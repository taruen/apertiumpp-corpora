GEN.1.1	In the beginning
GEN.1.2	Now the earth was formless and empty,
GEN.1.3	Then God said, “Let there be light,”
GEN.1.4	God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” There was an evening, and there was a morning: one day.
GEN.1.6	Then God said, “Let there be an expanse between the waters, separating water from water.”
GEN.1.7	So God made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above the expanse.
GEN.1.8	God called the expanse “sky.”
GEN.1.9	Then God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered into one place,
GEN.1.10	God called the dry land “earth,” and the gathering of the water he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.11	Then God said, “Let the earth produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and fruit trees on the earth bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds.”
GEN.1.12	The earth produced vegetation: seed-bearing plants according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 
GEN.1.13	Evening came and then morning: the third day.
GEN.1.14	Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night. They will serve as signs
GEN.1.15	They will be lights in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.16	God made the two great lights — the greater light to rule over the day and the lesser light to rule over the night — as well as the stars.
GEN.1.17	God placed them in the expanse of the sky to provide light on the earth, 
GEN.1.18	to rule the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness.
GEN.1.19	Evening came and then morning: the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	Then God said, “Let the water swarm with
GEN.1.21	So God created the large sea-creatures
GEN.1.22	God blessed them: “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters of the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”
GEN.1.23	Evening came and then morning: the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	Then God said, “Let the earth produce living creatures according to their kinds: livestock, creatures that crawl, and the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds.” And it was so. 
GEN.1.25	So God made the wildlife of the earth according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that crawl on the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.26	Then God said, “Let us
GEN.1.27	So God created man
GEN.1.27	in his own image;
GEN.1.27	he created him in
GEN.1.27	he created them male and female.
GEN.1.28	God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth,
GEN.1.29	God also said, “Look, I have given you every seed-bearing plant on the surface of the entire earth and every tree whose fruit contains seed. This will be food for you,
GEN.1.30	for all the wildlife of the earth, for every bird of the sky, and for every creature that crawls on the earth — everything having the breath of life in it — I have given
GEN.1.31	God saw all that he had made, and it was very good indeed.
GEN.2.1	So the heavens and the earth and everything in them were completed.
GEN.2.2	On the seventh
GEN.2.3	God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, for on it he rested
GEN.2.4	These are the records
GEN.2.5	no shrub of the field
GEN.2.6	But mist would come up from the earth and water all the ground. 
GEN.2.7	Then the 
GEN.2.8	The 
GEN.2.9	The 
GEN.2.10	A river went
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is Pishon, which flows through the entire land of Havilah,
GEN.2.12	Gold from that land is pure;
GEN.2.13	The name of the second river is Gihon, which flows through the entire land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	The name of the third river is Tigris,
GEN.2.15	The 
GEN.2.16	And the 
GEN.2.17	but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for on the day you eat from it, you will certainly die.”
GEN.2.18	Then the 
GEN.2.19	The 
GEN.2.20	The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds of the sky, and to every wild animal; but for the man
GEN.2.21	So the 
GEN.2.22	Then the 
GEN.2.23	And the man said:
GEN.2.23	This one, at last, is bone of my bone
GEN.2.23	and flesh of my flesh;
GEN.2.23	this one will be called “woman,”
GEN.2.23	for she was taken from man.
GEN.2.24	This is why a man leaves his father and mother and bonds with his wife, and they become one flesh.
GEN.2.25	Both the man and his wife were naked, yet felt no shame.
GEN.3.1	Now the serpent was the most cunning of all the wild animals that the 
GEN.3.2	The woman said to the serpent, “We may eat the fruit from the trees in the garden. 
GEN.3.3	But about the fruit of the tree in the middle of the garden, God said, ‘You must not eat it or touch it, or you will die.’”
GEN.3.4	“No! You will not die,” the serpent said to the woman.
GEN.3.5	“In fact, God knows that when
GEN.3.6	The woman saw that the tree was good for food and delightful to look at, and that it was desirable for obtaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate it; she also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it.
GEN.3.7	Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves.
GEN.3.8	Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the 
GEN.3.9	So the 
GEN.3.10	And he said, “I heard you
GEN.3.11	Then he asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”
GEN.3.12	The man replied,
GEN.3.13	So the 
GEN.3.13	And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, and I ate.”
GEN.3.14	So the 
GEN.3.14	Because you have done this,
GEN.3.14	you are cursed more than any livestock
GEN.3.14	and more than any wild animal.
GEN.3.14	You will move on your belly
GEN.3.14	and eat dust all the days of your life.
GEN.3.15	I will put hostility between you and the woman,
GEN.3.15	and between your offspring and her offspring.
GEN.3.15	He will strike your head,
GEN.3.15	and you will strike his heel.
GEN.3.16	He said to the woman:
GEN.3.16	I will intensify your labor pains;
GEN.3.16	you will bear children with painful effort.
GEN.3.16	Your desire
GEN.3.16	yet he will rule over you.
GEN.3.17	And he said to the man, “Because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which I commanded you, ‘Do not eat from it’:
GEN.3.17	The ground is cursed because of you.
GEN.3.17	You will eat from it by means of painful labor
GEN.3.17	all the days of your life.
GEN.3.18	It will produce thorns and thistles for you,
GEN.3.18	and you will eat the plants of the field.
GEN.3.19	You will eat bread
GEN.3.19	until you return to the ground,
GEN.3.19	since you were taken from it.
GEN.3.19	For you are dust,
GEN.3.19	and you will return to dust.”
GEN.3.20	The man named his wife Eve
GEN.3.21	The 
GEN.3.22	The 
GEN.3.23	So the 
GEN.3.24	He drove the man out and stationed the cherubim and the flaming, whirling sword east of the garden of Eden to guard the way to the tree of life.
GEN.4.1	The man was intimate with his wife Eve, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain. She said, “I have had a male child with the 
GEN.4.2	She also gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel became a shepherd of flocks, but Cain worked the ground. 
GEN.4.3	In the course of time Cain presented some of the land’s produce as an offering to the 
GEN.4.4	And Abel also presented an offering — some of the firstborn of his flock and their fat portions.
GEN.4.5	but he did not have regard for Cain and his offering. Cain was furious, and he looked despondent.
GEN.4.6	Then the 
GEN.4.7	If you do what is right, won’t you be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. Its desire is for you, but you must rule over it.”
GEN.4.8	Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out to the field.”
GEN.4.9	Then the 
GEN.4.9	“I don’t know,” he replied. “Am I my brother’s guardian?”
GEN.4.10	Then he said, “What have you done? Your brother’s blood cries out to me from the ground!
GEN.4.11	So now you are cursed, alienated from the ground that opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood you have shed.
GEN.4.12	If you work the ground, it will never again give you its yield. You will be a restless wanderer on the earth.”
GEN.4.13	But Cain answered the 
GEN.4.14	Since you are banishing me today from the face of the earth, and I must hide from your presence and become a restless wanderer on the earth, whoever finds me will kill me.”
GEN.4.15	Then the 
GEN.4.16	Then Cain went out from the 
GEN.4.17	Cain was intimate with his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain became the builder of a city, and he named the city Enoch after his son. 
GEN.4.18	Irad was born to Enoch, Irad fathered Mehujael, Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. 
GEN.4.19	Lamech took two wives for himself, one named Adah and the other named Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of the nomadic herdsmen.
GEN.4.21	His brother was named Jubal; he was the father of all who play the lyre and the flute. 
GEN.4.22	Zillah bore Tubal-cain, who made all kinds of bronze and iron tools. Tubal-cain’s sister was Naamah.
GEN.4.23	Lamech said to his wives:
GEN.4.23	Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;
GEN.4.23	wives of Lamech, pay attention to my words.
GEN.4.23	For I killed a man for wounding me,
GEN.4.23	a young man for striking me.
GEN.4.24	If Cain is to be avenged seven times over,
GEN.4.24	then for Lamech it will be seventy-seven times!
GEN.4.25	Adam was intimate with his wife again, and she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, for she said, “God has given
GEN.4.26	A son was born to Seth
GEN.5.1	This is the document containing the family
GEN.5.2	he created them male and female. When they were created, he blessed them and called them mankind.
GEN.5.3	Adam was 130 years old when he fathered a son in his likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth. 
GEN.5.4	Adam lived 800 years after he fathered Seth, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	So Adam’s life lasted 930 years; then he died.
GEN.5.6	Seth was 105 years old when he fathered Enosh. 
GEN.5.7	Seth lived 807 years after he fathered Enosh, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.8	So Seth’s life lasted 912 years; then he died.
GEN.5.9	Enosh was 90 years old when he fathered Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	Enosh lived 815 years after he fathered Kenan, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	So Enosh’s life lasted 905 years; then he died.
GEN.5.12	Kenan was 70 years old when he fathered Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	Kenan lived 840 years after he fathered Mahalalel, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.14	So Kenan’s life lasted 910 years; then he died.
GEN.5.15	Mahalalel was 65 years old when he fathered Jared. 
GEN.5.16	Mahalalel lived 830 years after he fathered Jared, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	So Mahalalel’s life lasted 895 years; then he died.
GEN.5.18	Jared was 162 years old when he fathered Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	Jared lived 800 years after he fathered Enoch, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	So Jared’s life lasted 962 years; then he died.
GEN.5.21	Enoch was 65 years old when he fathered Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	And after he fathered Methuselah, Enoch walked with God
GEN.5.23	So Enoch’s life lasted 365 years. 
GEN.5.24	Enoch walked with God; then he was not there because God took him.
GEN.5.25	Methuselah was 187 years old when he fathered Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	Methuselah lived 782 years after he fathered Lamech, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	So Methuselah’s life lasted 969 years; then he died.
GEN.5.28	Lamech was 182 years old when he fathered a son. 
GEN.5.29	And he named him Noah,
GEN.5.30	Lamech lived 595 years after he fathered Noah, and he fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	So Lamech’s life lasted 777 years; then he died.
GEN.5.32	Noah was 500 years old, and he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	When mankind began to multiply on the earth and daughters were born to them, 
GEN.6.2	the sons of God
GEN.6.3	And the 
GEN.6.4	The Nephilim
GEN.6.5	When the 
GEN.6.6	the 
GEN.6.7	Then the 
GEN.6.8	Noah, however, found favor with the 
GEN.6.9	These are the family records
GEN.6.10	And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	Now the earth was corrupt in God’s sight, and the earth was filled with wickedness.
GEN.6.12	God saw how corrupt the earth was, for every creature had corrupted its way on the earth.
GEN.6.13	Then God said to Noah, “I have decided to put an end to every creature, for the earth is filled with wickedness because of them; therefore I am going to destroy them along with the earth.
GEN.6.14	“Make yourself an ark of gopher
GEN.6.15	This is how you are to make it: The ark will be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high.
GEN.6.16	You are to make a roof,
GEN.6.17	“Understand that I am bringing a flood — floodwaters on the earth
GEN.6.18	But I will establish my covenant with you,
GEN.6.19	You are also to bring into the ark two of all the living creatures, male and female, to keep them alive with you. 
GEN.6.20	Two of everything — from the birds according to their kinds, from the livestock according to their kinds, and from the animals that crawl on the ground according to their kinds — will come to you so that you can keep them alive. 
GEN.6.21	Take with you every kind of food that is eaten; gather it as food for you and for them.” 
GEN.6.22	And Noah did this. He did everything that God had commanded him.
GEN.7.1	Then the 
GEN.7.2	You are to take with you seven pairs, a male and its female, of all the clean animals,
GEN.7.3	and seven pairs, male and female, of the birds of the sky — in order to keep offspring alive throughout the earth. 
GEN.7.4	Seven days from now I will make it rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing I have made I will wipe off the face of the earth.” 
GEN.7.5	And Noah did everything that the 
GEN.7.6	Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came and water covered the earth. 
GEN.7.7	So Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives entered the ark because of the floodwaters. 
GEN.7.8	From the clean animals, unclean animals, birds, and every creature that crawls on the ground, 
GEN.7.9	two of each, male and female, came to Noah and entered the ark, just as God had commanded him. 
GEN.7.10	Seven days later the floodwaters came on the earth.
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the sources of the vast watery depths burst open,
GEN.7.12	and the rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. 
GEN.7.13	On that same day Noah and his three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, entered the ark, along with Noah’s wife and his three sons’ wives. 
GEN.7.14	They entered it with all the wildlife according to their kinds, all livestock according to their kinds, all the creatures that crawl on the earth according to their kinds, every flying creature — all the birds and every winged creature — according to their kinds. 
GEN.7.15	Two of every creature that has the breath of life in it came to Noah and entered the ark. 
GEN.7.16	Those that entered, male and female of every creature, entered just as God had commanded him. Then the 
GEN.7.17	The flood continued for forty days on the earth; the water increased and lifted up the ark so that it rose above the earth. 
GEN.7.18	The water surged and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the water. 
GEN.7.19	Then the water surged even higher on the earth, and all the high mountains under the whole sky were covered. 
GEN.7.20	The mountains were covered as the water surged above them more than twenty feet.
GEN.7.21	Every creature perished — those that crawl on the earth, birds, livestock, wildlife, and those that swarm
GEN.7.22	Everything with the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils
GEN.7.23	He wiped out every living thing that was on the face of the earth, from mankind to livestock, to creatures that crawl, to the birds of the sky, and they were wiped off the earth. Only Noah was left, and those that were with him in the ark.
GEN.7.24	And the water surged on the earth 150 days.
GEN.8.1	God remembered Noah,
GEN.8.2	The sources of the watery depths and the floodgates of the sky were closed, and the rain from the sky stopped.
GEN.8.3	The water steadily receded from the earth, and by the end of 150 days the water had decreased significantly.
GEN.8.4	The ark came to rest in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.
GEN.8.5	The water continued to recede until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were visible. 
GEN.8.6	After forty days Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made, 
GEN.8.7	and he sent out a raven. It went back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. 
GEN.8.8	Then he sent out a dove to see whether the water on the earth’s surface had gone down, 
GEN.8.9	but the dove found no resting place for its foot. It returned to him in the ark because water covered the surface of the whole earth. He reached out and brought it into the ark to himself. 
GEN.8.10	So Noah waited seven more days and sent out the dove from the ark again. 
GEN.8.11	When the dove came to him at evening, there was a plucked olive leaf in its beak. So Noah knew that the water on the earth’s surface had gone down. 
GEN.8.12	After he had waited another seven days, he sent out the dove, but it did not return to him again. 
GEN.8.13	In the six hundred and first year,
GEN.8.14	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month, the earth was dry.
GEN.8.15	Then God spoke to Noah, 
GEN.8.16	“Come out of the ark, you, your wife, your sons, and your sons’ wives with you. 
GEN.8.17	Bring out all the living creatures
GEN.8.18	So Noah, along with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, came out. 
GEN.8.19	All the animals, all the creatures that crawl, and all the flying creatures — everything that moves on the earth — came out of the ark by their families.
GEN.8.20	Then Noah built an altar to the 
GEN.8.21	When the 
GEN.8.22	As long as the earth endures,
GEN.8.22	seedtime and harvest, cold and heat,
GEN.8.22	summer and winter, and day and night
GEN.8.22	will not cease.”
GEN.9.1	God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
GEN.9.2	The fear and terror of you will be in every living creature on the earth, every bird of the sky, every creature that crawls on the ground, and all the fish of the sea. They are placed under your authority.
GEN.9.3	Every creature that lives and moves will be food for you;
GEN.9.4	However, you must not eat meat with its lifeblood in it.
GEN.9.5	And I will require a penalty for your lifeblood;
GEN.9.6	Whoever sheds human blood,
GEN.9.6	by humans his blood will be shed,
GEN.9.6	for God made humans in his image.
GEN.9.7	But you, be fruitful and multiply; spread out over the earth and multiply on it.”
GEN.9.8	Then God said to Noah and his sons with him, 
GEN.9.9	“Understand that I am establishing my covenant
GEN.9.10	and with every living creature that is with you — birds, livestock, and all wildlife of the earth that are with you — all the animals of the earth that came out of the ark. 
GEN.9.11	I establish my covenant with you that never again will every creature be wiped out by floodwaters; there will never again be a flood to destroy the earth.”
GEN.9.12	And God said, “This is the sign of the covenant
GEN.9.13	I have placed my bow in the clouds,
GEN.9.14	Whenever I form clouds over the earth and the bow appears in the clouds, 
GEN.9.15	I will remember my covenant
GEN.9.16	The bow will be in the clouds, and I will look at it and remember the permanent covenant
GEN.9.17	God said to Noah, “This is the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and every creature on earth.”
GEN.9.18	Noah’s sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. Ham was the father of Canaan. 
GEN.9.19	These three were Noah’s sons, and from them the whole earth was populated.
GEN.9.20	Noah, as a man of the soil, began by planting
GEN.9.21	He drank some of the wine, became drunk, and uncovered himself inside his tent. 
GEN.9.22	Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father naked and told his two brothers outside.
GEN.9.23	Then Shem and Japheth took a cloak and placed it over both their shoulders, and walking backward, they covered their father’s nakedness. Their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father naked.
GEN.9.24	When Noah awoke from his drinking and learned what his youngest son had done to him, 
GEN.9.25	he said:
GEN.9.25	Canaan is cursed.
GEN.9.25	He will be the lowest of slaves to his brothers.
GEN.9.26	He also said:
GEN.9.26	Blessed be the 
GEN.9.26	Let Canaan be
GEN.9.27	Let God extend Japheth;
GEN.9.27	let Japheth dwell in the tents of Shem;
GEN.9.27	let Canaan be Shem’s slave.
GEN.9.28	Now Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 
GEN.9.29	So Noah’s life lasted 950 years; then he died.
GEN.10.1	These are the family records
GEN.10.2	Japheth’s sons:
GEN.10.3	Gomer’s sons: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah. 
GEN.10.4	And Javan’s sons: Elishah, Tarshish,
GEN.10.5	From these descendants, the peoples of the coasts and islands spread out into their lands according to their clans in their nations, each with its own language.
GEN.10.6	Ham’s sons:
GEN.10.7	Cush’s sons: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. And Raamah’s sons: Sheba and Dedan.
GEN.10.8	Cush fathered Nimrod, who began to be powerful in the land. 
GEN.10.9	He was a powerful hunter in the sight of the 
GEN.10.10	His kingdom started with Babylon,
GEN.10.11	From that land he went to Assyria
GEN.10.12	and Resen, between Nineveh and the great city Calah.
GEN.10.13	Mizraim
GEN.10.14	Pathrus, Casluh (the Philistines came from them), and Caphtor.
GEN.10.15	Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn and Heth, 
GEN.10.16	as well as the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites,
GEN.10.17	the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
GEN.10.18	the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Afterward the Canaanite clans scattered. 
GEN.10.19	The Canaanite border went from Sidon going toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and going toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim as far as Lasha.
GEN.10.20	These are Ham’s sons by their clans, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.
GEN.10.21	And Shem, Japheth’s older brother, also had sons. Shem was the father of all the sons of Eber.
GEN.10.22	Shem’s sons
GEN.10.23	Aram’s sons: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
GEN.10.24	Arpachshad fathered
GEN.10.25	Eber had two sons. One was named Peleg,
GEN.10.26	And Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were Joktan’s sons. 
GEN.10.30	Their settlements extended from Mesha to Sephar, the eastern hill country.
GEN.10.31	These are Shem’s sons by their clans, according to their languages, in their lands and their nations.
GEN.10.32	These are the clans of Noah’s sons, according to their family records, in their nations. The nations on earth spread out from these after the flood.
GEN.11.1	The whole earth had the same language and vocabulary.
GEN.11.2	As people
GEN.11.3	They said to each other, “Come, let us make oven-fired bricks.” (They used brick for stone and asphalt
GEN.11.4	And they said, “Come, let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the sky.
GEN.11.5	Then the 
GEN.11.6	The 
GEN.11.7	Come, let’s go down there and confuse their language so that they will not understand one another’s speech.” 
GEN.11.8	So from there the 
GEN.11.9	Therefore it is called Babylon,
GEN.11.10	These are the family records
GEN.11.11	After he fathered Arpachshad, Shem lived 500 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.12	Arpachshad lived 35 years
GEN.11.13	After he fathered Shelah, Arpachshad lived 403 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.14	Shelah lived 30 years and fathered Eber. 
GEN.11.15	After he fathered Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.16	Eber lived 34 years and fathered Peleg. 
GEN.11.17	After he fathered Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.18	Peleg lived 30 years and fathered Reu. 
GEN.11.19	After he fathered Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.20	Reu lived 32 years and fathered Serug. 
GEN.11.21	After he fathered Serug, Reu lived 207 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.22	Serug lived 30 years and fathered Nahor. 
GEN.11.23	After he fathered Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.24	Nahor lived 29 years and fathered Terah.
GEN.11.25	After he fathered Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 
GEN.11.26	Terah lived 70 years and fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	These are the family records of Terah. Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran, and Haran fathered Lot. 
GEN.11.28	Haran died in his native land, in Ur of the Chaldeans, during his father Terah’s lifetime. 
GEN.11.29	Abram and Nahor took wives: Abram’s wife was named Sarai,
GEN.11.30	Sarai was unable to conceive;
GEN.11.31	Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (Haran’s son), and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram’s wife, and they set out together from Ur of the Chaldeans
GEN.11.32	Terah lived 205 years and died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	The 
GEN.12.1	Go out from your land,
GEN.12.1	your relatives,
GEN.12.1	and your father’s house
GEN.12.1	to the land that I will show you.
GEN.12.2	I will make you into a great nation,
GEN.12.2	I will bless you,
GEN.12.2	I will make your name great,
GEN.12.2	and you will be a blessing.
GEN.12.3	I will bless those who bless you,
GEN.12.3	I will curse anyone who treats you with contempt,
GEN.12.3	and all the peoples
GEN.12.3	will be blessed
GEN.12.4	So Abram went, as the 
GEN.12.5	He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated, and the people they had acquired in Haran, and they set out for the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, 
GEN.12.6	Abram passed through the land to the site of Shechem,
GEN.12.7	The 
GEN.12.8	From there he moved on to the hill country east of Bethel and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. He built an altar to the 
GEN.12.9	Then Abram journeyed by stages to the Negev.
GEN.12.10	There was a famine in the land,
GEN.12.11	When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “Look, I know what a beautiful woman you are. 
GEN.12.12	When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife.’ They will kill me but let you live.
GEN.12.13	Please say you’re my sister so it will go well for me because of you, and my life will be spared on your account.” 
GEN.12.14	When Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that the woman was very beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	Pharaoh’s officials saw her and praised her to Pharaoh, so the woman was taken to Pharaoh’s household. 
GEN.12.16	He treated Abram well because of her, and Abram acquired flocks and herds, male and female donkeys, male and female slaves, and camels.
GEN.12.17	But the 
GEN.12.18	So Pharaoh sent for Abram and said, “What have you done to me? Why didn’t you tell me she was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She’s my sister,’ so that I took her as my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take her and go!” 
GEN.12.20	Then Pharaoh gave his men orders about him, and they sent him away with his wife and all he had.
GEN.13.1	Abram went up from Egypt to the Negev
GEN.13.2	Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold. 
GEN.13.3	He went by stages from the Negev to Bethel, to the place between Bethel and Ai where his tent had formerly been, 
GEN.13.4	to the site where he had built the altar. And Abram called on the name of the 
GEN.13.5	Now Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks, herds, and tents. 
GEN.13.6	But the land was unable to support them as long as they stayed together, for they had so many possessions that they could not stay together,
GEN.13.7	and there was quarreling between the herdsmen of Abram’s livestock and the herdsmen of Lot’s livestock.
GEN.13.8	So Abram said to Lot, “Please, let’s not have quarreling between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, since we are relatives.
GEN.13.9	Isn’t the whole land before you? Separate from me: if you go to the left, I will go to the right; if you go to the right, I will go to the left.”
GEN.13.10	Lot looked out and saw that the entire plain
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose the entire plain of the Jordan for himself. Then Lot journeyed eastward, and they separated from each other. 
GEN.13.12	Abram lived in the land of Canaan, but Lot lived in the cities on the plain and set up his tent near Sodom. 
GEN.13.13	(Now the men of Sodom were evil, sinning immensely
GEN.13.14	After Lot had separated from him, the 
GEN.13.15	for I will give you and your offspring forever all the land that you see.
GEN.13.16	I will make your offspring like the dust of the earth,
GEN.13.17	Get up and walk around the land, through its length and width, for I will give it to you.”
GEN.13.18	So Abram moved his tent and went to live near the oaks of Mamre at Hebron,
GEN.14.1	In those days King Amraphel of Shinar,
GEN.14.2	waged war against King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, and King Shemeber of Zeboiim,
GEN.14.3	All of these came as allies to the Siddim Valley (that is, the Dead Sea
GEN.14.4	They were subject to Chedorlaomer for twelve years, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 
GEN.14.5	In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him came and defeated the Rephaim
GEN.14.6	and the Horites
GEN.14.7	Then they came back to invade En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh
GEN.14.8	Then the king of Sodom, the king of Gomorrah, the king of Admah, the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar) went out and lined up for battle in the Siddim Valley 
GEN.14.9	against King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar — four kings against five. 
GEN.14.10	Now the Siddim Valley contained many asphalt pits, and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into them,
GEN.14.11	The four kings took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food and went on. 
GEN.14.12	They also took Abram’s nephew Lot and his possessions, for he was living in Sodom,
GEN.14.13	One of the survivors came and told Abram the Hebrew,
GEN.14.14	When Abram heard that his relative had been taken prisoner, he assembled
GEN.14.15	And he and his servants deployed against them by night, defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hobah to the north of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	He brought back all the goods and also his relative Lot and his goods, as well as the women and the other people.
GEN.14.17	After Abram returned from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the Shaveh Valley (that is, the King’s Valley
GEN.14.18	Melchizedek, king of Salem,
GEN.14.19	He blessed him and said:
GEN.14.19	Abram is blessed by God Most High,
GEN.14.19	Creator
GEN.14.20	and blessed be God Most High
GEN.14.20	who has handed over your enemies to you.
GEN.14.20	And Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
GEN.14.21	Then the king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people, but take the possessions for yourself.”
GEN.14.22	But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand in an oath to the 
GEN.14.23	that I will not take a thread or sandal strap or anything that belongs to you, so you can never say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	I will take nothing
GEN.15.1	After these events, the word of the 
GEN.15.1	Do not be afraid,
GEN.15.1	I am your shield;
GEN.15.1	your reward will be very great.
GEN.15.2	But Abram said, “Lord 
GEN.15.3	Abram continued, “Look, you have given me no offspring, so a slave born in
GEN.15.4	Now the word of the 
GEN.15.5	He took him outside and said, “Look at the sky and count the stars, if you are able to count them.” Then he said to him, “Your offspring will be that numerous.”
GEN.15.6	Abram believed the 
GEN.15.7	He also said to him, “I am the 
GEN.15.8	But he said, “Lord 
GEN.15.9	He said to him, “Bring me a three-year-old cow, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.”
GEN.15.10	So he brought all these to him, cut them in half, and laid the pieces opposite each other, but he did not cut the birds
GEN.15.11	Birds of prey came down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away. 
GEN.15.12	As the sun was setting, a deep sleep
GEN.15.13	Then the 
GEN.15.14	However, I will judge the nation they serve,
GEN.15.15	But you will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age.
GEN.15.16	In the fourth generation they will return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites has not yet reached its full measure.”
GEN.15.17	When the sun had set and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch appeared and passed between the divided animals. 
GEN.15.18	On that day the 
GEN.15.19	the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	Hethites, Perizzites, Rephaim, 
GEN.15.21	Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Abram’s wife Sarai had not borne any children for him, but she owned an Egyptian slave named Hagar. 
GEN.16.2	Sarai said to Abram, “Since the 
GEN.16.3	So Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar, her Egyptian slave, and gave her to her husband Abram as a wife for him. This happened after Abram had lived in the land of Canaan ten years. 
GEN.16.4	He slept with
GEN.16.5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “You are responsible for my suffering!
GEN.16.6	Abram replied to Sarai, “Here, your slave is in your hands; do whatever you want with her.” Then Sarai mistreated her so much that she ran away from her.
GEN.16.7	The angel of the 
GEN.16.8	He said, “Hagar, slave of Sarai, where have you come from and where are you going?”
GEN.16.8	She replied, “I’m running away from my mistress Sarai.”
GEN.16.9	The angel of the 
GEN.16.10	The angel of the 
GEN.16.11	The angel of the 
GEN.16.12	This man will be like a wild donkey. His hand will be against everyone, and everyone’s hand will be against him; he will settle near all his relatives.”
GEN.16.13	So she named the 
GEN.16.14	That is why the well is called Beer-lahai-roi.
GEN.16.15	So Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son, and Abram named his son (whom Hagar bore) Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him.
GEN.17.1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the 
GEN.17.2	I will set up my covenant between me and you, and I will multiply you greatly.”
GEN.17.3	Then Abram fell facedown and God spoke with him: 
GEN.17.4	“As for me, here is my covenant with you: You will become the father of many nations. 
GEN.17.5	Your name will no longer be Abram;
GEN.17.6	I will make you extremely fruitful and will make nations and kings come from you. 
GEN.17.7	I will confirm my covenant that is between me and you and your future offspring throughout their generations. It is a permanent covenant
GEN.17.8	And to you and your future offspring
GEN.17.9	God also said to Abraham, “As for you, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations are to keep my covenant. 
GEN.17.10	This is my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you, which you are to keep: Every one of your males must be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	You must circumcise the flesh of your foreskin to serve as a sign of the covenant between me and you.
GEN.17.12	Throughout your generations, every male among you is to be circumcised
GEN.17.13	Whether born in your household or purchased, he must be circumcised. My covenant will be marked in your flesh as a permanent covenant. 
GEN.17.14	If any male is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that man will be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”
GEN.17.15	God said to Abraham, “As for your wife Sarai, do not call her Sarai, for Sarah
GEN.17.16	I will bless her; indeed, I will give you a son by her.
GEN.17.17	Abraham fell facedown. Then he laughed
GEN.17.18	So Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael were acceptable
GEN.17.19	But God said, “No. Your wife Sarah will bear you a son, and you will name him Isaac.
GEN.17.20	As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will certainly bless him; I will make him fruitful and will multiply him greatly. He will father twelve tribal leaders,
GEN.17.21	But I will confirm my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.”
GEN.17.22	When he finished talking with him, God withdrew
GEN.17.23	So Abraham took his son Ishmael and those born in his household or purchased — every male among the members of Abraham’s household — and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin on that very day, just as God had said to him. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised, 
GEN.17.25	and his son Ishmael was thirteen years old when the flesh of his foreskin was circumcised. 
GEN.17.26	On that same day Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised. 
GEN.17.27	And all the men of his household — whether born in his household or purchased from a foreigner — were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	The 
GEN.18.2	He looked up, and he saw three men standing near him.
GEN.18.3	and said, “My lord, if I have found favor with you, please do not go on past your servant. 
GEN.18.4	Let a little water be brought, that you may wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree. 
GEN.18.5	I will bring a bit of bread so that you may strengthen yourselves.
GEN.18.5	“Yes,” they replied, “do as you have said.”
GEN.18.6	So Abraham hurried into the tent and said to Sarah, “Quick! Knead three measures
GEN.18.7	Abraham ran to the herd and got a tender, choice calf. He gave it to a young man, who hurried to prepare it. 
GEN.18.8	Then Abraham took curds
GEN.18.9	“Where is your wife Sarah?” they asked him.
GEN.18.9	“There, in the tent,” he answered.
GEN.18.10	The 
GEN.18.11	Abraham and Sarah were old and getting on in years.
GEN.18.12	So she laughed to herself: “After I am worn out and my lord is old, will I have delight?” 
GEN.18.13	But the 
GEN.18.14	Is anything impossible for the 
GEN.18.15	Sarah denied it. “I did not laugh,” she said, because she was afraid.
GEN.18.15	But he replied, “No, you did laugh.”
GEN.18.16	The men got up from there and looked out over Sodom, and Abraham was walking with them to see them off. 
GEN.18.17	Then the 
GEN.18.18	Abraham is to become a great and powerful nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him.
GEN.18.19	For I have chosen
GEN.18.20	Then the 
GEN.18.21	I will go down
GEN.18.22	The men turned from there and went toward Sodom
GEN.18.23	Abraham stepped forward and said, “Will you really sweep away the righteous with the wicked?
GEN.18.24	What if there are fifty righteous people in the city? Will you really sweep it away instead of sparing the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people who are in it? 
GEN.18.25	You could not possibly do such a thing: to kill the righteous with the wicked, treating the righteous and the wicked alike. You could not possibly do that! Won’t the Judge of the whole earth do what is just?” 
GEN.18.26	The 
GEN.18.27	Then Abraham answered, “Since I have ventured to speak to my lord — even though I am dust and ashes —  
GEN.18.28	suppose the fifty righteous lack five. Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?”
GEN.18.28	He replied, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”
GEN.18.29	Then he spoke to him again, “Suppose forty are found there?”
GEN.18.29	He answered, “I will not do it on account of forty.”
GEN.18.30	Then he said, “Let my lord not be angry, and I will speak further. Suppose thirty are found there?”
GEN.18.30	He answered, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.”
GEN.18.31	Then he said, “Since I have ventured to speak to my lord, suppose twenty are found there?”
GEN.18.31	He replied, “I will not destroy it on account of twenty.”
GEN.18.32	Then he said, “Let my lord not be angry, and I will speak one more time.
GEN.18.32	He answered, “I will not destroy it on account of ten.” 
GEN.18.33	When the 
GEN.19.1	The two angels entered Sodom
GEN.19.2	and said, “My lords, turn aside to your servant’s house, wash your feet, and spend the night. Then you can get up early and go on your way.”
GEN.19.2	“No,” they said. “We would rather spend the night in the square.” 
GEN.19.3	But he urged them so strongly that they followed him and went into his house. He prepared a feast and baked unleavened bread for them, and they ate.
GEN.19.4	Before they went to bed, the men of the city of Sodom, both young and old, the whole population, surrounded the house. 
GEN.19.5	They called out to Lot and said, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Send them out to us so we can have sex with them!” 
GEN.19.6	Lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him. 
GEN.19.7	He said, “Don’t do this evil, my brothers. 
GEN.19.8	Look, I’ve got two daughters who haven’t been intimate with a man.
GEN.19.9	“Get out of the way!” they said, adding, “This one came here as an alien, but he’s acting like a judge!
GEN.19.10	But the angels
GEN.19.11	They struck the men who were at the entrance of the house, both young and old, with blindness
GEN.19.12	Then the angels said to Lot, “Do you have anyone else here: a son-in-law, your sons and daughters, or anyone else in the city who belongs to you? Get them out of this place, 
GEN.19.13	for we are about to destroy this place because the outcry against its people is so great before the 
GEN.19.14	So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were going to marry
GEN.19.15	At daybreak the angels urged Lot on: “Get up! Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment
GEN.19.16	But he hesitated. Because of the 
GEN.19.17	As soon as the angels got them outside, one of them
GEN.19.18	But Lot said to them, “No, my lords
GEN.19.19	Your servant has indeed found favor with you, and you have shown me great kindness by saving my life. But I can’t run to the mountains; the disaster will overtake me, and I will die. 
GEN.19.20	Look, this town is close enough for me to flee to. It is a small place. Please let me run to it — it’s only a small place, isn’t it? — so that I can survive.”
GEN.19.21	And he said to him, “All right,
GEN.19.22	Hurry up! Run to it, for I cannot do anything until you get there.” Therefore the name of the city is Zoar.
GEN.19.23	The sun had risen over the land when Lot reached Zoar. 
GEN.19.24	Then out of the sky the 
GEN.19.25	He demolished these cities, the entire plain, all the inhabitants of the cities, and whatever grew on the ground. 
GEN.19.26	But Lot’s wife looked back and became a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	Early in the morning Abraham went to the place where he had stood before the 
GEN.19.28	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the land of the plain, and he saw that smoke was going up from the land like the smoke of a furnace. 
GEN.19.29	So it was, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham and brought Lot out of the middle of the upheaval when he demolished the cities where Lot had lived.
GEN.19.30	Lot departed from Zoar and lived in the mountains along with his two daughters, because he was afraid to live in Zoar. Instead, he and his two daughters lived in a cave. 
GEN.19.31	Then the firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is old, and there is no man in the land to sleep with us as is the custom of all the land. 
GEN.19.32	Come, let’s get our father to drink wine so that we can sleep with him and preserve our father’s line.” 
GEN.19.33	So they got their father to drink wine that night, and the firstborn came and slept with her father; he did not know when she lay down or when she got up.
GEN.19.34	The next day the firstborn said to the younger, “Look, I slept with my father last night. Let’s get him to drink wine again tonight so you can go sleep with him and we can preserve our father’s line.” 
GEN.19.35	That night they again got their father to drink wine, and the younger went and slept with him; he did not know when she lay down or when she got up.
GEN.19.36	So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. 
GEN.19.37	The firstborn gave birth to a son and named him Moab.
GEN.19.38	The younger also gave birth to a son, and she named him Ben-ammi.
GEN.20.1	From there Abraham traveled to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadesh and Shur. While he was staying in Gerar,
GEN.20.2	Abraham said about his wife Sarah, “She is my sister.”
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, “You are about to die because of the woman you have taken, for she is a married woman.”
GEN.20.4	Now Abimelech had not approached her, so he said, “Lord, would you destroy a nation even though it is innocent? 
GEN.20.5	Didn’t he himself say to me, ‘She is my sister’? And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ I did this with a clear conscience
GEN.20.6	Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a clear conscience.
GEN.20.7	Now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet,
GEN.20.8	Early in the morning Abimelech got up, called all his servants together, and personally
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham in and said to him, “What have you done to us? How did I sin against you that you have brought such enormous guilt on me and on my kingdom? You have done things to me that should never be done.”
GEN.20.10	Abimelech also asked Abraham, “What made you do this?”
GEN.20.11	Abraham replied, “I thought, ‘There is absolutely no fear of God in this place.
GEN.20.12	Besides, she really is my sister, the daughter of my father though not the daughter of my mother, and she became my wife. 
GEN.20.13	So when God had me wander from my father’s house,
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelech took flocks and herds and male and female slaves, gave them to Abraham, and returned his wife Sarah to him. 
GEN.20.15	Abimelech said, “Look, my land is before you.
GEN.20.16	And he said to Sarah, “Look, I am giving your brother one thousand pieces of silver. It is a verification of your honor
GEN.20.17	Then Abraham prayed to God,
GEN.20.18	for the 
GEN.21.1	The 
GEN.21.2	Sarah became pregnant and bore a son to Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time God had told him.
GEN.21.3	Abraham named his son who was born to him — the one Sarah bore to him — Isaac.
GEN.21.4	When his son Isaac was eight days old, Abraham circumcised him, as God had commanded him.
GEN.21.5	Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
GEN.21.6	Sarah said, “God has made me laugh, and everyone who hears will laugh with me.”
GEN.21.7	She also said, “Who would have told Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? Yet I have borne a son for him
GEN.21.8	The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day Isaac was weaned. 
GEN.21.9	But Sarah saw the son mocking — the one Hagar the Egyptian had borne to Abraham.
GEN.21.10	So she said to Abraham, “Drive out this slave with her son, for the son of this slave will not be a coheir with my son Isaac!” 
GEN.21.11	This was very distressing to
GEN.21.12	But God said to Abraham, “Do not be distressed
GEN.21.13	and I will also make a nation of the slave’s son
GEN.21.14	Early in the morning Abraham got up, took bread and a waterskin, put them on Hagar’s shoulders, and sent her and the boy away. She left and wandered in the Wilderness of Beer-sheba. 
GEN.21.15	When the water in the skin was gone, she left the boy under one of the bushes 
GEN.21.16	and went and sat at a distance, about a bowshot away, for she said, “I can’t bear to watch the boy die!” While she sat at a distance, she
GEN.21.17	God heard the boy crying, and the
GEN.21.18	Get up, help the boy up, and grasp his hand, for I will make him a great nation.” 
GEN.21.19	Then God opened her eyes,
GEN.21.20	God was with the boy, and he grew; he settled in the wilderness and became an archer. 
GEN.21.21	He settled in the Wilderness of Paran, and his mother got a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	At that time Abimelech, accompanied by Phicol the commander of his army,
GEN.21.23	Swear to me by God here and now, that you will not break an agreement with me or with my children and descendants. As I have been loyal to you, so you will be loyal to me and to the country where you are a resident alien.”
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, “I swear it.” 
GEN.21.25	But Abraham complained to Abimelech because of the well that Abimelech’s servants had seized.
GEN.21.26	Abimelech replied, “I don’t know who did this thing. You didn’t report anything to me, so I hadn’t heard about it until today.”
GEN.21.27	Abraham took flocks and herds and gave them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant.
GEN.21.28	Abraham separated seven ewe lambs from the flock. 
GEN.21.29	And Abimelech said to Abraham, “Why have you separated these seven ewe lambs?”
GEN.21.30	He replied, “You are to accept the seven ewe lambs from me so that this act
GEN.21.31	Therefore that place was called Beer-sheba
GEN.21.32	After they had made a covenant at Beer-sheba, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, left and returned to the land of the Philistines.
GEN.21.33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beer-sheba, and there he called on the name of the 
GEN.21.34	And Abraham lived as an alien in the land of the Philistines for many days.
GEN.22.1	After these things God tested Abraham
GEN.22.1	“Here I am,” he answered.
GEN.22.2	“Take your son,” he said, “your only son Isaac, whom you love,
GEN.22.3	So Abraham got up early in the morning,
GEN.22.4	On the third day
GEN.22.5	Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey. The boy and I will go over there to worship; then we’ll come back to you.” 
GEN.22.6	Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on his son Isaac.
GEN.22.7	Then Isaac spoke to his father Abraham and said, “My father.”
GEN.22.7	And he replied, “Here I am, my son.”
GEN.22.7	Isaac said, “The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?”
GEN.22.8	Abraham answered, “God himself will provide
GEN.22.9	When they arrived at the place that God had told him about, Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood. He bound his son Isaac
GEN.22.10	Then Abraham reached out and took the knife to slaughter his son.
GEN.22.11	But the angel of the 
GEN.22.11	He replied, “Here I am.”
GEN.22.12	Then he said, “Do not lay a hand on the boy or do anything to him. For now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your only son from me.”
GEN.22.13	Abraham looked up and saw a ram
GEN.22.14	And Abraham named that place The 
GEN.22.15	Then the angel of the 
GEN.22.16	and said, “By myself I have sworn,”
GEN.22.17	I will indeed bless you
GEN.22.18	And all the nations of the earth will be blessed
GEN.22.19	Abraham went back to his young men, and they got up and went together to Beer-sheba. And Abraham settled in Beer-sheba.
GEN.22.20	Now after these things Abraham was told, “Milcah also has borne sons to your brother Nahor:
GEN.22.21	Uz his firstborn, his brother Buz, Kemuel the father of Aram, 
GEN.22.22	Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	And Bethuel fathered Rebekah.
GEN.22.24	His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	Now Sarah lived 127 years; these were all the years of her life. 
GEN.23.2	Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron
GEN.23.3	Then Abraham got up from beside his dead wife and spoke to the Hethites: 
GEN.23.4	“I am an alien residing among you.
GEN.23.5	The Hethites replied to Abraham,
GEN.23.6	“Listen to us, my lord. You are a prince of God
GEN.23.7	Then Abraham rose and bowed down to the Hethites, the people of the land. 
GEN.23.8	He said to them, “If you are willing for me to bury my dead, listen to me and ask Ephron son of Zohar on my behalf 
GEN.23.9	to give me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him; it is at the end of his field. Let him give it to me in your presence, for the full price, as burial property.”
GEN.23.10	Ephron was sitting among the Hethites. So in the hearing
GEN.23.11	“No, my lord. Listen to me. I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it. I give it to you in the sight
GEN.23.12	Abraham bowed down to the people of the land 
GEN.23.13	and said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, “Listen to me, if you please. Let me pay the price of the field. Accept it from me, and let me bury my dead there.”
GEN.23.14	Ephron answered Abraham and said to him, 
GEN.23.15	“My lord, listen to me. Land worth four hundred shekels of silver
GEN.23.16	Abraham agreed with Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the silver that he had agreed to in the hearing of the Hethites: four hundred standard shekels
GEN.23.17	So Ephron’s field
GEN.23.18	Abraham’s possession in the sight of all the Hethites who came to the gate of his city. 
GEN.23.19	After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave of the field at Machpelah near Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.23.20	The field with its cave passed from the Hethites to Abraham
GEN.24.1	Abraham was now old, getting on in years,
GEN.24.2	Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his household who managed all he owned, “Place your hand under my thigh,
GEN.24.3	and I will have you swear by the 
GEN.24.4	but will go to my land and my family to take a wife for my son Isaac.”
GEN.24.5	The servant said to him, “Suppose the woman is unwilling to follow me to this land? Should I have your son go back to the land you came from?”
GEN.24.6	Abraham answered him, “Make sure that you don’t take my son back there. 
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	If the woman is unwilling to follow you, then you are free from this oath to me,
GEN.24.9	So the servant placed his hand under his master Abraham’s thigh and swore an oath to him concerning this matter.
GEN.24.10	The servant took ten of his master’s camels, and with all kinds of his master’s goods in hand, he went to Aram-naharaim, to Nahor’s town. 
GEN.24.11	At evening, the time when women went out to draw water, he made the camels kneel beside a well outside the town.
GEN.24.12	“
GEN.24.13	I am standing here
GEN.24.14	Let the girl to whom I say, ‘Please lower your water jug so that I may drink,’ and who responds, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels also’ — let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac. By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master.”
GEN.24.15	Before he had finished speaking, there was Rebekah — daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah,
GEN.24.16	Now the girl was very beautiful,
GEN.24.17	Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me have a little water from your jug.”
GEN.24.18	She replied, “Drink, my lord.” She quickly lowered her jug to her hand and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	When she had finished giving him a drink, she said, “I’ll also draw water for your camels until they have had enough to drink.”
GEN.24.20	She quickly emptied her jug into the trough and hurried to the well again to draw water. She drew water for all his camels 
GEN.24.21	while the man silently watched her to see whether or not the 
GEN.24.22	As the camels finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing half a shekel, and for her wrists two bracelets weighing ten shekels of gold. 
GEN.24.23	“Whose daughter are you?” he asked. “Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to spend the night?”
GEN.24.24	She answered him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel son of Milcah, whom she bore to Nahor.” 
GEN.24.25	She also said to him, “We have plenty of straw and feed and a place to spend the night.”
GEN.24.26	Then the man knelt low, worshiped the 
GEN.24.27	and said, “Blessed be the 
GEN.24.28	The girl ran and told her mother’s household about these things. 
GEN.24.29	Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban,
GEN.24.30	As soon as he had seen the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s wrists, and when he had heard his sister Rebekah’s words — “The man said this to me!” — he went to the man. He was standing there by the camels at the spring.
GEN.24.31	Laban said, “Come, you who are blessed by the 
GEN.24.32	So the man came to the house, and the camels were unloaded.
GEN.24.33	A meal was set before him, but he said, “I will not eat until I have said what I have to say.”
GEN.24.33	So Laban said, “Please speak.”
GEN.24.34	“I am Abraham’s servant,” he said. 
GEN.24.35	“The 
GEN.24.36	Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master in her
GEN.24.37	My master put me under this oath: ‘You will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites in whose land I live 
GEN.24.38	but will go to my father’s family and to my clan to take a wife for my son.’ 
GEN.24.39	But I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman will not come back with me?’ 
GEN.24.40	He said to me, ‘The 
GEN.24.41	Then you will be free from my oath if you go to my family and they do not give her to you — you will be free from my oath.’
GEN.24.42	“Today when I came to the spring, I prayed: 
GEN.24.43	I am standing here at a spring. Let the young woman
GEN.24.44	and who responds to me, ‘Drink, and I’ll draw water for your camels also’ — let her be the woman the 
GEN.24.45	“Before I had finished praying silently,
GEN.24.46	She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll water your camels also.’ So I drank, and she also watered the camels. 
GEN.24.47	Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you? ’ She responded, ‘The daughter of Bethuel son of Nahor, whom Milcah bore to him.’ So I put the ring on her nose
GEN.24.48	Then I knelt low, worshiped the 
GEN.24.49	Now, if you are going to show kindness and faithfulness to my master,
GEN.24.50	Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is from the 
GEN.24.51	Rebekah is here in front of you. Take her and go, and let her be a wife for your master’s son, just as the 
GEN.24.52	When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed to the ground before the 
GEN.24.53	Then he brought out objects of silver and gold, and garments, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave precious gifts to her brother and her mother. 
GEN.24.54	Then he and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night.
GEN.24.54	When they got up in the morning, he said, “Send me to my master.”
GEN.24.55	But her brother and mother said, “Let the girl stay with us for about ten days.
GEN.24.56	But he responded to them, “Do not delay me, since the 
GEN.24.57	So they said, “Let’s call the girl and ask her opinion.”
GEN.24.58	They called Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?”
GEN.24.58	She replied, “I will go.” 
GEN.24.59	So they sent away their sister Rebekah with the one who had nursed and raised her,
GEN.24.60	They blessed Rebekah, saying to her:
GEN.24.60	Our sister, may you become
GEN.24.60	thousands upon ten thousands.
GEN.24.60	May your offspring possess
GEN.24.60	the city gates of their
GEN.24.61	Then Rebekah and her female servants got up, mounted the camels, and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
GEN.24.62	Now Isaac was returning from Beer-lahai-roi,
GEN.24.63	In the early evening Isaac went out to walk
GEN.24.64	Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she got down from her camel 
GEN.24.65	and asked the servant, “Who is that man in the field coming to meet us?”
GEN.24.65	The servant answered, “It is my master.” So she took her veil and covered herself. 
GEN.24.66	Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done.
GEN.24.67	And Isaac brought her into the tent of his mother Sarah and took Rebekah to be his wife. Isaac loved her, and he was comforted after his mother’s death.
GEN.25.1	Abraham had taken
GEN.25.2	and she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. Dedan’s sons were the Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 
GEN.25.4	And Midian’s sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were sons of Keturah. 
GEN.25.5	Abraham gave everything he owned to Isaac.
GEN.25.6	But Abraham gave gifts to the sons of his concubines, and while he was still alive he sent them eastward, away from his son Isaac, to the land of the East.
GEN.25.7	This is the length of Abraham’s life:
GEN.25.8	He took his last breath and died at a good old age,
GEN.25.9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah
GEN.25.10	This was the field that Abraham bought from the Hethites.
GEN.25.11	After Abraham’s death, God blessed his son Isaac, who lived near Beer-lahai-roi.
GEN.25.12	These are the family records
GEN.25.13	These are the names of Ishmael’s sons; their names according to the family records are Nebaioth, Ishmael’s firstborn, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	These are Ishmael’s sons, and these are their names by their settlements and encampments: twelve leaders
GEN.25.17	This is the length
GEN.25.18	And they
GEN.25.19	These are the family records of Isaac son of Abraham. Abraham fathered Isaac.
GEN.25.20	Isaac was forty years old when he took as his wife Rebekah
GEN.25.21	Isaac prayed to the 
GEN.25.22	But the children inside her struggled with each other, and she said, “Why is this happening to me?” 
GEN.25.23	And the 
GEN.25.23	Two nations are in your womb;
GEN.25.23	two peoples will come from you and be separated.
GEN.25.23	One people will be stronger than the other,
GEN.25.23	and the older will serve the younger.
GEN.25.24	When her time came to give birth, there were indeed twins in her womb. 
GEN.25.25	The first one came out red-looking,
GEN.25.26	After this, his brother came out grasping Esau’s heel with his hand.
GEN.25.27	When the boys grew up, Esau became an expert hunter, an outdoorsman,
GEN.25.28	Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for wild game, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	Once when Jacob was cooking a stew, Esau came in from the field exhausted. 
GEN.25.30	He said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red stuff, because I’m exhausted.” That is why he was also named Edom.
GEN.25.31	Jacob replied, “First sell me your birthright.”
GEN.25.32	“Look,” said Esau, “I’m about to die, so what good is a birthright to me?”
GEN.25.33	Jacob said, “Swear to me first.” So he swore to Jacob and sold his birthright to him. 
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave bread and lentil stew to Esau; he ate, drank, got up, and went away. So Esau despised his birthright.
GEN.26.1	There was another famine in the land in addition to the one that had occurred in Abraham’s time.
GEN.26.2	The 
GEN.26.3	stay in this land as an alien, and I will be with you and bless you.
GEN.26.4	I will make your offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky, I will give your offspring all these lands, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed
GEN.26.5	because Abraham listened to me and kept my mandate, my commands, my statutes, and my instructions.”
GEN.26.6	So Isaac settled in Gerar.
GEN.26.7	When the men of the place asked about his wife, he said, “She is my sister,”
GEN.26.8	When Isaac had been there for some time, Abimelech king of the Philistines looked down from the window and was surprised to see
GEN.26.9	Abimelech sent for Isaac and said, “So she is really your wife! How could you say, ‘She is my sister’?”
GEN.26.9	Isaac answered him, “Because I thought I might die on account of her.”
GEN.26.10	Then Abimelech said, “What is this you’ve done to us? One of the people could easily have slept with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us.”
GEN.26.11	So Abimelech warned all the people, “Whoever harms this man or his wife will certainly be put to death.”
GEN.26.12	Isaac sowed seed in that land, and in that year he reaped
GEN.26.13	and the man became rich and kept getting richer until he was very wealthy. 
GEN.26.14	He had flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and many slaves, and the Philistines were envious of him. 
GEN.26.15	Philistines stopped up all the wells that his father’s servants had dug in the days of his father Abraham,
GEN.26.16	And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Leave us, for you are much too powerful for us.”
GEN.26.17	So Isaac left there, camped in the Gerar Valley, and lived there. 
GEN.26.18	Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the days of his father Abraham and that the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died. He gave them the same names his father had given them. 
GEN.26.19	Then Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found a well of spring
GEN.26.20	But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen and said, “The water is ours!” So he named the well Esek
GEN.26.21	Then they dug another well and quarreled over that one also, so he named it Sitnah.
GEN.26.22	He moved from there and dug another, and they did not quarrel over it. He named it Rehoboth
GEN.26.23	From there he went up to Beer-sheba, 
GEN.26.24	and the 
GEN.26.25	So he built an altar there,
GEN.26.26	Now Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath his adviser and Phicol the commander of his army.
GEN.26.27	Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me? You hated me and sent me away from you.”
GEN.26.28	They replied, “We have clearly seen how the 
GEN.26.29	You will not harm us, just as we have not harmed you but have done only what was good to you, sending you away in peace. You are now blessed by the 
GEN.26.30	So he prepared a banquet for them, and they ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	They got up early in the morning and swore an oath to each other.
GEN.26.32	On that same day Isaac’s servants came to tell him about the well they had dug, saying to him, “We have found water!” 
GEN.26.33	He called it Sheba.
GEN.26.34	When Esau was forty years old, he took as his wives Judith daughter of Beeri the Hethite, and Basemath daughter of Elon the Hethite.
GEN.26.35	They made life bitter
GEN.27.1	When Isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could not see,
GEN.27.1	And he answered, “Here I am.”
GEN.27.2	He said, “Look, I am old and do not know the day of my death. 
GEN.27.3	So now take your hunting gear, your quiver and bow, and go out in the field to hunt some game for me.
GEN.27.4	Then make me a delicious meal that I love and bring it to me to eat, so that I can bless you before I die.”
GEN.27.5	Now Rebekah was listening to what Isaac said to his son Esau. So while Esau went to the field to hunt some game to bring in, 
GEN.27.6	Rebekah said to her son Jacob, “Listen! I heard your father talking with your brother Esau. He said, 
GEN.27.7	‘Bring me game and make a delicious meal for me to eat so that I can bless you in the 
GEN.27.8	Now, my son, listen to me and do what I tell you. 
GEN.27.9	Go to the flock and bring me two choice young goats, and I will make them into a delicious meal for your father — the kind he loves. 
GEN.27.10	Then take it to your father to eat so that he may bless you before he dies.”
GEN.27.11	Jacob answered Rebekah his mother, “Look, my brother Esau is a hairy man, but I am a man with smooth skin.
GEN.27.12	Suppose my father touches me. Then I will be revealed to him as a deceiver and bring a curse rather than a blessing on myself.”
GEN.27.13	His mother said to him, “Your curse be on me, my son. Just obey me and go get them for me.”
GEN.27.14	So he went and got the goats and brought them to his mother, and his mother made the delicious food his father loved. 
GEN.27.15	Then Rebekah took the best clothes of her older son Esau, which were in the house, and had her younger son Jacob wear them. 
GEN.27.16	She put the skins of the young goats on his hands and the smooth part of his neck. 
GEN.27.17	Then she handed the delicious food and the bread she had made to her son Jacob.
GEN.27.18	When he came to his father, he said, “My father.”
GEN.27.18	And he answered, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?”
GEN.27.19	Jacob replied to his father, “I am Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may bless me.”
GEN.27.20	But Isaac said to his son, “How did you ever find it so quickly, my son?”
GEN.27.20	He replied, “Because the 
GEN.27.21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come closer so I can touch you, my son. Are you really my son Esau or not?”
GEN.27.22	So Jacob came closer to his father Isaac. When he touched him, he said, “The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 
GEN.27.23	He did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau; so he blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	Again he asked, “Are you really my son Esau?”
GEN.27.24	And he replied, “I am.”
GEN.27.25	Then he said, “Bring it closer to me, and let me eat some of my son’s game so that I can bless you.” Jacob brought it closer to him, and he ate; he brought him wine, and he drank.
GEN.27.26	Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come closer and kiss me, my son.” 
GEN.27.27	So he came closer and kissed him. When Isaac smelled
GEN.27.27	Ah, the smell of my son
GEN.27.27	is like the smell of a field
GEN.27.27	that the 
GEN.27.28	May God give to you —
GEN.27.28	from the dew of the sky
GEN.27.28	and from the richness of the land
GEN.27.28	an abundance of grain and new wine.
GEN.27.29	May peoples serve you
GEN.27.29	and nations bow in worship to you.
GEN.27.29	Be master over your relatives;
GEN.27.29	may your mother’s sons bow in worship to you.
GEN.27.29	Those who curse you will be cursed,
GEN.27.29	and those who bless you will be blessed.
GEN.27.30	As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob and Jacob had left the presence of his father Isaac, his brother Esau arrived from his hunting. 
GEN.27.31	He had also made some delicious food and brought it to his father. He said to his father, “Let my father get up and eat some of his son’s game, so that you may bless me.”
GEN.27.32	But his father Isaac said to him, “Who are you?”
GEN.27.32	He answered, “I am Esau your firstborn son.”
GEN.27.33	Isaac began to tremble uncontrollably. “Who was it then,” he said, “who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate it all before you came in, and I blessed him. Indeed, he will be blessed!”
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard his father’s words, he cried out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me too, my father!” 
GEN.27.35	But he replied, “Your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing.”
GEN.27.36	So he said, “Isn’t he rightly named Jacob?
GEN.27.37	But Isaac answered Esau, “Look, I have made him a master over you, have given him all of his relatives as his servants, and have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then can I do for you, my son?”
GEN.27.38	Esau said to his father, “Do you have only one blessing, my father? Bless me too, my father!” And Esau wept loudly.
GEN.27.39	His father Isaac answered him,
GEN.27.39	Look, your dwelling place will be
GEN.27.39	away from the richness of the land,
GEN.27.39	away from the dew of the sky above.
GEN.27.40	You will live by your sword,
GEN.27.40	and you will serve your brother.
GEN.27.40	But when you rebel,
GEN.27.40	you will break his yoke from your neck.
GEN.27.41	Esau held a grudge against Jacob because of the blessing his father had given him. And Esau determined in his heart: “The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob.”
GEN.27.42	When the words of her older son Esau were reported to Rebekah, she summoned her younger son Jacob and said to him, “Listen, your brother Esau is consoling himself by planning to kill you. 
GEN.27.43	So now, my son, listen to me. Flee at once to my brother Laban in Haran, 
GEN.27.44	and stay with him for a few days until your brother’s anger subsides —  
GEN.27.45	until your brother’s rage turns away from you and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send for you and bring you back from there. Why should I lose you both in one day?”
GEN.27.46	So Rebekah said to Isaac, “I’m sick of my life because of these Hethite girls.
GEN.28.1	So Isaac summoned Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, “Do not marry a Canaanite girl. 
GEN.28.2	Go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father. Marry one of the daughters of Laban, your mother’s brother. 
GEN.28.3	May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you
GEN.28.4	May God give you and your offspring the blessing of Abraham
GEN.28.5	So Isaac sent Jacob to Paddan-aram, to Laban son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	Esau noticed that Isaac blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to get a wife there. When he blessed him, Isaac commanded Jacob, “Do not marry a Canaanite girl.” 
GEN.28.7	And Jacob listened to his father and mother and went to Paddan-aram. 
GEN.28.8	Esau realized that his father Isaac disapproved of the Canaanite women,
GEN.28.9	so Esau went to Ishmael and married, in addition to his other wives, Mahalath daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son. She was the sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.28.10	Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward Haran. 
GEN.28.11	He reached a certain place and spent the night there because the sun had set. He took one of the stones from the place, put it there at his head, and lay down in that place. 
GEN.28.12	And he dreamed:
GEN.28.13	The 
GEN.28.14	Your offspring will be like the dust of the earth,
GEN.28.15	Look, I am with you and will watch over you wherever you go. I will bring you back to this land,
GEN.28.16	When Jacob awoke from his sleep, he said, “Surely the 
GEN.28.17	He was afraid and said, “What an awesome place this is! This is none other than the house of God. This is the gate of heaven.”
GEN.28.18	Early in the morning Jacob took the stone that was near his head and set it up as a marker. He poured oil on top of it 
GEN.28.19	and named the place Bethel,
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a vow:
GEN.28.21	and if I return safely to my father’s family,
GEN.28.22	This stone that I have set up as a marker will be God’s house, and I will give to you a tenth of all that you give me.”
GEN.29.1	Jacob resumed his journey
GEN.29.2	He looked and saw a well in a field. Three flocks of sheep were lying there beside it because the sheep were watered from this well. But a large stone covered the opening of the well. 
GEN.29.3	The shepherds would roll the stone from the opening of the well and water the sheep when all the flocks
GEN.29.4	Jacob asked the men at the well, “My brothers! Where are you from?”
GEN.29.4	“We’re from Haran,” they answered.
GEN.29.5	“Do you know Laban grandson of Nahor?” Jacob asked them.
GEN.29.5	They answered, “We know him.”
GEN.29.6	“Is he well?” Jacob asked.
GEN.29.6	“Yes,” they said, “and here is his daughter Rachel, coming with his sheep.”
GEN.29.7	Then Jacob said, “Look, it is still broad daylight. It’s not time for the animals to be gathered. Water the flock, then go out and let them graze.”
GEN.29.8	But they replied, “We can’t until all the flocks have been gathered and the stone is rolled from the well’s opening. Then we will water the sheep.”
GEN.29.9	While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. 
GEN.29.10	As soon as Jacob saw his uncle Laban’s daughter Rachel with his sheep,
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and wept loudly.
GEN.29.12	He told Rachel that he was her father’s relative, Rebekah’s son. She ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran to meet him, hugged him, and kissed him. Then he took him to his house, and Jacob told him all that had happened.
GEN.29.14	Laban said to him, “Yes, you are my own flesh and blood.”
GEN.29.14	After Jacob had stayed with him a month, 
GEN.29.15	Laban said to him, “Just because you’re my relative, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me what your wages should be.”
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters: the older was named Leah, and the younger was named Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Leah had tender eyes, but Rachel was shapely and beautiful. 
GEN.29.18	Jacob loved Rachel, so he answered Laban, “I’ll work for you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.”
GEN.29.19	Laban replied, “Better that I give her to you than to some other man. Stay with me.” 
GEN.29.20	So Jacob worked seven years for Rachel, and they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.
GEN.29.21	Then Jacob said to Laban, “Since my time is complete, give me my wife, so I can sleep with
GEN.29.22	So Laban invited all the men of the place and sponsored a feast. 
GEN.29.23	That evening, Laban took his daughter Leah and gave her to Jacob, and he slept with her. 
GEN.29.24	And Laban gave his slave Zilpah to his daughter Leah as her slave.
GEN.29.25	When morning came, there was Leah! So he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? Wasn’t it for Rachel that I worked for you? Why have you deceived me?”
GEN.29.26	Laban answered, “It is not the custom in this place to give the younger daughter in marriage before the firstborn. 
GEN.29.27	Complete this week of wedding celebration, and we will also give you this younger one in return for working yet another seven years for me.”
GEN.29.28	And Jacob did just that. He finished the week of celebration, and Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his wife. 
GEN.29.29	And Laban gave his slave Bilhah to his daughter Rachel as her slave. 
GEN.29.30	Jacob slept with Rachel also, and indeed, he loved Rachel more than Leah. And he worked for Laban another seven years.
GEN.29.31	When the 
GEN.29.32	Leah conceived, gave birth to a son, and named him Reuben,
GEN.29.33	She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, “The 
GEN.29.34	She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, “At last, my husband will become attached to me because I have borne three sons for him.” Therefore he was named Levi.
GEN.29.35	And she conceived again, gave birth to a son, and said, “This time I will praise the 
GEN.30.1	When Rachel saw that she was not bearing Jacob any children, she envied her sister. “Give me sons, or I will die!” 
GEN.30.2	Jacob became angry with Rachel and said, “Am I in God’s place, who has withheld offspring
GEN.30.3	Then she said, “Here is my maid Bilhah. Go sleep with her, and she’ll bear children for me
GEN.30.4	So Rachel gave her slave Bilhah to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her. 
GEN.30.5	Bilhah conceived and bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.6	Rachel said, “God has vindicated me; yes, he has heard me and given me a son,” so she named him Dan.
GEN.30.7	Rachel’s slave Bilhah conceived again and bore Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	Rachel said, “In my wrestlings with God,
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had stopped having children, she took her slave Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	Leah’s slave Zilpah bore Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.11	Then Leah said, “What good fortune!” 
GEN.30.12	When Leah’s slave Zilpah bore Jacob a second son, 
GEN.30.13	Leah said, “I am happy that the women call me happy,”
GEN.30.14	Reuben went out during the wheat harvest and found some mandrakes in the field.
GEN.30.15	But Leah replied to her, “Isn’t it enough that you have taken my husband? Now you also want to take my son’s mandrakes?”
GEN.30.15	“Well then,” Rachel said, “he can sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.16	When Jacob came in from the field that evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come with me, for I have hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So Jacob slept with her that night.
GEN.30.17	God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore Jacob a fifth son. 
GEN.30.18	Leah said, “God has rewarded me for giving my slave to my husband,” and she named him Issachar.
GEN.30.19	Then Leah conceived again and bore Jacob a sixth son. 
GEN.30.20	“God has given me a good gift,” Leah said. “This time my husband will honor me because I have borne six sons for him,” and she named him Zebulun.
GEN.30.21	Later, Leah bore a daughter and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her and opened her womb.
GEN.30.23	She conceived and bore a son, and she said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”
GEN.30.24	She named him Joseph
GEN.30.25	After Rachel gave birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me on my way so that I can return to my homeland. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children that I have worked for, and let me go.
GEN.30.27	But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor with you, stay. I have learned by divination that the 
GEN.30.28	Then Laban said, “Name your wages, and I will pay them.”
GEN.30.29	So Jacob said to him, “You know how I have served you and how your herds have fared with me.
GEN.30.30	For you had very little before I came, but now your wealth has increased. The 
GEN.30.31	Laban asked, “What should I give you?”
GEN.30.31	And Jacob said, “You don’t need to give me anything. If you do this one thing for me, I will continue to shepherd and keep your flock. 
GEN.30.32	Let me go through all your sheep today and remove every sheep that is speckled or spotted, every dark-colored sheep among the lambs, and the spotted and speckled among the female goats. Such will be my wages. 
GEN.30.33	In the future when you come to check on my wages, my honesty will testify for me. If I have any female goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any lambs that are not black, they will be considered stolen.”
GEN.30.34	“Good,” said Laban. “Let it be as you have said.”
GEN.30.35	That day Laban removed the streaked and spotted male goats and all the speckled and spotted female goats — every one that had any white on it — and every dark-colored one among the lambs, and he placed his sons in charge of them. 
GEN.30.36	He put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob. Jacob, meanwhile, was shepherding the rest of Laban’s flock.
GEN.30.37	Jacob then took branches of fresh poplar, almond, and plane wood, and peeled the bark, exposing white stripes on the branches. 
GEN.30.38	He set the peeled branches in the troughs in front of the sheep — in the water channels where the sheep came to drink. And the sheep bred when they came to drink. 
GEN.30.39	The flocks bred in front of the branches and bore streaked, speckled, and spotted young.
GEN.30.40	Jacob separated the lambs and made the flocks face the streaked sheep and the completely dark sheep in Laban’s flocks. Then he set his own stock apart and didn’t put them with Laban’s sheep.
GEN.30.41	Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding, Jacob placed the branches in the troughs, in full view of the flocks, and they would breed in front of the branches. 
GEN.30.42	As for the weaklings of the flocks, he did not put out the branches. So it turned out that the weak sheep belonged to Laban and the stronger ones to Jacob. 
GEN.30.43	And the man became very rich.
GEN.31.1	Now Jacob heard what Laban’s sons were saying: “Jacob has taken all that was our father’s and has built this wealth from what belonged to our father.” 
GEN.31.2	And Jacob saw from Laban’s face that his attitude toward him was not the same as before.
GEN.31.3	The 
GEN.31.4	Jacob had Rachel and Leah called to the field where his flocks were. 
GEN.31.5	He said to them, “I can see from your father’s face that his attitude toward me is not the same as before, but the God of my father has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	You know that with all my strength I have served your father
GEN.31.7	and that he has cheated me and changed my wages ten times. But God has not let him harm me. 
GEN.31.8	If he said, ‘The spotted sheep will be your wages,’ then all the sheep were born spotted. If he said, ‘The streaked sheep will be your wages,’ then all the sheep were born streaked.
GEN.31.9	God has taken away your father’s herds and given them to me.
GEN.31.10	“When the flocks were breeding, I saw in a dream that the streaked, spotted, and speckled males were mating with the females. 
GEN.31.11	In that dream the angel of God said to me, ‘Jacob!’ and I said, ‘Here I am.’ 
GEN.31.12	And he said, ‘Look up and see: all the males that are mating with the flocks are streaked, spotted, and speckled, for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you.
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Bethel, where you poured oil on the stone marker and made a solemn vow to me.
GEN.31.14	Then Rachel and Leah answered him, “Do we have any portion or inheritance in our father’s family? 
GEN.31.15	Are we not regarded by him as outsiders? For he has sold us
GEN.31.16	In fact, all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. So do whatever God has said to you.”
GEN.31.17	So Jacob got up and put his children and wives on the camels. 
GEN.31.18	He took all the livestock and possessions he had acquired in Paddan-aram, and he drove his herds to go to the land of Canaan, to his father Isaac. 
GEN.31.19	When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father’s household idols.
GEN.31.20	And Jacob deceived
GEN.31.21	He fled with all his possessions, crossed the Euphrates, and headed for
GEN.31.22	On the third day Laban was told that Jacob had fled. 
GEN.31.23	So he took his relatives with him, pursued Jacob for seven days, and overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night. “Watch yourself!” God warned him. “Don’t say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.”
GEN.31.25	When Laban overtook Jacob, Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban and his relatives also pitched their tents in the hill country of Gilead. 
GEN.31.26	Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You have deceived me and taken my daughters away like prisoners of war! 
GEN.31.27	Why did you secretly flee from me, deceive me, and not tell me? I would have sent you away with joy and singing, with tambourines and lyres, 
GEN.31.28	but you didn’t even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters. You have acted foolishly. 
GEN.31.29	I could do you great harm, but last night the God of your father said to me: ‘Watch yourself! Don’t say anything to Jacob, either good or bad.’ 
GEN.31.30	Now you have gone off because you long for your father’s family — but why have you stolen my gods?” 
GEN.31.31	Jacob answered, “I was afraid, for I thought you would take your daughters from me by force. 
GEN.31.32	If you find your gods with anyone here, he will not live!
GEN.31.33	So Laban went into Jacob’s tent, Leah’s tent, and the tents of the two concubines,
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel had taken Laban’s household idols, put them in the saddlebag of the camel, and sat on them. Laban searched the whole tent but found nothing.
GEN.31.35	She said to her father, “Don’t be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence;
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob became incensed and brought charges against Laban. “What is my crime?” he said to Laban. “What is my sin, that you have pursued me? 
GEN.31.37	You’ve searched all my possessions! Have you found anything of yours?
GEN.31.38	I’ve been with you these twenty years. Your ewes and female goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams from your flock. 
GEN.31.39	I did not bring you any of the flock torn by wild beasts; I myself bore the loss. You demanded payment from me for what was stolen by day or by night. 
GEN.31.40	There I was — the heat consumed me by day and the frost by night, and sleep fled from my eyes. 
GEN.31.41	For twenty years in your household I served you — fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks
GEN.31.42	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, certainly now you would have sent me off empty-handed. But God has seen my affliction and my hard work,
GEN.31.43	Then Laban answered Jacob, “The daughters are my daughters; the sons, my sons; and the flocks, my flocks! Everything you see is mine! But what can I do today for these daughters of mine or for the children they have borne? 
GEN.31.44	Come now, let’s make a covenant, you and I.
GEN.31.45	So Jacob picked out a stone and set it up as a marker.
GEN.31.46	Then Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a mound, then ate there by the mound. 
GEN.31.47	Laban named the mound Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob named it Galeed.
GEN.31.48	Then Laban said, “This mound is a witness between you and me today.” Therefore the place was called Galeed 
GEN.31.49	and also Mizpah,
GEN.31.50	If you mistreat my daughters or take other wives, though no one is with us, understand that God will be a witness between you and me.”
GEN.31.51	Laban also said to Jacob, “Look at this mound and the marker I have set up between you and me. 
GEN.31.52	This mound is a witness and the marker is a witness that I will not pass beyond this mound to you, and you will not pass beyond this mound and this marker to do me harm. 
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham, and the gods
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and invited his relatives to eat a meal. So they ate a meal and spent the night on the mountain. 
GEN.31.55	Laban got up early in the morning, kissed his grandchildren and daughters, and blessed them. Then Laban left to return home.
GEN.32.1	Jacob went on his way, and God’s angels met him.
GEN.32.2	When he saw them, Jacob said, “This is God’s camp.” So he called that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the territory of Edom. 
GEN.32.4	He commanded them, “You are to say to my lord Esau, ‘This is what your servant Jacob says. I have been staying with Laban and have been delayed until now. 
GEN.32.5	I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, and male and female slaves. I have sent this message to inform my lord, in order to seek your favor.’”
GEN.32.6	When the messengers returned to Jacob, they said, “We went to your brother Esau; he is coming to meet you — and he has four hundred men with him.”
GEN.32.7	Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; he divided the people with him into two camps, along with the flocks, herds, and camels. 
GEN.32.8	He thought, “If Esau comes to one camp and attacks it, the remaining one can escape.”
GEN.32.9	Then Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac,
GEN.32.10	I am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant. Indeed, I crossed over the Jordan with my staff, and now I have become two camps. 
GEN.32.11	Please rescue me from my brother Esau, for I am afraid of him; otherwise, he may come and attack me, the mothers, and their children. 
GEN.32.12	You have said, ‘I will cause you to prosper, and I will make your offspring like the sand of the sea, too numerous to be counted.’”
GEN.32.13	He spent the night there and took part of what he had brought with him as a gift for his brother Esau:
GEN.32.14	two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, twenty rams, 
GEN.32.15	thirty milk camels with their young, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten male donkeys. 
GEN.32.16	He entrusted them to his slaves as separate herds and said to them, “Go on ahead of me, and leave some distance between the herds.”
GEN.32.17	And he told the first one: “When my brother Esau meets you and asks, ‘Who do you belong to? Where are you going? And whose animals are these ahead of you?’ 
GEN.32.18	then tell him, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. They are a gift sent to my lord Esau. And look, he is behind us.’”
GEN.32.19	He also told the second one, the third, and everyone who was walking behind the animals, “Say the same thing to Esau when you find him. 
GEN.32.20	You are also to say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.’” For he thought, “I want to appease Esau with the gift that is going ahead of me. After that, I can face him, and perhaps he will forgive me.”
GEN.32.21	So the gift was sent on ahead of him while he remained in the camp that night. 
GEN.32.22	During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two slave women, and his eleven sons, and crossed the ford of Jabbok.
GEN.32.23	He took them and sent them across the stream, along with all his possessions.
GEN.32.24	Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until daybreak.
GEN.32.25	When the man saw that he could not defeat him, he struck Jacob’s hip socket as they wrestled and dislocated his hip. 
GEN.32.26	Then he said to Jacob, “Let me go, for it is daybreak.”
GEN.32.26	But Jacob said, “I will not let you go unless you bless me.”
GEN.32.27	“What is your name?” the man asked.
GEN.32.27	“Jacob,” he replied.
GEN.32.28	“Your name will no longer be Jacob,”
GEN.32.29	Then Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.”
GEN.32.29	But he answered, “Why do you ask my name?” 
GEN.32.30	Jacob then named the place Peniel,
GEN.32.31	The sun shone on him as he passed by Penuel
GEN.32.32	That is why, still today, the Israelites don’t eat the thigh muscle that is at the hip socket: because he struck Jacob’s hip socket at the thigh muscle.
GEN.33.1	Now Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming toward him with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and the two slave women. 
GEN.33.2	He put the slaves and their children first, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last. 
GEN.33.3	He himself went on ahead and bowed to the ground
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet him, hugged him, threw his arms around him, and kissed him. Then they wept.
GEN.33.5	When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these with you?”
GEN.33.5	He answered, “The children God has graciously given your servant.”
GEN.33.6	Then the slaves and their children approached him and bowed down. 
GEN.33.7	Leah and her children also approached and bowed down, and then Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed down.
GEN.33.8	So Esau said, “What do you mean by this whole procession
GEN.33.8	“To find favor with you, my lord,”
GEN.33.9	“I have enough, my brother,” Esau replied. “Keep what you have.”
GEN.33.10	But Jacob said, “No, please! If I have found favor with you, take this gift from me. For indeed, I have seen your face, and it is like seeing God’s face, since you have accepted me. 
GEN.33.11	Please take my present that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have everything I need.” So Jacob urged him until he accepted.
GEN.33.12	Then Esau said, “Let’s move on, and I’ll go ahead of you.”
GEN.33.13	Jacob replied, “My lord knows that the children are weak, and I have nursing flocks and herds. If they are driven hard for one day, the whole herd will die. 
GEN.33.14	Let my lord go ahead of his servant. I will continue on slowly, at a pace suited to the livestock and the children, until I come to my lord at Seir.”
GEN.33.15	Esau said, “Let me leave some of my people with you.”
GEN.33.15	But he replied, “Why do that? Please indulge me,
GEN.33.16	That day Esau started on his way back to Seir, 
GEN.33.17	but Jacob went to Succoth. He built a house for himself and shelters for his livestock; that is why the place was called Succoth.
GEN.33.18	After Jacob came from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely
GEN.33.19	He purchased a section of the field where he had pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of silver.
GEN.33.20	And he set up an altar there and called it God, the God of Israel.
GEN.34.1	Leah’s daughter
GEN.34.2	When Shechem — son of Hamor the Hivite, who was the region’s chieftain — saw her, he took her and raped her. 
GEN.34.3	He became infatuated with Jacob’s daughter Dinah. He loved the young girl and spoke tenderly to her.
GEN.34.4	“Get me this girl as a wife,”
GEN.34.5	Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter Dinah, but since his sons were with his livestock in the field, he remained silent until they returned. 
GEN.34.6	Meanwhile, Shechem’s father Hamor came to speak with Jacob. 
GEN.34.7	Jacob’s sons returned from the field when they heard about the incident and were deeply grieved and very angry. For Shechem had committed an outrage against Israel by raping Jacob’s daughter,
GEN.34.8	Hamor said to Jacob’s sons, “My son Shechem has his heart set on your
GEN.34.9	Intermarry with us; give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves. 
GEN.34.10	Live with us. The land is before you. Settle here, move about, and acquire property in it.”
GEN.34.11	Then Shechem said to Dinah’s father and brothers, “Grant me this favor,
GEN.34.12	Demand of me a high compensation
GEN.34.13	But Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceitfully because he had defiled their sister Dinah. 
GEN.34.14	“We cannot do this thing,” they said to them. “Giving our sister to an uncircumcised man is a disgrace to us. 
GEN.34.15	We will agree with you only on this condition: if all your males are circumcised as we are.
GEN.34.16	Then we will give you our daughters, take your daughters for ourselves, live with you, and become one people. 
GEN.34.17	But if you will not listen to us and be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.”
GEN.34.18	Their words seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem. 
GEN.34.19	The young man did not delay doing this, because he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. Now he was the most important in all his father’s family. 
GEN.34.20	So Hamor and his son Shechem went to the gate of their city
GEN.34.21	“These men are peaceful toward us,” they said. “Let them live in our land and move about in it, for indeed, the region is large enough for them. Let us take their daughters as our wives and give our daughters to them. 
GEN.34.22	But the men will agree to live with us and be one people only on this condition: if all our men are circumcised as they are. 
GEN.34.23	Won’t their livestock, their possessions, and all their animals become ours? Only let us agree with them, and they will live with us.”
GEN.34.24	All the men
GEN.34.25	On the third day, when they were still in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi,
GEN.34.26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with their swords, took Dinah from Shechem’s house, and went away. 
GEN.34.27	Jacob’s sons came to the slaughter and plundered the city because their sister had been defiled. 
GEN.34.28	They took their flocks, herds, donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field. 
GEN.34.29	They captured all their possessions, dependents, and wives and plundered everything in the houses.
GEN.34.30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have brought trouble on me,
GEN.34.31	But they answered, “Should he treat our sister like a prostitute?”
GEN.35.1	God said to Jacob, “Get up! Go to Bethel and settle there.
GEN.35.2	So Jacob said to his family and all who were with him, “Get rid of the foreign gods that are among you.
GEN.35.3	We must get up and go to Bethel. I will build an altar there to the God who answered me in my day of distress.
GEN.35.4	Then they gave Jacob all their foreign gods and their earrings, and Jacob hid them under the oak near Shechem. 
GEN.35.5	When they set out, a terror from God came over the cities around them, and they did not pursue Jacob’s sons.
GEN.35.6	So Jacob and all who were with him came to Luz (that is, Bethel
GEN.35.7	Jacob built an altar there and called the place El-bethel
GEN.35.8	Deborah, the one who had nursed and raised Rebekah,
GEN.35.9	God appeared to Jacob again after he returned from Paddan-aram, and he blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	God said to him, “Your name is Jacob; you will no longer be named Jacob, but your name will be Israel.”
GEN.35.11	God also said to him, “I am God Almighty.
GEN.35.12	I will give to you the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac.
GEN.35.13	Then God withdrew
GEN.35.14	Jacob set up a marker at the place where he had spoken to him — a stone marker. He poured a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil.
GEN.35.15	Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him Bethel.
GEN.35.16	They set out from Bethel. When they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel began to give birth, and her labor was difficult. 
GEN.35.17	During her difficult labor, the midwife said to her, “Don’t be afraid, for you have another son.”
GEN.35.18	With her last breath — for she was dying — she named him Ben-oni,
GEN.35.19	So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem
GEN.35.20	Jacob set up a marker on her grave; it is the marker at Rachel’s grave still today.
GEN.35.21	Israel set out again and pitched his tent beyond the Tower of Eder.
GEN.35.22	While Israel was living in that region, Reuben went in and slept with his father’s concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it.
GEN.35.22	Jacob had twelve sons:
GEN.35.23	Leah’s sons were Reuben (Jacob’s firstborn),
GEN.35.23	Simeon, Levi, Judah,
GEN.35.23	Issachar, and Zebulun.
GEN.35.24	Rachel’s sons were
GEN.35.24	Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.35.25	The sons of Rachel’s slave Bilhah
GEN.35.25	were Dan and Naphtali.
GEN.35.26	The sons of Leah’s slave Zilpah
GEN.35.26	were Gad and Asher.
GEN.35.26	These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan-aram.
GEN.35.27	Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre
GEN.35.28	Isaac lived 180 years. 
GEN.35.29	He took his last breath and died, and was gathered to his people,
GEN.36.1	These are the family records
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives from the Canaanite women: Adah daughter of Elon the Hethite,
GEN.36.3	and Basemath daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.36.4	Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel, 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were Esau’s sons, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.
GEN.36.6	Esau took his wives, sons, daughters, and all the people of his household, as well as his herds, all his livestock, and all the property he had acquired in Canaan; he went to a land away from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	For their possessions were too many for them to live together,
GEN.36.8	So Esau (that is, Edom) lived in the mountains of Seir.
GEN.36.9	These are the family records of Esau, father of the Edomites in the mountains of Seir.

GEN.36.31	before any king reigned over the Israelites:
GEN.36.32	Bela son of Beor reigned in Edom;
GEN.36.32	the name of his city was Dinhabah.
GEN.36.33	When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place.
GEN.36.34	When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
GEN.36.35	When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad reigned in his place.
GEN.36.35	He defeated Midian in the field of Moab;
GEN.36.35	the name of his city was Avith.

GEN.36.43	Esau
GEN.37.1	Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed, the land of Canaan.
GEN.37.2	These are the family records of Jacob.
GEN.37.2	At seventeen years of age, Joseph tended sheep with his brothers. The young man was working with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives,
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other sons because Joseph was a son born to him in his old age,
GEN.37.4	When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not bring themselves to speak peaceably to him.
GEN.37.5	Then Joseph had a dream. When he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more. 
GEN.37.6	He said to them, “Listen to this dream I had: 
GEN.37.7	There we were, binding sheaves of grain in the field. Suddenly my sheaf stood up, and your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf.”
GEN.37.8	“Are you really going to reign over us?” his brothers asked him. “Are you really going to rule us?” So they hated him even more because of his dream and what he had said.
GEN.37.9	Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers. “Look,” he said, “I had another dream, and this time the sun, moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
GEN.37.10	He told his father and brothers, and his father rebuked him. “What kind of dream is this that you have had?” he said. “Am I and your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the ground before you?” 
GEN.37.11	His brothers were jealous of him,
GEN.37.12	His brothers had gone to pasture their father’s flocks at Shechem. 
GEN.37.13	Israel said to Joseph, “Your brothers, you know, are pasturing the flocks at Shechem. Get ready. I’m sending you to them.”
GEN.37.13	“I’m ready,” Joseph replied.
GEN.37.14	Then Israel said to him, “Go and see how your brothers and the flocks are doing, and bring word back to me.” So he sent him from the Hebron
GEN.37.15	A man found him there, wandering in the field, and asked him, “What are you looking for?”
GEN.37.16	“I’m looking for my brothers,” Joseph said. “Can you tell me where they are pasturing their flocks?”
GEN.37.17	“They’ve moved on from here,” the man said. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’”
GEN.37.18	They saw him in the distance, and before he had reached them, they plotted to kill him.
GEN.37.19	They said to one another, “Oh, look, here comes that dream expert!
GEN.37.20	So now, come on, let’s kill him and throw him into one of the pits.
GEN.37.21	When Reuben heard this, he tried to save him from them.
GEN.37.22	Reuben also said to them, “Don’t shed blood. Throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but don’t lay a hand on him” — intending to rescue him from them and return him to his father.
GEN.37.23	When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped off Joseph’s robe, the robe of many colors that he had on. 
GEN.37.24	Then they took him and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty, without water.
GEN.37.25	They sat down to eat a meal,
GEN.37.26	Judah said to his brothers, “What do we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? 
GEN.37.27	Come on, let’s sell him to the Ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him, for he is our brother, our own flesh,” and his brothers agreed. 
GEN.37.28	When Midianite
GEN.37.29	When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes.
GEN.37.30	He went back to his brothers and said, “The boy is gone! What am I going to do?” 
GEN.37.31	So they took Joseph’s robe, slaughtered a male goat, and dipped the robe in its blood. 
GEN.37.32	They sent the robe of many colors to their father and said, “We found this. Examine it. Is it your son’s robe or not?”
GEN.37.33	His father recognized it. “It is my son’s robe,” he said. “A vicious animal has devoured him. Joseph has been torn to pieces!” 
GEN.37.34	Then Jacob tore his clothes, put sackcloth around his waist, and mourned for his son many days. 
GEN.37.35	All his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. “No,” he said. “I will go down to Sheol to my son, mourning.” And his father wept for him.
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile, the Midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and the captain of the guards.
GEN.38.1	At that time Judah left his brothers and settled near an Adullamite
GEN.38.2	There Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite named Shua; he took her as a wife and slept with her. 
GEN.38.3	She conceived and gave birth to a son, and he named him Er.
GEN.38.4	She conceived again, gave birth to a son, and named him Onan. 
GEN.38.5	She gave birth to another son and named him Shelah. It was at Chezib that
GEN.38.6	Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 
GEN.38.7	Now Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the 
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife. Perform your duty as her brother-in-law
GEN.38.9	But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he released his semen on the ground so that he would not produce offspring for his brother. 
GEN.38.10	What he did was evil in the 
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up.”
GEN.38.12	After a long time
GEN.38.13	Tamar was told, “Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” 
GEN.38.14	So she took off her widow’s clothes, veiled her face,
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face.
GEN.38.16	He went over to her and said, “Come, let me sleep with you,” for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law.
GEN.38.16	She said, “What will you give me for sleeping with me?”
GEN.38.17	“I will send you a young goat from my flock,” he replied.
GEN.38.17	But she said, “Only if you leave something with me until you send it.”
GEN.38.18	“What should I give you?” he asked.
GEN.38.18	She answered, “Your signet ring, your cord, and the staff in your hand.” So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. 
GEN.38.19	She got up and left, then removed her veil and put her widow’s clothes back on.
GEN.38.20	When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite in order to get back the items he had left with the woman, he could not find her. 
GEN.38.21	He asked the men of the place, “Where is the cult prostitute who was beside the road at Enaim?”
GEN.38.21	“There has been no cult prostitute here,” they answered.
GEN.38.22	So the Adullamite returned to Judah, saying, “I couldn’t find her, and besides, the men of the place said, ‘There has been no cult prostitute here.’”
GEN.38.23	Judah replied, “Let her keep the items for herself; otherwise we will become a laughingstock. After all, I did send this young goat, but you couldn’t find her.”
GEN.38.24	About three months later Judah was told, “Your daughter-in-law, Tamar, has been acting like a prostitute, and now she is pregnant.”
GEN.38.24	“Bring her out,” Judah said, “and let her be burned to death!” 
GEN.38.25	As she was being brought out, she sent her father-in-law this message: “I am pregnant by the man to whom these items belong.” And she added, “Examine them. Whose signet ring, cord, and staff are these?”
GEN.38.26	Judah recognized them and said, “She is more in the right
GEN.38.27	When the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb. 
GEN.38.28	As she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand, and the midwife took it and tied a scarlet thread around it, announcing, “This one came out first.” 
GEN.38.29	But then he pulled his hand back, out came his brother, and she said, “What a breakout you have made for yourself!” So he was named Perez.
GEN.38.30	Then his brother, who had the scarlet thread tied to his hand, came out, and was named Zerah.
GEN.39.1	Now Joseph had been taken to Egypt. An Egyptian named Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and the captain of the guards, bought him from the Ishmaelites
GEN.39.2	The 
GEN.39.3	When his master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	Joseph found favor
GEN.39.5	From the time that he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned, the 
GEN.39.6	He left all that he owned under Joseph’s authority;
GEN.39.6	Now Joseph was well-built and handsome.
GEN.39.7	After some time
GEN.39.8	But he refused. “Look,” he said to his master’s wife, “with me here my master does not concern himself with anything in his house, and he has put all that he owns under my authority.
GEN.39.9	No one in this house is greater than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. So how could I do this immense evil, and how could I sin against God?” 
GEN.39.10	Although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he refused to go to bed with her.
GEN.39.11	Now one day he went into the house to do his work, and none of the household servants were there.
GEN.39.12	She grabbed him by his garment and said, “Sleep with me!” But leaving his garment in her hand, he escaped and ran outside. 
GEN.39.13	When she saw that he had left his garment with her and had run outside, 
GEN.39.14	she called her household servants. “Look,” she said to them, “my husband brought a Hebrew man to make fools of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me, and I screamed as loud as I could. 
GEN.39.15	When he heard me screaming for help,
GEN.39.16	She put Joseph’s garment beside her until his master came home. 
GEN.39.17	Then she told him the same story: “The Hebrew slave you brought to us came to make a fool of me, 
GEN.39.18	but when I screamed for help,
GEN.39.19	When his master heard the story his wife told him — “These are the things your slave did to me” — he was furious 
GEN.39.20	and had him thrown into prison,
GEN.39.21	But the 
GEN.39.22	The warden put all the prisoners who were in the prison under Joseph’s authority,
GEN.39.23	The warden did not bother with anything under Joseph’s authority,
GEN.40.1	After this, the king of Egypt’s cupbearer
GEN.40.2	Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer and the chief baker, 
GEN.40.3	and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guards
GEN.40.4	The captain of the guards assigned Joseph to them as their personal attendant, and they were in custody for some time.
GEN.40.5	The king of Egypt’s cupbearer and baker, who were confined in the prison, each had a dream. Both had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning. 
GEN.40.6	When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they looked distraught. 
GEN.40.7	So he asked Pharaoh’s officers who were in custody with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so sad today?” 
GEN.40.8	“We had dreams,” they said to him, “but there is no one to interpret them.”
GEN.40.8	Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations belong to God? Tell me your dreams.”
GEN.40.9	So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph: “In my dream there was a vine in front of me. 
GEN.40.10	On the vine were three branches. As soon as it budded, its blossoms came out and its clusters ripened into grapes. 
GEN.40.11	Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand.”
GEN.40.12	“This is its interpretation,”
GEN.40.13	In just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head
GEN.40.14	But when all goes well for you, remember that I was with you. Please show kindness to me by mentioning me to Pharaoh, and get me out of this prison. 
GEN.40.15	For I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews,
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was positive, he said to Joseph, “I also had a dream. Three baskets of white bread were on my head. 
GEN.40.17	In the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
GEN.40.18	“This is its interpretation,” Joseph replied. “The three baskets are three days. 
GEN.40.19	In just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head — from off you — and hang you on a tree.
GEN.40.20	On the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, he gave a feast for all his servants. He elevated
GEN.40.21	Pharaoh restored the chief cupbearer to his position as cupbearer, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh’s hand. 
GEN.40.22	But Pharaoh hanged
GEN.40.23	Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph; he forgot him.
GEN.41.1	At the end of two years Pharaoh had a dream: He was standing beside the Nile,
GEN.41.2	when seven healthy-looking, well-fed cows came up from the Nile and began to graze among the reeds. 
GEN.41.3	After them, seven other cows, sickly and thin, came up from the Nile and stood beside those cows along the bank of the Nile. 
GEN.41.4	The sickly, thin cows ate the healthy, well-fed cows. Then Pharaoh woke up. 
GEN.41.5	He fell asleep and dreamed a second time: Seven heads of grain, plump and good, came up on one stalk. 
GEN.41.6	After them, seven heads of grain, thin and scorched by the east wind, sprouted up. 
GEN.41.7	The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven plump, full ones. Then Pharaoh woke up, and it was only a dream.
GEN.41.8	When morning came, he was troubled,
GEN.41.9	Then the chief cupbearer said to Pharaoh, “Today I remember my faults. 
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me and the chief baker in the custody of the captain of the guards. 
GEN.41.11	He and I had dreams on the same night; each dream had its own meaning. 
GEN.41.12	Now a young Hebrew, a slave of the captain of the guards, was with us there. We told him our dreams, he interpreted our dreams for us, and each had its own interpretation. 
GEN.41.13	It turned out just the way he interpreted them to us: I was restored to my position, and the other man was hanged.”
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent for Joseph, and they quickly brought him from the dungeon.
GEN.41.15	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, and no one can interpret it. But I have heard it said about you that you can hear a dream and interpret it.”
GEN.41.16	“I am not able to,”
GEN.41.17	So Pharaoh said to Joseph: “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 
GEN.41.18	when seven well-fed, healthy-looking cows came up from the Nile and grazed among the reeds. 
GEN.41.19	After them, seven other cows — weak, very sickly, and thin — came up. I’ve never seen such sickly ones as these in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.20	Then the thin, sickly cows ate the first seven well-fed cows. 
GEN.41.21	When they had devoured them, you could not tell that they had devoured them; their appearance was as bad as it had been before. Then I woke up. 
GEN.41.22	In my dream I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, coming up on one stalk. 
GEN.41.23	After them, seven heads of grain — withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind — sprouted up. 
GEN.41.24	The thin heads of grain swallowed the seven good ones. I told this to the magicians, but no one can tell me what it means.”
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams mean the same thing. God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads are seven years. The dreams mean the same thing. 
GEN.41.27	The seven thin, sickly cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven worthless, scorched heads of grain are seven years of famine.
GEN.41.28	“It is just as I told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.29	Seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.30	After them, seven years of famine will take place, and all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. The famine will devastate the land.
GEN.41.31	The abundance in the land will not be remembered because of the famine that follows it, for the famine will be very severe. 
GEN.41.32	Since the dream was given twice to Pharaoh, it means that the matter has been determined by God, and he will carry it out soon.
GEN.41.33	“So now, let Pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh do this: Let him appoint overseers over the land and take a fifth of the harvest of the land of Egypt during the seven years of abundance. 
GEN.41.35	Let them gather all the excess food during these good years that are coming. Under Pharaoh’s authority, store the grain in the cities, so they may preserve it as food. 
GEN.41.36	The food will be a reserve for the land during the seven years of famine that will take place in the land of Egypt. Then the country will not be wiped out by the famine.”
GEN.41.37	The proposal pleased Pharaoh and all his servants, 
GEN.41.38	and he said to them, “Can we find anyone like this, a man who has God’s spirit
GEN.41.39	So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has made all this known to you, there is no one as discerning and wise as you are. 
GEN.41.40	You will be over my house, and all my people will obey your commands.
GEN.41.41	Pharaoh also said to Joseph, “See, I am placing you over all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, clothed him with fine linen garments, and placed a gold chain around his neck.
GEN.41.43	He had Joseph ride in his second chariot, and servants called out before him, “Make way!” 
GEN.41.44	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I am Pharaoh and no one will be able to raise his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt without your permission.” 
GEN.41.45	Pharaoh gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-paneah and gave him a wife, Asenath daughter of Potiphera, priest at On.
GEN.41.46	Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. Joseph left Pharaoh’s presence and traveled throughout the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.47	During the seven years of abundance the land produced outstanding harvests. 
GEN.41.48	Joseph gathered all the excess food in the land of Egypt during the seven years and put it in the cities. He put the food in every city from the fields around it. 
GEN.41.49	So Joseph stored up grain in such abundance — like the sand of the sea — that he stopped measuring it because it was beyond measure.
GEN.41.50	Two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine arrived.
GEN.41.51	Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh
GEN.41.52	And the second son he named Ephraim
GEN.41.53	Then the seven years of abundance in the land of Egypt came to an end, 
GEN.41.54	and the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had said. There was famine in every land, but in the whole land of Egypt there was food. 
GEN.41.55	When the whole land of Egypt was stricken with famine, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food. Pharaoh told all Egypt, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.” 
GEN.41.56	Now the famine had spread across the whole region, so Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.57	Every land came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain, for the famine was severe in every land.
GEN.42.1	When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt,
GEN.42.2	Listen,” he went on, “I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us so that we will live and not die.”
GEN.42.3	So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Joseph’s brother Benjamin with his brothers, for he thought, “Something might happen to him.”
GEN.42.5	The sons of Israel were among those who came to buy grain, for the famine was in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.42.6	Joseph was in charge of the country; he sold grain to all its people. His brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground.
GEN.42.7	When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke harshly to them.
GEN.42.7	“Where do you come from?” he asked.
GEN.42.7	“From the land of Canaan to buy food,” they replied.
GEN.42.8	Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they did not recognize him. 
GEN.42.9	Joseph remembered his dreams about them
GEN.42.10	“No, my lord. Your servants have come to buy food,” they said. 
GEN.42.11	“We are all sons of one man. We are honest; your servants are not spies.”
GEN.42.12	“No,” he said to them. “You have come to see the weakness of the land.”
GEN.42.13	But they replied, “We, your servants, were twelve brothers, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan. The youngest is now
GEN.42.14	Then Joseph said to them, “I have spoken:
GEN.42.15	This is how you will be tested: As surely as Pharaoh lives, you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	Send one from among you to get your brother. The rest of you will be imprisoned so that your words can be tested to see if they are true. If they are not, then as surely as Pharaoh lives, you are spies!” 
GEN.42.17	So Joseph imprisoned them together for three days.
GEN.42.18	On the third day Joseph said to them, “I fear God
GEN.42.19	If you are honest, let one of you
GEN.42.20	Bring your youngest brother to me so that your words can be confirmed; then you won’t die.” And they consented to this.
GEN.42.21	Then they said to each other, “Obviously, we are being punished for what we did to our brother. We saw his deep distress when he pleaded with us, but we would not listen. That is why this trouble has come to us.”
GEN.42.22	But Reuben replied: “Didn’t I tell you not to harm the boy?
GEN.42.23	They did not realize that Joseph understood them, since there was an interpreter between them. 
GEN.42.24	He turned away from them and wept. When he turned back and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and had him bound before their eyes. 
GEN.42.25	Joseph then gave orders to fill their containers with grain, return each man’s silver to his sack, and give them provisions for their journey. This order was carried out. 
GEN.42.26	They loaded the grain on their donkeys and left there.
GEN.42.27	At the place where they lodged for the night, one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey, and he saw his silver there at the top of his bag. 
GEN.42.28	He said to his brothers, “My silver has been returned! It’s here in my bag.” Their hearts sank. Trembling, they turned to one another and said, “What is this that God has done to us?”
GEN.42.29	When they reached their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him all that had happened to them: 
GEN.42.30	“The man who is the lord of the country spoke harshly to us and accused us of spying on the country. 
GEN.42.31	But we told him: We are honest and not spies. 
GEN.42.32	We were twelve brothers, sons of the same
GEN.42.33	The man who is the lord of the country said to us, ‘This is how I will know if you are honest: Leave one brother with me, take food to relieve the hunger of your households, and go. 
GEN.42.34	Bring back your youngest brother to me, and I will know that you are not spies but honest men. I will then give your brother back to you, and you can trade in the country.’”
GEN.42.35	As they began emptying their sacks, there in each man’s sack was his bag of silver! When they and their father saw their bags of silver, they were afraid.
GEN.42.36	Their father Jacob said to them, “It’s me that you make childless. Joseph is gone, and Simeon is gone. Now you want to take Benjamin. Everything happens to me!”
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben said to his father, “You can kill my two sons if I don’t bring him back to you. Put him in my care,
GEN.42.38	But Jacob answered, “My son will not go down with you, for his brother is dead and he alone is left.
GEN.43.1	Now the famine in the land was severe.
GEN.43.2	When they had used up the grain they had brought back from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go back and buy us a little food.”
GEN.43.3	But Judah said to him, “The man specifically warned us: ‘You will not see me again unless your brother is with you.’ 
GEN.43.4	If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you. 
GEN.43.5	But if you will not send him, we will not go, for the man said to us, ‘You will not see me again unless your brother is with you.’”
GEN.43.6	“Why have you caused me so much trouble?” Israel asked. “Why did you tell the man that you had another brother?”
GEN.43.7	They answered, “The man kept asking about us and our family: ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ And we answered him accordingly. How could we know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother here’?”
GEN.43.8	Then Judah said to his father Israel, “Send the boy with me. We will be on our way so that we may live and not die — neither we, nor you, nor our dependents. 
GEN.43.9	I will be responsible for him. You can hold me personally accountable!
GEN.43.10	If we had not delayed, we could have come back twice by now.”
GEN.43.11	Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this: Put some of the best products of the land in your packs and take them down to the man as a gift — a little balsam and a little honey, aromatic gum and resin, pistachios and almonds.
GEN.43.12	Take twice as much silver with you. Return the silver that was returned to you in the top of your bags. Perhaps it was a mistake. 
GEN.43.13	Take your brother also, and go back at once to the man. 
GEN.43.14	May God Almighty cause the man to be merciful to you so that he will release your other brother and Benjamin to you. As for me, if I am deprived of my sons, then I am deprived.”
GEN.43.15	The men took this gift, double the amount of silver, and Benjamin. They immediately went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to his steward, “Take the men to my house. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, for they will eat with me at noon.” 
GEN.43.17	The man did as Joseph had said and brought them to Joseph’s house.
GEN.43.18	But the men were afraid because they were taken to Joseph’s house. They said, “We have been brought here because of the silver that was returned in our bags the first time. They intend to overpower us, seize us, make us slaves, and take our donkeys.” 
GEN.43.19	So they approached Joseph’s steward
GEN.43.20	They said, “My lord, we really did come down here the first time only to buy food. 
GEN.43.21	When we came to the place where we lodged for the night and opened our bags of grain, each one’s silver was at the top of his bag!
GEN.43.22	We have brought additional silver with us to buy food. We don’t know who put our silver in the bags.”
GEN.43.23	Then the steward said, “May you be well. Don’t be afraid. Your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your bags. I received your silver.” Then he brought Simeon out to them. 
GEN.43.24	The steward brought the men into Joseph’s house, gave them water to wash their feet,
GEN.43.25	Since the men had heard that they were going to eat a meal there, they prepared their gift for Joseph’s arrival at noon. 
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, they brought him the gift they had carried into the house, and they bowed to the ground before him.
GEN.43.27	He asked if they were well, and he said, “How is your elderly father that you told me about? Is he still alive?”
GEN.43.28	They answered, “Your servant our father is well. He is still alive.” And they knelt low and paid homage to him.
GEN.43.29	When he looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, he asked, “Is this your youngest brother that you told me about?” Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.” 
GEN.43.30	Joseph hurried out because he was overcome with emotion for his brother, and he was about to weep. He went into an inner room and wept there. 
GEN.43.31	Then he washed his face and came out. Regaining his composure,
GEN.43.32	They served him by himself, his brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves, because Egyptians could not eat with Hebrews, since that is detestable to them.
GEN.43.33	They were seated before him in order by age, from the firstborn to the youngest. The men looked at each other in astonishment. 
GEN.43.34	Portions were served to them from Joseph’s table, and Benjamin’s portion was five times larger than any of theirs.
GEN.44.1	Joseph commanded his steward, “Fill the men’s bags with as much food as they can carry, and put each one’s silver at the top of his bag.
GEN.44.2	Put my cup, the silver one, at the top of the youngest one’s bag, along with the silver for his grain.” So he did as Joseph told him.
GEN.44.3	At morning light, the men were sent off with their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	They had not gone very far from the city when Joseph said to his steward, “Get up. Pursue the men, and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good? 
GEN.44.5	Isn’t this the cup that my master drinks from and uses for divination?
GEN.44.6	When he overtook them, he said these words to them. 
GEN.44.7	They said to him, “Why does my lord say these things? Your servants could not possibly do such a thing. 
GEN.44.8	We even brought back to you from the land of Canaan the silver we found at the top of our bags. How could we steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 
GEN.44.9	If it is found with one of us, your servants, he must die, and the rest of us will become my lord’s slaves.”
GEN.44.10	The steward replied, “What you have said is right, but only the one who is found to have it will be my slave, and the rest of you will be blameless.”
GEN.44.11	So each one quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it. 
GEN.44.12	The steward searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 
GEN.44.13	Then they tore their clothes,
GEN.44.14	When Judah and his brothers reached Joseph’s house, he was still there. They fell to the ground before him.
GEN.44.15	“What is this you have done?” Joseph said to them. “Didn’t you know that a man like me could uncover the truth by divination?”
GEN.44.16	“What can we say to my lord?” Judah replied. “How can we plead? How can we justify ourselves? God has exposed your servants’ iniquity. We are now my lord’s slaves — both we and the one in whose possession the cup was found.”
GEN.44.17	Then Joseph said, “I swear that I will not do this. The man in whose possession the cup was found will be my slave. The rest of you can go in peace to your father.”
GEN.44.18	But Judah approached him and said, “My lord, please let your servant speak personally to my lord.
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his servants, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	and we answered my lord, ‘We have an elderly father and a younger brother, the child of his old age.
GEN.44.21	Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him to me so that I can see him.’
GEN.44.22	But we said to my lord, ‘The boy cannot leave his father. If he were to leave, his father would die.’ 
GEN.44.23	Then you said to your servants, ‘If your younger brother does not come down with you, you will not see me again.’
GEN.44.24	“This is what happened when we went back to your servant my father: We reported to him the words of my lord. 
GEN.44.25	But our father said, ‘Go again, and buy us a little food.’
GEN.44.26	We told him, ‘We cannot go down unless our younger brother goes with us. If our younger brother isn’t with us, we cannot see the man.’ 
GEN.44.27	Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore me two sons. 
GEN.44.28	One is gone from me — I said he must have been torn to pieces — and I have never seen him again.
GEN.44.29	If you also take this one from me and anything happens to him, you will bring my gray hairs down to Sheol in sorrow.’
GEN.44.30	“So if I come to your servant my father and the boy is not with us — his life is wrapped up with the boy’s life —  
GEN.44.31	when he sees that the boy is not with us, he will die. Then your servants will have brought the gray hairs of your servant our father down to Sheol in sorrow. 
GEN.44.32	Your servant became accountable to my father for the boy, saying, ‘If I do not return him to you, I will always bear the guilt for sinning against you, my father.’
GEN.44.33	Now please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave, in place of the boy. Let him go back with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	For how can I go back to my father without the boy? I could not bear to see the grief that would overwhelm my father.”
GEN.45.1	Joseph could no longer keep his composure in front of all his attendants,
GEN.45.2	But he wept so loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and also Pharaoh’s household heard it. 
GEN.45.3	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still living?” But they could not answer him because they were terrified in his presence.
GEN.45.4	Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please, come near me,” and they came near. “I am Joseph, your brother,” he said, “the one you sold into Egypt.
GEN.45.5	And now don’t be grieved or angry with yourselves for selling me here, because God sent me ahead of you to preserve life.
GEN.45.6	For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there will be five more years without plowing or harvesting. 
GEN.45.7	God sent me ahead of you to establish you as a remnant within the land and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.
GEN.45.8	Therefore it was not you who sent me here, but God. He has made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of his entire household, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.
GEN.45.9	“Return quickly to my father and say to him, ‘This is what your son Joseph says: “God has made me lord of all Egypt. Come down to me without delay. 
GEN.45.10	You can settle in the land of Goshen
GEN.45.11	There I will sustain you, for there will be five more years of famine. Otherwise, you, your household, and everything you have will become destitute.”’
GEN.45.12	Look! Your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin can see that I’m
GEN.45.13	Tell my father about all my glory in Egypt and about all you have seen. And bring my father here quickly.”
GEN.45.14	Then Joseph threw his arms around his brother Benjamin and wept, and Benjamin wept on his shoulder. 
GEN.45.15	Joseph kissed each of his brothers as he wept,
GEN.45.16	When the news reached Pharaoh’s palace, “Joseph’s brothers have come,” Pharaoh and his servants were pleased. 
GEN.45.17	Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and go on back to the land of Canaan. 
GEN.45.18	Get your father and your families, and come back to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt, and you can eat from the richness of the land.’ 
GEN.45.19	You are also commanded to tell them, ‘Do this: Take wagons from the land of Egypt for your dependents and your wives and bring your father here.
GEN.45.20	Do not be concerned about your belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”
GEN.45.21	The sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them wagons as Pharaoh had commanded, and he gave them provisions for the journey. 
GEN.45.22	He gave each of the brothers changes of clothes,
GEN.45.23	He sent his father the following: ten donkeys carrying the best products of Egypt and ten female donkeys carrying grain, food, and provisions for his father on the journey. 
GEN.45.24	So Joseph sent his brothers on their way, and as they were leaving, he said to them, “Don’t argue
GEN.45.25	So they went up from Egypt and came to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.45.26	They said, “Joseph is still alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt!” Jacob was stunned,
GEN.45.27	But when they told Jacob all that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent to transport him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived.
GEN.45.28	Then Israel said, “Enough! My son Joseph is still alive. I will go to see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	Israel set out with all that he had and came to Beer-sheba,
GEN.46.2	That night God spoke to Israel in a vision:
GEN.46.2	And Jacob replied, “Here I am.”
GEN.46.3	God said, “I am God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you into a great nation there.
GEN.46.4	I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you back.
GEN.46.5	Jacob left Beer-sheba. The sons of Israel took their father Jacob in the wagons Pharaoh had sent to carry him,
GEN.46.6	They also took their cattle and possessions they had acquired in the land of Canaan. Then Jacob and all his offspring with him came to Egypt.
GEN.46.7	His sons and grandsons, his daughters and granddaughters, indeed all his offspring, he brought with him to Egypt.
GEN.46.8	These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt
GEN.46.8	Jacob’s firstborn: Reuben.
GEN.46.9	Reuben’s sons:
GEN.46.10	Simeon’s sons:
GEN.46.11	Levi’s sons:
GEN.46.12	Judah’s sons: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.
GEN.46.12	The sons
GEN.46.13	Issachar’s sons:
GEN.46.14	Zebulun’s sons: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
GEN.46.15	These were Leah’s sons born to Jacob in Paddan-aram, as well as his daughter Dinah. The total number of persons:
GEN.46.16	Gad’s sons: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
GEN.46.17	Asher’s sons:
GEN.46.17	Beriah’s sons were Heber and Malchiel.
GEN.46.18	These were the sons of Zilpah — whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah — that she bore to Jacob: sixteen persons.
GEN.46.19	The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.46.20	Manasseh and Ephraim were born to Joseph in the land of Egypt. They were born to him by Asenath daughter of Potiphera, a priest at On.
GEN.46.21	Benjamin’s sons:
GEN.46.22	These were Rachel’s sons who were born to Jacob: fourteen persons.
GEN.46.23	Dan’s son:
GEN.46.24	Naphtali’s sons:
GEN.46.25	These were the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel.
GEN.46.26	The total number of persons belonging to Jacob — his direct descendants,
GEN.46.27	And Joseph’s sons who were born to him in Egypt: two persons.
GEN.46.27	All those of Jacob’s household who came to Egypt: seventy
GEN.46.28	Now Jacob had sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph to prepare for his arrival
GEN.46.29	Joseph hitched the horses to his chariot and went up to Goshen to meet his father Israel. Joseph presented himself to him, threw his arms around him, and wept for a long time.
GEN.46.30	Then Israel said to Joseph, “I’m ready to die now because I have seen your face and you are still alive!”
GEN.46.31	Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s family, “I will go up and inform Pharaoh, telling him, ‘My brothers and my father’s family, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me.
GEN.46.32	The men are shepherds; they also raise livestock. They have brought their flocks and herds and all that they have.’ 
GEN.46.33	When Pharaoh addresses you and asks, ‘What is your occupation?’ 
GEN.46.34	you are to say, ‘Your servants, both we and our fathers, have raised livestock
GEN.47.1	So Joseph went and informed Pharaoh: “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and herds and all that they own, have come from the land of Canaan and are now in the land of Goshen.”
GEN.47.2	He took five of his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh.
GEN.47.3	And Pharaoh asked his brothers, “What is your occupation?”
GEN.47.3	They said to Pharaoh, “Your servants, both we and our fathers, are shepherds.”
GEN.47.4	And they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to stay in the land for a while because there is no grazing land for your servants’ sheep, since the famine in the land of Canaan has been severe.
GEN.47.5	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Now that your father and brothers have come to you, 
GEN.47.6	the land of Egypt is open before you; settle your father and brothers in the best part of the land.
GEN.47.7	Joseph then brought his father Jacob and presented him to Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
GEN.47.8	Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many years have you lived?”
GEN.47.9	Jacob said to Pharaoh, “My pilgrimage
GEN.47.10	So Jacob blessed Pharaoh and departed from Pharaoh’s presence.
GEN.47.11	Then Joseph settled his father and brothers in the land of Egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land, the land of Rameses,
GEN.47.12	And Joseph provided his father, his brothers, and all his father’s family with food for their dependents.
GEN.47.13	But there was no food in the entire region, for the famine was very severe. The land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were exhausted by the famine. 
GEN.47.14	Joseph collected all the silver to be found in the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan in exchange for the grain they were purchasing, and he brought the silver to Pharaoh’s palace.
GEN.47.15	When the silver from the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan was gone, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food. Why should we die here in front of you? The silver is gone!”
GEN.47.16	But Joseph said, “Give me your livestock. Since the silver is gone, I will give you food in exchange for your livestock.” 
GEN.47.17	So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for the horses, the flocks of sheep, the herds of cattle, and the donkeys. That year he provided them with food in exchange for all their livestock.
GEN.47.18	When that year was over, they came the next year and said to him, “We cannot hide from our lord that the silver is gone and that all our livestock belongs to our lord. There is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land. 
GEN.47.19	Why should we die here in front of you — both us and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food. Then we with our land will become Pharaoh’s slaves. Give us seed so that we can live and not die, and so that the land won’t become desolate.”
GEN.47.20	In this way, Joseph acquired all the land in Egypt for Pharaoh, because every Egyptian sold his field since the famine was so severe for them. The land became Pharaoh’s, 
GEN.47.21	and Joseph moved the people to the cities
GEN.47.22	The only land he did not acquire belonged to the priests, for they had an allowance from Pharaoh. They ate from their allowance that Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their land.
GEN.47.23	Joseph said to the people, “Understand today that I have acquired you and your land for Pharaoh. Here is seed for you. Sow it in the land. 
GEN.47.24	At harvest, you are to give a fifth of it to Pharaoh,
GEN.47.25	“You have saved our lives,” they said. “We have found favor with our lord and will be Pharaoh’s slaves.” 
GEN.47.26	So Joseph made it a law, still in effect today in the land of Egypt, that a fifth of the produce belongs to Pharaoh. Only the priests’ land does not belong to Pharaoh.
GEN.47.27	Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen. They acquired property in it and became fruitful and very numerous.
GEN.47.28	Now Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years, and his life span was 147 years. 
GEN.47.29	When the time approached for him to die,
GEN.47.30	When I rest with my fathers, carry me away from Egypt and bury me in their burial place.”
GEN.47.30	Joseph answered, “I will do what you have asked.”
GEN.47.31	And Jacob said, “Swear to me.” So Joseph swore to him. Then Israel bowed in thanks at the head of his bed.
GEN.48.1	Some time after this, Joseph was told, “Your father is weaker.” So he set out with his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim. 
GEN.48.2	When Jacob was told, “Your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel summoned his strength and sat up in bed.
GEN.48.3	Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty
GEN.48.4	He said to me, ‘I will make you fruitful and numerous; I will make many nations come from you, and I will give this land as a permanent possession
GEN.48.5	Your two sons
GEN.48.6	Children born to you after them will be yours and will be recorded under the names of their brothers with regard to their inheritance. 
GEN.48.7	When I was returning from Paddan, to my sorrow Rachel died along the way,
GEN.48.8	When Israel saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?”
GEN.48.9	And Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons God has given me here.”
GEN.48.9	So Israel said, “Bring them to me and I will bless them.”
GEN.48.10	Now his eyesight was poor because of old age; he could hardly
GEN.48.11	Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face again, but now God has even let me see your offspring.” 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph took them from his father’s knees and bowed with his face to the ground.
GEN.48.13	Then Joseph took them both — with his right hand Ephraim toward Israel’s left, and with his left hand Manasseh toward Israel’s right — and brought them to Israel. 
GEN.48.14	But Israel stretched out his right hand and put it on the head of Ephraim, the younger, and crossing his hands, put his left on Manasseh’s head, although Manasseh was the firstborn.
GEN.48.15	Then he blessed Joseph and said:
GEN.48.15	The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
GEN.48.15	the God who has been my shepherd
GEN.48.16	the angel who has redeemed me from all harm
GEN.48.16	may he bless these boys.
GEN.48.16	And may they be called by my name
GEN.48.16	and the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,
GEN.48.16	and may they grow to be numerous within the land.
GEN.48.17	When Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he thought it was a mistake
GEN.48.18	Joseph said to his father, “Not that way, my father! This one is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head.”
GEN.48.19	But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know! He too will become a tribe,
GEN.48.20	So he blessed them that day, putting Ephraim before Manasseh when he said, “The nation Israel will invoke blessings by you, saying, ‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’”
GEN.48.21	Israel said to Joseph, “Look, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will bring you back to the land of your fathers.
GEN.48.22	Over and above what I am giving your brothers, I am giving you the one mountain slope
GEN.49.1	Then Jacob called his sons and said, “Gather around, and I will tell you what will happen to you in the days to come.
GEN.49.2	Come together and listen, sons of Jacob;
GEN.49.2	listen to your father Israel:
GEN.49.3	Reuben, you are my firstborn,
GEN.49.3	my strength and the firstfruits of my virility,
GEN.49.3	excelling in prominence, excelling in power.
GEN.49.4	Turbulent as water, you will not excel,
GEN.49.4	because you got into your father’s bed
GEN.49.4	and you defiled it — he
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi are brothers;
GEN.49.5	their knives are vicious weapons.
GEN.49.6	May I never enter their council;
GEN.49.6	may I never join their assembly.
GEN.49.6	For in their anger they kill men,
GEN.49.6	and on a whim they hamstring oxen.
GEN.49.7	Their anger is cursed, for it is strong,
GEN.49.7	and their fury, for it is cruel!
GEN.49.7	I will disperse them throughout Jacob
GEN.49.7	and scatter them throughout Israel.
GEN.49.8	Judah, your brothers will praise you.
GEN.49.8	Your hand will be on the necks of your enemies;
GEN.49.8	your father’s sons will bow down to you.
GEN.49.9	Judah is a young lion
GEN.49.9	my son, you return from the kill.
GEN.49.9	He crouches; he lies down like a lion
GEN.49.9	or a lioness — who dares to rouse him?
GEN.49.10	The scepter will not depart from Judah
GEN.49.10	or the staff from between his feet
GEN.49.10	until he whose right it is comes
GEN.49.10	and the obedience of the peoples belongs to him.
GEN.49.11	He ties his donkey to a vine,
GEN.49.11	and the colt of his donkey to the choice vine.
GEN.49.11	He washes his clothes in wine
GEN.49.11	and his robes in the blood of grapes.
GEN.49.12	His eyes are darker than wine,
GEN.49.12	and his teeth are whiter than milk.
GEN.49.13	Zebulun will live by the seashore
GEN.49.13	and will be a harbor for ships,
GEN.49.13	and his territory will be next to Sidon.
GEN.49.14	Issachar is a strong donkey
GEN.49.14	lying down between the saddlebags.
GEN.49.15	He saw that his resting place was good
GEN.49.15	and that the land was pleasant,
GEN.49.15	so he leaned his shoulder to bear a load
GEN.49.15	and became a forced laborer.
GEN.49.16	Dan will judge his people
GEN.49.16	as one of the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan will be a snake by the road,
GEN.49.17	a viper beside the path,
GEN.49.17	that bites the horse’s heels
GEN.49.17	so that its rider falls backward.
GEN.49.18	I wait for your salvation, 
GEN.49.19	Gad will be attacked by raiders,
GEN.49.19	but he will attack their heels.
GEN.49.20	Asher’s
GEN.49.20	and he will produce royal delicacies.
GEN.49.21	Naphtali is a doe set free
GEN.49.21	that bears beautiful fawns.
GEN.49.22	Joseph is a fruitful vine,
GEN.49.22	a fruitful vine beside a spring;
GEN.49.22	its branches
GEN.49.23	The archers attacked him,
GEN.49.23	shot at him, and were hostile toward him.
GEN.49.24	Yet his bow remained steady,
GEN.49.24	and his strong arms were made agile
GEN.49.24	by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,
GEN.49.24	by the name of
GEN.49.25	by the God of your father who helps you,
GEN.49.25	and by the Almighty who blesses you
GEN.49.25	with blessings of the heavens above,
GEN.49.25	blessings of the deep that lies below,
GEN.49.25	and blessings of the breasts and the womb.
GEN.49.26	The blessings of your father excel
GEN.49.26	the blessings of my ancestors
GEN.49.26	and
GEN.49.26	May they rest on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	on the brow of the prince of his brothers.
GEN.49.27	Benjamin is a wolf; he tears his prey.
GEN.49.27	In the morning he devours the prey,
GEN.49.27	and in the evening he divides the plunder.”
GEN.49.28	These are the tribes of Israel, twelve in all, and this is what their father said to them. He blessed them, and he blessed each one with a suitable blessing.
GEN.49.29	Then he commanded them: “I am about to be gathered to my people.
GEN.49.30	The cave is in the field of Machpelah near Mamre, in the land of Canaan. This is the field Abraham purchased from Ephron the Hethite as burial property.
GEN.49.31	Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried there,
GEN.49.32	The field and the cave in it were purchased from the Hethites.” 
GEN.49.33	When Jacob had finished giving charges to his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, took his last breath, and was gathered to his people.
GEN.50.1	Then Joseph, leaning over his father’s face, wept and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	He commanded his servants who were physicians to embalm his father. So they embalmed Israel. 
GEN.50.3	They took forty days to complete this, for embalming takes that long, and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
GEN.50.4	When the days of mourning were over, Joseph said to Pharaoh’s household, “If I have found favor with you, please tell
GEN.50.5	my father made me take an oath,
GEN.50.6	So Pharaoh said, “Go and bury your father in keeping with your oath.”
GEN.50.7	Then Joseph went to bury his father, and all Pharaoh’s servants, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt went with him, 
GEN.50.8	along with all Joseph’s family, his brothers, and his father’s family. Only their dependents, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	Horses and chariots went up with him; it was a very impressive procession. 
GEN.50.10	When they reached the threshing floor of Atad, which is across the Jordan, they lamented and wept loudly, and Joseph mourned seven days for his father. 
GEN.50.11	When the Canaanite inhabitants of the land saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a solemn mourning on the part of the Egyptians.” Therefore the place is named Abel-mizraim.
GEN.50.12	So Jacob’s sons did for him what he had commanded them. 
GEN.50.13	They carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave at Machpelah in the field near Mamre, which Abraham had purchased as burial property from Ephron the Hethite.
GEN.50.14	After Joseph buried his father, he returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone with him to bury his father.
GEN.50.15	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said to one another, “If Joseph is holding a grudge against us, he will certainly repay us for all the suffering we caused him.”
GEN.50.16	So they sent this message to Joseph, “Before he died your father gave a command: 
GEN.50.17	‘Say this to Joseph: Please forgive your brothers’ transgression and their sin — the suffering they caused you.’ Therefore, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” Joseph wept
GEN.50.18	His brothers also came to him, bowed down before him, and said, “We are your slaves!”
GEN.50.19	But Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Am I in the place of God?
GEN.50.20	You planned evil against me; God planned it for good to bring about the present result — the survival of many people.
GEN.50.21	Therefore don’t be afraid. I will take care of you and your children.”
GEN.50.22	Joseph and his father’s family remained in Egypt. Joseph lived 110 years. 
GEN.50.23	He saw Ephraim’s sons to the third generation;
GEN.50.24	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die,
GEN.50.25	So Joseph made the sons of Israel take an oath: “When God comes to your aid, you are to carry my bones up from here.”
GEN.50.26	Joseph died at the age of 110. They embalmed him and placed him in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	These are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his family:
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;
EXO.1.4	Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.
EXO.1.5	The total number of Jacob’s descendants
EXO.1.6	Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation eventually died.
EXO.1.7	But the Israelites were fruitful, increased rapidly, multiplied, and became extremely numerous
EXO.1.8	A new king, who did not know about Joseph, came to power in Egypt. 
EXO.1.9	He said to his people, “Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and powerful than we are.
EXO.1.10	Come, let’s deal shrewdly with them; otherwise they will multiply further, and when war breaks out, they will join our enemies, fight against us, and leave the country.”
EXO.1.11	So the Egyptians assigned taskmasters over the Israelites to oppress them with forced labor.
EXO.1.12	But the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread so that the Egyptians came to dread
EXO.1.13	They worked the Israelites ruthlessly
EXO.1.14	and made their lives bitter with difficult labor in brick and mortar and in all kinds of fieldwork. They ruthlessly imposed all this work on them.
EXO.1.15	The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives — the first whose name was Shiphrah and the second whose name was Puah —  
EXO.1.16	“When you help the Hebrew women give birth, observe them as they deliver. If the child is a son, kill him, but if it’s a daughter, she may live.” 
EXO.1.17	The midwives, however, feared God
EXO.1.18	So the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this and let the boys live?”
EXO.1.19	The midwives said to Pharaoh, “The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women, for they are vigorous and give birth before the midwife can get to them.”
EXO.1.20	So God was good to the midwives,
EXO.1.21	Since the midwives feared God, he gave them families.
EXO.1.22	Pharaoh then commanded all his people: “You must throw every son born to the Hebrews into the Nile, but let every daughter live.”
EXO.2.1	Now a man from the family of Levi married a Levite woman.
EXO.2.2	The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son; when she saw that he was beautiful,
EXO.2.3	But when she could no longer hide him, she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with asphalt and pitch. She placed the child in it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 
EXO.2.4	Then his sister
EXO.2.5	Pharaoh’s daughter went down to bathe at the Nile while her servant girls walked along the riverbank. She saw the basket among the reeds, sent her slave girl, took it, 
EXO.2.6	opened it, and saw him, the child — and there he was, a little boy, crying. She felt sorry for him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew boys.”
EXO.2.7	Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Should I go and call a Hebrew woman who is nursing to nurse the boy for you?”
EXO.2.8	“Go,” Pharaoh’s daughter told her. So the girl went and called the boy’s mother. 
EXO.2.9	Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child and nurse him for me, and I will pay your wages.” So the woman took the boy and nursed him. 
EXO.2.10	When the child grew older, she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses,
EXO.2.11	Years later,
EXO.2.12	Looking all around and seeing no one, he struck the Egyptian dead and hid him in the sand. 
EXO.2.13	The next day he went out and saw two Hebrews fighting. He asked the one in the wrong, “Why are you attacking your neighbor?” 
EXO.2.14	“Who made you a commander and judge over us?” the man replied. “Are you planning to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?”
EXO.2.14	Then Moses became afraid and thought, “What I did is certainly known.”
EXO.2.15	When Pharaoh heard about this, he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in the land of Midian,
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian
EXO.2.17	Then some shepherds arrived and drove them away, but Moses came to their rescue and watered their flock. 
EXO.2.18	When they returned to their father Reuel,
EXO.2.19	They answered, “An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds. He even drew water for us and watered the flock.”
EXO.2.20	“So where is he?” he asked his daughters. “Why then did you leave the man behind? Invite him to eat dinner.”
EXO.2.21	Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah
EXO.2.22	She gave birth to a son whom he named Gershom,
EXO.2.23	After a long time, the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned because of their difficult labor; and they cried out;
EXO.2.24	And God heard their groaning; and God remembered
EXO.2.25	and God saw the Israelites; and God knew.
EXO.3.1	Meanwhile, Moses was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Jethro,
EXO.3.2	Then the angel of the 
EXO.3.3	So Moses thought, “I must go over and look at this remarkable sight. Why isn’t the bush burning up?”
EXO.3.4	When the 
EXO.3.4	“Here I am,” he answered.
EXO.3.5	“Do not come closer,” he said. “Remove the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.”
EXO.3.6	Then he continued, “I am the God of your father,
EXO.3.7	Then the 
EXO.3.8	and I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and to bring them from that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey
EXO.3.9	So because the Israelites’ cry for help has come to me, and I have also seen the way the Egyptians are oppressing
EXO.3.10	therefore, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh so that you may lead my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt.”
EXO.3.11	But Moses asked God, “Who am I
EXO.3.12	He answered, “I will certainly be with you,
EXO.3.13	Then Moses asked God, “If I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what should I tell them?”
EXO.3.14	God replied to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.
EXO.3.15	God also said to Moses, “Say this to the Israelites: The 
EXO.3.16	“Go and assemble the elders of Israel and say to them: The 
EXO.3.17	And I have promised you that I will bring you up from the misery of Egypt
EXO.3.18	They will listen to what you say. Then you, along with the elders of Israel, must go to the king of Egypt and say to him: The 
EXO.3.19	“However, I know that the king of Egypt will not allow you to go, even under force from a strong hand.
EXO.3.20	But when I stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my miracles that I will perform in it, after that, he will let you go.
EXO.3.21	And I will give these people such favor with the Egyptians that when you go, you will not go empty-handed.
EXO.3.22	Each woman will ask her neighbor and any woman staying in her house for silver and gold jewelry, and clothing, and you will put them on your sons and daughters. So you will plunder the Egyptians.”
EXO.4.1	Moses answered, “What if they won’t believe me and will not obey me but say, ‘The 
EXO.4.2	The 
EXO.4.2	“A staff,” he replied.
EXO.4.3	“Throw it on the ground,” he said. So Moses threw it on the ground, it became a snake, and he ran from it. 
EXO.4.4	The 
EXO.4.5	“This will take place,” he continued, “so that they will believe that the 
EXO.4.6	In addition the 
EXO.4.7	“Put your hand back inside your cloak,” he said. So he put his hand back inside his cloak, and when he took it out, it had again become like the rest of his skin.
EXO.4.8	“If they will not believe you and will not respond to the evidence of the first sign, they may believe the evidence of the second sign. 
EXO.4.9	And if they don’t believe even these two signs or listen to what you say, take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you take from the Nile will become blood on the ground.”
EXO.4.10	But Moses replied to the 
EXO.4.11	The 
EXO.4.12	Now go! I will help you speak
EXO.4.13	Moses said, “Please, Lord, send someone else.”
EXO.4.14	Then the 
EXO.4.15	You will speak with him and tell him what to say.
EXO.4.16	He will speak to the people for you. He will serve as a mouth for you, and you will serve as God to him. 
EXO.4.17	And take this staff in your hand that you will perform the signs with.”
EXO.4.18	Then Moses went back to his father-in-law Jethro and said to him, “Please let me return to my relatives in Egypt and see if they are still living.”
EXO.4.18	Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”
EXO.4.19	Now in Midian the 
EXO.4.20	So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took God’s staff
EXO.4.21	The 
EXO.4.22	And you will say to Pharaoh: This is what the 
EXO.4.23	I told you: Let my son go so that he may worship me, but you refused to let him go. Look, I am about to kill your firstborn son!” 
EXO.4.24	On the trip, at an overnight campsite, it happened that the 
EXO.4.25	So Zipporah took a flint, cut off her son’s foreskin, threw it at Moses’s feet, and said, “You are a bridegroom of blood to me!” 
EXO.4.26	So he let him alone. At that time she said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” referring to the circumcision.
EXO.4.27	Now the 
EXO.4.28	Moses told Aaron everything the 
EXO.4.29	Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders of the Israelites. 
EXO.4.30	Aaron repeated everything the 
EXO.4.31	The people believed, and when they heard that the 
EXO.5.1	Later, Moses and Aaron went in and said to Pharaoh, “This is what the 
EXO.5.2	But Pharaoh responded, “Who is the 
EXO.5.3	They answered, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go on a three-day trip into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to the 
EXO.5.4	The king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why are you causing the people to neglect their work? Get to your labor!” 
EXO.5.5	Pharaoh also said, “Look, the people of the land are so numerous, and you would stop them from their labor.”
EXO.5.6	That day Pharaoh commanded the overseers
EXO.5.7	“Don’t continue to supply the people with straw for making bricks, as before. They must go and gather straw for themselves. 
EXO.5.8	But require the same quota of bricks from them as they were making before; do not reduce it. For they are slackers — that is why they are crying out,
EXO.5.9	Impose heavier work on the men. Then they will be occupied with it and not pay attention to deceptive words.”
EXO.5.10	So the overseers and foremen of the people went out and said to them, “This is what Pharaoh says:
EXO.5.11	Go get straw yourselves wherever you can find it, but there will be no reduction at all in your workload.’” 
EXO.5.12	So the people scattered throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw. 
EXO.5.13	The overseers insisted, “Finish your assigned work each day, just as you did when straw was provided.” 
EXO.5.14	Then the Israelite foremen, whom Pharaoh’s slave drivers had set over the people, were beaten
EXO.5.15	So the Israelite foremen went in and cried for help to Pharaoh: “Why are you treating your servants this way? 
EXO.5.16	No straw has been given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ Look, your servants are being beaten, but it is your own people who are at fault.”
EXO.5.17	But he said, “You are slackers. Slackers! That is why you are saying, ‘Let us go sacrifice to the 
EXO.5.18	Now get to work. No straw will be given to you, but you must produce the same quantity of bricks.”
EXO.5.19	The Israelite foremen saw that they were in trouble when they were told, “You cannot reduce your daily quota of bricks.” 
EXO.5.20	When they left Pharaoh, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who stood waiting to meet them.
EXO.5.21	“May the 
EXO.5.22	So Moses went back to the 
EXO.5.23	Ever since I went in to Pharaoh to speak in your name he has caused trouble for this people, and you haven’t rescued your people at all.”
EXO.6.1	But the 
EXO.6.2	Then God spoke to Moses, telling him, “I am the 
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty, but I was not known to them by my name ‘the 
EXO.6.4	I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land they lived in as aliens.
EXO.6.5	Furthermore, I have heard the groaning of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are forcing to work as slaves, and I have remembered
EXO.6.6	“Therefore tell the Israelites: I am the 
EXO.6.7	I will take you as my people,
EXO.6.8	I will bring you to the land that I swore
EXO.6.9	Moses told this to the Israelites, but they did not listen
EXO.6.10	Then the 
EXO.6.11	“Go and tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the Israelites go from his land.”
EXO.6.12	But Moses said in the 
EXO.6.13	Then the 
EXO.6.14	These are the heads of their fathers’ families:
EXO.6.14	The sons of Reuben,
EXO.6.14	Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi.
EXO.6.14	These are the clans of Reuben.
EXO.6.15	The sons of Simeon:
EXO.6.15	Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin,
EXO.6.15	Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.
EXO.6.15	These are the clans of Simeon.
EXO.6.16	These are the names of the sons of Levi
EXO.6.16	according to their family records;
EXO.6.16	Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
EXO.6.16	Levi lived 137 years.
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon:
EXO.6.17	Libni and Shimei, by their clans.
EXO.6.18	The sons of Kohath:
EXO.6.18	Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
EXO.6.18	Kohath lived 133 years.
EXO.6.19	The sons of Merari:
EXO.6.19	Mahli and Mushi.
EXO.6.19	These are the clans of the Levites
EXO.6.19	according to their family records.
EXO.6.20	Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed,
EXO.6.20	and she bore him Aaron and Moses.
EXO.6.20	Amram lived 137 years.
EXO.6.21	The sons of Izhar:
EXO.6.21	Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
EXO.6.22	The sons of Uzziel:
EXO.6.22	Mishael, Elzaphan,
EXO.6.23	Aaron married Elisheba,
EXO.6.23	daughter of Amminadab
EXO.6.23	She bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
EXO.6.24	The sons of Korah:
EXO.6.24	Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph.
EXO.6.24	These are the clans of the Korahites.
EXO.6.25	Aaron’s son Eleazar married
EXO.6.25	one of the daughters of Putiel,
EXO.6.25	and she bore him Phinehas.
EXO.6.25	These are the heads of the Levite families by their clans.
EXO.6.26	It was this Aaron and Moses whom the 
EXO.6.27	Moses and Aaron were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt in order to bring the Israelites out of Egypt.
EXO.6.28	On the day the 
EXO.6.29	he said to him, “I am the 
EXO.6.30	But Moses replied in the 
EXO.7.1	The 
EXO.7.2	You must say whatever I command you; then Aaron your brother must declare it to Pharaoh so that he will let the Israelites go from his land. 
EXO.7.3	But I will harden Pharaoh’s heart
EXO.7.4	Pharaoh will not listen to you, but I will put my hand into Egypt and bring the military divisions of my people the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment. 
EXO.7.5	The Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	So Moses and Aaron did this; they did just as the 
EXO.7.7	Moses was eighty years old
EXO.7.8	The 
EXO.7.9	“When Pharaoh tells you, ‘Perform a miracle,’ tell Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh. It will become a serpent.’”
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and did just as the 
EXO.7.11	But then Pharaoh called the wise men and sorcerers — the magicians
EXO.7.12	Each one threw down his staff, and it became a serpent. But Aaron’s staff swallowed their staffs. 
EXO.7.13	However, Pharaoh’s heart was hard,
EXO.7.14	Then the 
EXO.7.15	Go to Pharaoh in the morning. When you see him walking out to the water, stand ready to meet him by the bank of the Nile. Take in your hand the staff that turned into a snake.
EXO.7.16	Tell him: The 
EXO.7.17	This is what the 
EXO.7.18	The fish in the Nile will die, the river will stink, and the Egyptians will be unable to drink water from it.”
EXO.7.19	So the 
EXO.7.20	Moses and Aaron did just as the 
EXO.7.21	The fish in the Nile died, and the river smelled so bad the Egyptians could not drink water from it. There was blood throughout the land of Egypt.
EXO.7.22	But the magicians of Egypt did the same thing by their occult practices. So Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he would not listen to them, as the 
EXO.7.23	Pharaoh turned around, went into his palace, and didn’t take even this to heart. 
EXO.7.24	All the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink because they could not drink the water from the river. 
EXO.7.25	Seven days passed after the 
EXO.8.1	Then the 
EXO.8.2	But if you refuse to let them go, then I will plague all your territory with frogs.
EXO.8.3	The Nile will swarm with frogs; they will come up and go into your palace, into your bedroom and on your bed, into the houses of your officials and your people, and into your ovens and kneading bowls. 
EXO.8.4	The frogs will come up on you, your people, and all your officials.”
EXO.8.5	The 
EXO.8.6	When Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, the frogs
EXO.8.7	But the magicians did the same thing by their occult practices and brought frogs up onto the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Appeal
EXO.8.9	Moses said to Pharaoh, “You may have the honor of choosing. When should I appeal on behalf of you, your officials, and your people, that the frogs be taken away from you and your houses, and remain only in the Nile?”
EXO.8.10	“Tomorrow,” he answered.
EXO.8.10	Moses replied, “As you have said, so that you may know there is no one like the 
EXO.8.11	the frogs will go away from you, your houses, your officials, and your people. The frogs will remain only in the Nile.” 
EXO.8.12	After Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, Moses cried out to the 
EXO.8.13	The 
EXO.8.14	They piled them in countless heaps, and there was a terrible odor in the land. 
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw there was relief, he hardened his heart
EXO.8.16	Then the 
EXO.8.17	And they did this. Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff, and when he struck the dust of the land, gnats were on people and animals. All the dust of the land became gnats throughout the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.18	The magicians tried to produce gnats using their occult practices, but they could not. The gnats remained on people and animals.
EXO.8.19	“This is the finger of God,”
EXO.8.20	The 
EXO.8.21	But if you will not let my people go, then I will send swarms of flies
EXO.8.22	But on that day I will give special treatment to the land of Goshen, where my people are living;
EXO.8.23	I will make a distinction
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, “Go sacrifice to your God within the country.”
EXO.8.26	But Moses said, “It would not be right
EXO.8.27	We must go a distance of three days into the wilderness and sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.28	Pharaoh responded, “I will let you go and sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.29	“As soon as I leave you,” Moses said, “I will appeal to the 
EXO.8.30	Then Moses left Pharaoh’s presence and appealed to the 
EXO.8.31	The 
EXO.8.32	But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also and did not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	But if you refuse to let them go and keep holding them, 
EXO.9.3	then the 
EXO.9.4	But the 
EXO.9.5	And the 
EXO.9.6	The 
EXO.9.7	Pharaoh sent messengers who saw that not a single one of the Israelite livestock was dead. But Pharaoh’s heart was hard,
EXO.9.8	Then the 
EXO.9.9	It will become fine dust over the entire land of Egypt. It will become festering boils
EXO.9.10	So they took furnace soot and stood before Pharaoh. Moses threw it toward heaven, and it became festering boils on people and animals. 
EXO.9.11	The magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians.
EXO.9.12	But the 
EXO.9.13	Then the 
EXO.9.14	For this time I am about to send all my plagues against you,
EXO.9.15	By now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague, and you would have been obliterated from the earth.
EXO.9.16	However, I have let you live for this purpose: to show you my power
EXO.9.17	You are still acting arrogantly against
EXO.9.18	Tomorrow at this time I will rain down the worst hail
EXO.9.19	Therefore give orders to bring your livestock and all that you have in the field into shelters. Every person and animal that is in the field and not brought inside will die when the hail falls on them.” 
EXO.9.20	Those among Pharaoh’s officials who feared the word of the 
EXO.9.21	but those who didn’t take to heart the 
EXO.9.22	Then the 
EXO.9.23	So Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, and the 
EXO.9.24	The hail, with lightning flashing through it, was so severe that nothing like it had occurred in the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. 
EXO.9.25	Throughout the land of Egypt, the hail struck down everything in the field, both people and animals. The hail beat down every plant of the field and shattered every tree in the field. 
EXO.9.26	The only place it didn’t hail was in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were.
EXO.9.27	Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron. “I have sinned this time,” he said to them. “The 
EXO.9.28	Make an appeal to the 
EXO.9.29	Moses said to him, “When I have left the city, I will spread out my hands
EXO.9.30	But as for you and your officials, I know that you still do not fear the 
EXO.9.31	The flax and the barley were destroyed because the barley was ripe
EXO.9.32	but the wheat and the spelt were not destroyed since they are later crops.
EXO.9.33	Moses left Pharaoh and the city, and spread out his hands to the 
EXO.9.34	When Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, he and his officials. 
EXO.9.35	So Pharaoh’s heart was hard, and he did not let the Israelites go, as the 
EXO.10.1	Then the 
EXO.10.2	and so that you may tell
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and told him, “This is what the 
EXO.10.4	But if you refuse to let my people go, then tomorrow I will bring locusts
EXO.10.5	They will cover the surface of the land so that no one will be able to see the land. They will eat the remainder left
EXO.10.6	They will fill your houses, all your officials’ houses, and the houses of all the Egyptians — something your fathers and grandfathers never saw since the time they occupied the land until today.” Then he turned and left Pharaoh’s presence.
EXO.10.7	Pharaoh’s officials asked him, “How long must this man be a snare
EXO.10.8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. “Go, worship the 
EXO.10.9	Moses replied, “We will go with our young and with our old; we will go with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds because we must hold the 
EXO.10.10	He said to them, “The Lord would have to be with you if I would ever let you and your families go! Look out — you’re heading for trouble. 
EXO.10.11	No, go — just able-bodied men — worship the 
EXO.10.12	The 
EXO.10.13	So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	The locusts went up over the entire land of Egypt and settled on the whole territory of Egypt. Never before had there been such a large number of locusts, and there never will be again.
EXO.10.15	They covered the surface of the whole land so that the land was black, and they consumed all the plants on the ground and all the fruit on the trees that the hail had left. Nothing green was left on the trees or the plants in the field throughout the land of Egypt.
EXO.10.16	Pharaoh urgently sent for Moses and Aaron and said, “I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Please forgive my sin once more and make an appeal to the 
EXO.10.18	Moses left Pharaoh’s presence and appealed to the 
EXO.10.19	Then the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	Then the 
EXO.10.22	So Moses stretched out his hand toward heaven, and there was thick darkness throughout the land of Egypt for three days. 
EXO.10.23	One person could not see another, and for three days they did not move from where they were. Yet all the Israelites had light where they lived.
EXO.10.24	Pharaoh summoned Moses and said, “Go, worship the 
EXO.10.25	Moses responded, “You must also let us have
EXO.10.26	Even our livestock must go with us; not a hoof will be left behind because we will take some of them to worship the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	Pharaoh said to him, “Leave me! Make sure you never see my face again, for on the day you see my face, you will die.”
EXO.10.29	“As you have said,” Moses replied, “I will never see your face again.”
EXO.11.1	The 
EXO.11.2	Now announce to the people that both men and women should ask their neighbors for silver and gold items.” 
EXO.11.3	The 
EXO.11.4	So Moses said, “This is what the 
EXO.11.5	and every firstborn male in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the servant girl who is at the grindstones, as well as every firstborn of the livestock. 
EXO.11.6	Then there will be a great cry of anguish through all the land of Egypt such as never was before or ever will be again. 
EXO.11.7	But against all the Israelites, whether people or animals, not even a dog will snarl,
EXO.11.8	All these officials of yours will come down to me and bow before me, saying: Get out, you and all the people who follow you.
EXO.11.9	The 
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the 
EXO.12.1	The 
EXO.12.2	“This month is to be the beginning of months for you; it is the first month of your year.
EXO.12.3	Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month they must each select an animal of the flock according to their fathers’ families, one animal per family. 
EXO.12.4	If the household is too small for a whole animal, that person and the neighbor nearest his house are to select one based on the combined number of people; you should apportion the animal according to what each will eat. 
EXO.12.5	You must have an unblemished
EXO.12.6	You are to keep it until the fourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembly of the community of Israel will slaughter the animals at twilight.
EXO.12.7	They must take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses where they eat them. 
EXO.12.8	They are to eat the meat that night; they should eat it, roasted over the fire along with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
EXO.12.9	Do not eat any of it raw or cooked in boiling
EXO.12.10	You must not leave any of it until morning;
EXO.12.11	Here is how you must eat it: You must be dressed for travel,
EXO.12.12	“I will pass through
EXO.12.13	The blood on the houses where you are staying will be a distinguishing mark for you; when I see the blood, I will pass over you. No plague will be among you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
EXO.12.14	“This day is to be a memorial for you, and you must celebrate it as a festival to the 
EXO.12.15	You must eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the first day you must remove yeast
EXO.12.16	You are to hold a sacred assembly
EXO.12.17	“You are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread because on this very day I brought your military divisions out of the land of Egypt.
EXO.12.18	You are to eat unleavened bread in the first month,
EXO.12.19	Yeast must not be found in your houses for seven days. If anyone eats something leavened, that person, whether a resident alien or native of the land, must be cut off from the community of Israel. 
EXO.12.20	Do not eat anything leavened; eat unleavened bread in all your homes.”
EXO.12.21	Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, select an animal from the flock according to your families, and slaughter the Passover animal.
EXO.12.22	Take a cluster of hyssop, dip it in the blood
EXO.12.23	When the 
EXO.12.24	“Keep this command permanently as a statute for you and your descendants. 
EXO.12.25	When you enter the land that the 
EXO.12.26	When your children
EXO.12.27	you are to reply, ‘It is the Passover sacrifice
EXO.12.28	Then the Israelites went and did this; they did just as the 
EXO.12.29	Now at midnight the 
EXO.12.30	During the night Pharaoh got up, he along with all his officials and all the Egyptians, and there was a loud wailing
EXO.12.31	He summoned Moses and Aaron during the night and said, “Get out immediately from among my people, both you and the Israelites, and go, worship the 
EXO.12.32	Take even your flocks and your herds as you asked and leave, and also bless me.”
EXO.12.33	Now the Egyptians pressured the people in order to send them quickly out of the country, for they said, “We’re all going to die!” 
EXO.12.34	So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their clothes on their shoulders.
EXO.12.35	The Israelites acted on Moses’s word and asked the Egyptians for silver and gold items and for clothing.
EXO.12.36	And the 
EXO.12.37	The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth,
EXO.12.38	A mixed crowd also went up with them, along with a huge number of livestock, both flocks and herds. 
EXO.12.39	The people baked the dough they had brought out of Egypt into unleavened loaves, since it had no yeast; for when they were driven
EXO.12.40	The time that the Israelites lived in Egypt
EXO.12.41	At the end of 430 years, on that same day, all the 
EXO.12.42	It was a night of vigil in honor of the 
EXO.12.43	The 
EXO.12.44	But any slave a man has purchased may eat it, after you have circumcised him. 
EXO.12.45	A temporary resident or hired worker may not eat the Passover.
EXO.12.46	It is to be eaten in one house. You may not take any of the meat outside the house, and you may not break any of its bones.
EXO.12.47	The whole community of Israel must celebrate
EXO.12.48	If an alien resides among you and wants to observe the 
EXO.12.49	The same law will apply to both the native and the alien
EXO.12.50	Then all the Israelites did this; they did just as the 
EXO.12.51	On that same day the 
EXO.13.1	The 
EXO.13.2	“Consecrate every firstborn male
EXO.13.3	Then Moses said to the people, “Remember this day when you came out of Egypt, out of the place of slavery, for the 
EXO.13.4	Today, in the month of Abib,
EXO.13.5	When the 
EXO.13.6	For seven days you must eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there is to be a festival to the 
EXO.13.7	Unleavened bread is to be eaten for those seven days. Nothing leavened may be found among you, and no yeast may be found among you in all your territory. 
EXO.13.8	On that day explain to your son, ‘This is because of what the 
EXO.13.9	Let it serve as a sign for you on your hand and as a reminder on your forehead,
EXO.13.10	Keep this statute at its appointed time from year to year.
EXO.13.11	“When the 
EXO.13.12	you are to present to the 
EXO.13.13	You must redeem every firstborn of a donkey with a flock animal, but if you do not redeem it, break its neck. However, you must redeem every firstborn among your sons.
EXO.13.14	“In the future, when your son
EXO.13.15	When Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the 
EXO.13.16	So let it be a sign on your hand and a symbol
EXO.13.17	When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them along the road to the land of the Philistines, even though it was nearby; for God said, “The people will change their minds and return to Egypt if they face war.”
EXO.13.18	So he led the people around toward the Red Sea along the road of the wilderness. And the Israelites left the land of Egypt in battle formation.
EXO.13.19	Moses took the bones of Joseph
EXO.13.20	They set out from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness. 
EXO.13.21	The 
EXO.13.22	The pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night never left its place in front of the people.
EXO.14.1	Then the 
EXO.14.2	“Tell the Israelites to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you must camp in front of Baal-zephon, facing it by the sea.
EXO.14.3	Pharaoh will say of the Israelites: They are wandering around the land in confusion; the wilderness has boxed them in. 
EXO.14.4	I will harden Pharaoh’s heart so that he will pursue them. Then I will receive glory by means of Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.14.5	When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about the people and said: “What have we done? We have released Israel from serving us.” 
EXO.14.6	So he got his chariot ready and took his troops
EXO.14.7	he took six hundred of the best chariots and all the rest of the chariots of Egypt, with officers in each one. 
EXO.14.8	The 
EXO.14.9	The Egyptians — all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, his horsemen,
EXO.14.10	As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and there were the Egyptians coming after them! The Israelites were terrified and cried out
EXO.14.11	They said to Moses: “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? 
EXO.14.12	Isn’t this what we told you in Egypt: Leave us alone so that we may serve the Egyptians? It would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness.”
EXO.14.13	But Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid. Stand firm and see
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	The 
EXO.14.16	As for you, lift up your staff, stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it so that the Israelites can go through the sea on dry ground.
EXO.14.17	As for me, I am going to harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in after them, and I will receive glory by means of Pharaoh, all his army, and his chariots and horsemen. 
EXO.14.18	The Egyptians will know that I am the 
EXO.14.19	Then the angel of God,
EXO.14.20	It came between the Egyptian and Israelite forces. There was cloud and darkness, it lit up the night, and neither group came near the other all night long.
EXO.14.21	Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea. The 
EXO.14.22	and the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with the waters like a wall to them on their right and their left.
EXO.14.23	The Egyptians set out in pursuit — all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen — and went into the sea after them. 
EXO.14.24	During the morning watch, the 
EXO.14.25	He caused their chariot wheels to swerve
EXO.14.26	Then the 
EXO.14.27	So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and at daybreak the sea returned to its normal depth. While the Egyptians were trying to escape from it, the 
EXO.14.28	The water came back and covered the chariots
EXO.14.29	But the Israelites had walked through the sea on dry ground, with the waters like a wall to them on their right and their left. 
EXO.14.30	That day the 
EXO.14.31	When Israel saw the great power that the 
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the 
EXO.15.1	I will sing to the 
EXO.15.1	for he is highly exalted;
EXO.15.1	he has thrown the horse
EXO.15.1	and its rider into the sea.
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.2	he has become my salvation.
EXO.15.2	This is my God, and I will praise him,
EXO.15.2	my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.3	the 
EXO.15.4	He threw Pharaoh’s chariots
EXO.15.4	and his army into the sea;
EXO.15.4	the elite of his officers
EXO.15.4	were drowned in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The floods covered them;
EXO.15.5	they sank to the depths like a stone.
EXO.15.7	You overthrew your adversaries
EXO.15.7	by your great majesty.
EXO.15.7	You unleashed your burning wrath;
EXO.15.7	it consumed them like stubble.
EXO.15.8	The water heaped up
EXO.15.8	the currents stood firm like a dam.
EXO.15.8	The watery depths congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said:
EXO.15.9	“I will pursue, I will overtake,
EXO.15.9	I will divide the spoil.
EXO.15.9	My desire will be gratified at their expense.
EXO.15.9	I will draw my sword;
EXO.15.9	my hand will destroy
EXO.15.10	But you blew with your breath,
EXO.15.10	and the sea covered them.
EXO.15.10	They sank like lead
EXO.15.10	in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	Who is like you, glorious in holiness,
EXO.15.11	revered with praises, performing wonders?
EXO.15.12	You stretched out your right hand,
EXO.15.12	and the earth swallowed them.
EXO.15.13	With your faithful love,
EXO.15.13	you will lead the people
EXO.15.13	you have redeemed;
EXO.15.13	you will guide them to your holy dwelling
EXO.15.13	with your strength.
EXO.15.14	When the peoples hear, they will shudder;
EXO.15.14	anguish will seize the inhabitants of Philistia.
EXO.15.15	Then the chiefs of Edom will be terrified;
EXO.15.15	trembling will seize the leaders of Moab;
EXO.15.15	all the inhabitants of Canaan will panic;
EXO.15.16	terror
EXO.15.16	They will be as still
EXO.15.16	because of your powerful arm
EXO.15.16	until your people pass by, 
EXO.15.16	until the people whom you purchased
EXO.15.17	You will bring them in and plant them
EXO.15.17	on the mountain of your possession;
EXO.15.17	for your dwelling;
EXO.15.17	Lord,
EXO.15.18	The 
EXO.15.19	When Pharaoh’s horses with his chariots and horsemen went into the sea, the 
EXO.15.20	Then the prophetess Miriam,
EXO.15.21	Miriam sang to them:
EXO.15.21	Sing to the 
EXO.15.21	for he is highly exalted;
EXO.15.21	he has thrown the horse
EXO.15.21	and its rider into the sea.
EXO.15.22	Then Moses led Israel on from the Red Sea, and they went out to the Wilderness of Shur. They journeyed for three days in the wilderness without finding water. 
EXO.15.23	They came to Marah, but they could not drink the water at Marah because it was bitter — that is why it was named Marah.
EXO.15.24	The people grumbled to Moses, “What are we going to drink?” 
EXO.15.25	So he cried out to the 
EXO.15.25	The 
EXO.15.26	He said, “If you will carefully obey the 
EXO.15.27	Then they came to Elim, where there were twelve springs and seventy date palms, and they camped there by the water.
EXO.16.1	The entire Israelite community departed from Elim and came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left the land of Egypt.
EXO.16.2	The entire Israelite community grumbled
EXO.16.3	The Israelites said to them, “If only we had died by the 
EXO.16.4	Then the 
EXO.16.5	On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be twice as much as they gather on other days.”
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites: “This evening you will know that it was the 
EXO.16.7	and in the morning you will see the 
EXO.16.8	Moses continued, “The 
EXO.16.9	Then Moses told Aaron, “Say to the entire Israelite community, ‘Come before the 
EXO.16.10	As Aaron was speaking to the entire Israelite community, they turned toward the wilderness, and there in a cloud the 
EXO.16.11	The 
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them: At twilight you will eat meat, and in the morning you will eat bread until you are full. Then you will know that I am the 
EXO.16.13	So at evening quail
EXO.16.14	When the layer of dew evaporated, there were fine flakes on the desert surface, as fine as frost on the ground. 
EXO.16.15	When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another, “What is it?” because they didn’t know what it was.
EXO.16.15	Moses told them, “It is the bread the 
EXO.16.16	This is what the 
EXO.16.17	So the Israelites did this. Some gathered a lot, some a little. 
EXO.16.18	When they measured it by quarts,
EXO.16.19	Moses said to them, “No one is to let any of it remain until morning.” 
EXO.16.20	But they didn’t listen to Moses; some people left part of it until morning, and it bred worms and stank. Therefore Moses was angry with them.
EXO.16.21	They gathered it every morning. Each gathered as much as he needed to eat, but when the sun grew hot, it melted. 
EXO.16.22	On the sixth day they gathered twice as much food, four quarts
EXO.16.23	He told them, “This is what the 
EXO.16.24	So they set it aside until morning as Moses commanded, and it didn’t stink or have maggots in it. 
EXO.16.25	“Eat it today,” Moses said, “because today is a Sabbath to the 
EXO.16.26	For six days you will gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none.”
EXO.16.27	Yet on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they did not find any. 
EXO.16.28	Then the 
EXO.16.29	Understand that the 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	The house of Israel named the substance manna.
EXO.16.32	Moses said, “This is what the 
EXO.16.33	Moses told Aaron, “Take a container and put two quarts
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	The Israelites ate manna for forty years, until they came to an inhabited land. They ate manna until they reached the border of the land of Canaan.
EXO.16.36	(They used a measure called an omer, which held two quarts.
EXO.17.1	The entire Israelite community left the Wilderness of Sin, moving from one place to the next according to the 
EXO.17.2	So the people complained to Moses, “Give us water to drink.”
EXO.17.2	“Why are you complaining to me?” Moses replied to them. “Why are you testing
EXO.17.3	But the people thirsted there for water and grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you ever bring us up from Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” 
EXO.17.4	Then Moses cried out to the 
EXO.17.5	The 
EXO.17.6	I am going to stand there in front of you on the rock at Horeb; when you hit the rock, water
EXO.17.7	He named the place Massah
EXO.17.8	At Rephidim, Amalek
EXO.17.9	Moses said to Joshua,
EXO.17.10	Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought against Amalek, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	While Moses held up his hand,
EXO.17.12	When Moses’s hands grew heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat down on it. Then Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other so that his hands remained steady until the sun went down. 
EXO.17.13	So Joshua defeated Amalek and his army
EXO.17.14	The 
EXO.17.15	And Moses built an altar
EXO.17.16	He said, “Indeed, my hand is lifted up toward
EXO.18.1	Moses’s father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian,
EXO.18.2	Now Jethro, Moses’s father-in-law, had taken in Zipporah,
EXO.18.3	along with her two sons, one of whom was named Gershom
EXO.18.4	and the other Eliezer (because he had said, “The God of my father was my helper and rescued me from Pharaoh’s sword”).
EXO.18.5	Moses’s father-in-law Jethro, along with Moses’s wife and sons, came to him in the wilderness where he was camped at the mountain of God.
EXO.18.6	He sent word to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”
EXO.18.7	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, bowed down,
EXO.18.8	Moses recounted to his father-in-law all that the 
EXO.18.9	Jethro rejoiced over all the good things the

EXO.18.12	Then Jethro, Moses’s father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’s father-in-law in God’s presence.
EXO.18.13	The next day Moses sat down to judge the people, and they stood around Moses from morning until evening. 
EXO.18.14	When Moses’s father-in-law saw everything he was doing for them he asked, “What is this thing you’re doing for the people? Why are you alone sitting as judge, while all the people stand around you from morning until evening?”
EXO.18.15	Moses replied to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God. 
EXO.18.16	Whenever they have a dispute, it comes to me, and I make a decision between one man and another. I teach them God’s statutes and laws.”
EXO.18.17	“What you’re doing is not good,” Moses’s father-in-law said to him. 
EXO.18.18	“You will certainly wear out both yourself and these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you. You can’t do it alone.
EXO.18.19	Now listen to me; I will give you some advice, and God be with you. You be the one to represent the people before God and bring their cases to him. 
EXO.18.20	Instruct them about the statutes and laws, and teach them the way to live and what they must do.
EXO.18.21	But you should select from all the people able men, God-fearing, trustworthy, and hating dishonest profit.
EXO.18.22	They should judge the people at all times. Then they can bring you every major case but judge every minor case themselves. In this way you will lighten your load,
EXO.18.23	If you do this, and God so directs you, you will be able to endure, and also all these people will be able to go home satisfied.”
EXO.18.24	Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 
EXO.18.25	So Moses chose able men from all Israel and made them leaders over the people as commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 
EXO.18.26	They judged the people at all times; they would bring the hard cases to Moses, but they would judge every minor case themselves.
EXO.18.27	Moses let his father-in-law go, and he journeyed to his own land.
EXO.19.1	In the third month from the very day the Israelites left the land of Egypt, they came to the Sinai Wilderness. 
EXO.19.2	They traveled from Rephidim, came to the Sinai Wilderness, and camped in the wilderness. Israel camped there in front of the mountain.
EXO.19.3	Moses went up the mountain to God, and the 
EXO.19.4	‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself.
EXO.19.5	Now if you will carefully listen to me and keep my covenant,
EXO.19.6	and you will be my kingdom of priests and my holy nation.’
EXO.19.7	After Moses came back, he summoned the elders of the people and set before them all these words that the 
EXO.19.8	Then all the people responded together, “We will do all that the 
EXO.19.9	The

EXO.19.13	No hand may touch him;
EXO.19.14	Then Moses came down from the mountain to the people and consecrated them, and they washed their clothes. 
EXO.19.15	He said to the people, “Be prepared by the third day. Do not have sexual relations with women.”
EXO.19.16	On the third day, when morning came, there was thunder and lightning, a thick cloud on the mountain, and a very loud trumpet sound, so that all the people in the camp shuddered. 
EXO.19.17	Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke because the 
EXO.19.19	As the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him in the thunder.

EXO.20.17	Do not covet your neighbor’s house. Do not covet your neighbor’s wife, his male or female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
EXO.20.18	All the people witnessed
EXO.20.19	“You speak to us, and we will listen,” they said to Moses, “but don’t let God speak to us, or we will die.”
EXO.20.20	Moses responded to the people, “Don’t be afraid, for God has come to test you, so that you will fear him and will not

EXO.20.25	If you make a stone altar for me, do not build it out of cut stones. If you use your chisel on it, you will defile it.

EXO.31.18	When he finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets inscribed by the finger of God.
EXO.32.1	When the people saw that Moses delayed in coming down from the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and said to him, “Come, make gods
EXO.32.2	Aaron replied to them, “Take off the gold rings
EXO.32.3	So all the people took off the gold rings that were on their ears and brought them to Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	He took the gold from them, fashioned it with an engraving tool, and made it into an image of a calf.
EXO.32.4	Then they said, “Israel, these are your gods,
EXO.32.5	When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of it and made an announcement: “There will be a festival
EXO.32.6	Early the next morning they arose, offered burnt offerings, and presented fellowship offerings. The people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to party.
EXO.32.7	The 
EXO.32.8	They have quickly turned from the way I commanded them; they have made for themselves an image of a calf. They have bowed down to it, sacrificed to it, and said, ‘Israel, these are your gods, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.’”
EXO.32.9	The 
EXO.32.10	Now leave me alone, so that my anger can burn against them and I can destroy them. Then I will make you into a great nation.”
EXO.32.11	But Moses sought the favor of the 
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians say, ‘He brought them out with an evil intent to kill them in the mountains and eliminate them from the face of the earth’? Turn from your fierce anger and relent concerning this disaster planned for your people.
EXO.32.13	Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Israel — you swore to them by yourself
EXO.32.14	So the 
EXO.32.15	Then Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands. They were inscribed on both sides — inscribed front and back. 
EXO.32.16	The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was God’s writing, engraved on the tablets.
EXO.32.17	When Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a sound of war in the camp.”
EXO.32.18	But Moses replied:
EXO.32.18	It’s not the sound of a victory cry
EXO.32.18	and not the sound of a cry of defeat;
EXO.32.18	I hear the sound of singing!
EXO.32.19	As he approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, Moses became enraged and threw the tablets out of his hands, smashing them at the base of the mountain. 
EXO.32.20	He took the calf they had made, burned it up, and ground it to powder. He scattered the powder over the surface of the water and forced the Israelites to drink the water.
EXO.32.21	Then Moses asked Aaron, “What did these people do to you that you have led them into such a grave sin?”
EXO.32.22	“Don’t be enraged, my lord,” Aaron replied. “You yourself know that the people are intent on evil.
EXO.32.23	They said to me, ‘Make gods for us who will go before us because this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt — we don’t know what has happened to him!’ 
EXO.32.24	So I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off,’ and they gave it to me. When I threw it into the fire, out came this calf!”
EXO.32.25	Moses saw that the people were out of control, for Aaron had let them get out of control, making them a laughingstock to their enemies.
EXO.32.26	And Moses stood at the camp’s entrance and said, “Whoever is for the 
EXO.32.27	He told them, “This is what the 
EXO.32.28	The Levites did as Moses commanded, and about three thousand men fell dead that day among the people. 
EXO.32.29	Afterward Moses said, “Today you have been dedicated
EXO.32.30	The following day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a grave sin. Now I will go up to the 
EXO.32.31	So Moses returned to the 
EXO.32.32	Now if you would only forgive their sin. But if not, please erase me from the book you have written.”
EXO.32.33	The 
EXO.32.34	Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about; see, my angel will go before you. But on the day I settle accounts, I will hold them accountable for their sin.”
EXO.32.35	And the 
EXO.33.1	The 
EXO.33.2	I will send an angel ahead of you and will drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hethites, Perizzites,
EXO.33.3	Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey. But I will not go up with you because you are a stiff-necked people; otherwise, I might destroy you on the way.”
EXO.33.4	When the people heard this bad news, they mourned and didn’t put on their jewelry.
EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	So the Israelites remained stripped of their jewelry from Mount Horeb onward.
EXO.33.7	Now Moses took a tent and pitched it outside the camp, at a distance from the camp; he called it the tent of meeting. Anyone who wanted to consult the 
EXO.33.8	Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would stand up, each one at the door of his tent, and they would watch Moses until he entered the tent. 
EXO.33.9	When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and remain at the entrance to the tent, and the 
EXO.33.10	As all the people saw the pillar of cloud remaining at the entrance to the tent, they would stand up, then bow in worship, each one at the door of his tent. 
EXO.33.11	The 
EXO.33.12	Moses said to the 
EXO.33.13	Now if I have indeed found favor with you, please teach me your ways,
EXO.33.14	And he replied, “My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest.”
EXO.33.15	“If your presence does not go,” Moses responded to him, “don’t make us go up from here. 
EXO.33.16	How will it be known that I and your people have found favor with you unless you go with us? I and your people will be distinguished by this from all the other people on the face of the earth.”
EXO.33.17	The 
EXO.33.18	Then Moses said, “Please, let me see your glory.”
EXO.33.19	He said, “I will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you, and I will proclaim the name ‘the 
EXO.33.20	But he added, “You cannot see my face, for humans cannot see
EXO.33.21	The 
EXO.33.22	and when my glory passes by, I will put you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
EXO.33.23	Then I will take my hand away, and you will see my back, but my face will not be seen.”
EXO.34.1	The 
EXO.34.2	Be prepared by morning. Come up Mount Sinai in the morning and stand before me on the mountaintop. 
EXO.34.3	No one may go up with you; in fact, no one should be seen anywhere on the mountain. Even the flocks and herds are not to graze in front of that mountain.”
EXO.34.4	Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones. He got up early in the morning, and taking the two stone tablets in his hand, he climbed Mount Sinai, just as the

EXO.34.7	maintaining faithful love to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity, rebellion, and sin.
EXO.34.8	Moses immediately knelt low on the ground and worshiped. 
EXO.34.9	Then he said, “My Lord, if I have indeed found favor with you, my Lord, please go with us (even though this is a stiff-necked people), forgive our iniquity and our sin, and accept us as your own possession.”
EXO.34.10	And the 
EXO.34.11	Observe what I command you today. I am going to drive out before you the Amorites, Canaanites, Hethites, Perizzites, Hivites,
EXO.34.12	Be careful not to make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land that you are going to enter; otherwise, they will become a snare among you.
EXO.34.13	Instead, you must tear down their altars, smash their sacred pillars, and chop down their Asherah poles.
EXO.34.14	Because the 
EXO.34.15	“Do not make a treaty with the inhabitants of the land, or else when they prostitute themselves with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, they will invite you, and you will eat their sacrifices.
EXO.34.16	Then you will take some of their daughters as brides for your sons. Their daughters will prostitute themselves with their gods and cause your sons to prostitute themselves with their gods.
EXO.34.17	“Do not make cast images

EXO.34.27	The 
EXO.34.28	Moses was there with the 
EXO.34.29	As Moses descended from Mount Sinai — with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands as he descended the mountain — he did not realize that the skin of his face shone as a result of his speaking with the 
EXO.34.30	When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face shone!
EXO.34.31	But Moses called out to them, so Aaron and all the leaders of the community returned to him, and Moses spoke to them. 
EXO.34.32	Afterward all the Israelites came near, and he commanded them to do everything the 
EXO.34.33	When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. 
EXO.34.34	But whenever Moses went before the 
EXO.34.35	and the Israelites would see that Moses’s face
EXO.35.1	Moses assembled the entire Israelite community and said to them, “These are the things that the

EXO.35.21	Everyone whose heart was moved and whose spirit prompted him came and brought an offering to the 
EXO.35.22	Both men and women came; all who had willing hearts brought brooches, earrings, rings, necklaces, and all kinds of gold jewelry — everyone who presented a presentation offering of gold to the 
EXO.35.23	Everyone who possessed blue, purple, or scarlet yarn,
EXO.35.24	Everyone making an offering of silver or bronze brought it as a contribution to the

EXO.35.27	The leaders
EXO.35.28	as well as the spice
EXO.35.29	So the Israelites brought a freewill offering to the 
EXO.35.30	Moses
EXO.35.31	He has filled him with God’s Spirit, with wisdom, understanding, and ability in every kind of craft 
EXO.35.32	to design artistic works in gold, silver, and bronze, 
EXO.35.33	to cut gemstones for mounting, and to carve wood for work in every kind of artistic craft. 
EXO.35.34	He has also given
EXO.35.35	He has filled them with skill
EXO.36.1	Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the skilled
EXO.36.2	So Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person in whose heart the 
EXO.36.3	They took from Moses’s presence all the contributions that the Israelites had brought for the task of making the sanctuary. Meanwhile, the people continued to bring freewill offerings morning after morning.
EXO.36.4	Then all the artisans who were doing all the work for the sanctuary came one by one from the work they were doing 
EXO.36.5	and said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than is needed
EXO.36.6	After Moses gave an order, they sent a proclamation throughout the camp: “Let no man or woman make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.” So the people stopped. 
EXO.36.7	The materials were sufficient for them to do all the work. There was more than enough.
EXO.36.8	All
EXO.36.9	Each curtain was forty-two feet
EXO.36.10	He joined five of the curtains to each other, and the other five curtains he joined to each other. 
EXO.36.11	He made loops of blue yarn on the edge of the last curtain in the first set and did the same on the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set. 
EXO.36.12	He made fifty loops on the one curtain and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain in the second set, so that the loops lined up with each other. 
EXO.36.13	He also made fifty gold clasps and joined the curtains to each other, so that the tabernacle became a single unit.
EXO.36.14	He made curtains of goat hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven of them. 
EXO.36.15	Each curtain was forty-five feet
EXO.36.16	He joined five of the curtains together, and the other six together. 
EXO.36.17	He made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set and fifty loops on the edge of the corresponding curtain in the second set. 
EXO.36.18	He made fifty bronze clasps to join the tent together as a single unit. 
EXO.36.19	He also made a covering for the tent from ram skins dyed red and a covering of fine leather
EXO.36.20	He
EXO.36.21	Each support was fifteen feet
EXO.36.22	Each support had two tenons for joining one to another. He did the same for all the supports of the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.23	He made supports for the tabernacle as follows: twenty for the south side, 
EXO.36.24	and he made forty silver bases to put under the twenty supports, two bases under the first support for its two tenons, and two bases under each of the following supports for their two tenons; 
EXO.36.25	for the second side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty supports, 
EXO.36.26	with their forty silver bases, two bases under the first support and two bases under each of the following ones; 
EXO.36.27	and for the back of the tabernacle, on the west side, he made six supports. 
EXO.36.28	He also made two additional supports for the two back corners of the tabernacle. 
EXO.36.29	They were paired at the bottom and joined together
EXO.36.30	So there were eight supports with their sixteen silver bases, two bases under each one.
EXO.36.31	He made five crossbars of acacia wood for the supports on one side of the tabernacle, 
EXO.36.32	five crossbars for the supports on the other side of the tabernacle, and five crossbars for those at the back of the tabernacle on the west. 
EXO.36.33	He made the central crossbar run through the middle of the supports from one end to the other. 
EXO.36.34	He overlaid them with gold and made their rings out of gold as holders for the crossbars. He also overlaid the crossbars with gold.
EXO.36.35	Then
EXO.36.36	He made four pillars of acacia wood for it and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were of gold. And he cast four silver bases for the pillars.
EXO.36.37	He made a screen embroidered
EXO.36.38	together with its five pillars and their hooks. He overlaid the tops of the pillars and their bands with gold, but their five bases were bronze.
EXO.37.1	Bezalel
EXO.37.2	He overlaid it with pure gold inside and out and made a gold molding all around it. 
EXO.37.3	He cast four gold rings for it, for its four feet, two rings on one side and two rings on the other side. 
EXO.37.4	He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.5	He inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark for carrying the ark.
EXO.37.6	He made a mercy seat of pure gold, forty-five inches long and twenty-seven inches wide.
EXO.37.7	He made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the mercy seat, 
EXO.37.8	one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end. At each end, he made a cherub of one piece with the mercy seat. 
EXO.37.9	They had wings spread out. They faced each other and covered the mercy seat with their wings. The faces of the cherubim were looking toward the mercy seat.
EXO.37.10	He
EXO.37.11	He overlaid it with pure gold and made a gold molding all around it. 
EXO.37.12	He made a three-inch
EXO.37.13	He cast four gold rings for it and attached the rings to the four corners at its four legs. 
EXO.37.14	The rings were next to the frame as holders for the poles to carry the table. 
EXO.37.15	He made the poles for carrying the table from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
EXO.37.16	He also made the utensils that would be on the table out of pure gold: its plates and cups, as well as its bowls and pitchers for pouring drink offerings.
EXO.37.17	Then
EXO.37.18	Six branches extended from its sides, three branches of the lampstand from one side and three branches of the lampstand from the other side. 
EXO.37.19	There were three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with a bud and petals, on one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with a bud and petals, on the next branch. It was this way for the six branches that extended from the lampstand. 
EXO.37.20	There were four cups shaped like almond blossoms on the lampstand shaft along with its buds and petals. 
EXO.37.21	For the six branches that extended from it, a bud was under the first pair of branches from it, a bud under the second pair of branches from it, and a bud under the third pair of branches from it. 
EXO.37.22	Their buds and branches were of one piece with it. All of it was a single hammered piece of pure gold. 
EXO.37.23	He also made its seven lamps, snuffers, and firepans of pure gold. 
EXO.37.24	He made it and all its utensils of seventy-five pounds
EXO.37.25	He
EXO.37.26	He overlaid it, its top, all around its sides, and its horns with pure gold. Then he made a gold molding all around it. 
EXO.37.27	He made two gold rings for it under the molding on two of its sides; he put these on opposite sides of it to be holders for the poles to carry it with. 
EXO.37.28	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
EXO.37.29	He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant, and expertly blended incense.
EXO.38.1	Bezalel
EXO.38.2	He made horns for it on its four corners; the horns were of one piece with it. Then he overlaid it with bronze.
EXO.38.3	He made all the altar’s utensils: the pots, shovels, basins, meat forks, and firepans; he made all its utensils of bronze. 
EXO.38.4	He constructed for the altar a grate of bronze mesh under its ledge,
EXO.38.5	He cast four rings at the four corners of the bronze grate as holders for the poles. 
EXO.38.6	He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	Then he inserted the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar in order to carry it with them. He constructed the altar with boards so that it was hollow.
EXO.38.8	He made the bronze basin and its stand from the bronze mirrors of the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.
EXO.38.9	Then
EXO.38.10	including their twenty posts and their twenty bronze bases, with silver hooks and silver bands

EXO.39.5	The artistically woven waistband that was on the ephod was of one piece with the ephod, according to the same workmanship of gold, of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and of finely spun linen, just as the 
EXO.39.6	Then they mounted the onyx stones surrounded with gold filigree settings, engraved with the names of Israel’s sons as a gem cutter engraves a seal. 
EXO.39.7	He fastened them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod as memorial stones for the Israelites, just as the

EXO.39.17	Then they attached the two gold cords to the two gold rings on the corners of the breastpiece. 
EXO.39.18	They attached the other ends of the two cords to the two filigree settings, and in this way they attached them to the ephod’s shoulder pieces in front. 
EXO.39.19	They made two other gold rings and put them at the two other corners of the breastpiece on the edge that is next to the inner border of the ephod. 
EXO.39.20	They made two more gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the ephod’s two shoulder pieces on its front, close to its seam,
EXO.39.21	Then they tied the breastpiece from its rings to the rings of the ephod with a cord of blue yarn, so that the breastpiece was above the ephod’s waistband and did not come loose from the ephod. They did just as the

EXO.40.13	Clothe Aaron with the holy garments,
EXO.40.14	Have his sons come forward and clothe them in tunics. 
EXO.40.15	Anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may also serve me as priests. Their anointing will serve to inaugurate a permanent priesthood for them throughout their generations.”
EXO.40.16	Moses did everything just as the 
EXO.40.17	The tabernacle was set up in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month.
EXO.40.18	Moses set up the tabernacle: He laid its bases, positioned its supports, inserted its crossbars, and set up its pillars. 
EXO.40.19	Then he spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as the 
EXO.40.20	Moses took the testimony
EXO.40.21	He brought the ark into the tabernacle, put up the curtain for the screen, and screened off the ark of the testimony, just as the 
EXO.40.22	Moses placed the table in the tent of meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain. 
EXO.40.23	He arranged the bread on it before the 
EXO.40.24	He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle 
EXO.40.25	and set up the lamps before the 
EXO.40.26	Moses installed the gold altar in the tent of meeting, in front of the curtain, 
EXO.40.27	and burned fragrant incense on it, just as the 
EXO.40.28	He put up the screen at the entrance to the tabernacle. 
EXO.40.29	He placed the altar of burnt offering at the entrance to the tabernacle, the tent of meeting, and offered the burnt offering and the grain offering on it, just as the 
EXO.40.30	He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water in it for washing. 
EXO.40.31	Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet from it. 
EXO.40.32	They washed whenever they came to the tent of meeting and approached the altar, just as the

EXO.40.34	The cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.35	Moses was unable to enter the tent of meeting because the cloud rested on it, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.36	The Israelites set out whenever the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle throughout all the stages of their journey.

LEV.8.7	He put the tunic on Aaron, wrapped the sash around him, clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod
LEV.8.8	Then he put the breastpiece on him and placed the Urim and Thummim
LEV.8.9	He also put the turban
LEV.8.10	Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and everything in it to consecrate
LEV.8.11	He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times, anointing the altar with all its utensils, and the basin with its stand, to consecrate them.
LEV.8.12	He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed and consecrated him.
LEV.8.13	Then Moses presented Aaron’s sons, clothed them with tunics, wrapped sashes around them, and fastened headbands on them, as the 
LEV.8.14	Then he brought the bull near for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull for the sin offering. 
LEV.8.15	Then Moses slaughtered it,
LEV.8.16	Moses took all the fat that was on the entrails, the fatty lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys
LEV.8.17	He burned the bull with its hide, flesh, and waste outside the camp,
LEV.8.18	Then he presented the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
LEV.8.19	Moses slaughtered it and
LEV.8.20	Moses cut the ram into pieces and burned the head, the pieces, and the fat,
LEV.8.21	but he washed the entrails and legs with water. He then burned the entire ram on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a pleasing aroma, a fire offering to the 
LEV.8.22	Next he presented the second ram, the ram of ordination,
LEV.8.23	Moses slaughtered it,
LEV.8.24	Moses also presented Aaron’s sons and put some of the blood on their right earlobes, on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the big toes of their right feet. Then Moses splattered the blood on all sides of the altar. 
LEV.8.25	He took the fat — the fat tail,
LEV.8.26	From the basket of unleavened bread that was before the 
LEV.8.27	He put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons and presented them before the

LEV.8.31	Moses said to Aaron and his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance to the tent of meeting and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket for the ordination offering as I commanded:
LEV.8.32	Burn up what remains of the meat and bread.
LEV.8.33	Do not go outside the entrance to the tent of meeting for seven days, until the time your days of ordination are completed, because it will take seven days to ordain you.

LEV.9.7	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering; make atonement for yourself and the people.
LEV.9.8	So Aaron approached the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself. 
LEV.9.9	Aaron’s sons brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and applied it to the horns of the altar. He poured out the blood at the base of the altar. 
LEV.9.10	He burned the fat, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver from the sin offering on the altar, as the 
LEV.9.11	He burned the flesh and the hide
LEV.9.12	Then he slaughtered the burnt offering. Aaron’s sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it on all sides of the altar. 
LEV.9.13	They brought him the burnt offering piece by piece, along with the head, and he burned them on the altar. 
LEV.9.14	He washed the entrails and the legs and burned them with the burnt offering on the altar.
LEV.9.15	Aaron presented the people’s offering. He took the male goat for the people’s sin offering, slaughtered it, and made a sin offering with it as he did before. 
LEV.9.16	He presented the burnt offering and sacrificed it according to the regulation.
LEV.9.17	Next he presented the grain offering, took a handful of it, and burned it on the altar in addition to the morning burnt offering.
LEV.9.18	Finally, he slaughtered the ox and the ram as the people’s fellowship sacrifice. Aaron’s sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it on all sides of the altar. 
LEV.9.19	They also brought the fat portions from the ox and the ram — the fat tail, the fat surrounding the entrails, the kidneys, and the fatty lobe of the liver —  
LEV.9.20	and placed these on the breasts. Aaron burned the fat portions on the altar, 
LEV.9.21	but he presented the breasts
LEV.9.22	Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed
LEV.9.23	Moses and Aaron then entered the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people, and the glory of the 
LEV.9.24	Fire came from the 
LEV.10.1	Aaron’s sons Nadab
LEV.10.2	Then fire came from the 
LEV.10.3	Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the 
LEV.10.3	I will demonstrate my holiness
LEV.10.3	to those who are near me,
LEV.10.3	and I will reveal my glory
LEV.10.3	before all the people.”
LEV.10.3	And Aaron remained silent.
LEV.10.4	Moses summoned Mishael and Elzaphan,
LEV.10.5	So they came forward and carried them in their tunics outside the camp, as Moses had said.
LEV.10.6	Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar,
LEV.10.7	You must not go outside the entrance to the tent of meeting or you will die, for the

LEV.10.9	“You and your sons are not to drink wine
LEV.10.10	You must distinguish

LEV.10.13	You must eat it in a holy place because it is your portion
LEV.10.14	But you and your sons and your daughters may eat the breast of the presentation offering and the thigh of the contribution in any ceremonially clean place, because these portions have been assigned to you and your children from the Israelites’ fellowship sacrifices. 
LEV.10.15	They are to bring the thigh of the contribution and the breast of the presentation offering, together with the offerings of fat portions made by fire, to present as a presentation offering before the 
LEV.10.16	Then Moses inquired carefully about the male goat of the sin offering, but it had already been burned up. He was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s surviving sons, and asked, 
LEV.10.17	“Why didn’t you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area?
LEV.10.18	Since its blood was not brought inside the sanctuary, you should have eaten it in the sanctuary area, as I commanded.”
LEV.10.19	But Aaron replied to Moses, “See, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the

LEV.25.10	You are to consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom in the land for all its inhabitants. It will be your Jubilee,
LEV.25.11	The fiftieth year will be your Jubilee; you are not to sow, reap what grows by itself, or harvest its untended vines. 
LEV.25.12	It is to be holy to you because it is the Jubilee; you may only eat its produce directly from the field.
LEV.25.13	“In this Year of Jubilee, each of you will return to his property. 
LEV.25.14	If you make a sale to your neighbor or a purchase from him, do not cheat
LEV.25.15	You are to make the purchase from your neighbor based on the number of years since the last Jubilee. He is to sell to you based on the number of remaining harvest years. 
LEV.25.16	You are to increase its price in proportion to a greater amount of years, and decrease its price in proportion to a lesser amount of years, because what he is selling to you is a number of harvests. 
LEV.25.17	You are not to cheat one another, but fear your God, for I am the

LEV.25.23	“The land is not to be permanently sold because it is mine, and you are only aliens and temporary residents on my land.

LEV.25.46	You may leave them to your sons after you to inherit as property; you can make them slaves for life. But concerning your brothers, the Israelites, you must not rule over one another harshly.
LEV.25.47	“If an alien or temporary resident living among you prospers, but your brother living near him becomes destitute and sells himself to the alien living among you, or to a member of the resident alien’s clan, 
LEV.25.48	he has the right of redemption after he has been sold. One of his brothers may redeem him. 
LEV.25.49	His uncle or cousin may redeem him, or any of his close relatives from his clan may redeem him. If he prospers, he may redeem himself. 
LEV.25.50	The one who purchased him is to calculate the time from the year he sold himself to him until the Year of Jubilee. The price of his sale will be determined by the number of years. It will be set for him like the daily wages of a hired worker. 
LEV.25.51	If many years are still left, he must pay his redemption price in proportion to them based on his purchase price. 
LEV.25.52	If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he will calculate and pay the price of his redemption in proportion to his remaining years. 
LEV.25.53	He will stay with him like a man hired year by year. A resident alien is not to rule over him harshly in your sight. 
LEV.25.54	If he is not redeemed in any of these ways, he and his children are to be released at the Year of Jubilee.

LEV.26.32	I also will devastate the land, so that your enemies who come to live there will be appalled by it. 
LEV.26.33	But I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw a sword to chase after you. So your land will become desolate, and your cities will become ruins.

NUM.8.2	“Speak to Aaron and tell him: When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps are to give light in front of the lampstand.” 
NUM.8.3	So Aaron did this; he set up its lamps to give light in front of the lampstand just as the 
NUM.8.4	This is the way the lampstand was made: it was a hammered work of gold, hammered from its base to its flower petals. The lampstand was made according to the pattern the

NUM.8.9	Bring the Levites before the tent of meeting and assemble the entire Israelite community.
NUM.8.10	Then present the Levites before the 
NUM.8.11	Aaron is to present the Levites before the 
NUM.8.12	Next the Levites are to lay their hands on the heads of the bulls. Sacrifice one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the 
NUM.8.13	“You are to have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons, and you are to present them before the 
NUM.8.14	In this way you are to separate the Levites from the rest of the Israelites so that the Levites will belong to me.

NUM.8.16	For they have been exclusively assigned to me from the Israelites.
NUM.8.17	For every firstborn among the Israelites is mine, both man and animal. I consecrated them to myself
NUM.8.18	But I have taken the Levites in place of every firstborn among the Israelites. 
NUM.8.19	From the Israelites, I have given the Levites exclusively to Aaron and his sons to perform the work for the Israelites at the tent of meeting and to make atonement on their behalf, so that no plague will come against the Israelites when they approach the sanctuary.”
NUM.8.20	Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community did this to the Levites. The Israelites did everything to them the 
NUM.8.21	The Levites purified themselves and washed their clothes; then Aaron presented
NUM.8.22	After that, the Levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting in the presence of Aaron and his sons. So they did to them as the 
NUM.8.23	The 
NUM.8.24	“In regard to the Levites: From twenty-five years old or more, a man enters the service in the work at the tent of meeting.

NUM.9.3	You must observe it at its appointed time on the fourteenth day of this month at twilight; you are to observe it according to all its statutes and ordinances.”
NUM.9.4	So Moses told the Israelites to observe the Passover, 
NUM.9.5	and they observed it in the first month on the fourteenth day at twilight in the Wilderness of Sinai. The Israelites did everything as the 
NUM.9.6	But there were some men who were unclean because of a human corpse, so they could not observe the Passover on that day.
NUM.9.7	and said to him, “We are unclean because of a human corpse. Why should we be excluded from presenting the

NUM.10.12	The Israelites traveled on from the Wilderness of Sinai, moving from one place to the next
NUM.10.13	They set out for the first time according to the 
NUM.10.14	The military divisions of the camp of Judah’s descendants with their banner set out first, and Nahshon son of Amminadab
NUM.10.15	Nethanel son of Zuar
NUM.10.16	and Eliab son of Helon was over the division of the tribe of Zebulun’s descendants. 
NUM.10.17	The tabernacle was then taken down, and the Gershonites and the Merarites set out, transporting the tabernacle.
NUM.10.18	The military divisions of the camp of Reuben with their banner set out, and Elizur son of Shedeur was over their divisions. 
NUM.10.19	Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai
NUM.10.20	and Eliasaph son of Deuel
NUM.10.21	The Kohathites then set out, transporting the holy objects;
NUM.10.22	Next the military divisions of the camp of Ephraim’s descendants with their banner set out, and Elishama son of Ammihud
NUM.10.23	Gamaliel son of Pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of Manasseh’s descendants, 
NUM.10.24	and Abidan son of Gideoni was over the division of the tribe of Benjamin’s descendants.
NUM.10.25	The military divisions of the camp of Dan’s descendants with their banner set out, serving as rear guard for all the camps, and Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai
NUM.10.26	Pagiel son of Ochran was over the division of the tribe of Asher’s descendants, 
NUM.10.27	and Ahira son of Enan was over the division of the tribe of Naphtali’s descendants. 
NUM.10.28	This was the order of march for the Israelites by their military divisions as they set out.
NUM.10.29	Moses said to Hobab, descendant of Reuel
NUM.10.30	But he replied to him, “I don’t want to go. Instead, I will go to my own land and my relatives.”
NUM.10.31	“Please don’t leave us,” Moses said, “since you know where we should camp in the wilderness, and you can serve as our eyes. 
NUM.10.32	If you come with us, whatever good the

NUM.10.35	Whenever the ark set out, Moses would say:
NUM.10.35	Arise, 
NUM.10.35	Let your enemies be scattered,
NUM.10.35	and those who hate you flee from your presence.
NUM.10.36	When it came to rest, he would say:
NUM.10.36	Return, 
NUM.10.36	to the countless thousands of Israel.
NUM.11.1	Now the people began complaining openly before
NUM.11.2	Then the people cried out to Moses, and he prayed to the 
NUM.11.3	So that place was named Taberah,
NUM.11.4	The riffraff
NUM.11.5	We remember the free fish we ate in Egypt,
NUM.11.6	But now our appetite is gone;
NUM.11.7	The manna
NUM.11.8	The people walked around and gathered it. They ground it on a pair of grinding stones or crushed it in a mortar, then boiled it in a cooking pot and shaped it into cakes. It tasted like a pastry cooked with the finest oil. 
NUM.11.9	When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna would fall with it.
NUM.11.10	Moses heard the people, family after family, weeping at the entrance of their tents. The 
NUM.11.11	So Moses asked the 
NUM.11.12	Did I conceive all these people? Did I give them birth so you should tell me, ‘Carry them at your breast, as a nanny carries a baby,’
NUM.11.13	Where can I get meat to give all these people? For they are weeping to me, ‘Give us meat to eat!’ 
NUM.11.14	I can’t carry all these people by myself. They are too much for me. 
NUM.11.15	If you are going to treat me like this, please kill me right now
NUM.11.16	The 
NUM.11.17	Then I will come down and speak with you there. I will take some of the Spirit who is on you and put the Spirit on them.
NUM.11.18	“Tell the people: Consecrate yourselves in readiness for tomorrow, and you will eat meat because you wept in the 
NUM.11.19	You will eat, not for one day, or two days, or five days, or ten days, or twenty days, 
NUM.11.20	but for a whole month — until it comes out of your nostrils and becomes nauseating to you — because you have rejected the 
NUM.11.21	But Moses replied, “I’m in the middle of a people with six hundred thousand foot soldiers,
NUM.11.22	If flocks and herds were slaughtered for them, would they have enough? Or if all the fish in the sea were caught for them, would they have enough?” 
NUM.11.23	The 
NUM.11.24	Moses went out and told the people the words of the 
NUM.11.25	Then the 
NUM.11.26	Two men had remained in the camp, one named Eldad and the other Medad; the Spirit rested on them — they were among those listed, but had not gone out to the tent — and they prophesied in the camp. 
NUM.11.27	A young man ran and reported to Moses, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”
NUM.11.28	Joshua son of Nun, assistant to Moses since his youth,
NUM.11.29	But Moses asked him, “Are you jealous on my account?
NUM.11.30	Then Moses returned to the camp along with the elders of Israel.
NUM.11.31	A wind sent by the 
NUM.11.32	The people were up all that day and night and all the next day gathering the quail — the one who took the least gathered fifty bushels
NUM.11.33	While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the 
NUM.11.34	So they named that place Kibroth-hattaavah,
NUM.11.35	From Kibroth-hattaavah the people moved on to Hazeroth
NUM.12.1	Miriam
NUM.12.2	They said, “Does the 
NUM.12.3	Moses was a very humble man, more so than anyone on the face of the earth.
NUM.12.4	Suddenly the 
NUM.12.5	Then the 
NUM.12.6	he said:
NUM.12.6	“Listen to what I say:
NUM.12.6	If there is a prophet among you from the 
NUM.12.6	I make myself known to him in a vision;
NUM.12.6	I speak with him in a dream.
NUM.12.7	Not so with my servant Moses;
NUM.12.7	he is faithful in
NUM.12.8	I speak with him
NUM.12.8	openly, and not in riddles;
NUM.12.8	he sees the form of the 
NUM.12.8	So why were you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?” 
NUM.12.9	The 
NUM.12.10	As the cloud moved away from the tent, Miriam’s skin suddenly became diseased, resembling snow.
NUM.12.11	and said to Moses, “My lord, please don’t hold against us this sin we have so foolishly committed. 
NUM.12.12	Please don’t let her be like a dead baby
NUM.12.13	Then Moses cried out to the 
NUM.12.14	The 
NUM.12.15	So Miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was brought back in.
NUM.12.16	After that, the people set out from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran.
NUM.13.1	The 
NUM.13.2	“Send men to scout out the land of Canaan
NUM.13.3	Moses sent them from the Wilderness of Paran at the 
NUM.13.4	These were their names:
NUM.13.4	Shammua son of Zaccur from the tribe of Reuben;
NUM.13.5	Shaphat son of Hori from the tribe of Simeon;

NUM.13.11	Gaddi son of Susi from the tribe of Manasseh (from the tribe of Joseph);
NUM.13.12	Ammiel son of Gemalli from the tribe of Dan;
NUM.13.13	Sethur son of Michael from the tribe of Asher;
NUM.13.14	Nahbi son of Vophsi from the tribe of Naphtali;
NUM.13.15	Geuel son of Machi from the tribe of Gad.
NUM.13.16	These were the names of the men Moses sent to scout out the land, and Moses renamed Hoshea son of Nun, Joshua.
NUM.13.17	When Moses sent them to scout out the land of Canaan, he told them, “Go up this way to the Negev, then go up into the hill country. 
NUM.13.18	See what the land is like, and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many. 
NUM.13.19	Is the land they live in good
NUM.13.20	Is the land fertile or unproductive?
NUM.13.21	So they went up and scouted out the land from the Wilderness of Zin
NUM.13.22	They went up through the Negev and came to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak,
NUM.13.23	When they came to the Valley of Eshcol,
NUM.13.24	That place was called the Valley of Eshcol
NUM.13.25	At the end of forty days
NUM.13.26	The men went back to Moses, Aaron, and the entire Israelite community in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh. They brought back a report for them and the whole community, and they showed them the fruit of the land.
NUM.13.27	They reported to Moses: “We went into the land where you sent us. Indeed it is flowing with milk and honey,
NUM.13.28	However, the people living in the land are strong, and the cities are large and fortified.
NUM.13.29	The Amalekites
NUM.13.30	Then Caleb
NUM.13.31	But the men who had gone up with him responded, “We can’t attack the people because they are stronger than we are!” 
NUM.13.32	So they gave a negative report to the Israelites about the land they had scouted: “The land we passed through to explore is one that devours its inhabitants, and all the people we saw in it are men of great size. 
NUM.13.33	We even saw the Nephilim
NUM.14.1	Then the whole community broke into loud cries, and the people wept that night. 
NUM.14.2	All the Israelites complained about Moses and Aaron,
NUM.14.3	Why is the 
NUM.14.4	So they said to one another, “Let’s appoint a leader and go back to Egypt.”
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell facedown in front of the whole assembly of the Israelite community. 
NUM.14.6	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who were among those who scouted out the land, tore their clothes 
NUM.14.7	and said to the entire Israelite community: “The land we passed through and explored is an extremely good land.

NUM.14.9	Only don’t rebel against the 
NUM.14.10	While the whole community threatened to stone them,
NUM.14.11	The 
NUM.14.12	I will strike them with a plague and destroy them. Then I will make you into a greater and mightier nation than they are.”
NUM.14.13	But Moses replied to the 
NUM.14.14	They will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.
NUM.14.15	If you kill this people with a single blow,
NUM.14.16	‘Since the 
NUM.14.17	“So now, may my Lord’s power be magnified just as you have spoken:

NUM.14.22	none of the men who have seen my glory and the signs I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tested me these ten times and did not obey me, 
NUM.14.23	will ever see the land I swore to give their fathers.
NUM.14.24	But since my servant Caleb has a different spirit and has remained loyal to me, I will bring him into the land where he has gone, and his descendants will inherit it.
NUM.14.25	Since the Amalekites and Canaanites are living in the lowlands,
NUM.14.26	Then the 
NUM.14.27	“How long must I endure this evil community that keeps complaining about me? I have heard the Israelites’ complaints that they make against me.
NUM.14.28	Tell them: As surely as I live — this is the 
NUM.14.29	Your corpses will fall in this wilderness — all of you who were registered in the census, the entire number of you twenty years old or more

NUM.14.36	So the men Moses sent to scout out the land, and who returned and incited the entire community to complain about him by spreading a negative report about the land —  
NUM.14.37	those men who spread the negative report about the land were struck down by the 
NUM.14.38	Only Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh remained alive of those men who went to scout out the land.
NUM.14.39	When Moses reported these words to all the Israelites, the people were overcome with grief. 
NUM.14.40	They got up early the next morning and went up the ridge of the hill country, saying, “Let’s go to the place the 
NUM.14.41	But Moses responded, “Why are you going against the

NUM.16.4	When Moses heard this, he fell facedown.

NUM.16.9	Isn’t it enough for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the Israelite community to bring you near to himself,
NUM.16.10	He has brought you near, and all your fellow Levites who are with you, but you are pursuing the priesthood
NUM.16.11	Therefore, it is you and all your followers who have conspired against the 
NUM.16.12	Moses sent for Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they said, “We will not come!

NUM.16.14	Furthermore, you didn’t bring us to a land flowing with milk and honey or give us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men?

NUM.16.16	So Moses told Korah, “You and all your followers are to appear before the 
NUM.16.17	Each of you is to take his firepan, place incense on it, and present his firepan before the 
NUM.16.18	Each man took his firepan, placed fire in it, put incense on it, and stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting along with Moses and Aaron.

NUM.16.26	He warned the community, “Get away now from the tents of these wicked men. Don’t touch anything that belongs to them,
NUM.16.27	So they got away from the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Meanwhile, Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrance of their tents with their wives, children, and infants.

NUM.16.41	The next day the entire Israelite community complained about Moses and Aaron,
NUM.16.42	When the community assembled against them, Moses and Aaron turned toward the tent of meeting, and suddenly the cloud covered it, and the 
NUM.16.43	Moses and Aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting, 
NUM.16.44	and the 
NUM.16.45	“Get away from this community so that I may consume them instantly.”
NUM.16.46	Then Moses told Aaron, “Take your firepan, place fire from the altar in it, and add incense. Go quickly to the community and make atonement for them, because wrath has come from the 
NUM.16.47	So Aaron took his firepan as Moses had ordered, ran into the middle of the assembly, and saw that the plague had begun among the people. After he added incense, he made atonement for the people. 
NUM.16.48	He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague was halted. 
NUM.16.49	But those who died from the plague numbered 14,700, in addition to those who died because of the Korah incident. 
NUM.16.50	Aaron then returned to Moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting, since the plague had been halted.
NUM.17.1	The 
NUM.17.2	“Speak to the Israelites and take one staff from them for each ancestral tribe,
NUM.17.3	Write Aaron’s name on Levi’s staff, because there is to be one staff for the head of each tribe. 
NUM.17.4	Then place them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony where I meet with you. 
NUM.17.5	The staff of the man I choose will sprout, and I will rid myself of the Israelites’ complaints that they have been making about you.”
NUM.17.6	So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a staff, one for each of the leaders of their tribes, twelve staffs in all. Aaron’s staff was among them.
NUM.17.7	Moses placed the staffs before the 
NUM.17.8	The next day Moses entered the tent of the testimony and saw that Aaron’s staff, representing the house of Levi, had sprouted, formed buds, blossomed, and produced almonds! 
NUM.17.9	Moses then brought out all the staffs from the 
NUM.17.10	The 
NUM.17.11	So Moses did as the 
NUM.17.12	Then the Israelites declared to Moses, “Look, we’re perishing! We’re lost; we’re all lost! 
NUM.17.13	Anyone who comes near the 
NUM.18.1	The 
NUM.18.2	But also bring your relatives with you from the tribe of Levi, your ancestral tribe, so they may join you and assist you and your sons in front of the tent of the testimony.
NUM.18.3	They are to perform duties for you and for the whole tent. They must not come near the sanctuary equipment or the altar; otherwise, both they and you will die. 
NUM.18.4	They are to join you and guard the tent of meeting, doing all the work at the tent, but no unauthorized person may come near you.
NUM.18.5	“You are to guard the sanctuary and the altar so that wrath may not fall on the Israelites again.
NUM.18.6	Look, I have selected your fellow Levites from the Israelites as a gift for you, assigned by the 
NUM.18.7	But you and your sons will carry out your priestly responsibilities
NUM.18.8	Then the 
NUM.18.9	A portion of the holiest offerings kept from the fire will be yours; every one of their offerings that they give me, whether the grain offering, sin offering, or guilt offering will be most holy for you and your sons. 
NUM.18.10	You are to eat it as a most holy offering.
NUM.18.11	“The contribution of their gifts also belongs to you. I have given all the Israelites’ presentation offerings
NUM.18.12	I am giving you all the best of the fresh oil, new wine, and grain,
NUM.18.13	The firstfruits of all that is in their land, which they bring to the 
NUM.18.14	“Everything in Israel that is permanently dedicated to the 
NUM.18.15	The firstborn of every living thing, human or animal, presented to the 
NUM.18.16	You will pay the redemption price for a month-old male according to your assessment: five shekels
NUM.18.17	“However, you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox, a sheep, or a goat; they are holy. You are to splatter their blood on the altar and burn their fat as a fire offering for a pleasing aroma to the 
NUM.18.18	But their meat belongs to you. It belongs to you like the breast of the presentation offering and the right thigh.
NUM.18.19	“I give to you and to your sons and daughters all the holy contributions that the Israelites present to the 
NUM.18.20	The 
NUM.18.21	“Look, I have given the Levites every tenth
NUM.18.22	The Israelites must never again come near the tent of meeting, or they will incur guilt and die. 
NUM.18.23	The Levites will do the work of the tent of meeting, and they will bear the consequences of their iniquity. The Levites will not receive an inheritance among the Israelites;
NUM.18.24	For I have given them the tenth that the Israelites present to the 
NUM.18.25	The 
NUM.18.26	“Speak to the Levites and tell them: When you receive from the Israelites the tenth that I have given you as your inheritance, you are to present part of it as an offering to the 
NUM.18.27	Your offering will be credited to you as if it were your grain from the threshing floor or the full harvest from the winepress. 
NUM.18.28	You are to present an offering to the 
NUM.18.29	You must present the entire offering due the 
NUM.18.30	“Tell them further: Once you have presented the best part of the tenth, and it is credited to you Levites as the produce of the threshing floor or the winepress, 
NUM.18.31	then you and your household may eat it anywhere. It is your wage in return for your work at the tent of meeting. 
NUM.18.32	You will not incur guilt because of it once you have presented the best part of it, but you must not defile the Israelites’ holy offerings, so that you will not die.”
NUM.19.1	The 
NUM.19.2	“This is the legal statute that the 
NUM.19.3	Give it to the priest Eleazar,
NUM.19.4	The priest Eleazar is to take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting. 
NUM.19.5	The cow is to be burned in his sight. Its hide, flesh, and blood, are to be burned along with its waste. 
NUM.19.6	The priest is to take cedar wood, hyssop, and crimson yarn,
NUM.19.7	Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; after that he may enter the camp, but he will remain ceremonially unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.8	The one who burned the cow must also wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and he will remain unclean until evening.
NUM.19.9	“A man who is clean is to gather up the cow’s ashes and deposit them outside the camp in a ceremonially clean place. The ashes will be kept by the Israelite community for preparing the water to remove impurity; it is a sin offering.
NUM.19.10	Then the one who gathers up the cow’s ashes must wash his clothes, and he will remain unclean until evening. This is a permanent statute for the Israelites and for the alien who resides among them.
NUM.19.11	“The person who touches any human corpse will be unclean for seven days. 
NUM.19.12	He is to purify himself with the water
NUM.19.13	Anyone who touches a body of a person who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the 
NUM.19.14	“This is the law when a person dies in a tent: everyone who enters the tent and everyone who is already in the tent will be unclean for seven days, 
NUM.19.15	and any open container without a lid tied on it is unclean. 
NUM.19.16	Anyone in the open field who touches a person who has been killed by the sword or has died, or who even touches a human bone, or a grave, will be unclean for seven days. 
NUM.19.17	For the purification of the unclean person, they are to take some of the ashes of the burnt sin offering, put them in a jar, and add fresh water to them. 
NUM.19.18	A person who is clean is to take hyssop, dip it in the water, and sprinkle the tent, all the furnishings, and the people who were there. He is also to sprinkle the one who touched a bone, a grave, a corpse, or a person who had been killed.
NUM.19.19	“The one who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and the seventh day. After he purifies the unclean person on the seventh day, the one being purified must wash his clothes and bathe in water, and he will be clean by evening. 
NUM.19.20	But a person who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person will be cut off from the assembly because he has defiled the sanctuary of the 
NUM.19.21	This is a permanent statute for them. The person who sprinkles the water for impurity is to wash his clothes, and whoever touches the water for impurity will be unclean until evening. 
NUM.19.22	Anything the unclean person touches will become unclean, and anyone who touches it will be unclean until evening.”
NUM.20.1	The entire Israelite community entered the Wilderness of Zin
NUM.20.2	There was no water for the community, so they assembled against Moses and Aaron. 
NUM.20.3	The people quarreled with Moses and said,
NUM.20.4	Why have you brought the 
NUM.20.5	Why have you led us up from Egypt to bring us to this evil place? It’s not a place of grain, figs, vines, and pomegranates,
NUM.20.6	Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the tent of meeting. They fell facedown, and the glory of the 
NUM.20.7	The 
NUM.20.8	“Take the staff
NUM.20.9	So Moses took the staff from the 
NUM.20.10	Moses and Aaron summoned the assembly in front of the rock, and Moses said to them, “Listen, you rebels! Must we bring water out of this rock for you?” 
NUM.20.11	Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his staff, so that abundant water gushed out, and the community and their livestock drank.
NUM.20.12	But the 
NUM.20.13	These are the Waters of Meribah,
NUM.20.14	Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, “This is what your brother Israel
NUM.20.15	Our fathers went down to Egypt, and we lived in Egypt many years, but the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly. 
NUM.20.16	When we cried out to the 
NUM.20.17	Please let us travel through your land. We won’t travel through any field or vineyard, or drink any well water. We will travel the King’s Highway; we won’t turn to the right or the left until we have traveled through your territory.’”
NUM.20.18	But Edom answered him, “You will not travel through our land, or we will come out and confront you with the sword.”
NUM.20.19	“We will go on the main road,” the Israelites replied to them, “and if we or our herds drink your water, we will pay its price.
NUM.20.20	Yet Edom insisted, “You may not travel through.” And they came out to confront them with a large force of heavily-armed people.
NUM.20.21	Edom refused to allow Israel to travel through their territory, and Israel turned away from them.
NUM.20.22	After they set out from Kadesh, the entire Israelite community came to Mount Hor.
NUM.20.23	The 
NUM.20.24	“Aaron will be gathered to his people; he will not enter the land I have given the Israelites, because you both rebelled against my command at the Waters of Meribah. 
NUM.20.25	Take Aaron and his son Eleazar and bring them up Mount Hor. 
NUM.20.26	Remove Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar. Aaron will be gathered to his people and die there.”
NUM.20.27	So Moses did as the 
NUM.20.28	After Moses removed Aaron’s garments and put them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
NUM.20.29	When the whole community saw that Aaron had passed away, the entire house of Israel mourned for him thirty days.
NUM.21.1	When the Canaanite king of Arad,
NUM.21.2	Then Israel made a vow to the 
NUM.21.3	The 
NUM.21.4	Then they set out from Mount Hor by way of the Red Sea to bypass the land of Edom, but the people became impatient because of the journey. 
NUM.21.5	The people spoke against God and Moses: “Why have you led us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread or water, and we detest this wretched food!” 
NUM.21.6	Then the 
NUM.21.7	The people then came to Moses and said, “We have sinned by speaking against the 
NUM.21.8	Then the 
NUM.21.9	So Moses made a bronze snake and mounted it on a pole. Whenever someone was bitten, and he looked at the bronze snake, he recovered.
NUM.21.10	The Israelites set out and camped at Oboth.
NUM.21.11	They set out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim in the wilderness that borders Moab on the east. 
NUM.21.12	From there they went and camped at Zered Valley. 
NUM.21.13	They set out from there and camped on the other side of the Arnon River, in the wilderness that extends from the Amorite border, because the Arnon was the Moabite border between Moab and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	Therefore it is stated in the Book of the 
NUM.21.14	Waheb in Suphah
NUM.21.14	and the ravines of the Arnon,
NUM.21.15	even the slopes of the ravines
NUM.21.15	that extend to the site of Ar
NUM.21.15	and lie along the border of Moab.
NUM.21.16	From there they went to Beer,
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song:
NUM.21.17	Spring up, well — sing to it!
NUM.21.18	The princes dug the well;
NUM.21.18	the nobles of the people hollowed it out
NUM.21.18	with a scepter and with their staffs.
NUM.21.18	They went from the wilderness to Mattanah, 
NUM.21.19	from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
NUM.21.20	from Bamoth to the valley in the territory of Moab near the Pisgah highlands
NUM.21.21	Israel sent messengers to say to King Sihon
NUM.21.22	“Let us travel through your land. We won’t go into the fields or vineyards. We won’t drink any well water. We will travel the King’s Highway until we have traveled through your territory.”
NUM.21.23	But Sihon would not let Israel travel through his territory. Instead, he gathered his whole army and went out to confront Israel in the wilderness. When he came to Jahaz,
NUM.21.24	Israel struck him with the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok,
NUM.21.25	Israel took all the cities and lived in all these Amorite cities, including Heshbon and all its surrounding villages. 
NUM.21.26	Heshbon was the city of King Sihon of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken control of all his land as far as the Arnon. 
NUM.21.27	Therefore the poets
NUM.21.27	Come to Heshbon, let it be rebuilt;
NUM.21.27	let the city of Sihon be restored.
NUM.21.28	For fire came out of Heshbon,
NUM.21.28	a flame from the city of Sihon.
NUM.21.28	It consumed Ar of Moab,
NUM.21.28	the citizens of Arnon’s heights.
NUM.21.29	Woe to you, Moab!
NUM.21.29	You have been destroyed, people of Chemosh!
NUM.21.29	He gave up his sons as refugees,
NUM.21.29	and his daughters into captivity
NUM.21.29	to Sihon the Amorite king.
NUM.21.30	We threw them down;
NUM.21.30	Heshbon has been destroyed as far as Dibon.
NUM.21.30	We caused desolation as far as Nophah,
NUM.21.30	which reaches as far as Medeba.
NUM.21.31	So Israel lived in the Amorites’ land. 
NUM.21.32	After Moses sent spies to Jazer, Israel captured its surrounding villages and drove out the Amorites who were there.
NUM.21.33	Then they turned and went up the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan
NUM.21.34	But the 
NUM.21.35	So they struck him, his sons, and his whole army until no one was left,
NUM.22.1	The Israelites traveled on and camped in the plains of Moab near the Jordan across from Jericho. 
NUM.22.2	Now Balak
NUM.22.3	Moab was terrified of the people because they were numerous,
NUM.22.4	So the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “This horde will devour everything around us like an ox eats up the green plants in the field.”
NUM.22.4	Since Balak son of Zippor was Moab’s king at that time, 
NUM.22.5	he sent messengers to Balaam
NUM.22.6	Please come and put a curse on these people for me because they are more powerful than I am. I may be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land, for I know that those you bless are blessed and those you curse are cursed.”
NUM.22.7	The elders of Moab and Midian departed with fees for divination
NUM.22.8	He said to them, “Spend the night here, and I will give you the answer the 
NUM.22.9	Then God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”
NUM.22.10	Balaam replied to God, “Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, sent this message to me: 
NUM.22.11	‘Look, a people has come out of Egypt, and they cover the surface of the land. Now come and put a curse on them for me. I may be able to fight against them and drive them away.’”
NUM.22.12	Then God said to Balaam, “You are not to go with them. You are not to curse this people, for they are blessed.”
NUM.22.13	So Balaam got up the next morning and said to Balak’s officials, “Go back to your land, because the 
NUM.22.14	The officials of Moab arose, returned to Balak, and reported, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
NUM.22.15	Balak sent officials again who were more numerous and higher in rank than the others. 
NUM.22.16	They came to Balaam and said to him, “This is what Balak son of Zippor says: ‘Let nothing keep you from coming to me, 
NUM.22.17	for I will greatly honor you and do whatever you ask me. So please come and put a curse on these people for me! ’”
NUM.22.18	But Balaam responded to the servants of Balak, “If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go against the command of the 
NUM.22.19	Please stay here overnight as the others did, so that I may find out what else the 
NUM.22.20	God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “Since these men have come to summon you, get up and go with them, but you must only do what I tell you.” 
NUM.22.21	When he got up in the morning, Balaam saddled his donkey and went with the officials of Moab.
NUM.22.22	But God was incensed that Balaam was going, and the angel of the 
NUM.22.23	When the donkey saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.24	Then the angel of the 
NUM.22.25	The donkey saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.26	The angel of the 
NUM.22.27	When the donkey saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.28	Then the 
NUM.22.29	Balaam answered the donkey, “You made me look like a fool. If I had a sword in my hand, I’d kill you now!”
NUM.22.30	But the donkey said, “Am I not the donkey you’ve ridden all your life until today? Have I ever treated you this way before?”
NUM.22.30	“No,” he replied.
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	The angel of the 
NUM.22.33	The donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times. If she had not turned away from me, I would have killed you by now and let her live.”
NUM.22.34	Balaam said to the angel of the 
NUM.22.35	Then the angel of the 
NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the Moabite city
NUM.22.37	Balak asked Balaam, “Did I not send you an urgent summons? Why didn’t you come to me? Am I really not able to reward you?”
NUM.22.38	Balaam said to him, “Look, I have come to you, but can I say anything I want? I must speak only the message God puts in my mouth.” 
NUM.22.39	So Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth.
NUM.22.40	Balak sacrificed cattle, sheep, and goats and sent for Balaam and the officials who were with him.
NUM.22.41	In the morning, Balak took Balaam and brought him to Bamoth-baal.
NUM.23.1	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”
NUM.23.2	So Balak did as Balaam directed, and they offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
NUM.23.3	Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here by your burnt offering while I am gone. Maybe the 
NUM.23.4	God met with him and Balaam said to him, “I have arranged seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.” 
NUM.23.5	Then the 
NUM.23.6	So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with all the officials of Moab.
NUM.23.7	Balaam proclaimed his poem:
NUM.23.7	Balak brought me from Aram;
NUM.23.7	the king of Moab, from the eastern mountains:
NUM.23.7	“Come, put a curse on Jacob for me;
NUM.23.7	come, denounce Israel!” 
NUM.23.8	How can I curse someone God has not cursed?
NUM.23.8	How can I denounce someone the 
NUM.23.9	I see them from the top of rocky cliffs,
NUM.23.9	and I watch them from the hills.
NUM.23.9	There is a people living alone;
NUM.23.9	it does not consider itself among the nations.
NUM.23.10	Who has counted the dust of Jacob
NUM.23.10	or numbered even one-fourth of Israel?
NUM.23.10	Let me die the death of the upright;
NUM.23.10	let the end of my life be like theirs.
NUM.23.11	“What have you done to me?” Balak asked Balaam. “I brought you to curse my enemies, but look, you have only blessed them!”
NUM.23.12	He answered, “Shouldn’t I say exactly what the 
NUM.23.13	Then Balak said to him, “Please come with me to another place
NUM.23.14	So Balak took him to Lookout Field
NUM.23.15	Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here by your burnt offering while I seek the 
NUM.23.16	The 
NUM.23.17	So he returned to Balak, who was standing there by his burnt offering with the officials of Moab. Balak asked him, “What did the 
NUM.23.18	Balaam proclaimed his poem:
NUM.23.18	Balak, get up and listen;
NUM.23.18	son of Zippor, pay attention to what I say!
NUM.23.19	God is not a man, that he might lie,
NUM.23.19	or a son of man, that he might change his mind.
NUM.23.19	Does he speak and not act,
NUM.23.19	or promise and not fulfill?
NUM.23.20	I have indeed received a command to bless;
NUM.23.20	since he has blessed,
NUM.23.21	He considers no disaster for Jacob;
NUM.23.21	he sees no trouble for Israel.
NUM.23.21	The 
NUM.23.21	and there is rejoicing over the King among them.
NUM.23.22	God brought them out of Egypt;
NUM.23.22	he is like the horns of a wild ox for them.
NUM.23.23	There is no magic curse against Jacob
NUM.23.23	and no divination against Israel.
NUM.23.23	It will now be said about Jacob and Israel,
NUM.23.23	“What great things God has done!”
NUM.23.24	A people rise up like a lioness;
NUM.23.24	they rouse themselves like a lion.
NUM.23.24	They will not lie down until they devour the prey
NUM.23.24	and drink the blood of the slain.
NUM.23.25	Then Balak told Balaam, “Don’t curse them and don’t bless them!”
NUM.23.26	But Balaam answered him, “Didn’t I tell you: Whatever the 
NUM.23.27	Again Balak said to Balaam, “Please come. I will take you to another place. Maybe it will be agreeable to God that you can put a curse on them for me there.” 
NUM.23.28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, which overlooks the wasteland.
NUM.23.29	Balaam told Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me.”
NUM.23.30	So Balak did as Balaam said and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
NUM.24.1	Since Balaam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	When Balaam looked up and saw Israel encamped tribe by tribe, the Spirit of God
NUM.24.3	and he proclaimed his poem:
NUM.24.3	The oracle of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.3	the oracle of the man whose eyes are opened,
NUM.24.4	the oracle of one who hears the sayings of God,
NUM.24.4	who sees a vision from the Almighty,
NUM.24.4	who falls into a trance with his eyes uncovered:
NUM.24.5	How beautiful are your tents, Jacob,
NUM.24.5	your dwellings, Israel.
NUM.24.6	They stretch out like river valleys,
NUM.24.6	like gardens beside a stream,
NUM.24.6	like aloes the 
NUM.24.6	like cedars beside the water.
NUM.24.7	Water will flow from his buckets,
NUM.24.7	and his seed will be by abundant water.
NUM.24.7	His king will be greater than Agag,
NUM.24.7	and his kingdom will be exalted.
NUM.24.8	God brought him out of Egypt;
NUM.24.8	he is like
NUM.24.8	He will feed on enemy nations
NUM.24.8	and gnaw their bones;
NUM.24.8	he will strike them with his arrows.
NUM.24.9	He crouches, he lies down like a lion
NUM.24.9	or a lioness — who dares to rouse him?
NUM.24.9	Those who bless you will be blessed,
NUM.24.9	and those who curse you will be cursed.
NUM.24.10	Then Balak became furious with Balaam, struck his hands together, and said to him, “I summoned you to put a curse on my enemies, but instead, you have blessed them these three times. 
NUM.24.11	Now go to your home! I said I would reward you richly,
NUM.24.12	Balaam answered Balak, “Didn’t I previously tell the messengers you sent me: 
NUM.24.13	If Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go against the 
NUM.24.14	Now I am going back to my people, but first, let me warn you what these people will do to your people in the future.”
NUM.24.15	Then he proclaimed his poem:
NUM.24.15	The oracle of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.15	the oracle of the man whose eyes are opened;
NUM.24.16	the oracle of one who hears the sayings of God
NUM.24.16	and has knowledge from the Most High,
NUM.24.16	who sees a vision from the Almighty,
NUM.24.16	who falls into a trance with his eyes uncovered:
NUM.24.17	I see him, but not now;
NUM.24.17	I perceive him, but not near.
NUM.24.17	A star will come from Jacob,
NUM.24.17	and a scepter will arise from Israel.
NUM.24.17	He will smash the forehead
NUM.24.17	and strike down
NUM.24.18	Edom will become a possession;
NUM.24.18	Seir
NUM.24.18	but Israel will be triumphant.
NUM.24.19	One who comes from Jacob will rule;

NUM.32.4	which the 
NUM.32.5	They said, “If we have found favor with you, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Don’t make us cross the Jordan.”
NUM.32.6	But Moses asked the Gadites and Reubenites, “Should your brothers go to war while you stay here? 
NUM.32.7	Why are you discouraging the Israelites from crossing into the land the 
NUM.32.8	That’s what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
NUM.32.9	After they went up as far as Eshcol Valley and saw the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land the

NUM.32.15	If you turn back from following him,
NUM.32.16	Then they approached him and said, “We want to build sheep pens here for our livestock and cities for our dependents. 
NUM.32.17	But we will arm ourselves and be ready to go ahead of the Israelites until we have brought them into their place.
NUM.32.18	We will not return to our homes until each of the Israelites has taken possession of his inheritance.
NUM.32.19	Yet we will not have an inheritance with them across the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance will be across the Jordan to the east.”
NUM.32.20	Moses replied to them, “If you do this — if you arm yourselves for battle before the 
NUM.32.21	and every one of your armed men crosses the Jordan before the

NUM.32.31	The Gadites and Reubenites replied, “What the 
NUM.32.32	We will cross over in battle formation before the 
NUM.32.33	So Moses gave them — the Gadites, Reubenites, and half the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph — the kingdom of King Sihon of the Amorites and the kingdom of King Og of Bashan, the land including its cities with the territories surrounding them.

NUM.36.13	These are the commands and ordinances the 
DEU.1.1	These are the words Moses spoke to all Israel across the Jordan in the wilderness,
DEU.1.2	It is an eleven-day journey from Horeb
DEU.1.3	In the fortieth year,
DEU.1.4	This was after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.
DEU.1.5	Across the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying:
DEU.1.6	“The 
DEU.1.7	Resume your journey and go to the hill country of the Amorites
DEU.1.8	See, I have set the land before you. Enter and take possession of the land
DEU.1.9	“I said to you at that time: I can’t bear the responsibility for you on my own. 
DEU.1.10	The 
DEU.1.11	May the 
DEU.1.12	But how can I bear your troubles, burdens, and disputes by myself? 
DEU.1.13	Appoint for yourselves wise, understanding, and respected men from each of your tribes, and I will make them your leaders.
DEU.1.14	“You replied to me, ‘What you propose to do is good.’
DEU.1.15	“So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and respected men, and set them over you as leaders: commanders for thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens, and officers for your tribes. 
DEU.1.16	I commanded your judges at that time: Hear the cases between your brothers, and judge rightly between a man and his brother or his resident alien. 
DEU.1.17	Do not show partiality when deciding a case;
DEU.1.18	At that time I commanded you about all the things you were to do.
DEU.1.19	“We then set out from Horeb and went across all the great and terrible wilderness you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the 
DEU.1.20	I said to you: You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the 
DEU.1.21	See, the 
DEU.1.22	“Then
DEU.1.23	The plan seemed good to me, so I selected twelve men from among you, one man for each tribe. 
DEU.1.24	They left and went up into the hill country and came to the Valley of Eshcol, scouting the land. 
DEU.1.25	They took some of the fruit from the land in their hands, carried it down to us, and brought us back a report: ‘The land the

DEU.1.35	‘None of these men in this evil generation will see the good land I swore to give your fathers,
DEU.1.36	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh. He will see it, and I will give him and his descendants the land on which he has set foot, because he remained loyal to the

DEU.2.5	Don’t provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even a foot of it,

DEU.2.10	The Emim, a great and numerous people as tall as the Anakim,

DEU.2.12	The Horites
DEU.2.13	“The 
DEU.2.14	The time we spent traveling from Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley was thirty-eight years until the entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp, as the 
DEU.2.15	Indeed, the 
DEU.2.16	“When all the fighting men had died among the people, 
DEU.2.17	the 
DEU.2.18	‘Today you are going to cross the border of Moab at Ar. 
DEU.2.19	When you get close to the Ammonites, don’t show any hostility to them or provoke them, for I will not give you any of the Ammonites’ land as a possession; I have given it as a possession to the descendants of Lot.’”
DEU.2.20	This too used to be regarded as the land of the Rephaim. The Rephaim lived there previously, though the Ammonites called them Zamzummim,
DEU.2.21	a great and numerous people, tall as the Anakim. The 
DEU.2.22	This was just as he had done for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them; they drove them out and have lived in their place until now. 
DEU.2.23	The Caphtorim, who came from Caphtor,
DEU.2.24	“The 
DEU.2.25	Today I will begin to put the fear and dread of you on the peoples everywhere under heaven. They will hear the report about you, tremble, and be in anguish because of you.’
DEU.2.26	“So I sent messengers with an offer of peace
DEU.2.27	‘Let us travel through your land; we will keep strictly to the highway. We will not turn to the right or the left.
DEU.2.28	You can sell us food in exchange for silver so we may eat, and give us water for silver so we may drink. Only let us travel through on foot, 
DEU.2.29	just as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir did for us, and the Moabites who live in Ar, until we cross the Jordan into the land the 
DEU.2.30	But King Sihon of Heshbon would not let us travel through his land, for the 
DEU.2.31	“Then the 
DEU.2.32	So Sihon and his whole army came out against us for battle at Jahaz. 
DEU.2.33	The 
DEU.2.34	At that time we captured all his cities and completely destroyed the people of every city, including the women and children. We left no survivors.
DEU.2.35	We took only the livestock and the spoil from the cities we captured as plunder for ourselves. 
DEU.2.36	There was no city that was inaccessible to
DEU.2.37	But you did not go near the Ammonites’ land, all along the bank of the Jabbok River,
DEU.3.1	“Then we turned and went up the road to Bashan, and King Og of Bashan
DEU.3.2	But the 
DEU.3.3	So the 
DEU.3.4	We captured all his cities at that time. There wasn’t a city that we didn’t take from them: sixty cities, the entire region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	All these were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides a large number of rural villages. 
DEU.3.6	We completely destroyed them, as we had done to King Sihon of Heshbon, destroying the men, women, and children of every city. 
DEU.3.7	But we took all the livestock and the spoil from the cities as plunder for ourselves.
DEU.3.8	“At that time we took the land from the two Amorite kings across the Jordan,
DEU.3.9	which the Sidonians call Sirion, but the Amorites call Senir, 
DEU.3.10	all the cities of the plateau, Gilead, and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of Og’s kingdom in Bashan.
DEU.3.11	(Only King Og of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Rephaim.
DEU.3.12	“At that time we took possession of this land.
DEU.3.13	I gave to half the tribe of Manasseh the rest of Gilead and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og. The entire region of Argob, the whole territory of Bashan, used to be called the land of the Rephaim. 
DEU.3.14	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took over the entire region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. He called Bashan by his own name, Jair’s Villages,
DEU.3.15	I gave Gilead to Machir, 
DEU.3.16	and I gave to the Reubenites and Gadites the area extending from Gilead to the Arnon Valley (the middle of the valley was the border) and up to the Jabbok River, the border of the Ammonites.

DEU.3.19	But your wives, dependents, and livestock — I know that you have a lot of livestock — will remain in the cities I have given you
DEU.3.20	until the 
DEU.3.21	“I commanded Joshua at that time: Your own eyes have seen everything the 
DEU.3.22	Don’t be afraid of them, for the 
DEU.3.23	“At that time I begged the 
DEU.3.24	Lord 
DEU.3.25	Please let me cross over and see the beautiful land
DEU.3.26	“But the 
DEU.3.27	Go to the top of Pisgah and look to the west, north, south, and east, and see it with your own eyes, for you will not cross the Jordan.
DEU.3.28	But commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will cross over ahead of the people and enable them to inherit this land that you will see.’
DEU.3.29	So we stayed in the valley facing Beth-peor.
DEU.4.1	“Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances
DEU.4.2	You must not add anything to what I command you or take anything away from it,
DEU.4.3	Your eyes have seen what the 
DEU.4.4	But you who have remained faithful
DEU.4.5	Look, I have taught you statutes and ordinances as the 
DEU.4.6	Carefully follow them, for this will show your wisdom and understanding in the eyes of the peoples. When they hear about all these statutes, they will say, ‘This great nation is indeed a wise and understanding people.’ 
DEU.4.7	For what great nation is there that has a god near to it as the 
DEU.4.8	And what great nation has righteous statutes and ordinances like this entire law I set before you today?
DEU.4.9	“Only be on your guard and diligently watch yourselves,
DEU.4.10	The day you stood before the 
DEU.4.11	You came near and stood at the base of the mountain,
DEU.4.12	Then the 
DEU.4.13	He declared his covenant
DEU.4.14	At that time the 
DEU.4.15	“Diligently watch yourselves — because you did not see any form on the day the 
DEU.4.16	so you don’t act corruptly and make an idol for yourselves in the shape of any figure: a male or female form, 
DEU.4.17	or the form of any animal on the earth, any winged creature that flies in the sky, 
DEU.4.18	any creature that crawls on the ground, or any fish in the waters under the earth. 
DEU.4.19	When you look to the heavens and see the sun, moon, and stars — all the stars in the sky — do not be led astray to bow in worship to them and serve them.
DEU.4.20	But the 
DEU.4.21	“The 
DEU.4.22	I won’t be crossing the Jordan because I am going to die in this land.
DEU.4.23	Be careful not to forget the covenant of the 
DEU.4.24	For the 
DEU.4.25	“When you have children and grandchildren and have been in the land a long time, and if you act corruptly, make an idol in the form of anything, and do what is evil in the sight of the 
DEU.4.26	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that you will quickly perish
DEU.4.27	The 
DEU.4.28	There you will worship man-made gods of wood and stone, which cannot see, hear, eat, or smell. 
DEU.4.29	But from there, you will search for the 
DEU.4.30	When you are in distress and all these things have happened to you, in the future you will return to the 
DEU.4.31	He will not leave you, destroy you, or forget the covenant
DEU.4.32	“Indeed, ask about the earlier days that preceded you, from the day God created mankind
DEU.4.33	Has a people heard God’s voice speaking from the fire as you have, and lived? 
DEU.4.34	Or has a god attempted to go and take a nation as his own out of another nation, by trials, signs, wonders, and war, by a strong hand and an outstretched arm, by great terrors, as the 
DEU.4.35	You were shown these things so that you would know that the 
DEU.4.36	He let you hear his voice from heaven to instruct you.
DEU.4.37	Because he loved
DEU.4.38	to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you in and give you their land as an inheritance,
DEU.4.39	Today, recognize and keep in mind that the 
DEU.4.40	Keep his statutes and commands, which I am giving you today, so that you and your children after you may prosper and so that you may live long in the land the 
DEU.4.41	Then Moses set apart three cities across the Jordan to the east. 
DEU.4.42	Someone could flee there who committed manslaughter, killing his neighbor accidentally without previously hating him. He could flee to one of these cities and stay alive: 
DEU.4.43	Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau land, belonging to the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead, belonging to the Gadites; or Golan in Bashan, belonging to the Manassites.
DEU.4.44	This is the law Moses gave the Israelites. 
DEU.4.45	These are the decrees, statutes, and ordinances Moses proclaimed to them after they came out of Egypt, 
DEU.4.46	across the Jordan in the valley facing Beth-peor in the land of King Sihon of the Amorites. He lived in Heshbon, and Moses and the Israelites defeated him after they came out of Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings who were across the Jordan to the east, 
DEU.4.48	from Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon) 
DEU.4.49	and all the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the Dead Sea below the slopes of Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “Israel, listen to the statutes and ordinances I am proclaiming as you hear them today. Learn and follow them carefully. 
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	He did not make this covenant with our fathers,

DEU.5.5	At that time I was standing between the

DEU.5.12	Be careful to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy as the 
DEU.5.13	You are to labor six days and do all your work, 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the 
DEU.5.15	Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the 
DEU.5.16	Honor your father and your mother,
DEU.5.17	Do not murder.
DEU.5.18	Do not commit adultery.
DEU.5.19	Do not steal.
DEU.5.20	Do not give dishonest testimony against your neighbor.
DEU.5.21	Do not covet your neighbor’s wife or desire your neighbor’s house, his field, his male or female slave, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.
DEU.5.22	“The 
DEU.5.23	All of you approached me with your tribal leaders and elders when you heard the voice from the darkness and while the mountain was blazing with fire. 
DEU.5.24	You said, ‘Look, the 
DEU.5.25	But now, why should we die? This great fire will consume us and we will die if we hear the voice of the 
DEU.5.26	For who out of all mankind has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the fire, as we have, and lived? 
DEU.5.27	Go near and listen to everything the 
DEU.5.28	“The 
DEU.5.29	If only they had such a heart to fear me and keep all my commands always, so that they and their children would prosper forever. 
DEU.5.30	Go and tell them: Return to your tents. 
DEU.5.31	But you stand here with me, and I will tell you every command — the statutes and ordinances — you are to teach them, so that they may follow them in the land I am giving them to possess.’

DEU.7.25	Burn up the carved images of their gods. Don’t covet the silver and gold on the images and take it for yourself, or else you will be ensnared by it, for it is detestable to the 
DEU.7.26	Do not bring any detestable thing into your house, or you will be set apart for destruction like it. You are to abhor and detest it utterly because it is set apart for destruction.
DEU.8.1	“Carefully follow every command I am giving you today, so that you may live and increase, and may enter and take possession of the land
DEU.8.2	Remember that the 
DEU.8.3	He humbled you by letting you go hungry; then he gave you manna to eat, which you and your fathers had not known, so that you might learn that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the

DEU.9.4	When the 
DEU.9.5	You are not going to take possession of their land because of your righteousness or your integrity. Instead, the 
DEU.9.6	Understand that the 
DEU.9.7	“Remember
DEU.9.8	You provoked the 
DEU.9.9	When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets of the covenant
DEU.9.10	On the day of the assembly the 
DEU.9.11	The 
DEU.9.12	“The 
DEU.9.13	The 
DEU.9.14	Leave me alone, and I will destroy them and blot out their name under heaven.
DEU.9.15	“So I went back down the mountain, while it was blazing with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands. 
DEU.9.16	I saw how you had sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my hands, shattering them before your eyes.
DEU.9.18	I fell down like the first time in the presence of the 
DEU.9.19	I was afraid of the fierce anger the 
DEU.9.20	The 
DEU.9.21	I took the sinful calf you had made and burned it. I crushed it, thoroughly grinding it to powder as fine as dust, and threw its dust into the stream that came down from the mountain.
DEU.9.22	“You continued to provoke the 
DEU.9.23	When the 
DEU.9.24	You have been rebelling against the 
DEU.9.25	“I fell down in the presence of the 
DEU.9.26	I prayed to the 
DEU.9.26	Lord 
DEU.9.27	Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Disregard this people’s stubbornness, and their wickedness and sin. 
DEU.9.28	Otherwise, those in the land you brought us from will say, ‘Because the 
DEU.9.29	But they are your people, your inheritance, whom you brought out by your great power and outstretched arm.
DEU.10.1	“The 
DEU.10.2	I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets you broke, and you are to place them in the ark.’ 
DEU.10.3	So I made an ark of acacia wood,
DEU.10.4	Then on the day of the assembly, the 
DEU.10.5	and I went back down the mountain and placed the tablets in the ark I had made. And they have remained there, as the 
DEU.10.6	The Israelites traveled from Beeroth Bene-jaakan

DEU.10.8	“At that time the

DEU.10.18	He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the resident alien, giving him food and clothing.
DEU.10.19	You are also to love the resident alien, since you were resident aliens in the land of Egypt.
DEU.10.20	You are to fear the 
DEU.10.21	He is your praise and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awe-inspiring works your eyes have seen.

DEU.11.4	what he did to Egypt’s army, its horses and chariots, when he made the water of the Red Sea flow over them as they pursued you, and he destroyed them
DEU.11.5	what he did to you in the wilderness until you reached this place; 
DEU.11.6	and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when in the middle of the whole Israelite camp the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing with them.

DEU.25.3	He may be flogged with forty lashes, but no more. Otherwise, if he is flogged with more lashes than these, your brother will be degraded in your sight.

DEU.25.6	The first son she bears will carry on the name of the dead brother, so his name will not be blotted out from Israel.
DEU.25.7	But if the man doesn’t want to marry his sister-in-law, she is to go to the elders at the city gate
DEU.25.8	The elders of his city will summon him and speak with him. If he persists and says, ‘I don’t want to marry her,’ 
DEU.25.9	then his sister-in-law will go up to him in the sight of the elders, remove his sandal from his foot, and spit in his face. Then she will declare, ‘This is what is done to a man who will not build up his brother’s house.’

DEU.29.1	These are the words of the covenant
DEU.29.2	Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “You have seen with your own eyes
DEU.29.3	You saw with your own eyes the great trials and those great signs and wonders.
DEU.29.4	Yet to this day the 
DEU.29.5	I led you forty years in the wilderness; your clothes and the sandals on your feet did not wear out;
DEU.29.6	you did not eat food or drink wine or beer — so that you might know that I am the 
DEU.29.7	When you reached this place, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out against us in battle, but we defeated them.
DEU.29.8	We took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
DEU.29.9	Therefore, observe the words of this covenant
DEU.29.10	“All of you are standing today before the 
DEU.29.11	your dependents, your wives, and the resident aliens in your camps who cut your wood and draw your water —  
DEU.29.12	so that you may enter into the covenant of the 
DEU.29.13	and so that he may establish you today as his people and he may be your God as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
DEU.29.14	I am making this covenant and this oath not only with you, 
DEU.29.15	but also with those who are standing here with us today in the presence of the 
DEU.29.16	“Indeed, you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and passed through the nations where you traveled. 
DEU.29.17	You saw their abhorrent images and idols made of wood, stone, silver, and gold, which were among them.

DEU.30.12	It is not in heaven so that you have to ask, ‘Who will go up to heaven, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it?’ 
DEU.30.13	And it is not across the sea so that you have to ask, ‘Who will cross the sea, get it for us, and proclaim it to us so that we may follow it?’ 
DEU.30.14	But the message is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may follow it.
DEU.30.15	See, today I have set before you life and prosperity, death and adversity.
DEU.30.16	For
DEU.30.17	But if your heart turns away and you do not listen and you are led astray to bow in worship to other gods and serve them, 
DEU.30.18	I tell you today that you will certainly perish and will not prolong your days in the land you are entering to possess across the Jordan. 
DEU.30.19	I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Choose life

DEU.31.5	The 
DEU.31.6	Be strong and courageous;

DEU.31.9	Moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the

DEU.31.11	when all Israel assembles
DEU.31.12	Gather the people — men, women, dependents, and the resident aliens within your city gates — so that they may listen and learn to fear

DEU.31.19	Therefore write down this song
DEU.31.20	When I bring them into the land I swore to give their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey,
DEU.31.21	And when many troubles and afflictions come to them, this song will testify against them, because
DEU.31.22	So Moses wrote down this song on that day and taught it to the Israelites.
DEU.31.23	The 
DEU.31.24	When Moses had finished writing down on a scroll every single word
DEU.31.25	he commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the 
DEU.31.26	“Take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know how rebellious and stiff-necked you are. If you are rebelling against the 
DEU.31.28	Assemble all your tribal elders and officers before me so that I may speak these words directly to them and call heaven and earth as witnesses against them.
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death you will become completely corrupt and turn from the path I have commanded you. Disaster will come to you in the future, because you will do what is evil in the 
DEU.31.30	Then Moses recited aloud every single word
DEU.32.1	Pay attention, heavens, and I will speak;
DEU.32.1	listen, earth, to the words from my mouth.
DEU.32.2	Let my teaching fall like rain
DEU.32.2	and my word settle like dew,
DEU.32.2	like gentle rain on new grass
DEU.32.2	and showers on tender plants.
DEU.32.3	For I will proclaim the 
DEU.32.3	Declare the greatness of our God!
DEU.32.4	The Rock
DEU.32.4	all his ways are just.
DEU.32.4	A faithful God,
DEU.32.4	he is righteous and true.
DEU.32.5	His people have acted corruptly toward him;
DEU.32.5	this is their defect
DEU.32.5	but a devious and crooked generation.
DEU.32.6	Is this how you repay the 
DEU.32.6	you foolish and senseless people?
DEU.32.6	Isn’t he your Father and Creator?
DEU.32.6	Didn’t he make you and sustain you?
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of old;
DEU.32.7	consider the years of past generations.
DEU.32.7	Ask your father, and he will tell you,
DEU.32.7	your elders, and they will teach you.
DEU.32.8	When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance
DEU.32.8	and divided the human race,
DEU.32.8	he set the boundaries of the peoples
DEU.32.8	according to the number of the people of Israel.
DEU.32.9	But the 
DEU.32.9	Jacob, his own inheritance.
DEU.32.10	He found him in a desolate land,
DEU.32.10	in a barren, howling wilderness;
DEU.32.10	he surrounded him, cared for him,
DEU.32.10	and protected him as the pupil of his eye.
DEU.32.11	He watches over
DEU.32.11	and hovers over his young;
DEU.32.11	he spreads his wings, catches him,
DEU.32.11	and carries him on his feathers.
DEU.32.12	The 
DEU.32.12	with no help from a foreign god.
DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the heights of the land
DEU.32.13	and eat the produce of the field.
DEU.32.13	He nourished him with honey from the rock
DEU.32.13	and oil from flinty rock,
DEU.32.14	curds from the herd and milk from the flock,
DEU.32.14	with the fat of lambs,
DEU.32.14	rams from Bashan,
DEU.32.14	with the choicest grains of wheat;
DEU.32.14	you drank wine from the finest grapes.
DEU.32.15	Then
DEU.32.15	you became fat, bloated, and gorged.
DEU.32.15	He abandoned the God who made him
DEU.32.15	and scorned the Rock of his salvation.
DEU.32.16	They provoked his jealousy with different gods;
DEU.32.16	they enraged him with detestable practices.
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed to demons, not God,
DEU.32.17	to gods they had not known,
DEU.32.17	new gods that had just arrived,
DEU.32.17	which your fathers did not fear.
DEU.32.18	You ignored the Rock who gave you birth;
DEU.32.18	you forgot the God who gave birth to you.
DEU.32.19	When the 
DEU.32.19	angered by his sons and daughters.
DEU.32.20	He said: “I will hide my face from them;
DEU.32.20	I will see what will become of them,
DEU.32.20	for they are a perverse generation —
DEU.32.20	unfaithful children.
DEU.32.21	They have provoked my jealousy
DEU.32.21	with what is not a god;
DEU.32.21	they have enraged me with their worthless idols.
DEU.32.21	So I will provoke their jealousy
DEU.32.21	with what is not a people;
DEU.32.21	I will enrage them with a foolish nation.
DEU.32.22	For fire has been kindled because of my anger
DEU.32.22	and burns to the depths of Sheol;
DEU.32.22	it devours the land and its produce,
DEU.32.22	and scorches the foundations of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	“I will pile disasters on them;
DEU.32.23	I will use up my arrows against them.
DEU.32.24	They will be weak from hunger,
DEU.32.24	ravaged by pestilence and bitter plague;
DEU.32.24	I will unleash on them wild beasts with fangs,
DEU.32.24	as well as venomous snakes that slither in the dust.
DEU.32.25	Outside, the sword will take their children,
DEU.32.25	and inside, there will be terror;
DEU.32.25	the young man and the young woman will be killed,
DEU.32.25	the infant and the gray-haired man.
DEU.32.26	“I would have said: I will cut them to pieces
DEU.32.26	and blot out the memory of them from mankind,
DEU.32.27	if I had not feared provocation from the enemy,
DEU.32.27	or feared that these foes might misunderstand
DEU.32.27	and say: ‘Our own hand has prevailed;
DEU.32.27	it wasn’t the 
DEU.32.28	Israel is a nation lacking sense
DEU.32.28	with no understanding at all.
DEU.32.29	If only they were wise, they would comprehend this;
DEU.32.29	they would understand their fate.
DEU.32.30	How could one pursue a thousand,
DEU.32.30	or two put ten thousand to flight,
DEU.32.30	unless their Rock had sold them,
DEU.32.30	unless the 
DEU.32.31	But their “rock” is not like our Rock,
DEU.32.31	as even our enemies concede.
DEU.32.32	For their vine is from the vine of Sodom
DEU.32.32	and from the fields of Gomorrah.
DEU.32.32	Their grapes are poisonous;
DEU.32.32	their clusters are bitter.
DEU.32.33	Their wine is serpents’ venom,
DEU.32.33	the deadly poison of cobras.
DEU.32.34	“Is it not stored up with me,
DEU.32.34	sealed up in my vaults?
DEU.32.35	Vengeance
DEU.32.35	In time their foot will slip,
DEU.32.35	for their day of disaster is near,
DEU.32.35	and their doom is coming quickly.”
DEU.32.36	The 
DEU.32.36	and have compassion on his servants
DEU.32.36	when he sees that their strength is gone
DEU.32.36	and no one is left — slave or free.
DEU.32.37	He will say: “Where are their gods,
DEU.32.37	the ‘rock’ they found refuge in?
DEU.32.38	Who ate the fat of their sacrifices
DEU.32.38	and drank the wine of their drink offerings?
DEU.32.38	Let them rise up and help you;
DEU.32.38	let it
DEU.32.39	See now that I alone am he;
DEU.32.39	there is no God but me.
DEU.32.39	I bring death and I give life;
DEU.32.39	I wound and I heal.
DEU.32.39	No one can rescue anyone from my power.
DEU.32.40	I raise my hand to heaven and declare:
DEU.32.40	As surely as I live forever,
DEU.32.41	when I sharpen my flashing sword,
DEU.32.41	and my hand takes hold of judgment,
DEU.32.41	I will take vengeance on my adversaries
DEU.32.41	and repay those who hate me.
DEU.32.42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood
DEU.32.42	while my sword devours flesh —
DEU.32.42	the blood of the slain and the captives,
DEU.32.42	the heads of the enemy leaders.”
DEU.32.43	Rejoice, you nations, concerning his people,
DEU.32.43	for he will avenge the blood of his servants.
DEU.32.43	He will take vengeance on his adversaries;
DEU.32.43	he will purify his land and his people.
DEU.32.44	Moses came with Joshua
DEU.32.45	After Moses finished reciting all these words to all Israel, 
DEU.32.46	he said to them, “Take to heart all these words I am giving as a warning to you today,
DEU.32.47	For they are not meaningless words to you but they are your life,
DEU.32.48	On that same day the 
DEU.32.49	“Go up Mount Nebo
DEU.32.50	Then you will die on the mountain that you go up, and you will be gathered to your people,
DEU.32.51	For both of you broke faith with me among the Israelites at the Waters of Meribath-kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin by failing to treat me as holy in their presence. 
DEU.32.52	Although from a distance you will view the land that I am giving the Israelites, you will not go there.”
DEU.33.1	This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave the Israelites before his death.
DEU.33.2	He said:
DEU.33.2	The 
DEU.33.2	and appeared to them from Seir;
DEU.33.2	he shone on them from Mount Paran
DEU.33.2	and came with ten thousand holy ones,
DEU.33.2	with lightning
DEU.33.3	Indeed he loves the people.
DEU.33.3	All your
DEU.33.3	and they assemble
DEU.33.3	Each receives your words.
DEU.33.4	Moses gave us instruction,
DEU.33.4	a possession for the assembly of Jacob.
DEU.33.5	So he became King in Jeshurun
DEU.33.5	when the leaders of the people gathered
DEU.33.5	with the tribes of Israel.
DEU.33.6	Let Reuben live and not die
DEU.33.6	though his people become few.
DEU.33.7	He said this about Judah:
DEU.33.7	He fights for his cause
DEU.33.7	but may you be a help against his foes.
DEU.33.8	He said about Levi:
DEU.33.8	Your Thummim and Urim
DEU.33.8	you tested him at Massah
DEU.33.8	and contended with him at the Waters of Meribah.
DEU.33.9	He said about his father and mother,
DEU.33.9	“I do not regard them.”
DEU.33.9	He disregarded his brothers
DEU.33.9	and didn’t acknowledge his sons,
DEU.33.9	for they kept your word
DEU.33.9	and maintained your covenant.
DEU.33.10	They will teach your ordinances to Jacob
DEU.33.10	and your instruction to Israel;
DEU.33.10	they will set incense before you
DEU.33.10	and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
DEU.33.11	and accept the work of his hands.
DEU.33.11	Break the back
DEU.33.11	so that they cannot rise again.
DEU.33.12	He said about Benjamin:
DEU.33.12	The 
DEU.33.12	He
DEU.33.12	and he rests on his shoulders.
DEU.33.13	He said about Joseph:
DEU.33.13	May his land be blessed by the 
DEU.33.13	with the dew of heaven’s bounty
DEU.33.13	and the watery depths that lie beneath;
DEU.33.14	with the bountiful harvest from the sun
DEU.33.14	and the abundant yield of the seasons;
DEU.33.15	with the best products of the ancient mountains
DEU.33.15	and the bounty of the eternal hills;
DEU.33.16	with the choice gifts of the land
DEU.33.16	and everything in it;
DEU.33.16	and with the favor of him
DEU.33.16	who appeared
DEU.33.16	May these rest on the head of Joseph,
DEU.33.16	on the brow of the prince of his brothers.
DEU.33.17	His firstborn bull has
DEU.33.17	and horns like
DEU.33.17	he gores all the peoples with them
DEU.33.17	to the ends of the earth.
DEU.33.17	Such are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
DEU.33.17	and such are the thousands of Manasseh.
DEU.33.18	He said about Zebulun:
DEU.33.18	Rejoice, Zebulun, in your journeys,
DEU.33.18	and Issachar, in your tents.
DEU.33.19	They summon the peoples to a mountain;
DEU.33.19	there they offer acceptable sacrifices.
DEU.33.19	For they draw from the wealth of the seas
DEU.33.19	and the hidden treasures of the sand.
DEU.33.20	He said about Gad:
DEU.33.20	The one who enlarges Gad’s territory
DEU.33.20	will be blessed.
DEU.33.20	He lies down like a lion
DEU.33.20	and tears off an arm or even a head.
DEU.33.21	He chose the best part for himself,
DEU.33.21	because a ruler’s portion was assigned there for him.
DEU.33.21	He came with the leaders of the people;
DEU.33.21	he carried out the 
DEU.33.21	and his ordinances for Israel.
DEU.33.22	He said about Dan:
DEU.33.22	Dan is a young lion,
DEU.33.22	leaping out of Bashan.
DEU.33.23	He said about Naphtali:
DEU.33.23	Naphtali, enjoying approval,
DEU.33.23	full of the 
DEU.33.23	take
DEU.33.24	He said about Asher:
DEU.33.24	May Asher
DEU.33.24	may he be the most favored among his brothers
DEU.33.24	and dip his foot in olive oil.
DEU.33.25	May the bolts of your gate be iron and bronze,
DEU.33.25	and your strength last as long as you live.
DEU.33.26	There is none like the God of Jeshurun,
DEU.33.26	who rides the heavens to your aid,
DEU.33.26	the clouds in his majesty.
DEU.33.27	The God of old is your dwelling place,
DEU.33.27	and underneath are the everlasting arms.
DEU.33.27	He drives out the enemy before you
DEU.33.27	and commands, “Destroy!”
DEU.33.28	So Israel dwells securely;
DEU.33.28	Jacob lives untroubled
DEU.33.28	in a land of grain and new wine;
DEU.33.28	even his skies drip with dew.
DEU.33.29	How happy you are, Israel!
DEU.33.29	Who is like you,
DEU.33.29	a people saved by the 
DEU.33.29	He is the shield that protects you,
DEU.33.29	the sword you boast in.
DEU.33.29	Your enemies will cringe before you,
DEU.33.29	and you will tread on their backs.
DEU.34.1	Then Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah,
DEU.34.2	all of Naphtali, the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean
DEU.34.3	the Negev, and the plain in the Valley of Jericho, the City of Palms, as far as Zoar. 
DEU.34.4	The 
DEU.34.5	So Moses the servant of the 
DEU.34.6	He buried him
DEU.34.7	Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died; his eyes were not weak, and his vitality had not left him. 
DEU.34.8	The Israelites wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days.
DEU.34.9	Joshua son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom
DEU.34.10	No prophet has arisen again in Israel like Moses, whom the 
DEU.34.11	He was unparalleled for all the signs and wonders the 
DEU.34.12	and for all the mighty acts of power
JOS.1.1	After the death of Moses
JOS.1.2	“Moses my servant is dead.
JOS.1.3	I have given you every place where the sole of your foot treads,
JOS.1.4	Your territory will be from the wilderness and Lebanon
JOS.1.5	No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live.
JOS.1.6	“Be strong and courageous,
JOS.1.7	Above all, be strong and very courageous to observe carefully the whole instruction my servant Moses commanded you.
JOS.1.8	This book of instruction must not depart from your mouth;
JOS.1.9	Haven’t I commanded you: be strong and courageous?
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people: 
JOS.1.11	“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Get provisions ready for yourselves, for within three days you will be crossing the Jordan to go in and take possession of the land the 
JOS.1.12	Joshua said to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh:
JOS.1.13	“Remember what Moses the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, dependents, and livestock may remain in the land Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan. But your best soldiers must cross over in battle formation
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	They answered Joshua, “Everything you have commanded us we will do, and everywhere you send us we will go. 
JOS.1.17	We will obey you, just as we obeyed Moses in everything. Certainly the 
JOS.1.18	Anyone who rebels against your order and does not obey your words in all that you command him, will be put to death. Above all, be strong and courageous!” 
JOS.2.1	Joshua son of Nun secretly sent two men as spies
JOS.2.2	The king of Jericho was told, “Look, some of the Israelite men have come here tonight to investigate the land.” 
JOS.2.3	Then the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab and said, “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house,
JOS.2.4	But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them.
JOS.2.5	At nightfall, when the city gate was about to close, the men went out, and I don’t know where they were going. Chase after them quickly, and you can catch up with them!” 
JOS.2.6	But she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them
JOS.2.7	The men pursued them along the road to the fords of the Jordan, and as soon as they left to pursue them, the city gate was shut.
JOS.2.8	Before the men fell asleep, she went up on the roof 
JOS.2.9	and said to them, “I know that the 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	When we heard this, we lost heart,
JOS.2.12	Now please swear to me by the 
JOS.2.13	that you will spare the lives of my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and all who belong to them, and save us from death.”
JOS.2.14	The men answered her, “We will give our lives for yours. If you don’t report our mission, we will show kindness and faithfulness to you when the 
JOS.2.15	Then she let them down by a rope through the window, since she lived in a house that was built into the wall of the city. 
JOS.2.16	“Go to the hill country so that the men pursuing you won’t find you,” she said to them. “Hide there for three days until they return; afterward, go on your way.”
JOS.2.17	The men said to her, “We will be free from this oath you made us swear, 
JOS.2.18	unless, when we enter the land, you tie this scarlet cord to the window through which you let us down. Bring your father, mother, brothers, and all your father’s family into your house. 
JOS.2.19	If anyone goes out the doors of your house, his death will be his own fault,
JOS.2.20	And if you report our mission, we are free from the oath you made us swear.”
JOS.2.21	“Let it be as you say,” she replied, and she sent them away. After they had gone, she tied the scarlet cord to the window.
JOS.2.22	So the two men went into the hill country and stayed there three days until the pursuers had returned. They searched all along the way, but did not find them. 
JOS.2.23	Then the men returned, came down from the hill country, and crossed the Jordan. They went to Joshua son of Nun and reported everything that had happened to them. 
JOS.2.24	They told Joshua, “The 
JOS.3.1	Joshua started early the next morning and left the Acacia Grove
JOS.3.2	After three days the officers went through the camp
JOS.3.3	and commanded the people: “When you see the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.3.4	But keep a distance of about a thousand yards
JOS.3.5	Joshua told the people, “Consecrate yourselves,
JOS.3.6	Then he said to the priests, “Carry the ark of the covenant and go on ahead of the people.” So they carried the ark of the covenant and went ahead of them.
JOS.3.7	The 
JOS.3.8	Command the priests carrying the ark of the covenant: When you reach the edge of the water,
JOS.3.9	Then Joshua told the Israelites, “Come closer and listen to the words of the 
JOS.3.10	He said: “You will know that the living God is among you
JOS.3.11	when the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth
JOS.3.12	Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.
JOS.3.13	When the feet
JOS.3.14	When the people broke camp to cross the Jordan, the priests carried the ark of the covenant
JOS.3.15	Now the Jordan overflows its banks throughout the harvest season.
JOS.3.16	and the water flowing downstream stood still, rising up in a mass that extended as far as
JOS.3.17	The priests carrying the ark of the 
JOS.4.1	After the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan,
JOS.4.2	“Choose twelve men from the people, one man for each tribe,
JOS.4.3	and command them: Take twelve stones
JOS.4.4	So Joshua summoned the twelve men he had selected from the Israelites, one man for each tribe, 
JOS.4.5	and said to them, “Go across to the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	so that this will be a sign among you. In the future, when your children ask you, ‘What do these stones mean to you? ’ 
JOS.4.7	you should tell them, ‘The water of the Jordan was cut off in front of the ark of the 
JOS.4.8	The Israelites did just as Joshua had commanded them. The twelve men took stones from the middle of the Jordan, one for each
JOS.4.9	Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle
JOS.4.10	The priests carrying the ark continued standing in the middle of the Jordan until everything was completed that the 
JOS.4.11	and after everyone had finished crossing, the priests with the ark of the 
JOS.4.12	The Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh went in battle formation in front of the Israelites,
JOS.4.13	About forty thousand equipped for war crossed to the plains of Jericho in the 
JOS.4.14	On that day the 
JOS.4.15	The 
JOS.4.16	“Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony
JOS.4.17	So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up from the Jordan.” 
JOS.4.18	When the priests carrying the ark of the 
JOS.4.19	The people came up from the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month,
JOS.4.20	Then Joshua set up in Gilgal the twelve stones they had taken from the Jordan, 
JOS.4.21	and he said to the Israelites, “In the future, when your children ask their fathers, ‘What is the meaning of these stones?’ 
JOS.4.22	you should tell your children, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground.’
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	This is so that all the peoples of the earth may know
JOS.5.1	When all the Amorite kings across the Jordan to the west and all the Canaanite kings near the sea
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the Israelite men at Gibeath-haaraloth.
JOS.5.4	This is the reason Joshua circumcised them: All the people who came out of Egypt who were males — all the men of war — had died in the wilderness along the way after they had come out of Egypt. 
JOS.5.5	Though all the people who came out were circumcised, none of the people born in the wilderness along the way were circumcised after they had come out of Egypt. 
JOS.5.6	For the Israelites wandered in the wilderness forty years until all the nation’s men of war who came out of Egypt had died off because they did not obey the 
JOS.5.7	He raised up their sons in their place; it was these Joshua circumcised. They were still uncircumcised, since they had not been circumcised along the way. 
JOS.5.8	After the entire nation had been circumcised, they stayed where they were in the camp until they recovered.
JOS.5.9	The 
JOS.5.10	While the Israelites camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they observed the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month.
JOS.5.11	The day after Passover they ate unleavened bread and roasted grain from the produce of the land.
JOS.5.12	And the day after they ate from the produce of the land, the manna ceased.
JOS.5.13	When Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand.
JOS.5.14	“Neither,” he replied. “I have now come as commander of the 
JOS.5.14	Then Joshua bowed with his face to the ground in worship
JOS.5.15	The commander of the 
JOS.6.1	Now Jericho was strongly fortified because of the Israelites — no one leaving or entering. 
JOS.6.2	The 
JOS.6.3	March around the city with all the men of war, circling the city one time. Do this for six days. 
JOS.6.4	Have seven priests carry seven ram’s-horn trumpets in front of the ark. But on the seventh day, march around the city seven times, while the priests blow the trumpets.
JOS.6.5	When there is a prolonged blast of the horn and you hear its sound, have all the troops give a mighty shout. Then the city wall will collapse, and the troops will advance, each man straight ahead.”
JOS.6.6	So Joshua son of Nun summoned the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant and have seven priests carry seven trumpets in front of the ark of the 
JOS.6.7	He said to the troops, “Move forward, march around the city, and have the armed men go ahead of the ark of the 
JOS.6.8	After Joshua had spoken to the troops, seven priests carrying seven trumpets before the 
JOS.6.9	While the trumpets were blowing, the armed men went in front of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard went behind the ark.
JOS.6.10	But Joshua had commanded the troops: “Do not shout or let your voice be heard. Don’t let one word come out of your mouth until the time I say, ‘Shout! ’ Then you are to shout.” 
JOS.6.11	So the ark of the 
JOS.6.12	Joshua got up early the next morning. The priests took the ark of the 
JOS.6.13	and the seven priests carrying seven trumpets marched in front of the ark of the 
JOS.6.14	On the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp. They did this for six days.
JOS.6.15	Early on the seventh day, they started at dawn and marched around the city seven times in the same way. That was the only day they marched around the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	After the seventh time, the priests blew the trumpets, and Joshua said to the troops, “Shout! For the 
JOS.6.17	But the city and everything in it are set apart to the 
JOS.6.18	But keep yourselves from the things set apart, or you will be set apart for destruction. If you
JOS.6.19	For all the silver and gold, and the articles of bronze and iron, are dedicated to the 
JOS.6.20	So the troops shouted, and the trumpets sounded. When they heard the blast of the trumpet, the troops gave a great shout, and the wall collapsed.
JOS.6.21	They completely destroyed
JOS.6.22	Joshua said to the two men who had scouted the land, “Go to the prostitute’s house and bring the woman out of there, and all who are with her, just as you swore to her.”
JOS.6.23	So the young men who had scouted went in and brought out Rahab and her father, mother, brothers, and all who belonged to her. They brought out her whole family and settled them outside the camp of Israel.
JOS.6.24	They burned the city and everything in it, but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the 
JOS.6.25	However, Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, her father’s family, and all who belonged to her, because she hid the messengers Joshua had sent to spy on Jericho, and she still lives in Israel
JOS.6.26	At that time Joshua imposed this curse:
JOS.6.26	The man who undertakes
JOS.6.26	the rebuilding of this city, Jericho,
JOS.6.26	is cursed before the 
JOS.6.26	He will lay its foundation
JOS.6.26	at the cost of his firstborn;
JOS.6.26	he will finish its gates
JOS.6.26	at the cost of his youngest.
JOS.6.27	And the 
JOS.7.1	The Israelites, however, were unfaithful
JOS.7.2	Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven,
JOS.7.3	After returning to Joshua they reported to him, “Don’t send all the people, but send about two thousand or three thousand
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand men
JOS.7.5	The men of Ai struck down about thirty-six of them and chased them from outside the city gate to the quarries,
JOS.7.6	Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the 
JOS.7.7	“Oh, Lord 
JOS.7.8	What can I say, Lord, now that Israel has turned its back and run from its enemies? 
JOS.7.9	When the Canaanites and all who live in the land hear about this, they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth.
JOS.7.10	The 
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned. They have violated my covenant that I appointed for them. They have taken some of what was set apart. They have stolen, deceived, and put those things with their own belongings.
JOS.7.12	This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They will turn their backs and run from their enemies, because they have been set apart for destruction.
JOS.7.13	“Go and consecrate the people. Tell them to consecrate themselves for tomorrow,
JOS.7.14	In the morning, present yourselves tribe by tribe. The tribe the 
JOS.7.15	The one who is caught with the things set apart must be burned, along with everything he has, because he has violated the 
JOS.7.16	Joshua got up early the next morning. He had Israel come forward tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected. 
JOS.7.17	He had the clans of Judah come forward, and the Zerahite clan was selected. He had the Zerahite clan come forward by heads of families,
JOS.7.18	He then had Zabdi’s family come forward man by man, and Achan son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was selected.
JOS.7.19	So Joshua said to Achan, “My son, give glory to the 
JOS.7.20	Achan replied to Joshua, “It is true. I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	When I saw among the spoils a beautiful cloak from Babylon,
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers who ran to the tent, and there was the cloak, concealed in his tent, with the silver underneath. 
JOS.7.23	They took the things from inside the tent, brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out in the 
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan son of Zerah, the silver, the cloak, and the bar of gold, his sons and daughters, his ox, donkey, and sheep, his tent, and all that he had, and brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
JOS.7.25	Joshua said, “Why have you brought us trouble?
JOS.7.26	and raised over him a large pile of rocks that remains still today.
JOS.8.1	The 
JOS.8.2	Treat Ai and its king as you did Jericho and its king,
JOS.8.3	So Joshua and all the troops set out to attack Ai. Joshua selected thirty thousand of his best soldiers and sent them out at night. 
JOS.8.4	He commanded them: “Pay attention. Lie in ambush behind the city, not too far from it, and all of you be ready.
JOS.8.5	Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. When they come out against us as they did the first time, we will flee from them. 
JOS.8.6	They will come after us until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, ‘They are fleeing from us as before.’ While we are fleeing from them, 
JOS.8.7	you are to come out of your ambush and seize the city. The 
JOS.8.8	After taking the city, set it on fire. Follow the 
JOS.8.9	So Joshua sent them out, and they went to the ambush site and waited between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. But he spent that night with the troops.
JOS.8.10	Joshua started early the next morning and mobilized them. Then he and the elders of Israel led the troops up to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	All those
JOS.8.12	Now Joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city. 
JOS.8.13	The troops were stationed in this way: the main
JOS.8.14	When the king of Ai saw the Israelites, the men of the city hurried and went out early in the morning so that he and all his people could engage Israel in battle at a suitable place facing the Arabah. But he did not know there was an ambush waiting for him behind the city. 
JOS.8.15	Joshua and all Israel pretended to be beaten back by them and fled toward the wilderness.
JOS.8.16	Then all the troops of Ai were summoned to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were drawn away from the city. 
JOS.8.17	Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who did not go out after Israel, leaving the city exposed while they pursued Israel.
JOS.8.18	Then the 
JOS.8.19	When he held out his hand, the men in ambush rose quickly from their position. They ran, entered the city, captured it, and immediately set it on fire.
JOS.8.20	The men of Ai turned and looked back, and smoke from the city was rising to the sky! They could not escape in any direction, and the troops who had fled to the wilderness now became the pursuers. 
JOS.8.21	When Joshua and all Israel saw that the men in ambush had captured the city and that smoke was rising from it, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	Then men in ambush came out of the city against them, and the men of Ai were trapped between the Israelite forces, some on one side and some on the other. They struck them down until no survivor or fugitive remained,
JOS.8.23	but they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	When Israel had finished killing everyone living in Ai who had pursued them into the open country, and when every last one of them had fallen by the sword, all Israel returned to Ai and struck it down with the sword. 
JOS.8.25	The total of those who fell that day, both men and women, was twelve thousand — all the people of Ai. 
JOS.8.26	Joshua did not draw back his hand that was holding the javelin until all the inhabitants of Ai were completely destroyed.
JOS.8.27	Israel plundered only the cattle and spoil of that city for themselves, according to the 
JOS.8.28	Joshua burned Ai and left it a permanent ruin, still desolate today.
JOS.8.29	He hung
JOS.8.30	At that time Joshua built an altar on Mount Ebal
JOS.8.31	just as Moses the 
JOS.8.32	There on the stones, Joshua copied the law of Moses, which he had written in the presence of the Israelites.
JOS.8.33	All Israel — resident alien and citizen alike — with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on either side of the ark of the 
JOS.8.34	Afterward, Joshua read aloud all the words of the law — the blessings as well as the curses — according to all that is written in the book of the law. 
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read before the entire assembly of Israel, including the women, the dependents, and the resident aliens who lived
JOS.9.1	When all the kings heard about Jericho and Ai, those who were west of the Jordan in the hill country,
JOS.9.2	they formed a unified alliance to fight against Joshua and Israel.
JOS.9.3	When the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
JOS.9.4	they acted deceptively. They gathered provisions
JOS.9.5	They wore old, patched sandals on their feet and threadbare clothing on their bodies. Their entire provision of bread was dry and crumbly. 
JOS.9.6	They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a distant land. Please make a treaty with us.”
JOS.9.7	The men of Israel replied to the Hivites, “Perhaps you live among us. How can we make a treaty with you?” 
JOS.9.8	They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.”
JOS.9.8	Then Joshua asked them, “Who are you and where do you come from?”
JOS.9.9	They replied to him, “Your servants have come from a faraway land because of the reputation of the 
JOS.9.10	and all that he did to the two Amorite kings beyond the Jordan — King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan, who was in Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land told us, ‘Take provisions with you for the journey; go and meet them and say, “We are your servants. Please make a treaty with us.”’ 
JOS.9.12	This bread of ours was warm when we took it from our houses as food on the day we left to come to you; but see, it is now dry and crumbly. 
JOS.9.13	These wineskins were new when we filled them; but see, they are cracked. And these clothes and sandals of ours are worn out from the extremely long journey.” 
JOS.9.14	Then the men of Israel took some of their provisions, but did not seek the 
JOS.9.15	So Joshua established peace with them and made a treaty to let them live, and the leaders of the community swore an oath to them.
JOS.9.16	Three days after making the treaty with them, they heard that the Gibeonites were their neighbors, living among them. 
JOS.9.17	So the Israelites set out and reached the Gibeonite cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
JOS.9.18	But the Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the community had sworn an oath
JOS.9.19	All the leaders answered them, “We have sworn an oath to them by the 
JOS.9.20	This is how we will treat them: we will let them live, so that no wrath will fall on us because of the oath we swore to them.” 
JOS.9.21	They also said, “Let them live.” So the Gibeonites became woodcutters and water carriers
JOS.9.22	Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and said to them, “Why did you deceive us by telling us you live far away from us, when in fact you live among us? 
JOS.9.23	Therefore you are cursed and will always be slaves — woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my God.”
JOS.9.24	The Gibeonites answered him, “It was clearly communicated to your servants that the 
JOS.9.25	Now we are in your hands. Do to us whatever you think is right.”
JOS.9.26	This is what Joshua did to them: he rescued them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them. 
JOS.9.27	On that day he made them woodcutters and water carriers — as they are today — for the community and for the 
JOS.10.1	Now King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai and completely destroyed
JOS.10.2	So Adoni-zedek and his people were
JOS.10.3	Therefore King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent word to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon, saying, 
JOS.10.4	“Come up and help me. We will attack Gibeon, because they have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites.” 
JOS.10.5	So the five Amorite kings — the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon — joined forces, advanced with all their armies, besieged Gibeon, and fought against it.
JOS.10.6	Then the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal: “Don’t give up on
JOS.10.7	So Joshua and all his troops, including all his best soldiers, came from Gilgal.
JOS.10.8	The 
JOS.10.9	So Joshua caught them by surprise, after marching all night from Gilgal. 
JOS.10.10	The 
JOS.10.11	As they fled before Israel, the 
JOS.10.12	On the day the 
JOS.10.12	“Sun,
JOS.10.12	and moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”
JOS.10.13	And the sun stood still
JOS.10.13	and the moon stopped
JOS.10.13	until the nation took vengeance on its enemies.
JOS.10.13	Isn’t this written in the Book of Jashar?
JOS.10.13	So the sun stopped
JOS.10.13	in the middle of the sky
JOS.10.13	and delayed its setting
JOS.10.13	almost a full day.
JOS.10.14	There has been no day like it before or since, when the 
JOS.10.15	Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	Now the five defeated kings had fled and hidden in the cave at Makkedah. 
JOS.10.17	It was reported to Joshua: “The five kings have been found; they are hiding in the cave at Makkedah.”
JOS.10.18	Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and station men by it to guard the kings. 
JOS.10.19	But as for the rest of you, don’t stay there. Pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Don’t let them enter their cities, for the 
JOS.10.20	So Joshua and the Israelites finished inflicting a terrible slaughter on them until they were destroyed, although a few survivors ran away to the fortified cities. 
JOS.10.21	The people returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. And no one dared to threaten
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings to me out of there.” 
JOS.10.23	That is what they did. They brought the five kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon to Joshua out of the cave. 
JOS.10.24	When they had brought the kings to him, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the military commanders who had accompanied him, “Come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So the commanders came forward and put their feet on their necks. 
JOS.10.25	Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid or discouraged. Be strong and courageous,
JOS.10.26	After this, Joshua struck them down and executed them. He hung
JOS.10.27	At sunset Joshua commanded that they be taken down from the trees
JOS.10.28	On that day Joshua captured Makkedah and struck it down with the sword, including its king. He completely destroyed it
JOS.10.29	Joshua and all Israel with him
JOS.10.30	The 
JOS.10.31	From Libnah, Joshua and all Israel with him crossed to Lachish. They laid siege to it and attacked it. 
JOS.10.32	The 
JOS.10.33	At that time King Horam of Gezer went to help Lachish,
JOS.10.34	Then Joshua crossed from Lachish to Eglon and all Israel with him. They laid siege to it and attacked it. 
JOS.10.35	On that day they captured it and struck it down, putting everyone in it to the sword. He completely destroyed it that day, just as he had done to Lachish.
JOS.10.36	Next, Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron
JOS.10.37	They captured it and struck down its king, all its villages, and everyone in it with the sword. He left no survivors, just as he had done at Eglon. He completely destroyed Hebron and everyone in it.
JOS.10.38	Finally, Joshua turned toward Debir
JOS.10.39	He captured it — its king and all its villages. They struck them down with the sword and completely destroyed everyone in it, leaving no survivors. He treated Debir and its king as he had treated Hebron and as he had treated Libnah and its king.
JOS.10.40	So Joshua conquered the whole region
JOS.10.41	Joshua conquered everyone from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, and all the land of Goshen
JOS.10.42	Joshua captured all these kings and their land in one campaign,
JOS.10.43	Then Joshua returned with all Israel to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	When King Jabin of Hazor heard this news, he sent a message to: King Jobab of Madon, the kings of Shimron and Achshaph, 
JOS.11.2	and the kings of the north in the hill country, the Arabah south of Chinnereth,
JOS.11.3	the Canaanites in the east and west, the Amorites, Hethites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites at the foot of Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
JOS.11.4	They went out with all their armies — a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore
JOS.11.5	All these kings joined forces; they came and camped together at the Waters of Merom to attack Israel.
JOS.11.6	The 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and all his troops surprised them at the Waters of Merom and attacked them. 
JOS.11.8	The 
JOS.11.9	Joshua treated them as the 
JOS.11.10	At that time Joshua turned back, captured Hazor, and struck down its king with the sword, because Hazor had formerly been the leader of all these kingdoms. 
JOS.11.11	They struck down everyone in it with the sword, completely destroying
JOS.11.12	Joshua captured all these kings and their cities and struck them down with the sword. He completely destroyed them, as Moses the 
JOS.11.13	However, Israel did not burn any of the cities that stood on their mounds except Hazor, which Joshua burned. 
JOS.11.14	The Israelites plundered all the spoils and cattle of these cities for themselves. But they struck down every person with the sword until they had annihilated them, leaving no one alive. 
JOS.11.15	Just as the 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took all this land — the hill country, all the Negev, all the land of Goshen,
JOS.11.17	from Mount Halak,
JOS.11.18	Joshua waged war with all these kings for a long time. 
JOS.11.19	No city made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites who inhabited Gibeon;
JOS.11.20	For it was the 
JOS.11.21	At that time Joshua proceeded to exterminate the Anakim
JOS.11.22	No Anakim were left in the land of the Israelites, except for some remaining in Gaza, Gath,
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the entire land, in keeping with all that the 
JOS.12.1	The Israelites struck down the following kings of the land and took possession of their land beyond the Jordan to the east and from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon, including all the Arabah eastward:
JOS.12.2	King Sihon of the Amorites lived in Heshbon. He ruled from Aroer
JOS.12.3	the Arabah east of the Sea of Chinnereth to the Sea of Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea), eastward through Beth-jeshimoth
JOS.12.4	King Og
JOS.12.5	He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, all Bashan up to the Geshurite and Maacathite border, and half of Gilead to the border of King Sihon of Heshbon.
JOS.12.6	Moses the 
JOS.12.7	Joshua and the Israelites struck down the following kings of the land beyond the Jordan to the west, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak,

JOS.12.24	the king of Tirzah
JOS.12.24	one
JOS.12.24	the total number of all kings:
JOS.12.24	thirty-one.
JOS.13.1	Joshua was now old, advanced in age,
JOS.13.2	This is the land that remains:
JOS.13.2	All the districts of the Philistines and the Geshurites: 
JOS.13.3	from the Shihor east of Egypt to the border of Ekron on the north (considered to be Canaanite territory) — the five Philistine rulers of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, as well as the Avvites 
JOS.13.4	in the south; all the land of the Canaanites, from Arah of the Sidonians to Aphek and as far as the border of the Amorites; 
JOS.13.5	the land of the Gebalites;
JOS.13.6	all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim,
JOS.13.6	I will drive them out before the Israelites, only distribute the land as an inheritance for Israel, as I have commanded you. 
JOS.13.7	Therefore, divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and half the tribe of Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	With the other half of the tribe of Manasseh, the Reubenites and Gadites had received the inheritance Moses gave them beyond the Jordan to the east, just as Moses the 
JOS.13.9	From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the middle of the valley,
JOS.13.10	and all the cities of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, to the border of the Ammonites; 
JOS.13.11	also Gilead
JOS.13.12	the whole kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei; he was one of the remaining Rephaim.
JOS.13.12	Moses struck them down and drove them out,
JOS.13.13	but the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites and Maacathites.
JOS.13.14	He did not, however, give any inheritance to the tribe of Levi. This was their inheritance, just as he had promised: the offerings made by fire to the 
JOS.13.15	To the tribe of Reuben’s descendants by their clans, Moses gave 
JOS.13.16	this as their territory:
JOS.13.16	From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Valley, along with the city in the middle of the valley, the whole plateau as far as
JOS.13.17	with Heshbon and all its cities on the plateau — Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon, 
JOS.13.18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
JOS.13.19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill in the valley,
JOS.13.20	Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth —  
JOS.13.21	all the cities of the plateau, and all the kingdom of King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon. Moses had killed him and the chiefs of Midian — Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba — the princes of Sihon who lived in the land.
JOS.13.22	Along with those the Israelites put to death, they also killed the diviner, Balaam son of Beor, with the sword.
JOS.13.23	The border of the Reubenites was the Jordan and its plain. This was the inheritance of the Reubenites by their clans, with the cities and their settlements.
JOS.13.24	To the tribe of the Gadites by their clans, Moses gave 
JOS.13.25	this as their territory:
JOS.13.25	Jazer and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the Ammonites to Aroer, near Rabbah; 
JOS.13.26	from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;
JOS.13.27	in the valley: Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon — the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon. Their land also included the Jordan and its territory as far as the edge of the Sea of Chinnereth on the east side of the Jordan.
JOS.13.28	This was the inheritance of the Gadites by their clans, with the cities and their settlements.
JOS.13.29	And to half the tribe of Manasseh (that is, to half the tribe of Manasseh’s descendants by their clans) Moses gave 
JOS.13.30	this as their territory:
JOS.13.30	From Mahanaim through all Bashan — all the kingdom of King Og of Bashan, including all of Jair’s Villages
JOS.13.31	But half of Gilead, and Og’s royal cities in Bashan — Ashtaroth and Edrei — are for the descendants of Machir son of Manasseh (that is, half the descendants of Machir by their clans).
JOS.13.32	These were the portions Moses gave them on the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan east of Jericho. 
JOS.13.33	But Moses did not give a portion to the tribe of Levi. The 
JOS.14.1	The Israelites received these portions that the priest Eleazar,
JOS.14.2	Their inheritance was by lot
JOS.14.3	because Moses had given the inheritance to the two and a half tribes beyond the Jordan. But he gave no inheritance among them to the Levites. 
JOS.14.4	The descendants of Joseph became two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. No portion of the land was given to the Levites except cities to live in, along with pasturelands for their cattle and livestock. 
JOS.14.5	So the Israelites did as the 
JOS.14.6	The descendants of Judah approached Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know what the 
JOS.14.7	I was forty years old when Moses the 
JOS.14.8	My brothers who went with me caused the people to lose heart,
JOS.14.9	On that day Moses swore to me: ‘The land where you have set foot will be an inheritance for you and your descendants forever, because you have followed the 
JOS.14.10	“As you see, the 
JOS.14.11	I am still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out. My strength for battle and for daily tasks
JOS.14.12	Now give me this hill country the 
JOS.14.13	Then Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him Hebron as an inheritance.
JOS.14.14	Therefore, Hebron still belongs to Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite as an inheritance today
JOS.14.15	Hebron’s name used to be Kiriath-arba; Arba was the greatest man among the Anakim.
JOS.15.1	Now the allotment for the tribe of the descendants of Judah by their clans
JOS.15.2	Their southern border began at the tip of the Dead Sea on the south bay
JOS.15.3	and went south of the Scorpions’ Ascent,
JOS.15.4	It proceeded to Azmon and to the Brook of Egypt
JOS.15.5	Now the eastern border was along the Dead Sea to the mouth of the Jordan.
JOS.15.5	The border on the north side was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan. 
JOS.15.6	It ascended to Beth-hoglah, proceeded north of Beth-arabah, and ascended to the Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
JOS.15.7	Then the border ascended to Debir from the Valley of Achor, turning north to the Gilgal that is opposite the Ascent of Adummim, which is south of the ravine. The border proceeded to the Waters of En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel. 
JOS.15.8	From there the border ascended Ben Hinnom Valley to the southern Jebusite slope (that is, Jerusalem) and ascended to the top of the hill that faces Hinnom Valley on the west, at the northern end of Rephaim Valley. 
JOS.15.9	From the top of the hill the border curved to the spring of the Waters of Nephtoah, went to the cities of Mount Ephron, and then curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim
JOS.15.10	The border turned westward from Baalah to Mount Seir, went to the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), descended to Beth-shemesh, and proceeded to Timnah.
JOS.15.11	Then the border reached to the slope north of Ekron, curved to Shikkeron, proceeded to Mount Baalah, went to Jabneel, and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.12	Now the western border was the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.12	This was the boundary of the descendants of Judah around their clans.
JOS.15.13	He gave Caleb son of Jephunneh the following portion among the descendants of Judah based on the 
JOS.15.14	Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, descendants of Anak.
JOS.15.15	From there he marched against the inhabitants of Debir, which used to be called Kiriath-sepher,
JOS.15.16	and Caleb said, “Whoever attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher, I will give my daughter Achsah to him as a wife.” 
JOS.15.17	So Othniel
JOS.15.18	When she arrived, she persuaded Othniel to ask her father for a field. As she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?” 
JOS.15.19	She replied, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev, give me the springs also.” So he gave her the upper and lower springs.
JOS.15.20	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Judah by their clans.
JOS.15.21	These were the outermost cities of the tribe of the descendants of Judah toward the border of Edom in the Negev: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
JOS.15.22	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
JOS.15.23	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 
JOS.15.24	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,

JOS.15.26	Amam, Shema, Moladah, 
JOS.15.27	Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet, 
JOS.15.28	Hazar-shual, Beer-sheba, Biziothiah,
JOS.15.29	Baalah, Iim, Ezem, 
JOS.15.30	Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
JOS.15.32	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon — twenty-nine cities in all, with their settlements.
JOS.15.33	In the Judean foothills:
JOS.15.34	Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah,
JOS.15.35	Jarmuth, Adullam,
JOS.15.36	Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim — fourteen cities, with their settlements;

JOS.15.39	Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,

JOS.15.42	Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
JOS.15.43	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
JOS.15.44	Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah — nine cities, with their settlements; 
JOS.15.45	Ekron, with its surrounding villages and settlements; 
JOS.15.46	from Ekron to the sea, all the cities near Ashdod, with their settlements; 
JOS.15.47	Ashdod, with its surrounding villages and settlements; Gaza, with its surrounding villages and settlements, to the Brook of Egypt and the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.48	In the hill country: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 
JOS.15.49	Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir), 
JOS.15.50	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,

JOS.15.56	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
JOS.15.57	Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah — ten cities, with their settlements; 
JOS.15.58	Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon — six cities, with their settlements;
JOS.15.60	Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah — two cities, with their settlements.
JOS.15.61	In the wilderness: Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
JOS.15.62	Nibshan, the City of Salt,
JOS.15.63	But the descendants of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem.
JOS.16.1	The allotment for the descendants of Joseph went from the Jordan at Jericho to the Waters of Jericho on the east, through the wilderness
JOS.16.2	From Bethel it went to Luz and proceeded to the border of the Archites by Ataroth.
JOS.16.3	It then descended westward to the border of the Japhletites as far as the border of lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer,
JOS.16.4	So Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph,
JOS.16.5	This was the territory of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans:
JOS.16.5	The border of their inheritance went from Ataroth-addar
JOS.16.6	In the north the border went westward from Michmethath;
JOS.16.7	From Janoah it descended to Ataroth and Naarah,
JOS.16.8	From Tappuah the border went westward along the Brook of Kanah and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.16.8	This was the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Ephraim by their clans, together with 
JOS.16.9	the cities set apart for the descendants of Ephraim within the inheritance of the descendants of Manasseh — all these cities with their settlements. 
JOS.16.10	However, they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer.
JOS.17.1	This was the allotment for the tribe of Manasseh
JOS.17.2	So the allotment was for the rest of Manasseh’s descendants by their clans, for the sons of Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These are the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, by their clans.
JOS.17.3	Now Zelophehad son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
JOS.17.4	They came before the priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders, saying, “The 
JOS.17.5	As a result, ten tracts fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which are beyond the Jordan,
JOS.17.6	because Manasseh’s daughters received an inheritance among his sons. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of Manasseh’s sons.
JOS.17.7	The border of Manasseh went from Asher to Michmethath near Shechem. It then went southward toward the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 
JOS.17.8	The region of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuah itself on Manasseh’s border
JOS.17.9	From there the border descended to the Brook of Kanah; south of the brook, cities belonged to Ephraim among Manasseh’s cities. Manasseh’s border was on the north side of the brook and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. 
JOS.17.10	Ephraim’s territory was to the south and Manasseh’s to the north, with the Sea as its border. They reached Asher on the north and Issachar on the east. 
JOS.17.11	Within Issachar and Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean, Ibleam, and the inhabitants of Dor with their surrounding villages;
JOS.17.12	The descendants of Manasseh could not possess these cities, because the Canaanites were determined to stay in this land. 
JOS.17.13	However, when the Israelites grew stronger, they imposed forced labor on the Canaanites but did not drive them out completely.
JOS.17.14	Joseph’s descendants said to Joshua, “Why did you give us only one tribal allotment
JOS.17.15	“If you have so many people,” Joshua replied to them, “go to the forest and clear an area for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, because Ephraim’s hill country is too small for you.”
JOS.17.16	But the descendants of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who inhabit the valley area have iron chariots, both at Beth-shean with its surrounding villages and in the Jezreel Valley.”
JOS.17.17	So Joshua replied to Joseph’s family (that is, Ephraim and Manasseh), “You have many people and great strength. You will not have just one allotment, 
JOS.17.18	because the hill country will be yours also. It is a forest; clear it and its outlying areas will be yours. You can also drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and are strong.”
JOS.18.1	The entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh
JOS.18.2	but seven tribes among the Israelites were left who had not divided up their inheritance. 
JOS.18.3	So Joshua asked the Israelites, “How long will you delay going out to take possession of the land that the 
JOS.18.4	Appoint for yourselves three men from each tribe, and I will send them out. They are to go and survey the land, write a description of it for the purpose of their inheritance, and return to me. 
JOS.18.5	Then they are to divide it into seven portions. Judah is to remain in its territory in the south and Joseph’s family in their territory in the north.
JOS.18.6	When you have written a description of the seven portions of land and brought it to me, I will cast lots
JOS.18.7	But the Levites among you do not get a portion, because their inheritance is the priesthood of the 
JOS.18.8	As the men prepared to go, Joshua commanded them
JOS.18.9	So the men left, went through the land, and described it by towns in a document of seven sections. They returned to Joshua at the camp in Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	Joshua cast lots for them at Shiloh in the presence of the 
JOS.18.11	The lot came up for the tribe of Benjamin’s descendants by their clans, and their allotted territory lay between Judah’s descendants and Joseph’s descendants.
JOS.18.12	Their border on the north side began at the Jordan, ascended to the slope of Jericho on the north, through the hill country westward, and ended at the wilderness around Beth-aven.
JOS.18.13	From there the border went toward Luz, to the southern slope of Luz (that is, Bethel); it then went down by Ataroth-addar, over the hill south of Lower Beth-horon.
JOS.18.14	On the west side, from the hill facing Beth-horon on the south, the border curved, turning southward, and ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of the descendants of Judah. This was the west side of their border.
JOS.18.15	The south side began at the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border extended westward; it went to the spring at the Waters of Nephtoah. 
JOS.18.16	The border descended to the foot of the hill that faces Ben Hinnom Valley at the northern end of Rephaim Valley. It ran down Hinnom Valley toward the south Jebusite slope and downward to En-rogel. 
JOS.18.17	It curved northward and went to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth, which is opposite the Ascent of Adummim, and continued down to the Stone of Bohan
JOS.18.18	Then it went north to the slope opposite the Arabah
JOS.18.19	The border continued to the north slope of Beth-hoglah and ended at the northern bay of the Dead Sea, at the southern end of the Jordan. This was the southern border.
JOS.18.20	The Jordan formed the border on the east side.
JOS.18.20	This was the inheritance of Benjamin’s descendants, by their clans, according to its surrounding borders.
JOS.18.21	These were the cities of the tribe of Benjamin’s descendants by their clans:
JOS.18.21	Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz, 
JOS.18.22	Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
JOS.18.24	Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba — twelve cities, with their settlements; 
JOS.18.25	Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 
JOS.18.26	Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, 
JOS.18.27	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
JOS.18.28	Zela, Haeleph, Jebus
JOS.18.28	This was the inheritance for Benjamin’s descendants by their clans.
JOS.19.1	The second lot came out for Simeon, for the tribe of his descendants by their clans, but their inheritance was within the inheritance given to Judah’s descendants. 
JOS.19.2	Their inheritance included
JOS.19.2	Beer-sheba (or Sheba
JOS.19.3	Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem, 
JOS.19.4	Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
JOS.19.5	Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah, 
JOS.19.6	Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen — thirteen cities, with their settlements; 
JOS.19.7	Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan — four cities, with their settlements; 
JOS.19.8	and all the settlements surrounding these cities as far as Baalath-beer (Ramah in the south
JOS.19.8	This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon’s descendants by their clans. 
JOS.19.9	The inheritance of Simeon’s descendants was within the territory of Judah’s descendants, because the share for Judah’s descendants was too large. So Simeon’s descendants received an inheritance within Judah’s portion.
JOS.19.10	The third lot came up for Zebulun’s descendants by their clans.
JOS.19.10	The territory of their inheritance stretched as far as Sarid; 
JOS.19.11	their border went up westward to Maralah, reached Dabbesheth, and met the brook east of Jokneam. 
JOS.19.12	From Sarid, it turned due east along the border of Chisloth-tabor, went to Daberath, and went up to Japhia. 
JOS.19.13	From there, it went due east to Gath-hepher and to Eth-kazin; it extended to Rimmon, curving around to Neah. 
JOS.19.14	The border then circled around Neah on the north to Hannathon and ended at Iphtah-el Valley, 
JOS.19.15	along with Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem — twelve cities, with their settlements.
JOS.19.16	This was the inheritance of Zebulun’s descendants by their clans, these cities, with their settlements.
JOS.19.17	The fourth lot came out for the tribe of Issachar’s descendants by their clans.
JOS.19.18	Their territory went to Jezreel, and included Chesulloth, Shunem,
JOS.19.19	Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 
JOS.19.20	Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 
JOS.19.21	Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, and Beth-pazzez. 
JOS.19.22	The border reached Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh, and ended at the Jordan — sixteen cities, with their settlements.
JOS.19.23	This was the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar’s descendants by their clans, the cities, with their settlements.
JOS.19.24	The fifth lot came out for the tribe of Asher’s descendants by their clans.
JOS.19.25	Their boundary included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 
JOS.19.26	Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal and reached westward to Carmel and Shihor-libnath. 
JOS.19.27	It turned eastward to Beth-dagon, reached Zebulun and Iphtah-el Valley, north toward Beth-emek and Neiel, and went north to Cabul,
JOS.19.28	Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as greater Sidon. 
JOS.19.29	The boundary then turned to Ramah as far as the fortified city of Tyre; it turned back to Hosah and ended at the Mediterranean Sea, including Mahalab, Achzib,
JOS.19.30	Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob — twenty-two cities, with their settlements.
JOS.19.31	This was the inheritance of the tribe of Asher’s descendants by their clans, these cities with their settlements.
JOS.19.32	The sixth lot came out for Naphtali’s descendants by their clans.
JOS.19.33	Their boundary went from Heleph and from the oak in Zaanannim, including Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan. 
JOS.19.34	To the west, the boundary turned to Aznoth-tabor and went from there to Hukkok, reaching Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah
JOS.19.35	The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 
JOS.19.36	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
JOS.19.37	Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor, 
JOS.19.38	Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh — nineteen cities, with their settlements.
JOS.19.39	This was the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali’s descendants by their clans, the cities with their settlements.
JOS.19.40	The seventh lot came out for the tribe of Dan’s descendants by their clans.
JOS.19.41	The territory of their inheritance included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh, 
JOS.19.42	Shaalabbin, Aijalon,
JOS.19.43	Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
JOS.19.44	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
JOS.19.45	Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, 
JOS.19.46	Me-jarkon, and Rakkon, with the territory facing Joppa.
JOS.19.47	When the territory of the descendants of Dan slipped out of their control, they went up and fought against Leshem, captured it, and struck it down with the sword. So they took possession of it, lived there, and renamed Leshem after their ancestor Dan.
JOS.19.48	This was the inheritance of the tribe of Dan’s descendants by their clans, these cities with their settlements.
JOS.19.49	When they had finished distributing the land into its territories, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun an inheritance among them. 
JOS.19.50	By the 
JOS.19.51	These were the portions that the priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the family heads distributed to the Israelite tribes by lot at Shiloh in the 
JOS.20.1	Then the 
JOS.20.2	“Tell the Israelites: Select your cities of refuge, as I instructed you through Moses,
JOS.20.3	so that a person who kills someone unintentionally or accidentally may flee there. These will be your refuge from the avenger of blood.
JOS.20.4	When someone flees to one of these cities, stands at the entrance of the city gate, and states his case before
JOS.20.5	And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they must not hand the one who committed manslaughter over to him, for he killed his neighbor accidentally and did not hate him beforehand. 
JOS.20.6	He is to stay in that city until he stands trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest serving at that time.
JOS.20.7	So they designated Kedesh in the hill country of Naphtali in Galilee,
JOS.20.8	Across the Jordan east of Jericho, they selected Bezer on the wilderness plateau from Reuben’s tribe, Ramoth in Gilead from Gad’s tribe, and Golan in Bashan from Manasseh’s tribe.
JOS.20.9	These are the cities appointed for all the Israelites and the aliens residing among them,
JOS.21.1	The Levite family heads approached the priest Eleazar, Joshua son of Nun, and the family heads of the Israelite tribes. 
JOS.21.2	At Shiloh, in the land of Canaan, they told them, “The 
JOS.21.3	So the Israelites, by the 
JOS.21.4	The lot came out for the Kohathite clans: The Levites who were the descendants of the priest Aaron received thirteen cities by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 
JOS.21.5	The remaining descendants of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the clans of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and half the tribe of Manasseh.
JOS.21.6	Gershon’s descendants received thirteen cities by lot from the clans of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and half the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
JOS.21.7	Merari’s descendants received twelve cities for their clans from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
JOS.21.8	The Israelites gave these cities with their pasturelands around them to the Levites by lot, as the 
JOS.21.9	The Israelites gave these cities by name from the tribes of the descendants of Judah and Simeon 
JOS.21.10	to the descendants of Aaron from the Kohathite clans of the Levites, because they received the first lot. 
JOS.21.11	They gave them Kiriath-arba
JOS.21.12	But they gave the fields and settlements of the city to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
JOS.21.13	They gave to the descendants of the priest Aaron:
JOS.21.13	Hebron, the city of refuge for the one who commits manslaughter, with its pasturelands, Libnah with its pasturelands, 
JOS.21.14	Jattir with its pasturelands, Eshtemoa with its pasturelands, 
JOS.21.15	Holon with its pasturelands, Debir with its pasturelands, 
JOS.21.16	Ain with its pasturelands, Juttah with its pasturelands, and Beth-shemesh with its pasturelands — nine cities from these two tribes.
JOS.21.17	From the tribe of Benjamin they gave:
JOS.21.17	Gibeon with its pasturelands, Geba with its pasturelands, 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth with its pasturelands, and Almon with its pasturelands — four cities. 
JOS.21.19	All thirteen cities with their pasturelands were for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
JOS.21.20	The allotted cities to the remaining clans of Kohath’s descendants, who were Levites, came from the tribe of Ephraim. 
JOS.21.21	The Israelites gave them:
JOS.21.21	Shechem,
JOS.21.22	Kibzaim with its pasturelands, and Beth-horon with its pasturelands — four cities.
JOS.21.23	From the tribe of Dan they gave:
JOS.21.23	Elteke with its pasturelands, Gibbethon with its pasturelands, 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon with its pasturelands, and Gath-rimmon with its pasturelands — four cities.
JOS.21.25	From half the tribe of Manasseh they gave:
JOS.21.25	Taanach with its pasturelands and Gath-rimmon
JOS.21.26	All ten cities with their pasturelands were for the clans of Kohath’s other descendants.
JOS.21.27	From half the tribe of Manasseh, they gave to the descendants of Gershon,
JOS.21.27	Golan, the city of refuge for the one who commits manslaughter, with its pasturelands in Bashan, and Beeshterah with its pasturelands — two cities.
JOS.21.28	From the tribe of Issachar they gave:
JOS.21.28	Kishion with its pasturelands, Daberath with its pasturelands, 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth with its pasturelands, and En-gannim with its pasturelands — four cities.
JOS.21.30	From the tribe of Asher they gave:
JOS.21.30	Mishal with its pasturelands, Abdon with its pasturelands, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath with its pasturelands, and Rehob with its pasturelands — four cities.
JOS.21.32	From the tribe of Naphtali they gave:
JOS.21.32	Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for the one who commits manslaughter, with its pasturelands, Hammoth-dor with its pasturelands, and Kartan with its pasturelands — three cities.
JOS.21.33	All thirteen cities with their pasturelands were for the Gershonites by their clans.
JOS.21.34	From the tribe of Zebulun, they gave to the clans of the descendants of Merari,
JOS.21.34	Jokneam with its pasturelands, Kartah with its pasturelands, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah with its pasturelands, and Nahalal with its pasturelands — four cities.
JOS.21.36	From the tribe of Reuben they gave:
JOS.21.36	Bezer
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth with its pasturelands, and Mephaath with its pasturelands — four cities.
JOS.21.38	From the tribe of Gad they gave:
JOS.21.38	Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for the one who commits manslaughter, with its pasturelands, Mahanaim with its pasturelands, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon with its pasturelands, and Jazer with its pasturelands — four cities in all. 
JOS.21.40	All twelve cities were allotted to the clans of Merari’s descendants, the remaining Levite clans.
JOS.21.41	Within the Israelite possession there were forty-eight cities in all with their pasturelands for the Levites.
JOS.21.42	Each of these cities had its own surrounding pasturelands; this was true for all the cities.
JOS.21.43	So the 
JOS.21.44	The 
JOS.21.45	None of the good promises the 
JOS.22.1	Joshua summoned the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh 
JOS.22.2	and told them, “You have done everything Moses the 
JOS.22.3	You have not deserted your brothers even once this whole time but have carried out the requirement of the command of the 
JOS.22.4	Now that he has given your brothers rest, just as he promised them, return to your homes in your own land that Moses the 
JOS.22.5	Only carefully obey the command and instruction that Moses the 
JOS.22.6	Joshua blessed them and sent them on their way,
JOS.22.7	Moses had given territory to half the tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, but Joshua had given territory to the other half,
JOS.22.8	he said, “Return to your homes with great wealth: a huge number of cattle, and silver, gold, bronze, iron, and a large quantity of clothing. Share the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.”
JOS.22.9	The Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh left the Israelites at Shiloh in the land of Canaan to return to their own land of Gilead,
JOS.22.10	When they came to the region of
JOS.22.11	Then the Israelites heard it said, “Look, the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh have built an altar on the frontier of the land of Canaan at the region of
JOS.22.12	When the Israelites heard this, the entire Israelite community assembled at Shiloh to go to war against them.
JOS.22.13	The Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead.
JOS.22.14	They sent ten leaders with him — one family leader for each tribe of Israel. All of them were heads of their ancestral families
JOS.22.15	They went to the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and told them, 
JOS.22.16	“This is what the 
JOS.22.17	Wasn’t the iniquity of Peor,
JOS.22.18	and now would you turn away from the 
JOS.22.19	But if the land you possess is defiled, cross over to the land the 
JOS.22.20	Wasn’t Achan son of Zerah unfaithful regarding what was set apart for destruction, bringing wrath on the entire community of Israel? He was not the only one who perished because of his iniquity.’”
JOS.22.21	The Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh answered the heads of the Israelite clans, 
JOS.22.22	“The Mighty One, God, the 
JOS.22.23	that we have built for ourselves an altar to turn away from him. May the 
JOS.22.24	We actually did this from a specific concern that in the future your descendants might say to our descendants, ‘What relationship do you have with the 
JOS.22.25	For the 
JOS.22.26	“Therefore we said: Let us take action and build an altar for ourselves, but not for burnt offering or sacrifice. 
JOS.22.27	Instead, it is to be a witness between us and you,
JOS.22.28	We thought that if they said this to us or to our generations in the future, we would reply: Look at the replica of the 
JOS.22.29	We would never ever rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	When the priest Phinehas and the community leaders, the heads of Israel’s clans who were with him, heard what the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh had to say, they were pleased. 
JOS.22.31	Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest said to the descendants of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, “Today we know that the 
JOS.22.32	Then the priest Phinehas son of Eleazar and the leaders returned from the Reubenites and Gadites in the land of Gilead to the Israelites in the land of Canaan and brought back a report to them. 
JOS.22.33	The Israelites were pleased with the report, and they blessed God.
JOS.22.34	So the Reubenites and Gadites named the altar: It
JOS.23.1	A long time after the 
JOS.23.2	So Joshua summoned all Israel, including its elders, leaders, judges, and officers,
JOS.23.3	and you have seen for yourselves everything the 
JOS.23.4	See, I have allotted these remaining nations to you as an inheritance for your tribes,
JOS.23.5	The 
JOS.23.6	“Be very strong
JOS.23.7	and so that you do not associate with these nations remaining among you. Do not call on the names of their gods or make an oath to them;
JOS.23.8	Instead, be loyal to the 
JOS.23.9	“The 
JOS.23.10	One of you routed a thousand
JOS.23.11	So diligently watch yourselves! Love the 
JOS.23.12	If you ever turn away and become loyal to the rest of these nations remaining among you,
JOS.23.13	know for certain that the 
JOS.23.14	“I am now going the way of the whole earth,
JOS.23.15	Since every good thing the 
JOS.23.16	If you break the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	Joshua assembled all the tribes of Israel at Shechem
JOS.24.2	Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the 
JOS.24.3	But I took your father Abraham from the region beyond the Euphrates River, led him throughout the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants.
JOS.24.4	and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau.
JOS.24.4	“‘Jacob and his sons, however, went down to Egypt.
JOS.24.5	I sent Moses and Aaron,
JOS.24.6	When I brought your fathers out of Egypt and you reached the Red Sea,
JOS.24.7	Your fathers cried out to the 
JOS.24.8	“‘Later, I brought you to the land of the Amorites who lived beyond the Jordan.
JOS.24.9	Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab,
JOS.24.10	but I would not listen to Balaam. Instead, he repeatedly blessed you, and I rescued you from him.
JOS.24.11	“‘You then crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho.
JOS.24.12	I sent hornets
JOS.24.13	I gave you a land you did not labor for, and cities you did not build,
JOS.24.14	“Therefore, fear the 
JOS.24.15	But if it doesn’t please you to worship the 
JOS.24.16	The people replied, “We will certainly not abandon the 
JOS.24.17	For the 
JOS.24.18	The 
JOS.24.19	But Joshua told the people, “You will not be able to worship the 
JOS.24.20	If you abandon the 
JOS.24.21	“No!” the people answered Joshua. “We will worship the 
JOS.24.22	Joshua then told the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you yourselves have chosen to worship the 
JOS.24.22	“We are witnesses,” they said.
JOS.24.23	“Then get rid of the foreign gods that are among you and turn your hearts to the 
JOS.24.24	So the people said to Joshua, “We will worship the 
JOS.24.25	On that day Joshua made a covenant for the people at Shechem and established a statute and ordinance for them. 
JOS.24.26	Joshua recorded these things in the book of the law of God;
JOS.24.27	And Joshua said to all the people, “You see this stone — it will be a witness against us,
JOS.24.28	Then Joshua sent the people away, each to his own inheritance.
JOS.24.29	After these things, the 
JOS.24.30	They buried him in his allotted territory at Timnath-serah, in the hill country of Ephraim
JOS.24.31	Israel worshiped the 
JOS.24.32	Joseph’s bones, which the Israelites had brought up from Egypt,
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they buried him at Gibeah,
JDG.1.1	After the death of Joshua,
JDG.1.2	The 
JDG.1.3	Judah said to his brother Simeon, “Come with me to my allotted territory, and let us fight against the Canaanites. I will also go with you to your allotted territory.” So Simeon went with him.
JDG.1.4	When Judah attacked, the 
JDG.1.5	They found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, fought against him, and struck down the Canaanites and Perizzites.
JDG.1.6	When Adoni-bezek fled, they pursued him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
JDG.1.7	Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to pick up scraps
JDG.1.8	The men of Judah fought against Jerusalem, captured it, put it to the sword, and set the city on fire. 
JDG.1.9	Afterward, the men of Judah marched down to fight against the Canaanites who were living in the hill country, the Negev, and the Judean foothills.
JDG.1.10	Judah also marched against the Canaanites who were living in Hebron
JDG.1.11	From there they marched against the residents of Debir
JDG.1.12	Caleb
JDG.1.13	So Othniel
JDG.1.14	When she arrived, she persuaded Othniel to ask her father for a field. As she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?” 
JDG.1.15	She answered him, “Give me a blessing. Since you have given me land in the Negev,
JDG.1.16	The descendants of the Kenite, Moses’s father-in-law,
JDG.1.17	Judah went with his brother Simeon, struck the Canaanites who were living in Zephath, and completely destroyed the town. So they named the town Hormah.
JDG.1.18	Judah captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, and Ekron and its territory. 
JDG.1.19	The 
JDG.1.20	Judah gave Hebron to Caleb, just as Moses had promised.
JDG.1.21	At the same time the Benjaminites did not drive out the Jebusites who were living in Jerusalem. The Jebusites have lived among the Benjaminites in Jerusalem to this day.
JDG.1.22	The house of Joseph also attacked Bethel, and the 
JDG.1.23	They sent spies to Bethel (the town was formerly named Luz
JDG.1.24	The spies saw a man coming out of the town and said to him, “Please show us how to get into town, and we will show you kindness.”
JDG.1.25	When he showed them the way into the town, they put the town to the sword but released the man and his entire family. 
JDG.1.26	Then the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a town, and named it Luz. That is its name still today.
JDG.1.27	At that time Manasseh failed to take possession of Beth-shean
JDG.1.28	When Israel became stronger, they made the Canaanites serve as forced labor but never drove them out completely.
JDG.1.29	At that time Ephraim failed to drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer, so the Canaanites have lived among them in Gezer.
JDG.1.30	Zebulun failed to drive out the residents of Kitron or the residents of Nahalol,
JDG.1.31	Asher failed to drive out the residents of Acco or of Sidon, or Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	The Asherites lived among the Canaanites who were living in the land, because they failed to drive them out.
JDG.1.33	Naphtali did not drive out the residents of Beth-shemesh or the residents of Beth-anath. They lived among the Canaanites who were living in the land, but the residents of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath served as their forced labor.
JDG.1.34	The Amorites
JDG.1.35	The Amorites were determined to stay in
JDG.1.36	The territory of the Amorites extended from the Scorpions’ Ascent,
JDG.2.1	The angel of the 
JDG.2.2	You are not to make a covenant
JDG.2.3	Therefore, I now say: I will not drive out these people before you.
JDG.2.4	When the angel of the 
JDG.2.5	So they named that place Bochim
JDG.2.6	Previously, when Joshua had sent the people away, the Israelites had gone to take possession of the land, each to his own inheritance.
JDG.2.7	The people worshiped the 
JDG.2.8	Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the 
JDG.2.9	They buried him in the territory of his inheritance, in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim,
JDG.2.10	That whole generation was also gathered to their ancestors. After them another generation rose up who did not know the 
JDG.2.11	The Israelites did what was evil in the 
JDG.2.12	and abandoned the 
JDG.2.13	for they abandoned him and worshiped Baal and the Ashtoreths.
JDG.2.14	The 
JDG.2.15	Whenever the Israelites went out, the 
JDG.2.16	The 
JDG.2.17	but they did not listen to their judges. Instead, they prostituted
JDG.2.18	Whenever the 
JDG.2.19	Whenever the judge died, the Israelites would act even more corruptly
JDG.2.20	The 
JDG.2.21	I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations Joshua left
JDG.2.22	I did this to test Israel and to see whether or not they would keep the 
JDG.2.23	The 
JDG.3.1	These are the nations the 
JDG.3.2	This was to teach the future generations of the Israelites how to fight in battle, especially those who had not fought before.
JDG.3.3	These nations included the five rulers
JDG.3.4	The 
JDG.3.5	But they settled among the Canaanites, Hethites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
JDG.3.6	The Israelites took their daughters as wives for themselves, gave their own daughters to their sons, and worshiped their gods.
JDG.3.7	The Israelites did what was evil in the 
JDG.3.8	The 
JDG.3.9	The Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	Then the land had peace for
JDG.3.12	The Israelites again did what was evil in the 
JDG.3.13	After Eglon convinced the Ammonites and the Amalekites to join forces with him, he attacked and defeated Israel and took possession of the City of Palms.
JDG.3.14	The Israelites served King Eglon of Moab eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	Then the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.3.16	Ehud made himself a double-edged sword eighteen inches long.
JDG.3.17	and brought the tribute to King Eglon of Moab, who was an extremely fat man. 
JDG.3.18	When Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he dismissed the people who had carried it. 
JDG.3.19	At the carved images near Gilgal he returned and said, “King Eglon, I have a secret message for you.” The king said, “Silence!” and all his attendants left him. 
JDG.3.20	Then Ehud approached him while he was sitting alone in his upstairs room where it was cool. Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you,” and the king stood up from his throne. 
JDG.3.21	Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon’s belly. 
JDG.3.22	Even the handle went in after the blade, and Eglon’s fat closed in over it, so that Ehud did not withdraw the sword from his belly. And the waste came out.
JDG.3.23	Ehud escaped by way of the porch, closing and locking the doors of the upstairs room behind him.
JDG.3.24	Ehud was gone when Eglon’s servants came in. They looked and found the doors of the upstairs room locked and thought he was relieving himself
JDG.3.25	The servants waited until they became embarrassed and saw that he had still not opened the doors of the upstairs room. So they took the key and opened the doors — and there was their lord lying dead on the floor!
JDG.3.26	Ehud escaped while the servants waited. He passed the Jordan near the carved images and reached Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	After he arrived, he sounded the ram’s horn throughout the hill country of Ephraim. The Israelites came down with him from the hill country, and he became their leader. 
JDG.3.28	He told them, “Follow me, because the 
JDG.3.29	At that time they struck down about ten thousand Moabites, all stout and able-bodied men. Not one of them escaped. 
JDG.3.30	Moab became subject to Israel that day, and the land had peace for eighty years.
JDG.3.31	After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath became judge. He also delivered Israel, striking down six hundred Philistines with a cattle prod.
JDG.4.1	The Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.4.2	So the 
JDG.4.3	Then the Israelites cried out
JDG.4.4	Deborah, a prophetess
JDG.4.5	She would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites went up to her to settle disputes.
JDG.4.6	She summoned Barak son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, “Hasn’t the 
JDG.4.7	Then I will lure Sisera commander of Jabin’s army, his chariots, and his infantry at the Wadi Kishon
JDG.4.8	Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, I will go. But if you will not go with me, I will not go.”
JDG.4.9	“I will gladly go with you,” she said, “but you will receive no honor on the road you are about to take, because the 
JDG.4.10	Barak summoned Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; ten thousand men followed him, and Deborah also went with him.
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite had moved away from the Kenites, the sons of Hobab,
JDG.4.12	It was reported to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up Mount Tabor. 
JDG.4.13	Sisera summoned all his nine hundred iron chariots and all the troops who were with him from Harosheth of the Nations to the Wadi Kishon. 
JDG.4.14	Then Deborah said to Barak, “Go! This is the day the 
JDG.4.15	The 
JDG.4.16	Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth of the Nations, and the whole army of Sisera fell by the sword; not a single man was left.
JDG.4.17	Meanwhile, Sisera had fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between King Jabin of Hazor and the family of Heber the Kenite. 
JDG.4.18	Jael went out to greet Sisera and said to him, “Come in, my lord. Come in with me. Don’t be afraid.” So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket. 
JDG.4.19	He said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink for I am thirsty.” She opened a container of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him again. 
JDG.4.20	Then he said to her, “Stand at the entrance to the tent. If a man comes and asks you, ‘Is there a man here? ’ say, ‘No.’” 
JDG.4.21	While he was sleeping from exhaustion, Heber’s wife Jael took a tent peg, grabbed a hammer, and went silently to Sisera. She hammered the peg into his temple and drove it into the ground, and he died.
JDG.4.22	When Barak arrived in pursuit of Sisera, Jael went out to greet him and said to him, “Come and I will show you the man you are looking for.” So he went in with her, and there was Sisera lying dead with a tent peg through his temple!
JDG.4.23	That day God subdued King Jabin of Canaan before the Israelites. 
JDG.4.24	The power of the Israelites continued to increase against King Jabin of Canaan until they destroyed him.
JDG.5.1	On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang:
JDG.5.2	When the leaders lead
JDG.5.2	when the people volunteer,
JDG.5.2	blessed be the 
JDG.5.3	Listen, kings! Pay attention, princes!
JDG.5.3	I will sing to the 
JDG.5.3	I will sing praise to the 
JDG.5.4	when you marched from the fields of Edom,
JDG.5.4	the earth trembled,
JDG.5.4	the skies poured
JDG.5.4	and the clouds poured water.
JDG.5.5	The mountains melted before the 
JDG.5.5	even Sinai,
JDG.5.6	In the days of Shamgar
JDG.5.6	in the days of Jael,
JDG.5.6	the main roads were deserted
JDG.5.6	because travelers kept to the side roads.
JDG.5.7	Villages were deserted,
JDG.5.7	they were deserted in Israel,
JDG.5.7	until I,
JDG.5.7	a mother in Israel.
JDG.5.8	Israel chose new gods,
JDG.5.8	then there was war in the city gates.
JDG.5.8	Not a shield or spear was seen
JDG.5.8	among forty thousand in Israel.
JDG.5.9	My heart is with the leaders of Israel,
JDG.5.9	with the volunteers of the people.
JDG.5.9	Blessed be the 
JDG.5.10	You who ride on white
JDG.5.10	who sit on saddle blankets,
JDG.5.10	and who travel on the road, give praise!
JDG.5.11	Let them tell the righteous acts
JDG.5.11	the righteous deeds of his warriors in Israel,
JDG.5.11	with the voices of the singers at the watering places.
JDG.5.11	Then the 
JDG.5.12	“Awake! Awake, Deborah!
JDG.5.12	Awake! Awake, sing a song!
JDG.5.12	Arise, Barak,
JDG.5.12	and take your prisoners,
JDG.5.12	son of Abinoam!”
JDG.5.13	Then the survivors
JDG.5.13	the 
JDG.5.14	Those with their roots in Amalek
JDG.5.14	Benjamin came with your people after you.
JDG.5.14	The leaders came down from Machir,
JDG.5.14	and those who carry a marshal’s staff came from Zebulun.
JDG.5.15	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah;
JDG.5.15	Issachar was with Barak;
JDG.5.15	they were under his leadership
JDG.5.15	There was great searching
JDG.5.15	among the clans of Reuben.
JDG.5.16	Why did you sit among the sheep pens
JDG.5.16	listening to the playing of pipes for the flocks?
JDG.5.16	There was great searching of heart
JDG.5.16	among the clans of Reuben.
JDG.5.17	Gilead
JDG.5.17	Dan, why did you linger at the ships?
JDG.5.17	Asher remained at the seashore
JDG.5.17	and stayed in his harbors.
JDG.5.18	The people of Zebulun defied death,
JDG.5.18	Naphtali also, on the heights of the battlefield.
JDG.5.19	Kings came and fought.
JDG.5.19	Then the kings of Canaan fought
JDG.5.19	at Taanach by the Waters of Megiddo,
JDG.5.19	but they did not plunder the silver.
JDG.5.20	The stars fought from the heavens;
JDG.5.20	the stars fought with Sisera from their paths.
JDG.5.21	The river Kishon swept them away,
JDG.5.21	the ancient river, the river Kishon.
JDG.5.21	March on, my soul, in strength!
JDG.5.22	The horses’ hooves then hammered —
JDG.5.22	the galloping, galloping of his
JDG.5.23	“Curse Meroz,” says the angel of the 
JDG.5.23	“Bitterly curse her inhabitants,
JDG.5.23	for they did not come to help the 
JDG.5.23	to help the 
JDG.5.24	Jael is most blessed of women,
JDG.5.24	the wife of Heber the Kenite;
JDG.5.24	she is most blessed among tent-dwelling women.
JDG.5.25	He asked for water; she gave him milk.
JDG.5.25	She brought him cream
JDG.5.26	She reached for a tent peg,
JDG.5.26	her right hand, for a workman’s hammer.
JDG.5.26	Then she hammered Sisera —
JDG.5.26	she crushed his head;
JDG.5.26	she shattered and pierced his temple.
JDG.5.27	He collapsed, he fell, he lay down between her feet;
JDG.5.27	he collapsed, he fell between her feet;
JDG.5.27	where he collapsed, there he fell — dead.
JDG.5.28	Sisera’s mother looked through the window;
JDG.5.28	she peered through the lattice, crying out:
JDG.5.28	“Why is his chariot so long in coming?
JDG.5.28	Why don’t I hear the hoofbeats of his horses?” 
JDG.5.29	Her wisest princesses answer her;
JDG.5.29	she even answers herself:
JDG.5.30	“Are they not finding and dividing the spoil —
JDG.5.30	a girl or two
JDG.5.30	the spoil of colored garments for Sisera,
JDG.5.30	the spoil of an embroidered garment or two for my neck?” 
JDG.5.31	But may those who love him
JDG.5.31	be like the rising of the sun in its strength.
JDG.5.31	And the land had peace for forty years.
JDG.6.1	The Israelites did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.6.2	and they oppressed Israel.
JDG.6.3	Whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and the Qedemites
JDG.6.4	They encamped against them and destroyed the produce of the land, even as far as Gaza. They left nothing for Israel to eat, as well as no sheep, ox, or donkey. 
JDG.6.5	For the Midianites came with their cattle and their tents like a great swarm of locusts.
JDG.6.6	So Israel became poverty-stricken because of Midian, and the Israelites cried out to the 
JDG.6.7	When the Israelites cried out to him because of Midian, 
JDG.6.8	the 
JDG.6.9	I rescued you from the power of Egypt and the power of all who oppressed
JDG.6.10	I said to you: I am the 
JDG.6.11	The angel of the 
JDG.6.12	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.13	Gideon said to him, “Please, my lord, if the 
JDG.6.14	The 
JDG.6.15	He said to him, “Please, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Look, my family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the youngest in my father’s family.”
JDG.6.16	“But I will be with you,”
JDG.6.17	Then he said to him, “If I have found favor with you,
JDG.6.18	Please do not leave this place until I return to you. Let me bring my gift and set it before you.”
JDG.6.18	And he said, “I will stay until you return.”
JDG.6.19	So Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from a half bushel
JDG.6.20	The angel of God
JDG.6.21	The angel of the 
JDG.6.22	When Gideon realized that he was the angel of the 
JDG.6.23	But the 
JDG.6.24	So Gideon built an altar to the 
JDG.6.25	On that very night the 
JDG.6.26	Build a well-constructed altar to the 
JDG.6.27	So Gideon took ten of his male servants and did as the 
JDG.6.28	When the men of the city got up in the morning, they found Baal’s altar torn down, the Asherah pole beside it cut down, and the second bull offered up on the altar that had been built. 
JDG.6.29	They said to each other, “Who did this?” After they made a thorough investigation, they said, “Gideon son of Joash did it.”
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son. He must die, because he tore down Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah pole beside it.”
JDG.6.31	But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Would you plead Baal’s case for him? Would you save him? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If he is a god, let him plead his own case because someone tore down his altar.” 
JDG.6.32	That day he was called Jerubbaal, since Joash said, “Let Baal contend with him,” because he tore down his altar.
JDG.6.33	All the Midianites, Amalekites, and Qedemites gathered together, crossed over the Jordan, and camped in the Jezreel Valley.
JDG.6.34	The Spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	He sent messengers throughout all of Manasseh, who rallied behind him. He also sent messengers throughout Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, who also came to meet him.
JDG.6.36	Then Gideon said to God, “If you will deliver Israel by my hand, as you said, 
JDG.6.37	I will put a wool fleece here on the threshing floor. If dew is only on the fleece, and all the ground is dry, I will know that you will deliver Israel by my strength, as you said.” 
JDG.6.38	And that is what happened. When he got up early in the morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung dew out of it, filling a bowl with water.
JDG.6.39	Gideon then said to God, “Don’t be angry with me; let me speak one more time. Please allow me to make one more test with the fleece. Let it remain dry, and the dew be all over the ground.” 
JDG.6.40	That night God did as Gideon requested: only the fleece was dry, and dew was all over the ground.
JDG.7.1	Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the troops who were with him, got up early and camped beside the spring of Harod. The camp of Midian was north of them, below the hill of Moreh, in the valley. 
JDG.7.2	The 
JDG.7.3	Now announce to the troops: ‘Whoever is fearful and trembling may turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’”
JDG.7.4	Then the 
JDG.7.5	So he brought the troops down to the water, and the 
JDG.7.6	The number of those who lapped with their hands to their mouths was three hundred men, and all the rest of the troops knelt to drink water. 
JDG.7.7	The 
JDG.7.8	So Gideon sent all the Israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred troops, who took the provisions and their trumpets. The camp of Midian was below him in the valley.
JDG.7.9	That night the 
JDG.7.10	But if you are afraid to attack the camp, go down with Purah your servant. 
JDG.7.11	Listen to what they say, and then you will be encouraged
JDG.7.12	Now the Midianites, Amalekites, and all the Qedemites had settled down in the valley like a swarm of locusts, and their camels were as innumerable as the sand on the seashore. 
JDG.7.13	When Gideon arrived, there was a man telling his friend about a dream. He said, “Listen, I had a dream:
JDG.7.14	His friend answered: “This is nothing less than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite. God has handed the entire Midianite camp over to him.”
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship. He returned to Israel’s camp and said, “Get up, for the 
JDG.7.16	Then he divided the three hundred men into three companies and gave each of the men a trumpet in one hand and an empty pitcher with a torch inside it in the other hand.
JDG.7.17	“Watch me,” he said to them, “and do what I do. When I come to the outpost of the camp, do as I do. 
JDG.7.18	When I and everyone with me blow our trumpets, you are also to blow your trumpets all around the camp. Then you will say, ‘For the 
JDG.7.19	Gideon and the hundred men who were with him went to the outpost of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch after the sentries had been stationed. They blew their trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands. 
JDG.7.20	The three companies blew their trumpets and shattered their pitchers. They held their torches in their left hands, their trumpets
JDG.7.21	Each Israelite took his position around the camp, and the entire Midianite army began to run, and they cried out as they fled. 
JDG.7.22	When Gideon’s men blew their three hundred trumpets, the 
JDG.7.23	Then the men of Israel were called from Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh, and they pursued the Midianites.
JDG.7.24	Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim with this message: “Come down to intercept the Midianites and take control of the watercourses ahead of them as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan.” So all the men of Ephraim
JDG.7.25	They captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian; they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb, while they were pursuing the Midianites. They brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan.
JDG.8.1	The men of Ephraim said to him, “Why have you done this to us, not calling us when you went to fight against the Midianites?” And they argued with him violently.
JDG.8.2	So he said to them, “What have I done now compared to you? Is not the gleaning
JDG.8.3	God handed over to you Oreb and Zeeb, the two princes of Midian. What was I able to do compared to you?” When he said this, their anger against him subsided.
JDG.8.4	Gideon and the three hundred men came to the Jordan and crossed it. They were exhausted but still in pursuit. 
JDG.8.5	He said to the men of Succoth,
JDG.8.6	But the princes of Succoth asked, “Are
JDG.8.7	Gideon replied, “Very well, when the 
JDG.8.8	He went from there to Penuel and asked the same thing from them. The men of Penuel
JDG.8.9	He also told the men of Penuel, “When I return safely, I will tear down this tower!”
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and with them was their army of about fifteen thousand men, who were all those left of the entire army of the Qedemites. Those who had been killed were one hundred twenty thousand armed men.
JDG.8.11	Gideon traveled on the caravan route
JDG.8.12	Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them. He captured these two kings of Midian and routed the entire army.
JDG.8.13	Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the Ascent of Heres. 
JDG.8.14	He captured a youth from the men of Succoth and interrogated him. The youth wrote down for him the names of the seventy-seven leaders and elders of Succoth. 
JDG.8.15	Then he went to the men of Succoth and said, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. You taunted me about them, saying, ‘Are Zebah and Zalmunna now in your power that we should give bread to your exhausted men? ’” 
JDG.8.16	So he took the elders of the city, and he took some thorns and briers from the wilderness, and he disciplined the men of Succoth with them. 
JDG.8.17	He also tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.
JDG.8.18	He asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men did you kill at Tabor?”
JDG.8.18	“They were like you,” they said. “Each resembled the son of a king.”
JDG.8.19	So he said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother! As the 
JDG.8.20	Then he said to Jether, his firstborn, “Get up and kill them.” The youth did not draw his sword, for he was afraid because he was still a youth.
JDG.8.21	Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Get up and strike us down yourself, for a man is judged by his strength.” So Gideon got up, killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
JDG.8.22	Then the Israelites said to Gideon, “Rule over us,
JDG.8.23	But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the 
JDG.8.24	Then he said to them, “Let me make a request of you: Everyone give me an earring from his plunder.” Now the enemy had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.
JDG.8.25	They said, “We agree to give them.” So they spread out a cloak, and everyone threw an earring from his plunder on it. 
JDG.8.26	The weight of the gold earrings he requested was forty-three pounds
JDG.8.27	Gideon made an ephod
JDG.8.28	So Midian was subdued before the Israelites, and they were no longer a threat.
JDG.8.29	Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) son of Joash went back to live at his house.
JDG.8.30	Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, since he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	His concubine who was in Shechem
JDG.8.32	Then Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
JDG.8.33	When Gideon died, the Israelites turned and prostituted
JDG.8.34	The Israelites did not remember the 
JDG.8.35	They did not show kindness
JDG.9.1	Abimelech son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem and spoke to his uncles and to his mother’s whole clan, saying, 
JDG.9.2	“Please speak in the hearing of all the citizens of Shechem, ‘Is it better for you that seventy men, all the sons of Jerubbaal,
JDG.9.3	His mother’s relatives spoke all these words about him in the hearing of all the citizens of Shechem, and they were favorable to Abimelech, for they said, “He is our brother.” 
JDG.9.4	So they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-berith.
JDG.9.5	He went to his father’s house in Ophrah and killed his seventy brothers, the sons of Jerubbaal, on top of a large stone. But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, survived, because he hid. 
JDG.9.6	Then all the citizens of Shechem and of Beth-millo gathered together and proceeded to make Abimelech king at the oak of the pillar in Shechem.
JDG.9.7	When they told Jotham, he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim,
JDG.9.7	Listen to me, citizens of Shechem,
JDG.9.7	and may God listen to you:
JDG.9.8	The trees decided
JDG.9.8	to anoint a king over themselves.
JDG.9.8	They said to the olive tree, “Reign over us.”
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree said to them,
JDG.9.9	“Should I stop giving my oil
JDG.9.9	that people use to honor both God and men,
JDG.9.9	and rule
JDG.9.10	Then the trees said to the fig tree,
JDG.9.10	“Come and reign over us.”
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said to them,
JDG.9.11	“Should I stop giving
JDG.9.11	my sweetness and my good fruit,
JDG.9.11	and rule over trees?”
JDG.9.12	Later, the trees said to the grapevine,
JDG.9.12	“Come and reign over us.”
JDG.9.13	But the grapevine said to them,
JDG.9.13	“Should I stop giving my wine
JDG.9.13	that cheers both God and man,
JDG.9.13	and rule over trees?”
JDG.9.14	Finally, all the trees said to the bramble,
JDG.9.14	“Come and reign over us.”
JDG.9.15	The bramble said to the trees,
JDG.9.15	“If you really are anointing me
JDG.9.15	as king over you,
JDG.9.15	come and find refuge in my shade.
JDG.9.15	But if not,
JDG.9.15	may fire come out from the bramble
JDG.9.15	and consume the cedars of Lebanon.”
JDG.9.16	“Now if you have acted faithfully
JDG.9.17	for my father fought for you, risked his life, and rescued you from Midian, 
JDG.9.18	and now you have attacked my father’s family today, killed his seventy sons on top of a large stone, and made Abimelech, the son of his slave woman, king over the citizens of Shechem ‘because he is your brother’ —  
JDG.9.19	so if you have acted faithfully and honestly with Jerubbaal and his house this day, rejoice in Abimelech and may he also rejoice in you. 
JDG.9.20	But if not, may fire come from Abimelech and consume the citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire come from the citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo and consume Abimelech.” 
JDG.9.21	Then Jotham fled, escaping to Beer, and lived there because of his brother Abimelech.
JDG.9.22	When Abimelech had ruled over Israel three years, 
JDG.9.23	God sent an evil spirit
JDG.9.24	so that the crime against the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come to justice and their blood would be avenged on their brother Abimelech, who killed them, and on the citizens of Shechem, who had helped him
JDG.9.25	The citizens of Shechem rebelled against him by putting men in ambush
JDG.9.26	Gaal son of Ebed came with his brothers and crossed into Shechem, and the citizens of Shechem trusted him. 
JDG.9.27	So they went out to the countryside and harvested grapes from their vineyards. They trampled the grapes and held a celebration.
JDG.9.28	Gaal son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem that we should serve him? Isn’t he the son of Jerubbaal, and isn’t Zebul his officer? You are to serve the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem.
JDG.9.29	If only these people were in my power, I would remove Abimelech.” So he said
JDG.9.30	When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard the words of Gaal son of Ebed, he was angry. 
JDG.9.31	So he secretly sent messengers to Abimelech, saying, “Beware! Gaal son of Ebed, with his brothers, have come to Shechem and are turning the city against you.
JDG.9.32	Now tonight, you and the troops with you, come and wait in ambush in the countryside. 
JDG.9.33	Then get up early, and at sunrise attack the city. When he and the troops who are with him come out against you, do to him whatever you can.” 
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all the troops with him got up at night and waited in ambush for Shechem in four units.
JDG.9.35	Gaal son of Ebed went out and stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelech and the troops who were with him got up from their ambush. 
JDG.9.36	When Gaal saw the troops, he said to Zebul, “Look, troops are coming down from the mountaintops!” But Zebul said to him, “The shadows of the mountains look like men to you.”
JDG.9.37	Then Gaal spoke again, “Look, troops are coming down from the central part of the land,
JDG.9.38	Zebul replied, “What do you have to say now? You said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him? ’ Aren’t these the troops you despised? Now go and fight them!”
JDG.9.39	So Gaal went out leading the citizens of Shechem and fought against Abimelech, 
JDG.9.40	but Abimelech pursued him, and Gaal fled before him. Numerous bodies were strewn
JDG.9.41	Abimelech stayed in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers from Shechem.
JDG.9.42	The next day when the people of Shechem
JDG.9.43	He took the troops, divided them into three companies, and waited in ambush in the countryside. He looked, and the people were coming out of the city, so he arose against them and struck them down. 
JDG.9.44	Then Abimelech and the units that were with him rushed forward and took their stand at the entrance of the city gate. The other two units rushed against all who were in the countryside and struck them down. 
JDG.9.45	So Abimelech fought against the city that entire day, captured it, and killed the people who were in it. Then he tore down the city and sowed it with salt.
JDG.9.46	When all the citizens of the Tower of Shechem heard, they entered the inner chamber
JDG.9.47	Then it was reported to Abimelech that all the citizens of the Tower of Shechem had gathered. 
JDG.9.48	So Abimelech and all the troops who were with him went up to Mount Zalmon. Abimelech took his ax in his hand and cut a branch from the trees. He picked up the branch, put it on his shoulder, and said to the troops who were with him, “Hurry and do what you have seen me do.” 
JDG.9.49	Each of the troops also cut his own branch and followed Abimelech. They put the branches against the inner chamber and set it on fire; about a thousand men and women died, including all the men of the Tower of Shechem.
JDG.9.50	Abimelech went to Thebez,
JDG.9.51	There was a strong tower inside the city,
JDG.9.52	When Abimelech came to attack the tower, he approached its entrance to set it on fire. 
JDG.9.53	But a woman threw the upper portion of a millstone on Abimelech’s head and fractured his skull. 
JDG.9.54	He quickly called his armor-bearer and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, or they’ll say about me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So his armor-bearer ran him through, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home.
JDG.9.56	In this way, God brought back Abimelech’s evil—the evil that Abimelech had done to his father when he killed his seventy brothers. 
JDG.9.57	God also brought back to the men of Shechem all their evil.
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo became judge and began to deliver Israel. He was from Issachar and lived in Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	Tola judged Israel twenty-three years and when he died, was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	After him came Jair the Gileadite,
JDG.10.4	He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys. They had thirty towns
JDG.10.5	When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.
JDG.10.6	Then the Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the 
JDG.10.7	So the 
JDG.10.8	They shattered and crushed the Israelites that year, and for eighteen years they did the same to all the Israelites who were on the other side of the Jordan
JDG.10.9	The Ammonites also crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim. Israel was greatly oppressed, 
JDG.10.10	so they cried out to the 
JDG.10.11	The 
JDG.10.12	Sidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites
JDG.10.13	But you have abandoned me and worshiped other gods. Therefore, I will not deliver you again. 
JDG.10.14	Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen.
JDG.10.15	But the Israelites said, “We have sinned. Deal with us as you see fit;
JDG.10.16	So they got rid of the foreign gods
JDG.10.17	The Ammonites were called together, and they camped in Gilead. So the Israelites assembled and camped at Mizpah.
JDG.10.18	The rulers
JDG.11.1	Jephthah
JDG.11.2	Gilead’s wife bore him sons, and when they grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You will have no inheritance in our father’s family, because you are the son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob.
JDG.11.4	Some time later, the Ammonites fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	When the Ammonites made war with Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob. 
JDG.11.6	They said to him, “Come, be our commander, and let’s fight the Ammonites.”
JDG.11.7	Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, “Didn’t you hate me and drive me out of my father’s family? Why then have you come to me now when you’re in trouble?”
JDG.11.8	They answered Jephthah, “That’s true. But now we turn to you. Come with us, fight the Ammonites, and you will become leader of all the inhabitants of Gilead.”
JDG.11.9	So Jephthah said to them, “If you are bringing me back to fight the Ammonites and the 
JDG.11.10	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The 
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead. The people made him their leader and commander, and Jephthah repeated all his terms in the presence of the 
JDG.11.12	Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, asking, “What do you have against me that you have come to fight me in my land?”
JDG.11.13	The king of the Ammonites said to Jephthah’s messengers, “When Israel came from Egypt, they seized my land from the Arnon to the Jabbok
JDG.11.14	Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites 
JDG.11.15	to tell him, “This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. 
JDG.11.16	But when they came from Egypt, Israel traveled through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. 
JDG.11.17	Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please let us travel through your land,’ but the king of Edom would not listen. They also sent messengers to the king of Moab, but he refused. So Israel stayed in Kadesh.
JDG.11.18	“Then they traveled through the wilderness and around the lands of Edom and Moab. They came to the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon but did not enter into the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab.
JDG.11.19	“Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon.
JDG.11.20	but Sihon would not trust Israel to pass through his territory. Instead, Sihon gathered all his troops, camped at Jahaz, and fought with Israel. 
JDG.11.21	Then the 
JDG.11.22	They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan.
JDG.11.23	“The 
JDG.11.24	Isn’t it true that you can have whatever your god Chemosh conquers for you, and we can have whatever the 
JDG.11.25	Now are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend with Israel or fight against them? 
JDG.11.26	While Israel lived three hundred years in Heshbon and Aroer and their surrounding villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, why didn’t you take them back at that time? 
JDG.11.27	I have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by fighting against me. Let the 
JDG.11.28	But the king of the Ammonites would not listen to Jephthah’s message that he sent him.
JDG.11.29	The Spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	Jephthah made this vow
JDG.11.31	whoever comes out the doors of my house to greet me when I return safely from the Ammonites will belong to the 
JDG.11.32	Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the 
JDG.11.33	He defeated twenty of their cities with a great slaughter from Aroer all the way to the entrance of Minnith and to Abel-keramim. So the Ammonites were subdued
JDG.11.34	When Jephthah went to his home in Mizpah, there was his daughter, coming out to meet him with tambourines and dancing!
JDG.11.35	When he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “No! Not my daughter! You have devastated me! You have brought great misery on me.
JDG.11.36	Then she said to him, “My father, you have given your word to the 
JDG.11.37	She also said to her father, “Let me do this one thing: Let me wander two months through the mountains with my friends and mourn my virginity.”
JDG.11.38	“Go,” he said. And he sent her away two months. So she left with her friends and mourned her virginity as she wandered through the mountains. 
JDG.11.39	At the end of two months, she returned to her father, and he kept the vow he had made about her. And she had never been intimate with a man. Now it became a custom in Israel 
JDG.11.40	that four days each year the young women of Israel would commemorate the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite.
JDG.12.1	The men of Ephraim were called together and crossed the Jordan to Zaphon.
JDG.12.2	Then Jephthah said to them, “My people and I had a bitter conflict with the Ammonites. So I called for you, but you didn’t deliver me from their power. 
JDG.12.3	When I saw that you weren’t going to deliver me, I took my life in my own hands and crossed over to the Ammonites, and the 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah gathered all of the men of Gilead. They fought and defeated Ephraim, because Ephraim had said, “You Gileadites are Ephraimite fugitives in the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh.” 
JDG.12.5	The Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan leading to Ephraim. Whenever a fugitive from Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the Gileadites asked him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he answered, “No,” 
JDG.12.6	they told him, “Please say Shibboleth.” If he said, “Sibboleth,” because he could not pronounce it correctly, they seized him and executed him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time forty-two thousand from Ephraim died.
JDG.12.7	Jephthah judged Israel six years, and when he died, he was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
JDG.12.8	Ibzan, who was from Bethlehem,
JDG.12.9	and had thirty sons. He gave his thirty daughters in marriage to men outside the tribe and brought back thirty wives for his sons from outside the tribe. Ibzan judged Israel seven years, 
JDG.12.10	and when he died, he was buried in Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	Elon, who was from Zebulun, judged Israel after Ibzan. He judged Israel ten years, 
JDG.12.12	and when he died, he was buried in Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel, who was from Pirathon,
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. Abdon judged Israel eight years, 
JDG.12.15	and when he died, he was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
JDG.13.1	The Israelites again did what was evil in the 
JDG.13.2	There was a certain man from Zorah,
JDG.13.3	The angel of the 
JDG.13.4	Now please be careful not to drink wine or beer,
JDG.13.5	for indeed, you will conceive and give birth to a son. You must never cut his hair,
JDG.13.6	Then the woman went and told her husband, “A man of God came to me. He looked like the awe-inspiring angel of God. I didn’t ask him where he came from, and he didn’t tell me his name. 
JDG.13.7	He said to me, ‘You will conceive and give birth to a son. Therefore, do not drink wine or beer, and do not eat anything unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from birth until the day of his death.’”
JDG.13.8	Manoah prayed
JDG.13.9	God listened
JDG.13.10	The woman ran quickly to her husband and told him, “The man who came to me the other day has just come back!”
JDG.13.11	So Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he asked, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?”
JDG.13.11	“I am,” he said.
JDG.13.12	Then Manoah asked, “When your words come true, what will be the boy’s responsibilities and work?”
JDG.13.13	The angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine or drink wine or beer. And she must not eat anything unclean. Your wife must do everything I have commanded her.”
JDG.13.15	“Please stay here,” Manoah told him, “and we will prepare a young goat
JDG.13.16	The angel of the 
JDG.13.17	Then Manoah said to him, “What is your name, so that we may honor you when your words come true?”
JDG.13.18	“Why do you ask my name,” the angel of the 
JDG.13.19	Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered them on a rock to the 
JDG.13.20	When the flame went up from the altar to the sky, the angel of the 
JDG.13.21	The angel of the 
JDG.13.22	“We’re certainly going to die,” he said to his wife, “because we have seen God!” 
JDG.13.23	But his wife said to him, “If the 
JDG.13.24	So the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson.
JDG.13.25	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	Samson went down to Timnah
JDG.14.2	He went back and told his father and his mother: “I have seen a young Philistine woman in Timnah. Now get her for me as a wife.”
JDG.14.3	But his father and mother said to him, “Can’t you find a young woman among your relatives or among any of our people? Must you go to the uncircumcised Philistines for a wife?”
JDG.14.3	But Samson told his father, “Get her for me. She’s the right one for me.”  
JDG.14.4	Now his father and mother did not know this was from the 
JDG.14.5	Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother and came to the vineyards of Timnah. Suddenly a young lion came roaring at him, 
JDG.14.6	the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.7	Then he went and spoke to the woman, because she seemed right to Samson.
JDG.14.8	After some time, when he returned to marry her, he left the road to see the lion’s carcass, and there was a swarm of bees with honey in the carcass. 
JDG.14.9	He scooped some honey into his hands and ate it as he went along. When he came to his father and mother, he gave some to them and they ate it. But he did not tell them that he had scooped the honey from the lion’s carcass.
JDG.14.10	His father went to visit the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, as young men were accustomed to do. 
JDG.14.11	When the Philistines saw him, they brought thirty men to accompany him.
JDG.14.12	“Let me tell you a riddle,”
JDG.14.13	But if you can’t explain it to me, you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes.”
JDG.14.13	“Tell us your riddle,” they replied.
JDG.14.14	So he said to them:
JDG.14.14	Out of the eater came something to eat,
JDG.14.14	and out of the strong came something sweet.
JDG.14.14	After three days, they were unable to explain the riddle. 
JDG.14.15	On the fourth
JDG.14.16	So Samson’s wife came to him, weeping, and said, “You hate me and don’t love me!
JDG.14.16	“Look,” he said,
JDG.14.17	She wept the whole seven days of the feast, and at last, on the seventh day, he explained it to her, because she had nagged him so much. Then she explained it to her people. 
JDG.14.18	On the seventh day, before sunset, the men of the city said to him:
JDG.14.18	What is sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	What is stronger than a lion?
JDG.14.18	So he said to them:
JDG.14.18	If you hadn’t plowed with my young cow,
JDG.14.18	you wouldn’t know my riddle now!
JDG.14.19	The Spirit of the 
JDG.14.20	and his wife was given to one of the men who had accompanied him.
JDG.15.1	Later on, during the wheat harvest,
JDG.15.2	“I was sure you hated her,” her father said, “so I gave her to one of the men who accompanied you. Isn’t her younger sister more beautiful than she is? Why not take her instead?”
JDG.15.3	Samson said to them, “This time I will be blameless
JDG.15.4	So he went out and caught three hundred foxes.
JDG.15.5	Then he ignited the torches and released the foxes into the standing grain of the Philistines. He burned the piles of grain and the standing grain as well as the vineyards and olive groves.
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines asked, “Who did this?”
JDG.15.6	They were told, “It was Samson, the Timnite’s son-in-law, because he took Samson’s wife and gave her to his companion.” So the Philistines went to her and her father and burned them to death.
JDG.15.7	Then Samson told them, “Because you did this, I swear that I won’t rest until I have taken vengeance on you.” 
JDG.15.8	He tore them limb from limb
JDG.15.9	The Philistines went up, camped in Judah, and raided Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	So the men of Judah said, “Why have you attacked us?”
JDG.15.10	They replied, “We have come to tie Samson up and pay him back for what he did to us.”
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went to the cave at the rock of Etam, and they asked Samson, “Don’t you realize that the Philistines rule us?
JDG.15.11	“I have done to them what they did to me,” he answered.
JDG.15.12	They said to him, “We’ve come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines.”
JDG.15.12	Then Samson told them, “Swear to me that you yourselves won’t kill me.”
JDG.15.13	“No,” they said,
JDG.15.14	When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came to meet him shouting. The Spirit of the 
JDG.15.15	He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, reached out his hand, took it, and killed a thousand men with it. 
JDG.15.16	Then Samson said:
JDG.15.16	With the jawbone of a donkey
JDG.15.16	I have piled them in heaps.
JDG.15.16	With the jawbone of a donkey
JDG.15.16	I have killed a thousand men.
JDG.15.17	When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone and named that place Ramath-lehi.
JDG.15.18	He became very thirsty and called out to the 
JDG.15.19	So God split a hollow place in the ground at Lehi, and water came out of it. After Samson drank, his strength returned, and he revived.
JDG.15.20	And he judged Israel twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
JDG.16.1	Samson went to Gaza,
JDG.16.2	When the Gazites heard that Samson was there, they surrounded the place and waited in ambush for him all that night at the city gate. They kept quiet all night, saying, “Let’s wait until dawn; then we will kill him.” 
JDG.16.3	But Samson stayed in bed only until midnight. Then he got up, took hold of the doors of the city gate along with the two gateposts, and pulled them out, bar and all. He put them on his shoulders and took them to the top of the mountain overlooking Hebron.
JDG.16.4	Some time later, he fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the Sorek Valley. 
JDG.16.5	The Philistine leaders
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me, where does your great strength come from? How could someone tie you up and make you helpless?”
JDG.16.7	Samson told her, “If they tie me up with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, I will become weak and be like any other man.”
JDG.16.8	The Philistine leaders brought her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied him up with them. 
JDG.16.9	While the men in ambush were waiting in her room, she called out to him, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” 
JDG.16.10	Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me and told me lies! Won’t you please tell me how you can be tied up?”
JDG.16.11	He told her, “If they tie me up with new ropes that have never been used,
JDG.16.12	Delilah took new ropes, tied him up with them, and shouted, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” But while the men in ambush were waiting in her room, he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.
JDG.16.13	Then Delilah said to Samson, “You have mocked me all along and told me lies! Tell me how you can be tied up.”
JDG.16.13	He told her, “If you weave the seven braids on my head into the fabric on a loom — ” 
JDG.16.14	She fastened the braids with a pin and called to him, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” He awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin, with the loom and the web.
JDG.16.15	“How can you say, ‘I love you,’”
JDG.16.16	Because she nagged him day after day and pleaded with him until she wore him out,
JDG.16.17	he told her the whole truth and said to her, “My hair has never been cut,
JDG.16.18	When Delilah realized that he had told her the whole truth, she sent this message to the Philistine leaders: “Come one more time, for he has told me the whole truth.” The Philistine leaders came to her and brought the silver with them.
JDG.16.19	Then she let him fall asleep on her lap and called a man to shave off the seven braids on his head. In this way, she made him helpless, and his strength left him. 
JDG.16.20	Then she cried, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” When he awoke from his sleep, he said, “I will escape as I did before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the 
JDG.16.21	The Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes. They brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles, and he was forced to grind grain in the prison. 
JDG.16.22	But his hair began to grow back after it had been shaved.
JDG.16.23	Now the Philistine leaders gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon.
JDG.16.23	Our god has handed over
JDG.16.23	our enemy Samson to us.
JDG.16.24	When the people saw him, they praised their god
JDG.16.24	Our god has handed over to us
JDG.16.24	our enemy who destroyed our land
JDG.16.24	and who multiplied our dead.
JDG.16.25	When they were in good spirits,
JDG.16.26	Samson said to the young man who was leading him by the hand, “Lead me where I can feel the pillars supporting the temple, so I can lean against them.” 
JDG.16.27	The temple was full of men and women; all the leaders of the Philistines were there, and about three thousand men and women were on the roof watching Samson entertain them. 
JDG.16.28	He called out to the 
JDG.16.29	Samson took hold of the two middle pillars supporting the temple and leaned against them, one on his right hand and the other on his left. 
JDG.16.30	Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines.” He pushed with all his might, and the temple fell on the leaders and all the people in it. And those he killed at his death were more than those he had killed in his life.
JDG.16.31	Then his brothers and all his father’s family came down, carried him back, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. So he judged Israel twenty years.
JDG.17.1	There was a man from the hill country of Ephraim named Micah. 
JDG.17.2	He said to his mother, “The 1,100 pieces of silver taken from you, and that I heard you place a curse on — here’s the silver. I took it.”
JDG.17.2	Then his mother said, “My son, may you be blessed by the 
JDG.17.3	He returned the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother, and his mother said, “I personally consecrate
JDG.17.4	So he returned the silver to his mother, and she took five pounds of silver and gave it to a silversmith. He made it into a carved image and a silver idol, and it was in Micah’s house.
JDG.17.5	This man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household idols,
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel;
JDG.17.7	There was a young man, a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, who was staying within the clan of Judah.
JDG.17.8	The man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to stay wherever he could find a place. On his way he came to Micah’s home in the hill country of Ephraim.
JDG.17.9	“Where do you come from?” Micah asked him.
JDG.17.9	He answered him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I’m going to stay wherever I can find a place.”
JDG.17.10	Micah replied,
JDG.17.11	and agreed to stay with the man, and the young man became like one of his sons. 
JDG.17.12	Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest
JDG.17.13	Then Micah said, “Now I know that the 
JDG.18.1	In those days, there was no king in Israel,
JDG.18.2	So the Danites sent out five brave men
JDG.18.2	They came to the hill country of Ephraim as far as the home of Micah and spent the night there. 
JDG.18.3	While they were near Micah’s home, they recognized the accent of the young Levite. So they went over to him and asked, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is keeping you here?” 
JDG.18.4	He told them, “This is what Micah has done for me: He has hired me, and I became his priest.”
JDG.18.5	Then they said to him, “Please inquire of God
JDG.18.6	The priest told them, “Go in peace. The 
JDG.18.7	The five men left and came to Laish. They saw that the people who were there were living securely, in the same way as the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting. There was nothing lacking
JDG.18.8	When the men went back to their relatives at Zorah and Eshtaol,
JDG.18.9	They answered, “Come on, let’s attack them, for we have seen the land, and it is very good. Why wait? Don’t hesitate to go and invade and take possession of the land! 
JDG.18.10	When you get there, you will come to an unsuspecting people and a spacious land, for God has handed it over to you. It is a place where nothing on earth is lacking.”
JDG.18.11	Six hundred Danites departed from Zorah and Eshtaol armed with weapons of war. 
JDG.18.12	They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim
JDG.18.13	From there they traveled to the hill country of Ephraim and arrived at Micah’s house.
JDG.18.14	The five men who had gone to scout out the land of Laish told their brothers, “Did you know that there are an ephod, household gods, and a carved image and a silver idol
JDG.18.15	So they detoured there and went to the house of the young Levite at the home of Micah and greeted him. 
JDG.18.16	The six hundred Danite men were standing by the entrance of the city gate, armed with their weapons of war. 
JDG.18.17	Then the five men who had gone to scout out the land went in and took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the silver idol,
JDG.18.18	When they entered Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the silver idol, the priest said to them, “What are you doing?”
JDG.18.19	They told him, “Be quiet. Keep your mouth shut.
JDG.18.20	So the priest was pleased and took his ephod, household idols, and carved image, and went with the people. 
JDG.18.21	They prepared to leave, putting their dependents, livestock, and possessions in front of them.
JDG.18.22	After they were some distance from Micah’s house, the men who were in the houses near it were mustered and caught up with the Danites. 
JDG.18.23	They called to the Danites, who turned to face them, and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you that you mustered the men?”
JDG.18.24	He said, “You took the gods I had made and the priest, and went away. What do I have left? How can you say to me, ‘What’s the matter with you? ’”
JDG.18.25	The Danites said to him, “Don’t raise your voice against us, or angry men will attack you, and you and your family will lose your lives.” 
JDG.18.26	The Danites went on their way, and Micah turned to go back home, because he saw that they were stronger than he was.
JDG.18.27	After they had taken the gods Micah had made and the priest that belonged to him, they went to Laish, to a quiet and unsuspecting people. They killed them with their swords and burned the city.
JDG.18.28	There was no one to rescue them
JDG.18.29	They named the city Dan, after the name of their ancestor Dan, who was born to Israel. The city was formerly named Laish.
JDG.18.30	The Danites set up the carved image for themselves. Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses,
JDG.18.31	So they set up for themselves Micah’s carved image that he had made, and it was there as long as the house of God was in Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	In those days, when there was no king in Israel,
JDG.19.2	But she was unfaithful to
JDG.19.3	Then her husband got up and followed her to speak kindly to her
JDG.19.4	His father-in-law, the girl’s father, detained him, and he stayed with him for three days. They ate, drank, and spent the nights there.
JDG.19.5	On the fourth day, they got up early in the morning and prepared to go, but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Have something to eat to keep up your strength
JDG.19.6	So they sat down and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the girl’s father said to the man, “Please agree to stay overnight and enjoy yourself.”
JDG.19.7	The man got up to go, but his father-in-law persuaded him, so he stayed and spent the night there again. 
JDG.19.8	He got up early in the morning of the fifth day to leave, but the girl’s father said to him, “Please keep up your strength.” So they waited until late afternoon and the two of them ate. 
JDG.19.9	The man got up to go with his concubine and his servant, when his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Look, night is coming. Please spend the night. See, the day is almost over. Spend the night here, enjoy yourself, then you can get up early tomorrow for your journey and go home.”
JDG.19.10	But the man was unwilling to spend the night. He got up, departed, and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem
JDG.19.11	When they were near Jebus and the day was almost gone, the servant
JDG.19.12	But his master replied to him, “We will not stop at a foreign city where there are no Israelites. Let’s move on to Gibeah.”
JDG.19.13	“Come on,” he said,
JDG.19.14	So they continued on their journey, and the sun set as they neared Gibeah in Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	They stopped
JDG.19.16	In the evening, an old man came in from his work in the field. He was from the hill country of Ephraim,
JDG.19.17	When he looked up and saw the traveler in the city square, the old man asked, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?”
JDG.19.18	He answered him, “We’re traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote hill country of Ephraim, where I am from. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and now I’m going to the house of the 
JDG.19.19	although there’s straw and feed for the donkeys, and I have bread and wine for me, my concubine, and the servant
JDG.19.20	“Welcome!” said the old man. “I’ll take care of everything you need. Only don’t spend the night in the square.” 
JDG.19.21	So he brought him to his house and fed the donkeys. Then they washed their feet and ate and drank.
JDG.19.22	While they were enjoying themselves, all of a sudden, wicked men of the city
JDG.19.23	The owner of the house went out and said to them, “Please don’t do this evil, my brothers. After all, this man has come into my house. Don’t commit this horrible outrage.
JDG.19.24	Here, let me bring out my virgin daughter
JDG.19.25	But the men would not listen to him, so the man seized his concubine and took her outside to them. They raped
JDG.19.26	Early that morning, the woman made her way back, and as it was getting light, she collapsed at the doorway of the man’s house where her master was.
JDG.19.27	When her master got up in the morning, opened the doors of the house, and went out to leave on his journey, there was the woman, his concubine, collapsed near the doorway of the house with her hands on the threshold. 
JDG.19.28	“Get up,” he told her. “Let’s go.” But there was no response.
JDG.19.29	When he entered his house, he picked up a knife, took hold of his concubine, cut her into twelve pieces, limb by limb, and then sent her throughout the territory of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	Everyone who saw it said, “Nothing like this has ever happened or has been seen since the day the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt until now.
JDG.20.1	All the Israelites from Dan to Beer-sheba
JDG.20.2	The leaders
JDG.20.3	The Benjaminites heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.
JDG.20.3	The Israelites asked, “Tell us, how did this evil act happen?”
JDG.20.4	The Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, answered: “I went to Gibeah in Benjamin with my concubine to spend the night. 
JDG.20.5	Citizens of Gibeah came to attack me and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me, but they raped my concubine, and she died. 
JDG.20.6	Then I took my concubine and cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout Israel’s territory, because they have committed a wicked outrage in
JDG.20.7	Look, all of you are Israelites. Give your judgment and verdict here and now.”
JDG.20.8	Then all the people stood united and said, “None of us will go to his tent or return to his house. 
JDG.20.9	Now this is what we will do to Gibeah: we will attack it. By lot 
JDG.20.10	we will take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of Israel, and one hundred out of every thousand, and one thousand out of every ten thousand to get provisions for the troops when they go to Gibeah in Benjamin to punish them for all the outrage they committed in Israel.”
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel
JDG.20.12	Then the tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this evil act that has happened among you? 
JDG.20.13	Hand over the wicked men
JDG.20.14	Instead, the Benjaminites gathered together from their cities to Gibeah to go out and fight against the Israelites. 
JDG.20.15	On that day the Benjaminites mobilized twenty-six thousand armed men
JDG.20.16	There were seven hundred fit young men who were left-handed among all these troops; all could sling a stone at a hair and not miss.
JDG.20.17	The Israelites, apart from Benjamin, mobilized four hundred thousand armed men, every one an experienced warrior. 
JDG.20.18	They set out, went to Bethel, and inquired of God.
JDG.20.18	And the 
JDG.20.19	In the morning, the Israelites set out and camped near Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	The men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin and took their battle positions against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	The Benjaminites came out of Gibeah and slaughtered twenty-two thousand men of Israel on the field that day. 
JDG.20.22	But the Israelite troops rallied and again took their battle positions in the same place where they positioned themselves on the first day. 
JDG.20.23	They went up, wept
JDG.20.23	And the 
JDG.20.24	On the second day the Israelites advanced against the Benjaminites. 
JDG.20.25	That same day the Benjaminites came out from Gibeah to meet them and slaughtered an additional eighteen thousand Israelites on the field; all were armed.
JDG.20.26	The whole Israelite army went to Bethel where they wept and sat before the 
JDG.20.27	Then the Israelites inquired of the 
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas son of Eleazar, son of Aaron,
JDG.20.28	The 
JDG.20.29	So Israel set up an ambush
JDG.20.30	On the third day the Israelites fought against the Benjaminites and took their battle positions against Gibeah as before. 
JDG.20.31	Then the Benjaminites came out against the troops and were drawn away from the city.
JDG.20.32	The Benjaminites said, “We are defeating them as before.”
JDG.20.32	But the Israelites said, “Let’s flee and draw them away from the city to the highways.” 
JDG.20.33	So all the men of Israel got up from their places and took their battle positions at Baal-tamar, while the Israelites in ambush charged out of their places west of
JDG.20.34	Then ten thousand fit young men from all Israel made a frontal assault against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce, but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was about to strike them. 
JDG.20.35	The 
JDG.20.36	Then the Benjaminites realized they had been defeated.
JDG.20.36	The men of Israel had retreated before Benjamin, because they were confident in the ambush they had set against Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	The men in ambush had rushed quickly against Gibeah; they advanced and put the whole city to the sword.
JDG.20.38	The men of Israel had a prearranged signal with the men in ambush: when they sent up a great cloud of smoke from the city, 
JDG.20.39	the men of Israel would return to the battle. When Benjamin had begun to strike them down, killing about thirty men of Israel, they said, “They’re defeated before us, just as they were in the first battle.”
JDG.20.40	But when the column of smoke began to go up from the city, Benjamin looked behind them, and the whole city was going up in smoke.
JDG.20.41	Then the men of Israel returned, and the men of Benjamin were terrified when they realized that disaster had struck them. 
JDG.20.42	They retreated before the men of Israel toward the wilderness,
JDG.20.43	They surrounded the Benjaminites, pursued them, and easily overtook them near Gibeah toward the east. 
JDG.20.44	There were eighteen thousand men who died from Benjamin; all were warriors. 
JDG.20.45	Then Benjamin turned and fled toward the wilderness to Rimmon Rock,
JDG.20.46	All the Benjaminites who died that day were twenty-five thousand armed men; all were warriors. 
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men escaped into the wilderness to Rimmon Rock and stayed there four months. 
JDG.20.48	The men of Israel turned back against the other Benjaminites and killed them with their swords — the entire city, the animals, and everything that remained. They also burned all the cities that remained.
JDG.21.1	The men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah: “None of us will give his daughter to a Benjaminite in marriage.”
JDG.21.2	So the people went to Bethel and sat there before God
JDG.21.3	and cried out, “Why, 
JDG.21.4	The next day the people got up early, built an altar there,
JDG.21.5	The Israelites asked, “Who of all the tribes of Israel didn’t come to the 
JDG.21.6	But the Israelites had compassion on their brothers, the Benjaminites, and said, “Today a tribe has been cut off from Israel. 
JDG.21.7	What should we do about wives for the survivors? We’ve sworn to the 
JDG.21.8	They asked, “Which city among the tribes of Israel didn’t come to the 
JDG.21.9	For when the roll was called, no men were there from the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead.
JDG.21.10	The congregation sent twelve thousand brave warriors
JDG.21.11	This is what you should do: Completely destroy every male, as well as every woman who has gone to bed with a man.” 
JDG.21.12	They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins, who had not gone to bed with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
JDG.21.13	The whole congregation sent a message of peace
JDG.21.14	Benjamin returned at that time, and Israel gave them the women they had kept alive from Jabesh-gilead. But there were not enough for them.
JDG.21.15	The people had compassion on Benjamin, because the 
JDG.21.16	The elders of the congregation said, “What should we do about wives for those who are left, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?” 
JDG.21.17	They said, “There must be heirs for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe of Israel will not be wiped out. 
JDG.21.18	But we can’t give them our daughters as wives.” For the Israelites had sworn, “Anyone who gives a wife to a Benjaminite is cursed.” 
JDG.21.19	They also said, “Look, there’s an annual festival to the 
JDG.21.20	Then they commanded the Benjaminites: “Go and hide in the vineyards. 
JDG.21.21	Watch, and when you see the young women of Shiloh come out to perform the dances,
JDG.21.22	When their fathers or brothers come to us and protest, we will tell them, ‘Show favor to them, since we did not get enough wives for each of them in the battle. You didn’t actually give the women to them, so
JDG.21.23	The Benjaminites did this and took the number of women they needed from the dancers they caught. They went back to their own inheritance, rebuilt their cities,
JDG.21.24	At that time, each of the Israelites returned from there to his own tribe and family. Each returned from there to his own inheritance.
JDG.21.25	In those days there was no king in Israel;
RUT.1.1	During the time
RUT.1.2	The man’s name was Elimelech,
RUT.1.3	Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	Her sons took Moabite women as their wives: one was named Orpah and the second was named Ruth. After they lived in Moab about ten years, 
RUT.1.5	both Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left without her two children and without her husband.
RUT.1.6	She and her daughters-in-law set out to return from the territory of Moab, because she had heard in Moab that the 
RUT.1.7	She left the place where she had been living, accompanied by her two daughters-in-law, and traveled along the road leading back to the land of Judah.
RUT.1.8	Naomi said to them, “Each of you go back to your mother’s home.
RUT.1.9	May the 
RUT.1.10	They said to her, “We insist on returning with you to your people.”
RUT.1.11	But Naomi replied, “Return home, my daughters. Why do you want to go with me? Am I able to have any more sons who could become your husbands?
RUT.1.12	Return home, my daughters. Go on, for I am too old to have another husband. Even if I thought there was still hope for me to have a husband tonight and to bear sons, 
RUT.1.13	would you be willing to wait for them to grow up? Would you restrain yourselves from remarrying?
RUT.1.14	Again they wept loudly, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her. 
RUT.1.15	Naomi said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods.
RUT.1.16	But Ruth replied:
RUT.1.16	Don’t plead with me to abandon you
RUT.1.16	or to return and not follow you.
RUT.1.16	For wherever you go, I will go,
RUT.1.16	and wherever you live, I will live;
RUT.1.16	your people will be my people,
RUT.1.16	and your God will be my God.
RUT.1.17	Where you die, I will die,
RUT.1.17	and there I will be buried.
RUT.1.17	May the 
RUT.1.17	and do so severely,
RUT.1.17	if anything but death separates you and me.
RUT.1.18	When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped talking to her.
RUT.1.19	The two of them traveled until they came to Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was excited about their arrival
RUT.1.20	“Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara,”
RUT.1.21	I went away full, but the 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi came back from the territory of Moab with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabitess. They arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side. He was a prominent man of noble character
RUT.2.2	Ruth the Moabitess asked Naomi, “Will you let me go into the fields and gather fallen grain
RUT.2.2	Naomi answered her, “Go ahead, my daughter.” 
RUT.2.3	So Ruth left and entered the field to gather grain behind the harvesters. She happened
RUT.2.4	Later, when Boaz arrived from Bethlehem, he said to the harvesters, “The 
RUT.2.4	“The 
RUT.2.5	Boaz asked his servant who was in charge of the harvesters, “Whose young woman is this?”
RUT.2.6	The servant answered, “She is the young Moabite woman who returned with Naomi from the territory of Moab. 
RUT.2.7	She asked, ‘Will you let me gather fallen grain among the bundles behind the harvesters? ’ She came and has been on her feet since early morning, except that she rested a little in the shelter.”
RUT.2.8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter.
RUT.2.9	See which field they are harvesting, and follow them. Haven’t I ordered the young men not to touch you?
RUT.2.10	She fell facedown, bowed to the ground,
RUT.2.11	Boaz answered her, “Everything you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband’s death has been fully reported to me: how you left your father and mother and your native land, and how you came to a people you didn’t previously know. 
RUT.2.12	May the 
RUT.2.13	“My lord,” she said, “I have found favor with you, for you have comforted and encouraged
RUT.2.14	At mealtime Boaz told her, “Come over here and have some bread and dip it in the vinegar sauce.” So she sat beside the harvesters, and he offered her roasted grain. She ate and was satisfied and had some left over.
RUT.2.15	When she got up to gather grain, Boaz ordered his young men, “Let her even gather grain among the bundles, and don’t humiliate her. 
RUT.2.16	Pull out some stalks from the bundles for her and leave them for her to gather. Don’t rebuke her.” 
RUT.2.17	So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening. She beat out what she had gathered, and it was about twenty-six quarts
RUT.2.18	She picked up the grain and went into the town, where her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She brought out what she had left over from her meal and gave it to her.
RUT.2.19	Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you gather barley today, and where did you work? May the 
RUT.2.19	Ruth told her mother-in-law whom she had worked with and said, “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz.”
RUT.2.20	Then Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May the 
RUT.2.21	Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also told me, ‘Stay with my young men until they have finished all of my harvest.’”
RUT.2.22	So Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “My daughter, it is good for you to work
RUT.2.23	Ruth stayed close to Boaz’s female servants and gathered grain until the barley and the wheat harvests were finished.
RUT.3.1	Ruth’s mother-in-law Naomi said to her, “My daughter, shouldn’t I find rest for you, so that you will be taken care of? 
RUT.3.2	Now isn’t Boaz our relative?
RUT.3.3	Wash, put on perfumed oil, and wear your best clothes. Go down to the threshing floor, but don’t let the man know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. 
RUT.3.4	When he lies down, notice the place where he’s lying, go in and uncover his feet, and lie down. Then he will explain to you what you should do.”
RUT.3.5	So Ruth said to her, “I will do everything you say.”
RUT.3.6	She went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother-in-law had charged her to do. 
RUT.3.7	After Boaz ate, drank, and was in good spirits,
RUT.3.8	At midnight, Boaz was startled, turned over, and there lying at his feet was a woman! 
RUT.3.9	So he asked, “Who are you?”
RUT.3.9	“I am Ruth, your servant,” she replied. “Take me under your wing,
RUT.3.10	Then he said, “May the 
RUT.3.11	Now don’t be afraid, my daughter. I will do for you whatever you say,
RUT.3.12	Yes, it is true that I am a family redeemer, but there is a redeemer closer than I am. 
RUT.3.13	Stay here tonight, and in the morning, if he wants to redeem you, that’s good.

RUT.3.15	And he told Ruth, “Bring the shawl you’re wearing and hold it out.” When she held it out, he shoveled six measures of barley into her shawl, and she
RUT.3.16	She went to her mother-in-law, Naomi, who asked her, “What happened,
RUT.3.16	Then Ruth told her everything the man had done for her. 
RUT.3.17	She said, “He gave me these six measures of barley, because he said,
RUT.3.18	Naomi said, “My daughter, wait until you find out how things go, for he won’t rest unless he resolves this today.”
RUT.4.1	Boaz went to the gate of the town
RUT.4.2	Then Boaz took ten men of the town’s elders
RUT.4.3	He said to the redeemer, “Naomi, who has returned from the territory of Moab, is selling the portion of the field that belonged to our brother Elimelech.
RUT.4.4	I thought I should inform you:
RUT.4.4	“I want to redeem it,” he answered.
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz said, “On the day you buy the field from Naomi, you will acquire
RUT.4.6	The redeemer replied, “I can’t redeem it myself, or I will ruin my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption, because I can’t redeem it.”
RUT.4.7	At an earlier period in Israel, a man removed his sandal
RUT.4.8	So the redeemer removed his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy back the property yourself.”
RUT.4.9	Boaz said to the elders and all the people, “You are witnesses today that I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech, Chilion, and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, Mahlon’s widow, as my wife, to perpetuate the deceased man’s name on his property, so that his name will not disappear among his relatives or from the gate of his hometown. You are witnesses today.”
RUT.4.11	All the people who were at the city gate, including the elders, said, “We are witnesses. May the 
RUT.4.12	May your house become like the house of Perez, the son Tamar bore to Judah,
RUT.4.13	Boaz took Ruth and she became his wife. He slept with her, and the 
RUT.4.14	The women said to Naomi, “Blessed be the 
RUT.4.15	He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age. Indeed, your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons,
RUT.4.16	Naomi took the child, placed him on her lap, and became his nanny. 
RUT.4.17	The neighbor women said, “A son has been born to Naomi,” and they named him Obed.
RUT.4.18	Now these are the family records of Perez:
RUT.4.18	Perez fathered Hezron,
RUT.4.19	Hezron fathered Ram,
RUT.4.19	Ram fathered Amminadab,

1SA.1.1	There was a man from Ramathaim-zophim
1SA.1.2	He had two wives,
1SA.1.3	This man would go up from his town every year
1SA.1.4	Whenever Elkanah offered a sacrifice, he always gave portions of the meat
1SA.1.5	But he gave a double

1SA.1.7	Year after year, when she went up to the 
1SA.1.8	“Hannah, why are you crying?” her husband Elkanah would ask. “Why won’t you eat? Why are you troubled? Am I not better to you than ten sons?” 
1SA.1.9	On one occasion, Hannah got up after they ate and drank at Shiloh.
1SA.1.10	Deeply hurt, Hannah prayed to the 
1SA.1.11	Making a vow,
1SA.1.12	While she continued praying in the 
1SA.1.13	Hannah was praying silently,
1SA.1.14	and said to her, “How long are you going to be drunk?

1SA.1.19	The next morning Elkanah and Hannah got up early to worship before the 
1SA.1.20	After some time,
1SA.1.21	When Elkanah and all his household went up to make the annual sacrifice
1SA.1.22	Hannah did not go and explained to her husband, “After the child is weaned, I’ll take him to appear in the 
1SA.1.23	Her husband Elkanah replied, “Do what you think is best,
1SA.1.24	When she had weaned him, she took him with her to Shiloh, as well as a three-year-old bull,
1SA.1.25	Then they slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to Eli.
1SA.1.26	“Please, my lord,” she said, “as surely as you live,
1SA.1.27	I prayed for this boy,
1SA.1.28	I now give the boy to the

1SA.2.4	but the feeble are clothed with strength.
1SA.2.5	Those who are full hire themselves out for food,
1SA.2.5	but those who are starving hunger no more.

1SA.2.11	Elkanah went home to Ramah,
1SA.2.12	Eli’s sons were wicked men;
1SA.2.13	or the priests’ share of the sacrifices from the people. When anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come with a three-pronged meat fork while the meat was boiling 
1SA.2.14	and plunge it into the container, kettle, cauldron, or cooking pot.
1SA.2.15	Even before the fat was burned,
1SA.2.16	If that person said to him, “The fat must be burned first; then you can take whatever you want for yourself,”
1SA.2.17	So the servants’ sin was very severe in the presence of the 
1SA.2.18	Samuel served in the 
1SA.2.19	Each year his mother made him a little robe
1SA.2.20	Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife:
1SA.2.21	The 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old. He heard about everything his sons were doing to all Israel
1SA.2.23	He said to them, “Why are you doing these things? I have heard about your evil actions from all these people. 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons, the news I hear the 
1SA.2.25	If one person sins against another, God can intercede for him, but if a person sins against the 
1SA.2.26	By contrast, the boy Samuel grew in stature and in favor with the 
1SA.2.27	A man of God came to Eli and said to him,
1SA.2.28	Out of all the tribes of Israel, I chose your house
1SA.2.29	Why, then, do all of you despise my sacrifices and offerings that I require at the place of worship?
1SA.2.30	“Therefore, this is the declaration of the 
1SA.2.31	Look, the days are coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your forefather’s house, so that none in your family will reach old age.
1SA.2.32	You will see distress in the place of worship,
1SA.2.33	Any man from your family I do not cut off from my altar will bring grief
1SA.2.34	This will be the sign that will come to you concerning your two sons Hophni and Phinehas:
1SA.2.35	“‘Then I will raise up a faithful priest
1SA.2.36	Anyone who is left in your family will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread. He will say: Please appoint me to some priestly office so I can have a piece of bread to eat.’”
1SA.3.1	The boy Samuel served the 
1SA.3.2	One day Eli, whose eyesight was failing,
1SA.3.3	Before the lamp of God had gone out,
1SA.3.4	Then the 
1SA.3.5	He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.”
1SA.3.5	“I didn’t call,” Eli replied. “Go back and lie down.” So he went and lay down.
1SA.3.6	Once again the 
1SA.3.6	Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, “Here I am; you called me.”
1SA.3.6	“I didn’t call, my son,” he replied. “Go back and lie down.”
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know the 
1SA.3.8	Once again, for the third time, the 
1SA.3.8	Then Eli understood that the 
1SA.3.9	He told Samuel, “Go and lie down. If he calls you, say, ‘Speak, 
1SA.3.10	The 
1SA.3.10	Samuel responded, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”
1SA.3.11	The 
1SA.3.12	On that day I will carry out against Eli everything I said about his family, from beginning to end.
1SA.3.13	I told him that I am going to judge his family forever because of the iniquity he knows about: his sons are cursing God,
1SA.3.14	Therefore, I have sworn to Eli’s family: The iniquity of Eli’s family will never be wiped out by either sacrifice or offering.”
1SA.3.15	Samuel lay down until the morning; then he opened the doors of the 
1SA.3.16	but Eli called him and said, “Samuel, my son.”
1SA.3.16	“Here I am,” answered Samuel.
1SA.3.17	“What was the message he gave you?” Eli asked. “Don’t hide it from me. May God punish you and do so severely if you hide anything from me that he told you.”
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told him everything and did not hide anything from him. Eli responded, “He is the 
1SA.3.19	Samuel grew,
1SA.3.20	All Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was a confirmed prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	The 
1SA.4.1	And Samuel’s words came to all Israel.
1SA.4.1	Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and
1SA.4.2	The Philistines lined up in battle formation against Israel, and as the battle intensified, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who struck down about four thousand men on the battlefield.
1SA.4.3	When the troops returned to the camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent men to Shiloh to bring back the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.5	When the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.6	The Philistines heard the sound of the war cry and asked, “What’s this loud shout in the Hebrews’ camp?” When the Philistines discovered that the ark of the 
1SA.4.7	they panicked. “A god has entered their camp!” they said. “Woe to us, nothing like this has happened before.
1SA.4.8	Woe to us, who will rescue us from these magnificent gods? These are the gods that slaughtered the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 
1SA.4.9	Show some courage and be men, Philistines!
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated,
1SA.4.11	The ark of God was captured, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
1SA.4.12	That same day, a Benjaminite man ran
1SA.4.13	When he arrived, there was Eli sitting on his chair beside the road watching,
1SA.4.14	Eli heard the outcry and asked, “Why this commotion?” The man quickly came and reported to Eli. 
1SA.4.15	At that time Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes didn’t move
1SA.4.16	The man said to Eli, “I’m the one who came from the battle.
1SA.4.16	“What happened, my son?” 
1SA.4.17	The messenger answered, “Israel has fled from the Philistines, and also there was a great slaughter among the people. Your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are both dead, and the ark of God has been captured.” 
1SA.4.18	When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell backward off the chair by the city gate,
1SA.4.19	Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and about to give birth. When she heard the news about the capture of God’s ark and the deaths of her father-in-law and her husband, she collapsed and gave birth because her labor pains came on her. 
1SA.4.20	As she was dying,
1SA.4.21	She named the boy Ichabod,
1SA.4.22	“The glory has departed from Israel,” she said, “because the ark of God has been captured.”
1SA.5.1	After the Philistines had captured the ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer
1SA.5.2	brought it into the temple of Dagon
1SA.5.3	When the people of Ashdod got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.4	But when they got up early the next morning, there was Dagon, fallen with his face to the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.5	That is why, still today, the priests of Dagon and everyone who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod do not step on Dagon’s threshold.
1SA.5.6	The 
1SA.5.7	When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The ark of Israel’s God must not stay here with us, because his hand is strongly against us and our god Dagon.” 
1SA.5.8	So they called all the Philistine rulers together
1SA.5.8	“The ark of Israel’s God should be moved to Gath,” they replied. So they moved the ark of Israel’s God. 
1SA.5.9	After they had moved it, the 
1SA.5.10	The people of Gath then sent the ark of God to Ekron, but when it got there, the Ekronites cried out, “They’ve moved the ark of Israel’s God to us to kill us and our people!” 
1SA.5.11	The Ekronites called all the Philistine rulers together.
1SA.5.12	Those who did not die were afflicted with tumors, and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	When the ark of the 
1SA.6.2	the Philistines summoned the priests and the diviners
1SA.6.3	They replied, “If you send the ark of Israel’s God away, do not send it without an offering.
1SA.6.4	They asked, “What guilt offering should we send back to him?”
1SA.6.4	And they answered, “Five gold tumors and five gold mice
1SA.6.5	Make images of your tumors and of your mice that are destroying the land. Give glory to Israel’s God,
1SA.6.6	Why harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened theirs?
1SA.6.7	“Now then, prepare one new cart and two milk cows that have never been yoked.
1SA.6.8	Take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	Then watch: If it goes up the road to its homeland toward Beth-shemesh,
1SA.6.10	The men did this: They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and confined their calves in the pen. 
1SA.6.11	Then they put the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	The cows went straight up the road to Beth-shemesh.
1SA.6.13	The people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they looked up and saw the ark, they were overjoyed to see it. 
1SA.6.14	The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there near a large rock. The people of the city chopped up the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the 
1SA.6.15	The Levites
1SA.6.16	When the five Philistine rulers
1SA.6.17	As a guilt offering to the 
1SA.6.18	The number of gold mice also corresponded to the number of Philistine cities of the five rulers, the fortified cities and the outlying villages.
1SA.6.19	God struck down the people of Beth-shemesh because they looked inside the ark of the 
1SA.6.20	The people of Beth-shemesh asked, “Who is able to stand in the presence of the 
1SA.6.21	They sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath-jearim,
1SA.7.1	So the people of Kiriath-jearim came for the ark of the 
1SA.7.2	Time went by until twenty years had passed since the ark had been taken to Kiriath-jearim. Then the whole house of Israel longed for the 
1SA.7.3	Samuel told them, “If you
1SA.7.4	So the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtoreths
1SA.7.5	Samuel said, “Gather all Israel at Mizpah,
1SA.7.6	When they gathered at Mizpah, they drew water and poured it out in the 
1SA.7.7	When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, their rulers marched up toward Israel. When the Israelites heard about it, they were afraid because of the Philistines. 
1SA.7.8	The Israelites said to Samuel, “Don’t stop crying out to the 
1SA.7.9	Then Samuel took a young lamb
1SA.7.10	Samuel was offering the burnt offering as the Philistines approached to fight against Israel. The 
1SA.7.11	Then the men of Israel charged out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines striking them down all the way to a place below Beth-car.
1SA.7.12	Afterward, Samuel took a stone and set it upright
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued
1SA.7.14	The cities from Ekron to Gath, which they had taken from Israel, were restored; Israel even rescued their surrounding territories from Philistine control. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	Samuel judged Israel throughout his life.
1SA.7.16	Every year he would go on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah and would judge Israel at all these locations. 
1SA.7.17	Then he would return to Ramah
1SA.8.1	When Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons as judges over Israel.
1SA.8.2	His firstborn son’s name was Joel and his second was Abijah. They were judges in Beer-sheba.
1SA.8.3	However, his sons did not walk in his ways — they turned toward dishonest profit, took bribes, and perverted justice.
1SA.8.4	So all the elders of Israel gathered together and went to Samuel at Ramah.
1SA.8.5	They said to him, “Look, you are old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Therefore, appoint a king to judge us the same as all the other nations have.”
1SA.8.6	When they said, “Give us a king to judge us,” Samuel considered their demand wrong, so he prayed to the 
1SA.8.7	But the 
1SA.8.8	They are doing the same thing to you that they have done to me,
1SA.8.9	Listen to them, but solemnly warn them
1SA.8.10	Samuel told all the 
1SA.8.11	He said, “These are the rights of the king who will reign over you: He will take your sons and put them to his use in his chariots, on his horses, or running in front of his chariots. 
1SA.8.12	He can appoint them for his use as commanders of thousands or commanders of fifties,
1SA.8.13	He can take your daughters to become perfumers, cooks, and bakers. 
1SA.8.14	He can take your best fields, vineyards, and olive orchards and give them to his servants.
1SA.8.15	He can take a tenth of your grain and your vineyards and give them to his officials and servants. 
1SA.8.16	He can take your male servants, your female servants, your best young men,
1SA.8.17	He can take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves can become his servants. 
1SA.8.18	When that day comes, you will cry out because of the king you’ve chosen for yourselves,
1SA.8.19	The people refused to listen to Samuel. “No!” they said. “We must have a king over us. 
1SA.8.20	Then we’ll be like all the other nations: our king will judge us, go out before us,
1SA.8.21	Samuel listened to all the people’s words and then repeated them to the 
1SA.8.22	“Listen to them,” the 
1SA.8.22	Then Samuel told the men of Israel, “Each of you, go back to your city.”
1SA.9.1	There was a prominent man of Benjamin named Kish
1SA.9.2	He had a son named Saul, an impressive young man.
1SA.9.3	One day the donkeys of Saul’s father Kish wandered off. Kish said to his son Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go look for the donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	Saul and his servant went through the hill country of Ephraim
1SA.9.5	When they came to the land of Zuph,
1SA.9.6	“Look,” the servant said, “there’s a man of God
1SA.9.7	“Suppose we do go,” Saul said to his servant, “what do we take the man? The food from our packs is gone, and there’s no gift to take to the man of God.
1SA.9.8	The servant answered Saul: “Here, I have a little
1SA.9.9	Formerly in Israel, a man who was going to inquire of God would say, “Come, let’s go to the seer,” for the prophet of today was formerly called the seer.
1SA.9.10	“Good,” Saul replied to his servant. “Come on, let’s go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was. 
1SA.9.11	As they were climbing the hill to the city, they found some young women coming out to draw water
1SA.9.12	The women answered, “Yes, he is ahead of you. Hurry, he just now entered the city, because there’s a sacrifice
1SA.9.13	As soon as you enter the city, you will find him before he goes to the high place to eat. The people won’t eat until he comes because he must bless the sacrifice; after that, the guests can eat. Go up immediately — you can find him now.” 
1SA.9.14	So they went up toward the city.
1SA.9.14	Saul and his servant were entering the city when they saw Samuel coming toward them on his way to the high place. 
1SA.9.15	Now the day before Saul’s arrival, the 
1SA.9.16	“At this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him ruler over my people Israel.
1SA.9.17	When Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Saul approached Samuel in the city gate and asked, “Would you please tell me where the seer’s house is?”
1SA.9.19	“I am the seer,” Samuel answered.
1SA.9.20	As for the donkeys that wandered away from you three days ago,
1SA.9.21	Saul responded, “Am I not a Benjaminite
1SA.9.22	Samuel took Saul and his servant, brought them to the banquet hall, and gave them a place at the head of the thirty
1SA.9.23	Then Samuel said to the cook, “Get the portion of meat that I gave you and told you to set aside.”
1SA.9.24	The cook picked up the thigh
1SA.9.25	Afterward, they went down from the high place to the city, and Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof.
1SA.9.26	They got up early, and just before dawn, Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, and I’ll send you on your way!” Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went outside. 
1SA.9.27	As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay for a while, and I’ll reveal the word of God to you.” So the servant went on.
1SA.10.1	Samuel took the flask of oil,
1SA.10.2	Today when you leave me, you’ll find two men at Rachel’s Grave
1SA.10.3	“You will proceed from there until you come to the oak of Tabor.
1SA.10.4	They will ask how you are and give you two loaves
1SA.10.5	“After that you will come to Gibeah of God
1SA.10.6	The Spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	When these signs have happened to you, do whatever your circumstances require
1SA.10.8	Afterward, go ahead of me to Gilgal. I will come to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice fellowship offerings. Wait seven days until I come to you and show you what to do.”
1SA.10.9	When Saul turned around
1SA.10.10	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. Then the Spirit of God came powerfully on him, and he prophesied along with them.
1SA.10.11	Everyone who knew him previously and saw him prophesy with the prophets asked each other, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 
1SA.10.12	Then a man who was from there asked, “And who is their father?” 
1SA.10.12	As a result, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” became a popular saying. 
1SA.10.13	Then Saul finished prophesying and went to the high place.
1SA.10.14	Saul’s uncle
1SA.10.14	“To look for the donkeys,” Saul answered. “When we saw they weren’t there, we went to Samuel.”
1SA.10.15	“Tell me,” Saul’s uncle asked, “what did Samuel say to you?”
1SA.10.16	Saul told him, “He assured us the donkeys had been found.” However, Saul did not tell him what Samuel had said about the matter of kingship.
1SA.10.17	Samuel summoned the people to the 
1SA.10.18	and said to the Israelites, “This is what the 
1SA.10.19	But today you have rejected your God,
1SA.10.20	Samuel had all the tribes of Israel come forward, and the tribe of Benjamin was selected. 
1SA.10.21	Then he had the tribe of Benjamin come forward by its clans, and the Matrite clan was selected.
1SA.10.22	They again inquired of the 
1SA.10.22	The 
1SA.10.23	They ran and got him from there. When he stood among the people, he stood a head taller than anyone else.
1SA.10.24	Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see the one the 
1SA.10.24	And all the people shouted,
1SA.10.25	Samuel proclaimed to the people the rights of kingship.
1SA.10.26	Saul also went to his home in Gibeah,
1SA.10.27	But some wicked men said, “How can this guy save us?” They despised him and did not bring him a gift,
1SA.11.1	Nahash
1SA.11.2	Nahash the Ammonite replied, “I’ll make one with you on this condition: that I gouge out everyone’s right eye
1SA.11.3	“Don’t do anything to us for seven days,” the elders of Jabesh said to him, “and let us send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. If no one saves us, we will surrender to you.”
1SA.11.4	When the messengers came to Gibeah,
1SA.11.5	Just then Saul was coming in from the field behind his oxen. “What’s the matter with the people? Why are they weeping?” Saul inquired, and they repeated to him the words of the men from Jabesh.
1SA.11.6	When Saul heard these words, the Spirit of God suddenly came powerfully on him,
1SA.11.7	He took a team of oxen, cut them in pieces,
1SA.11.8	Saul counted them at Bezek.
1SA.11.9	He told the messengers who had come, “Tell this to the men of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Deliverance will be yours tomorrow by the time the sun is hot.’” So the messengers told the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced.
1SA.11.10	Then the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Tomorrow we will come out, and you can do whatever you want
1SA.11.11	The next day Saul organized the troops into three divisions.
1SA.11.12	Afterward, the people said to Samuel, “Who said that Saul should not
1SA.11.13	But Saul ordered, “No one will be executed this day, for today the 
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let’s go to Gilgal, so we can renew the kingship there.” 
1SA.11.15	So all the people went to Gilgal, and there in the 
1SA.12.1	Then Samuel said to all Israel, “I have carefully listened to everything you said to me and placed a king over you.
1SA.12.2	Now you can see that the king is leading you. As for me, I’m old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have led you from my youth until now. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am. Bring charges against me before the 
1SA.12.4	“You haven’t wronged us, you haven’t mistreated us, and you haven’t taken anything from anyone,” they responded.
1SA.12.5	He said to them, “The 
1SA.12.5	“He is a witness,” they said.
1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said to the people, “The 
1SA.12.7	Now present yourselves, so I may confront you before the 
1SA.12.8	“When Jacob went to Egypt,
1SA.12.9	But they forgot the 
1SA.12.10	Then they cried out to the 
1SA.12.11	So the 
1SA.12.12	But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites was coming against you, you said to me, ‘No, we must have a king reign over us’ — even though the 
1SA.12.13	“Now here is the king you’ve chosen,
1SA.12.14	If you fear the 
1SA.12.15	However, if you disobey the 
1SA.12.16	“Now, therefore, present yourselves and see this great thing that the 
1SA.12.17	Isn’t the wheat harvest today?
1SA.12.18	Samuel called on the 
1SA.12.19	They pleaded with Samuel, “Pray to the 
1SA.12.20	Samuel replied, “Don’t be afraid. Even though you have committed all this evil, don’t turn away from following the 
1SA.12.21	Don’t turn away to follow worthless
1SA.12.22	The 
1SA.12.23	“As for me, I vow that I will not sin against the 
1SA.12.24	Above all, fear the 
1SA.12.25	However, if you continue to do what is evil, both you and your king will be swept away.”
1SA.13.1	Saul was thirty years
1SA.13.2	He chose three thousand men from Israel for himself: two thousand were with Saul at Michmash
1SA.13.3	Jonathan attacked the Philistine garrison
1SA.13.4	And all Israel heard the news, “Saul has attacked the Philistine garrison, and Israel is now repulsive to the Philistines.” Then the troops were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	The Philistines also gathered to fight against Israel: three thousand
1SA.13.6	The men of Israel saw that they were in trouble because the troops were in a difficult situation. They hid in caves, in thickets, among rocks, and in holes and cisterns.
1SA.13.7	Some Hebrews even crossed the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead.
1SA.13.7	Saul, however, was still at Gilgal, and all his troops were gripped with fear. 
1SA.13.8	He waited seven days for the appointed time that Samuel had set,
1SA.13.9	So Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” Then he offered the burnt offering.
1SA.13.10	Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived. So Saul went out to greet him, 
1SA.13.11	and Samuel asked, “What have you done?”
1SA.13.11	Saul answered, “When I saw that the troops were deserting me and you didn’t come within the appointed days and the Philistines were gathering at Michmash, 
1SA.13.12	I thought, ‘The Philistines will now descend on me at Gilgal, and I haven’t sought the 
1SA.13.13	Samuel said to Saul, “You have been foolish.
1SA.13.14	but now your reign will not endure.
1SA.13.15	Then Samuel went
1SA.13.16	Saul, his son Jonathan, and the troops who were with them were staying in Geba
1SA.13.17	Raiding parties
1SA.13.18	The next division headed toward the Beth-horon
1SA.13.19	No blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel
1SA.13.20	So all the Israelites went to the Philistines to sharpen their plows, mattocks, axes, and sickles.
1SA.13.21	The price was two-thirds of a shekel
1SA.13.22	So on the day of battle not a sword or spear could be found in the hand of any of the troops who were with Saul
1SA.13.23	Now a Philistine garrison
1SA.14.1	That same day Saul’s son Jonathan said to the attendant who carried his weapons, “Come on, let’s cross over to the Philistine garrison on the other side.” However, he did not tell his father.
1SA.14.2	Saul was staying under the pomegranate tree in Migron
1SA.14.3	Ahijah,
1SA.14.4	There were sharp columns
1SA.14.5	one stood to the north in front of Michmash and the other to the south in front of Geba. 
1SA.14.6	Jonathan said to the attendant who carried his weapons, “Come on, let’s cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men.
1SA.14.7	His armor-bearer responded, “Do what is in your heart. You choose. I’m right here with you whatever you decide.”
1SA.14.8	“All right,” Jonathan replied, “we’ll cross over to the men and then let them see us. 
1SA.14.9	If they say, ‘Wait until we reach you,’ then we will stay where we are and not go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say, ‘Come on up,’ then we’ll go up, because the 
1SA.14.11	They let themselves be seen by the Philistine garrison, and the Philistines said, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they’ve been hiding!” 
1SA.14.12	The men of the garrison called to Jonathan and his armor-bearer. “Come on up, and we’ll teach you a lesson!” they said.
1SA.14.12	“Follow me,” Jonathan told his armor-bearer, “for the 
1SA.14.13	Jonathan climbed up using his hands and feet, with his armor-bearer behind him. Jonathan cut them down, and his armor-bearer followed and finished them off. 
1SA.14.14	In that first assault Jonathan and his armor-bearer struck down about twenty men in a half-acre field.
1SA.14.15	Terror spread through the Philistine camp and the open fields to all the troops. Even the garrison and the raiding parties
1SA.14.16	When Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, they saw the panicking troops scattering in every direction. 
1SA.14.17	So Saul said to the troops with him, “Call the roll and determine who has left us.” They called the roll and saw that Jonathan and his armor-bearer were gone.
1SA.14.18	Saul told Ahijah, “Bring the ark of God,” for it was with the Israelites
1SA.14.19	While Saul spoke to the priest,
1SA.14.20	Saul and all the troops with him assembled and marched to the battle, and there the Philistines were, fighting against each other in great confusion!
1SA.14.21	There were Hebrews from the area who had gone earlier into the camp to join the Philistines, but even they joined the Israelites
1SA.14.22	When all the Israelite men who had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.23	The battle extended beyond Beth-aven, 
1SA.14.24	and the men of Israel were worn out that day, for Saul had
1SA.14.25	Everyone
1SA.14.26	When the troops entered the forest, they saw the flow of honey, but none of them ate any of it
1SA.14.27	However, Jonathan had not heard his father make the troops swear the oath. He reached out with the end of the staff he was carrying and dipped it into the honeycomb.
1SA.14.28	Then one of the troops said, “Your father made the troops solemnly swear, ‘The man who eats food today is cursed,’ and the troops are exhausted.”
1SA.14.29	Jonathan replied, “My father has brought trouble to the land.
1SA.14.30	How much better if the troops had eaten freely today from the plunder they took from their enemies! Then the slaughter of the Philistines would have been much greater.”
1SA.14.31	The Israelites struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash
1SA.14.32	they rushed to the plunder,
1SA.14.33	Some reported to Saul: “Look, the troops are sinning against the 
1SA.14.33	Saul said, “You have been unfaithful. Roll a large stone over here at once.” 
1SA.14.34	He then said, “Go among the troops and say to them, ‘Let each man bring me his ox or his sheep. Do the slaughtering here and then you can eat. Don’t sin against the 
1SA.14.35	Then Saul built an altar to the 
1SA.14.36	Saul said, “Let’s go down after the Philistines tonight and plunder them until morning. Don’t let even one remain!”
1SA.14.36	“Do whatever you want,”
1SA.14.36	But the priest
1SA.14.37	So Saul inquired of God,
1SA.14.38	Saul said, “All you leaders of the troops, come here. Let us investigate
1SA.14.39	As surely as the 
1SA.14.40	So he said to all Israel, “You will be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side.”
1SA.14.40	And the troops replied, “Do whatever you want.”  
1SA.14.41	So Saul said to the 
1SA.14.42	Then Saul said, “Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan,” and Jonathan was selected. 
1SA.14.43	Saul commanded him, “Tell me what you did.”
1SA.14.43	Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey
1SA.14.44	Saul declared to him, “May God punish me and do so severely
1SA.14.45	But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die, who accomplished such a great deliverance for Israel? No, as the 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul gave up the pursuit of the Philistines, and the Philistines returned to their own territory.
1SA.14.47	When Saul assumed the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies in every direction: against Moab, the Ammonites,
1SA.14.48	He fought bravely, defeated the Amalekites,
1SA.14.49	Saul’s sons
1SA.14.50	The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The name of the commander of his army was Abner son of Saul’s uncle Ner.
1SA.14.51	Saul’s father was Kish.
1SA.14.52	The conflict with the Philistines was fierce all of Saul’s days, so whenever Saul noticed any strong or valiant man, he enlisted him.
1SA.15.1	Samuel told Saul, “The 
1SA.15.2	This is what the 
1SA.15.3	Now go and attack the Amalekites and completely destroy everything they have.
1SA.15.4	Then Saul summoned the troops and counted them at Telaim: two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Saul came to the city of Amalek and set up an ambush in the wadi. 
1SA.15.6	He warned the Kenites,
1SA.15.7	Then Saul struck down the Amalekites
1SA.15.8	He captured King Agag
1SA.15.9	Saul and the troops spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, goats, cattle, and choice animals,
1SA.15.10	Then the word of the 
1SA.15.11	“I regret that I made Saul king,
1SA.15.12	Early in the morning Samuel got up to confront Saul, but it was reported to Samuel, “Saul went to Carmel
1SA.15.13	When Samuel came to him, Saul said, “May the 
1SA.15.14	Samuel replied, “Then what is this sound of sheep, goats,
1SA.15.15	Saul answered, “The troops brought them from the Amalekites and spared the best sheep, goats, and cattle in order to offer a sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.16	“Stop!” exclaimed Samuel. “Let me tell you what the 
1SA.15.16	“Tell me,” he replied.
1SA.15.17	Samuel continued, “Although you once considered yourself unimportant,
1SA.15.18	and then sent you on a mission and said: ‘Go and completely destroy the sinful Amalekites. Fight against them until you have annihilated them.’ 
1SA.15.19	So why didn’t you obey the 
1SA.15.20	“But I did obey the 
1SA.15.21	The troops took sheep, goats, and cattle from the plunder — the best of what was set apart for destruction — to sacrifice to the 
1SA.15.22	Then Samuel said:
1SA.15.22	Does the 
1SA.15.22	as much as in obeying the 
1SA.15.22	Look: to obey is better than sacrifice,
1SA.15.22	to pay attention is better than the fat of rams.
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is like the sin of divination,
1SA.15.23	and defiance is like wickedness
1SA.15.23	Because you have rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.23	he has rejected you as king.
1SA.15.24	Saul answered Samuel, “I have sinned.
1SA.15.25	Now therefore, please forgive my sin
1SA.15.26	Samuel replied to Saul, “I will not return with you. Because you rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.27	When Samuel turned to go, Saul grabbed the corner of his robe, and it tore. 
1SA.15.28	Samuel said to him, “The 
1SA.15.29	Furthermore, the Eternal One of Israel
1SA.15.30	Saul said, “I have sinned. Please honor me
1SA.15.31	Then Samuel went back, following Saul, and Saul bowed down to the 
1SA.15.32	Samuel said, “Bring me King Agag of Amalek.”
1SA.15.32	Agag came to him trembling,
1SA.15.33	Samuel declared:
1SA.15.33	As your sword has made women childless,
1SA.15.33	so your mother will be childless among women.
1SA.15.33	Then he hacked Agag to pieces before the 
1SA.15.34	Samuel went to Ramah,
1SA.15.35	Even to the day of his death, Samuel never saw Saul again.
1SA.16.1	The 
1SA.16.2	Samuel asked, “How can I go? Saul will hear about it and kill me!”
1SA.16.2	The 
1SA.16.3	Then invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will let you know what you are to do.
1SA.16.4	Samuel did what the 
1SA.16.5	“In peace,” he replied. “I’ve come to sacrifice to the 
1SA.16.6	When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab
1SA.16.7	But the 
1SA.16.8	Jesse called Abinadab
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse presented Shammah,
1SA.16.10	After Jesse presented seven of his sons to him, Samuel told Jesse, “The 
1SA.16.11	Samuel asked him, “Are these all the sons you have?”
1SA.16.11	“There is still the youngest,”
1SA.16.12	So Jesse sent for him. He had beautiful eyes and a healthy,
1SA.16.12	Then the 
1SA.16.13	So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him
1SA.16.14	Now the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	so Saul’s servants said to him, “You see that an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 
1SA.16.16	Let our lord command your servants here in your presence to look for someone who knows how to play the lyre. Whenever the evil spirit from God comes on you, that person can play the lyre, and you will feel better.”
1SA.16.17	Then Saul commanded his servants, “Find me someone who plays well and bring him to me.”
1SA.16.18	One of the young men answered, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem who knows how to play the lyre. He is also a valiant man,
1SA.16.19	Then Saul dispatched messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” 
1SA.16.20	So Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a wineskin, and one young goat and sent them by his son David to Saul.
1SA.16.21	When David came to Saul
1SA.16.22	Then Saul sent word to Jesse: “Let David remain in my service, for he has found favor with me.” 
1SA.16.23	Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul,
1SA.17.1	The Philistines
1SA.17.2	Saul and the men of Israel gathered and camped in the Valley of Elah;
1SA.17.3	The Philistines were standing on one hill, and the Israelites were standing on another hill with a ravine between them. 
1SA.17.4	Then a champion named Goliath, from Gath,
1SA.17.5	and wore a bronze helmet
1SA.17.6	There was bronze armor on his shins, and a bronze javelin
1SA.17.7	His spear shaft
1SA.17.8	He stood and shouted to the Israelite battle formations: “Why do you come out to line up in battle formation?” He asked them, “Am I not a Philistine and are you not servants of Saul?
1SA.17.9	If he wins in a fight against me and kills me, we will be your servants. But if I win against him and kill him, then you will be our servants and serve us.”
1SA.17.10	Then the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel today.
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard these words from the Philistine, they lost their courage and were terrified.
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of the Ephrathite
1SA.17.13	Jesse’s three oldest sons had followed Saul to the war, and their names
1SA.17.14	and David was the youngest.
1SA.17.15	but David kept going back and forth from Saul
1SA.17.16	Every morning and evening for forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand. 
1SA.17.17	One day Jesse had told his son David: “Take this half-bushel
1SA.17.18	Also take these ten portions of cheese to the field commander.
1SA.17.19	They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines.”
1SA.17.20	So David got up early in the morning, left the flock with someone to keep it, loaded up, and set out as Jesse had charged him.
1SA.17.20	He arrived at the perimeter of the camp
1SA.17.21	Israel and the Philistines lined up in battle formation facing each other. 
1SA.17.22	David left his supplies in the care of the quartermaster
1SA.17.23	While he was speaking with them, suddenly the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, came forward from the Philistine battle line and shouted his usual words,
1SA.17.24	When all the Israelite men saw Goliath, they retreated from him terrified.
1SA.17.25	Previously, an Israelite man had declared: “Do you see this man who keeps coming out? He comes to defy Israel. The king will make the man who kills him very rich and will give him his daughter.
1SA.17.26	David spoke to the men who were standing with him: “What will be done for the man who kills that Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel?
1SA.17.27	The troops told him about the offer, concluding, “That is what will be done for the man who kills him.”
1SA.17.28	David’s oldest brother Eliab listened as he spoke to the men, and he became angry with him.
1SA.17.29	“What have I done now?” protested David. “It was just a question.” 
1SA.17.30	Then he turned from those beside him to others in front of him and asked about the offer. The people gave him the same answer as before.
1SA.17.31	What David said was overheard and reported to Saul, so he had David brought to him. 
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, “Don’t let anyone be discouraged by
1SA.17.33	But Saul replied, “You can’t go fight this Philistine. You’re just a youth, and he’s been a warrior since he was young.”
1SA.17.34	David answered Saul: “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep. Whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I went after it, struck it down, and rescued the lamb from its mouth.
1SA.17.36	Your servant has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.” 
1SA.17.37	Then David said, “The 
1SA.17.37	Saul said to David, “Go, and may the 
1SA.17.38	Then Saul had his own military clothes put on David. He put a bronze helmet on David’s head and had him put on armor. 
1SA.17.39	David strapped his sword on over the military clothes and tried to walk, but he was not used to them. “I can’t walk in these,” David said to Saul, “I’m not used to them.” So David took them off. 
1SA.17.40	Instead, he took his staff in his hand
1SA.17.41	The Philistine came closer and closer to David, with the shield-bearer in front of him. 
1SA.17.42	When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him
1SA.17.43	He said to David, “Am I a dog
1SA.17.44	“Come here,” the Philistine called to David, “and I’ll give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts!” 
1SA.17.45	David said to the Philistine: “You come against me with a sword, spear, and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	Today, the 
1SA.17.47	and this whole assembly will know that it is not by sword or by spear that the 
1SA.17.48	When the Philistine started forward to attack him, David ran quickly to the battle line to meet the Philistine.
1SA.17.49	David put his hand in the bag, took out a stone, slung it, and hit the Philistine on his forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown to the ground. 
1SA.17.50	David defeated the Philistine with a sling and a stone. David overpowered the Philistine and killed him without having a sword. 
1SA.17.51	David ran and stood over him. He grabbed the Philistine’s sword,
1SA.17.52	The men of Israel and Judah rallied, shouting their battle cry, and chased the Philistines to the entrance of the valley and to the gates of Ekron.
1SA.17.53	When the Israelites returned from the pursuit of the Philistines, they plundered their camps. 
1SA.17.54	David took Goliath’s
1SA.17.55	“Your Majesty, as surely as you live, I don’t know,” Abner replied.
1SA.17.56	The king said, “Find out whose son this young man is!”
1SA.17.57	When David returned from killing the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine’s head still in his hand.
1SA.17.58	Saul said to him, “Whose son are you, young man?”
1SA.17.58	“The son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem,”
1SA.18.1	When David had finished speaking with Saul, Jonathan was bound to David in close friendship,
1SA.18.2	Saul kept David with him from that day on and did not let him return to his father’s house.
1SA.18.3	Jonathan made a covenant with David
1SA.18.4	Then Jonathan removed the robe he was wearing and gave it to David,
1SA.18.5	David marched out with the army and was successful in everything Saul sent him to do. Saul put him in command of the fighting men, which pleased all the people and Saul’s servants as well.
1SA.18.6	As the troops were coming back, when David was returning from killing the Philistine, the women came out from all the cities of Israel to meet King Saul,
1SA.18.7	As they danced, the women sang:
1SA.18.7	Saul has killed his thousands,
1SA.18.7	but David his tens of thousands.
1SA.18.8	Saul was furious and resented this song.
1SA.18.9	So Saul watched David jealously from that day forward.
1SA.18.10	The next day an evil spirit sent from God came powerfully on Saul,
1SA.18.11	and he threw it, thinking, “I’ll pin David to the wall.”
1SA.18.12	Saul was afraid of David,
1SA.18.13	Therefore, Saul sent David away from him and made him commander over a thousand men. David led the troops
1SA.18.14	and continued to be successful in all his activities because the 
1SA.18.15	When Saul observed that David was very successful, he dreaded him. 
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David
1SA.18.17	Saul told David, “Here is my oldest daughter Merab. I’ll give her to you as a wife,
1SA.18.18	Then David responded, “Who am I,
1SA.18.19	When it was time to give Saul’s daughter Merab to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.
1SA.18.20	Now Saul’s daughter Michal
1SA.18.21	“I’ll give her to him,” Saul thought. “She’ll be a trap for him, and the hand of the Philistines will be against him.”
1SA.18.22	Saul then ordered his servants, “Speak to David in private and tell him, ‘Look, the king is pleased with you, and all his servants love you. Therefore, you should become the king’s son-in-law.’”
1SA.18.23	Saul’s servants reported these words directly to David,
1SA.18.24	The servants reported back to Saul, “These are the words David spoke.”
1SA.18.25	Then Saul replied, “Say this to David: ‘The king desires no other bride-price
1SA.18.26	When the servants reported these terms to David, he was pleased
1SA.18.27	David and his men went out and killed two hundred
1SA.18.28	Saul realized
1SA.18.29	and he became even more afraid of David. As a result, Saul was David’s enemy from then on.
1SA.18.30	Every time the Philistine commanders came out to fight,
1SA.19.1	Saul ordered his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David.
1SA.19.2	so he told him: “My father Saul intends to kill you. Be on your guard in the morning and hide in a secret place and stay there. 
1SA.19.3	I’ll go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are and talk to him about you. When I see what he says, I’ll tell you.”
1SA.19.4	Jonathan spoke well of David to his father Saul. He said to him: “The king should not sin against his servant David.
1SA.19.5	He took his life in his hands when he struck down the Philistine,
1SA.19.6	Saul listened to Jonathan’s advice and swore an oath: “As surely as the 
1SA.19.7	So Jonathan summoned David and told him all these words. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he served him as he did before.
1SA.19.8	When war broke out again, David went out and fought against the Philistines. He defeated them with such great force that they fled from him.
1SA.19.9	Now an evil spirit sent from the 
1SA.19.10	and Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear.
1SA.19.11	Saul sent agents to David’s house to watch for him and kill him in the morning.
1SA.19.12	So she lowered David from the window, and he fled and escaped.
1SA.19.13	Then Michal took the household idol and put it on the bed, placed some goat hair on its head, and covered it with a garment. 
1SA.19.14	When Saul sent agents to seize David, Michal said, “He’s sick.”
1SA.19.15	Saul sent the agents back to see David and said, “Bring him on his bed so I can kill him.” 
1SA.19.16	When the agents arrived, to their surprise, the household idol was on the bed with some goat hair on its head.
1SA.19.17	Saul asked Michal, “Why did you deceive me like this? You sent my enemy away, and he has escaped!”
1SA.19.17	She answered him, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you? ’”
1SA.19.18	So David fled and escaped and went to Samuel at Ramah
1SA.19.19	When it was reported to Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah, 
1SA.19.20	he sent agents to seize David.
1SA.19.21	When they reported to Saul, he sent other agents, and they also began prophesying.
1SA.19.22	Then Saul himself went to Ramah. He came to the large cistern at Secu and asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”
1SA.19.22	“At Naioth in Ramah,” someone said.
1SA.19.23	So he went to Naioth in Ramah. The Spirit of God also came on him,
1SA.19.24	Saul then removed his clothes and also prophesied before Samuel; he collapsed and lay naked
1SA.20.1	David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done?
1SA.20.2	Jonathan said to him, “No, you won’t die. Listen, my father doesn’t do anything, great or small, without telling me.
1SA.20.3	But David said, “Your father certainly knows that I have found favor with you. He has said, ‘Jonathan must not know of this, or else he will be grieved.’” David also swore, “As surely as the 
1SA.20.4	Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.”
1SA.20.5	So David told him, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon,
1SA.20.6	If your father misses me at all, say, ‘David urgently requested my permission to go quickly to his hometown Bethlehem
1SA.20.7	If he says, ‘Good,’ then your servant is safe, but if he becomes angry, you will know he has evil intentions. 
1SA.20.8	Deal kindly with
1SA.20.9	“No!” Jonathan responded. “If I ever find out my father has evil intentions against you, wouldn’t I tell you about it?”
1SA.20.10	So David asked Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?”
1SA.20.11	He answered David, “Come on, let’s go out to the countryside.” So both of them went out to the countryside. 
1SA.20.12	“By the 
1SA.20.13	If my father intends to bring evil on you, may the 
1SA.20.14	If I continue to live, show me kindness
1SA.20.15	don’t ever withdraw your kindness from my household — not even when the 
1SA.20.16	Then Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David,
1SA.20.17	Jonathan once again swore to David
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to him, “Tomorrow is the New Moon;
1SA.20.19	The following day hurry down and go to the place where you hid on the day this incident began and stay beside the rock Ezel. 
1SA.20.20	I will shoot three arrows beside it as if I’m aiming at a target. 
1SA.20.21	Then I will send a servant and say, ‘Go and find the arrows! ’ Now, if I expressly say to the servant, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you — get them,’ then come, because as the 
1SA.20.22	But if I say this to the youth, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you! ’ 
1SA.20.23	As for the matter you and I have spoken about,
1SA.20.24	So David hid in the countryside.
1SA.20.24	At the New Moon, the king sat down to eat the meal. 
1SA.20.25	He sat at his usual place on the seat by the wall. Jonathan sat facing him
1SA.20.26	Saul did not say anything that day because he thought, “Something unexpected has happened; he must be ceremonially unclean — yes, that’s it, he is unclean.”
1SA.20.27	However, the day after the New Moon, the second day, David’s place was still empty, and Saul asked his son Jonathan, “Why didn’t Jesse’s son come to the meal either yesterday or today?”
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered, “David asked for my permission to go to Bethlehem.
1SA.20.29	He said, ‘Please let me go because our clan is holding a sacrifice in the town, and my brother has told me to be there. So now, if I have found favor with you, let me go so I can see my brothers.’ That’s why he didn’t come to the king’s table.”
1SA.20.30	Then Saul became angry with Jonathan and shouted, “You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don’t I know that you are siding with Jesse’s son to your own shame and to the disgrace of your mother?
1SA.20.31	Every day Jesse’s son lives on earth you and your kingship are not secure. Now send for him and bring him to me — he must die!” 
1SA.20.32	Jonathan answered his father back: “Why is he to be killed? What has he done?” 
1SA.20.33	Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan to kill him,
1SA.20.34	He got up from the table fiercely angry and did not eat any food that second day of the New Moon, for he was grieved because of his father’s shameful behavior toward David.
1SA.20.35	In the morning Jonathan went out to the countryside for the appointed meeting with David. A young servant was with him. 
1SA.20.36	He said to the servant, “Run and find the arrows I’m shooting.”
1SA.20.37	He came to the location of the arrow that Jonathan had shot, but Jonathan called to him and said, “The arrow is beyond you, isn’t it?” 
1SA.20.38	Then Jonathan called to him, “Hurry up and don’t stop!” Jonathan’s servant picked up the arrow and returned to his master. 
1SA.20.39	He did not know anything; only Jonathan and David knew the arrangement. 
1SA.20.40	Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the servant who was with him and said, “Go, take it back to the city.”
1SA.20.41	When the servant had gone, David got up from the south side of the stone Ezel, fell facedown to the ground, and paid homage three times.
1SA.20.42	Jonathan then said to David, “Go in the assurance the two of us pledged in the name of the 
1SA.21.1	David went to the priest Ahimelech
1SA.21.2	David answered the priest Ahimelech, “The king gave me a mission, but he told me, ‘Don’t let anyone know anything about the mission I’m sending you on or what I have ordered you to do.’ I have stationed my young men at a certain place. 
1SA.21.3	Now what do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever can be found.”
1SA.21.4	The priest told him, “There is no ordinary bread on hand. However, there is consecrated bread,
1SA.21.5	David answered him, “I swear that women are being kept from us, as always when I go out to battle.
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him the consecrated bread,
1SA.21.7	One of Saul’s servants, detained before the 
1SA.21.8	David said to Ahimelech, “Do you have a spear or sword on hand? I didn’t even bring my sword or my weapons since the king’s mission was urgent.”
1SA.21.9	The priest replied, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine,
1SA.21.9	“There’s none like it!” David said. “Give it to me.”
1SA.21.10	David fled that day from Saul’s presence and went to King Achish of Gath.
1SA.21.11	But Achish’s servants said to him, “Isn’t this David, the king of the land? Don’t they sing about him during their dances:
1SA.21.11	Saul has killed his thousands,
1SA.21.11	but David his tens of thousands?” 
1SA.21.12	David took this to heart
1SA.21.13	so he pretended to be insane in their presence.
1SA.21.14	“Look! You can see the man is crazy,” Achish said to his servants. “Why did you bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	Do I have such a shortage of crazy people that you brought this one to act crazy around me? Is this one going to come into my house?” 
1SA.22.1	So David left Gath and took refuge in the cave of Adullam.
1SA.22.2	In addition, every man who was desperate, in debt, or discontented rallied around him, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
1SA.22.3	From there David went to Mizpeh of Moab where he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother stay with you until I know what God will do for me.” 
1SA.22.4	So he left them in the care of the king of Moab, and they stayed with him the whole time David was in the stronghold.
1SA.22.5	Then the prophet Gad
1SA.22.6	Saul heard that David and his men had been discovered. At that time Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree
1SA.22.7	Saul said to his servants, “Listen, men of Benjamin: Is Jesse’s son going to give all of you fields and vineyards? Do you think he’ll make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?
1SA.22.8	That’s why all of you have conspired against me! Nobody tells me
1SA.22.9	Then Doeg the Edomite,
1SA.22.10	Ahimelech inquired of the 
1SA.22.11	The king sent messengers to summon the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub, and his father’s whole family, who were priests in Nob. All of them came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	Then Saul said, “Listen, son of Ahitub!”
1SA.22.12	“I’m at your service,
1SA.22.13	Saul asked him, “Why did you and Jesse’s son conspire against me? You gave him bread and a sword and inquired of God for him, so he could rise up against me and wait in ambush, as is the case today.”
1SA.22.14	Ahimelech replied to the king: “Who among all your servants is as faithful as David?
1SA.22.15	Was today the first time I inquired of God for him?
1SA.22.16	But the king said, “You will die, Ahimelech — you and your father’s whole family!”
1SA.22.17	Then the king ordered the guards standing by him, “Turn and kill the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	So the king said to Doeg, “Go and execute the priests!” So Doeg the Edomite went and executed the priests himself. On that day, he killed eighty-five men
1SA.22.19	He also struck down Nob, the city of the priests, with the sword — both men and women, infants and nursing babies, oxen, donkeys, and sheep.
1SA.22.20	However, one of the sons of Ahimelech son of Ahitub escaped. His name was Abiathar,
1SA.22.21	Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the 
1SA.22.22	Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew that Doeg the Edomite
1SA.22.23	Stay with me. Don’t be afraid, for the one who wants to take my life wants to take your life.
1SA.23.1	It was reported to David: “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah
1SA.23.2	So David inquired of the 
1SA.23.2	The 
1SA.23.3	But David’s men said to him, “Look, we’re afraid here in Judah; how much more if we go to Keilah against the Philistine forces!”
1SA.23.4	Once again, David inquired of the 
1SA.23.5	Then David and his men went to Keilah, fought against the Philistines, drove their livestock away, and inflicted heavy losses on them. So David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah. 
1SA.23.6	Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, and he brought an ephod with him.
1SA.23.7	When it was reported to Saul that David had gone to Keilah, he said, “God has handed him over to me, for he has trapped himself by entering a town with barred gates.” 
1SA.23.8	Then Saul summoned all the troops to go to war at Keilah and besiege David and his men.
1SA.23.9	When David learned that Saul was plotting evil against him, he said to the priest Abiathar,
1SA.23.10	Then David said, “
1SA.23.11	Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down as your servant has heard? 
1SA.23.11	The 
1SA.23.12	Then David asked, “Will the citizens of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?”
1SA.23.12	“They will,”
1SA.23.13	So David and his men, numbering about six hundred,
1SA.23.14	David then stayed in the wilderness strongholds and in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph.
1SA.23.15	David was in the Wilderness of Ziph in Horesh when he saw that Saul had come out to take his life. 
1SA.23.16	Then Saul’s son Jonathan came to David in Horesh and encouraged him in his faith
1SA.23.17	saying, “Don’t be afraid, for my father Saul will never lay a hand on you. You yourself will be king over Israel,
1SA.23.18	Then the two of them made a covenant in the 
1SA.23.19	Some Ziphites
1SA.23.20	Now, whenever the king wants to come down, let him come down. Our part will be to hand him over to the king.”
1SA.23.21	“May you be blessed by the 
1SA.23.22	Go and check again. Investigate
1SA.23.23	Investigate
1SA.23.24	So they went to Ziph ahead of Saul.
1SA.23.24	Now David and his men were in the wilderness near Maon
1SA.23.25	and Saul and his men went to look for him. When David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed in the Wilderness of Maon. Saul heard of this and pursued David there.
1SA.23.26	Saul went along one side of the mountain and David and his men went along the other side. Even though David was hurrying to get away from Saul, Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.
1SA.23.27	Then a messenger came to Saul saying, “Come quickly, because the Philistines have raided the land!” 
1SA.23.28	So Saul broke off his pursuit of David and went to engage the Philistines. Therefore, that place was named the Rock of Separation. 
1SA.23.29	From there David went up and stayed in the strongholds of En-gedi.
1SA.24.1	When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines,
1SA.24.2	So Saul took three thousand of Israel’s fit young men
1SA.24.3	When Saul came to the sheep pens along the road, a cave was there, and he went in to relieve himself.
1SA.24.4	so they said to him, “Look, this is the day the 
1SA.24.5	Afterward, David’s conscience bothered
1SA.24.6	He said to his men, “I swear before the 
1SA.24.7	With these words David persuaded
1SA.24.7	Then Saul left the cave and went on his way. 
1SA.24.8	After that, David got up, went out of the cave, and called to Saul, “My lord the king!” When Saul looked behind him, David knelt low with his face to the ground and paid homage.
1SA.24.9	David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of people who say, ‘Look, David intends to harm you’? 
1SA.24.10	You can see with your own eyes that the 
1SA.24.11	Look, my father!
1SA.24.12	“May the 
1SA.24.13	As the old proverb says, ‘Wickedness comes from wicked people.’
1SA.24.14	Who has the king of Israel come after? What are you chasing after? A dead dog? A single flea?
1SA.24.15	May the 
1SA.24.16	When David finished saying these things to him, Saul replied, “Is that your voice, David my son?” 
1SA.24.17	and said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have done what is good to me though I have done what is evil to you.
1SA.24.18	You yourself have told me today what good you did for me: when the 
1SA.24.19	When a man finds his enemy, does he let him go unharmed?
1SA.24.20	“Now I know for certain you will be king, and the kingdom of Israel will be established
1SA.24.21	Therefore swear to me by the 
1SA.24.22	So David swore to Saul. Then Saul went back home, and David and his men went up to the stronghold.
1SA.25.1	Samuel died,
1SA.25.2	A man in Maon
1SA.25.3	The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife’s name, Abigail. The woman was intelligent and beautiful, but the man, a Calebite,
1SA.25.4	While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing sheep, 
1SA.25.5	so David sent ten young men instructing them, “Go up to Carmel, and when you come to Nabal, greet him
1SA.25.6	Then say this: ‘Long life to you,
1SA.25.7	I hear that you are shearing.
1SA.25.8	Ask your young men, and they will tell you. So let my young men find favor with you, for we have come on a feast
1SA.25.9	David’s young men went and said all these things to Nabal on David’s behalf,
1SA.25.10	Nabal asked them, “Who is David?
1SA.25.11	Am I supposed to take my bread, my water, and my meat that I butchered for my shearers and give them to these men? I don’t know where they are from.”
1SA.25.12	David’s young men retraced their steps. When they returned to him, they reported all these words. 
1SA.25.13	He said to his men, “All of you, put on your swords!” So each man put on his sword, and David also put on his sword. About four hundred men followed David while two hundred stayed with the supplies.
1SA.25.14	One of Nabal’s young men informed Abigail, Nabal’s wife: “Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master,
1SA.25.15	The men treated us very well. When we were in the field, we weren’t harassed
1SA.25.16	They were a wall around us, both day and night,
1SA.25.17	Now consider carefully
1SA.25.18	Abigail hurried, taking two hundred loaves of bread, two clay jars of wine, five butchered sheep, a bushel
1SA.25.19	Then she said to her male servants, “Go ahead of me. I will be right behind you.”
1SA.25.20	As she rode the donkey down a mountain pass hidden from view, she saw David and his men coming toward her and met them. 
1SA.25.21	David had just said, “I guarded everything that belonged to this man in the wilderness for nothing. He was not missing anything, yet he paid me back evil for good. 
1SA.25.22	May God punish me
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off the donkey and knelt down with her face to the ground and paid homage to David.
1SA.25.24	She knelt at his feet and said, “The guilt is mine, my lord, but please let your servant speak to you directly. Listen to the words of your servant. 
1SA.25.25	My lord should pay no attention to this worthless fool Nabal, for he lives up to his name:
1SA.25.26	Now my lord, as surely as the 
1SA.25.27	Let this gift
1SA.25.28	Please forgive your servant’s offense,
1SA.25.29	“Someone is pursuing you and intends to take your life. My lord’s life is tucked safely in the place
1SA.25.30	When the 
1SA.25.31	there will not be remorse or a troubled conscience for my lord because of needless bloodshed or my lord’s revenge. And when the 
1SA.25.32	Then David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the 
1SA.25.33	May your discernment be blessed, and may you be blessed. Today you kept me from participating in bloodshed and avenging myself by my own hand.
1SA.25.34	Otherwise, as surely as the 
1SA.25.35	Then David accepted what she had brought him and said, “Go home in peace.
1SA.25.36	Then Abigail went to Nabal, and there he was in his house, holding a feast fit for a king.
1SA.25.37	In the morning when Nabal sobered up,
1SA.25.38	About ten days later, the 
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the 
1SA.25.39	Then David sent messengers to speak to Abigail about marrying him. 
1SA.25.40	When David’s servants came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, “David sent us to bring you to him as a wife.”
1SA.25.41	She stood up, paid homage with her face to the ground,
1SA.25.42	Then Abigail got up quickly, and with her five female servants accompanying her, rode on the donkey following David’s messengers.
1SA.25.43	David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel,
1SA.25.44	But Saul gave his daughter Michal, David’s wife, to Palti
1SA.26.1	Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah saying, “David is hiding on the hill of Hachilah opposite Jeshimon.”
1SA.26.2	So Saul, accompanied by three thousand of the fit young men of Israel,
1SA.26.3	Saul camped beside the road at the hill of Hachilah
1SA.26.4	So David sent out spies and knew for certain that Saul had come. 
1SA.26.5	Immediately, David went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw the place where Saul and Abner son of Ner,
1SA.26.6	Then David asked Ahimelech the Hethite
1SA.26.6	“I’ll go with you,” answered Abishai.
1SA.26.7	That night, David and Abishai came to the troops, and Saul was lying there asleep in the inner circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground by his head. Abner and the troops were lying around him. 
1SA.26.8	Then Abishai said to David, “Today God has delivered your enemy to you. Let me thrust the spear through him into the ground just once. I won’t have to strike him twice!”
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, “Don’t destroy him, for who can lift a hand against the 
1SA.26.10	David added, “As the 
1SA.26.11	However, because of the 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the water jug by Saul’s head, and they went their way. No one saw them, no one knew, and no one woke up; they all remained asleep because a deep sleep from the 
1SA.26.13	David crossed to the other side and stood on top of the mountain at a distance; there was a considerable space between them. 
1SA.26.14	Then David shouted to the troops and to Abner son of Ner: “Aren’t you going to answer, Abner?”
1SA.26.14	“Who are you who calls to the king?” Abner asked.
1SA.26.15	David called to Abner, “You’re a man, aren’t you? Who in Israel is your equal? So why didn’t you protect your lord the king when one of the people came to destroy him? 
1SA.26.16	What you have done is not good. As the 
1SA.26.17	Saul recognized David’s voice and asked, “Is that your voice, my son David?” 
1SA.26.17	“It is my voice, my lord and king,” David said. 
1SA.26.18	Then he continued, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? What have I done? What crime have I committed?
1SA.26.19	Now, may my lord the king please hear the words of his servant: If it is the 
1SA.26.20	So don’t let my blood fall to the ground far from the 
1SA.26.21	Saul responded, “I have sinned.
1SA.26.22	David answered, “Here is the king’s spear; have one of the young men come over and get it. 
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	Just as I considered your life valuable today, so may the 
1SA.26.25	Saul said to him, “You are blessed, my son David. You will certainly do great things and will also prevail.”
1SA.27.1	David said to himself, “One of these days I’ll be swept away by Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape immediately to the land of the Philistines.
1SA.27.2	So David set out with his six hundred men
1SA.27.3	David and his men stayed with Achish in Gath. Each man had his family with him,
1SA.27.4	When it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.
1SA.27.5	Now David said to Achish, “If I have found favor with you, let me be given a place in one of the outlying towns, so I can live there. Why should your servant live in the royal city with you?” 
1SA.27.6	That day Achish gave Ziklag
1SA.27.7	The length of time that David stayed in Philistine territory amounted to a year and four months.
1SA.27.8	David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites,
1SA.27.9	Whenever David attacked the land, he did not leave a single person alive, either man or woman, but he took flocks, herds, donkeys, camels, and clothing.
1SA.27.10	who inquired, “Where did you raid today?” 
1SA.27.10	David replied, “The south country of Judah,” “The south country of the Jerahmeelites,”
1SA.27.11	David did not let a man or woman live to be brought to Gath, for he said, “Or they will inform on us and say, ‘This is what David did.’” This was David’s custom during the whole time he stayed in the Philistine territory. 
1SA.27.12	So Achish trusted David, thinking, “Since he has made himself repulsive to his people Israel, he will be my servant forever.”
1SA.28.1	At that time, the Philistines
1SA.28.2	David replied to Achish, “Good, you will find out what your servant can do.”
1SA.28.2	So Achish said to David, “Very well, I will appoint you as my permanent bodyguard.”
1SA.28.3	By this time Samuel had died,
1SA.28.4	The Philistines gathered and camped at Shunem. So Saul gathered all Israel, and they camped at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid and his heart pounded. 
1SA.28.6	He inquired of the 
1SA.28.7	Saul then said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium, so I can go and consult her.”
1SA.28.7	His servants replied, “There is a woman at En-dor
1SA.28.8	Saul disguised himself
1SA.28.9	But the woman said to him, “You surely know what Saul has done,
1SA.28.10	Then Saul swore to her by the 
1SA.28.11	“Who is it that you want me to bring up for you?” the woman asked.
1SA.28.11	“Bring up Samuel for me,” he answered.
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed, and then she asked Saul, “Why did you deceive me? You are Saul!”
1SA.28.13	But the king said to her, “Don’t be afraid. What do you see?”
1SA.28.13	“I see a spirit form
1SA.28.14	Then Saul asked her, “What does he look like?”
1SA.28.14	“An old man is coming up,” she replied. “He’s wearing a robe.”
1SA.28.15	“Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Samuel asked Saul.
1SA.28.15	“I’m in serious trouble,” replied Saul. “The Philistines are fighting against me and God has turned away from me.
1SA.28.16	Samuel answered, “Since the 
1SA.28.17	The 
1SA.28.18	You did not obey the 
1SA.28.19	The 
1SA.28.20	Immediately, Saul fell flat on the ground. He was terrified by Samuel’s words and was also weak because he had not eaten anything all day and all night. 
1SA.28.21	The woman came over to Saul, and she saw that he was terrified and said to him, “Look, your servant has obeyed you. I took my life in my hands
1SA.28.22	Now please listen to your servant. Let me set some food in front of you. Eat and it will give you strength so you can go on your way.”
1SA.28.23	He refused, saying, “I won’t eat,” but when his servants and the woman urged him, he listened to them.
1SA.28.24	The woman had a fattened calf at her house, and she quickly slaughtered it.
1SA.28.25	She served it to Saul and his servants, and they ate. Afterward, they got up and left that night.
1SA.29.1	The Philistines
1SA.29.2	As the Philistine leaders were passing in review with their units of hundreds and thousands, David and his men
1SA.29.3	Then the Philistine commanders asked, “What are these Hebrews doing here?”
1SA.29.3	Achish answered the Philistine commanders, “That is David, servant of King Saul of Israel. He has been with me a considerable period of time.
1SA.29.4	The Philistine commanders, however, were enraged with Achish and told him, “Send that man back and let him return to the place you assigned him.
1SA.29.5	Isn’t this the David they sing about during their dances:
1SA.29.5	Saul has killed his thousands,
1SA.29.5	but David his tens of thousands?” 
1SA.29.6	So Achish summoned David and told him, “As the 
1SA.29.7	Now go back quietly and you won’t be doing anything the Philistine leaders think is wrong.”
1SA.29.8	“But what have I done?” 
1SA.29.9	Achish answered David, “I’m convinced that you are as reliable as an angel of God.
1SA.29.10	So get up early in the morning, you and your masters’ servants who came with you.
1SA.29.11	So David and his men got up early in the morning to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	David and his men
1SA.30.2	They also had kidnapped the women and everyone
1SA.30.3	When David and his men arrived at the town, they found it burned. Their wives, sons, and daughters had been kidnapped. 
1SA.30.4	David and the troops with him wept loudly until they had no strength left to weep. 
1SA.30.5	David’s two wives,
1SA.30.6	David was in an extremely difficult position because the troops talked about stoning him,
1SA.30.7	David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod.”
1SA.30.8	and David asked the 
1SA.30.8	The 
1SA.30.9	So David and the six hundred men with him
1SA.30.10	David and four hundred of the men continued the pursuit, while two hundred stopped because they were too exhausted to cross the Wadi Besor.
1SA.30.11	David’s men found an Egyptian in the open country and brought him to David. They gave him some bread to eat and water to drink. 
1SA.30.12	Then they gave him some pressed figs and two clusters of raisins. After he ate he revived,
1SA.30.13	Then David said to him, “Who do you belong to? Where are you from?”
1SA.30.13	“I’m an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite man,” he said. “My master abandoned me when I got sick three days ago. 
1SA.30.14	We raided the south country of the Cherethites,
1SA.30.15	David then asked him, “Will you lead me to these raiders?”
1SA.30.15	He said, “Swear to me by God that you won’t kill me or turn me over to my master, and I will lead you to them.”
1SA.30.16	So he led him, and there were the Amalekites, spread out over the entire area, eating, drinking, and celebrating because of the great amount of plunder
1SA.30.17	David slaughtered them from twilight until the evening of the next day.
1SA.30.18	David recovered everything the Amalekites had taken; he also rescued his two wives. 
1SA.30.19	Nothing of theirs was missing from the youngest to the oldest, including the sons and daughters, and all the plunder the Amalekites had taken. David got everything back.
1SA.30.20	He took all the flocks and herds, which were driven ahead of the other livestock, and the people shouted, “This is David’s plunder!” 
1SA.30.21	When David came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to go with him and had been left at the Wadi Besor,
1SA.30.22	but all the corrupt and worthless men among those who had gone with David argued, “Because they didn’t go with us, we will not give any of the plunder we recovered to them except for each man’s wife and children. They may take them and go.”
1SA.30.23	But David said, “My brothers, you must not do this with what the 
1SA.30.24	Who can agree to your proposal? The share of the one who goes into battle is to be the same as the share of the one who remains with the supplies. They will share equally.”
1SA.30.25	And it has been so from that day forward. David established this policy
1SA.30.26	When David came to Ziklag, he sent some of the plunder to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, “Here is a gift for you
1SA.30.27	He sent gifts
1SA.30.28	to those in Aroer,
1SA.30.29	to those in Racal, in the towns of the Jerahmeelites,
1SA.30.30	to those in Hormah,
1SA.30.31	to those in Hebron,
1SA.31.1	The Philistines fought against Israel,
1SA.31.2	The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons and killed his sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. 
1SA.31.3	When the battle intensified against Saul,
1SA.31.4	Then Saul said to his armor-bearer,
1SA.31.5	When his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his own sword and died with him. 
1SA.31.6	So on that day, Saul died together with his three sons, his armor-bearer, and all his men.
1SA.31.7	When the men of Israel on the other side of the valley and on the other side of the Jordan saw that Israel’s men had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled. So the Philistines came and settled in them.
1SA.31.8	The next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons dead on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	They cut off Saul’s head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines to spread the good news
1SA.31.10	Then they put his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths
1SA.31.11	When the residents of Jabesh-gilead
1SA.31.12	all their brave men
1SA.31.13	Afterward, they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree
2SA.1.1	After the death of Saul,
2SA.1.2	On the third day a man with torn clothes and dust on his head
2SA.1.3	David asked him, “Where have you come from?”
2SA.1.3	He replied to him, “I’ve escaped from the Israelite camp.”
2SA.1.4	“What was the outcome? Tell me,” David asked him.
2SA.1.4	“The troops fled from the battle,” he answered. “Many of the troops have fallen and are dead. Also, Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.”
2SA.1.5	David asked the young man who had brought him the report, “How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
2SA.1.6	“I happened to be on Mount Gilboa,”
2SA.1.7	When he turned around and saw me, he called out to me, so I answered: I’m at your service. 
2SA.1.8	He asked me, ‘Who are you? ’ I told him: I’m an Amalekite.
2SA.1.9	Then he begged me, ‘Stand over me and kill me, for I’m mortally wounded,
2SA.1.10	So I stood over him and killed him because I knew that after he had fallen he couldn’t survive. I took the crown that was on his head and the armband that was on his arm, and I’ve brought them here to my lord.”
2SA.1.11	Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them,
2SA.1.12	They mourned, wept, and fasted until the evening
2SA.1.13	David inquired of the young man who had brought him the report, “Where are you from?”
2SA.1.13	“I’m the son of a resident alien,” he said. “I’m an Amalekite.”
2SA.1.14	David questioned him, “How is it that you were not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the 
2SA.1.15	Then David summoned one of his servants and said, “Come here and kill him!” The servant struck him, and he died.
2SA.1.16	For David had said to the Amalekite, “Your blood is on your own head
2SA.1.17	David sang the following lament
2SA.1.18	and he ordered that the Judahites be taught The Song of the Bow. It is written in the Book of Jashar:
2SA.1.19	The splendor of Israel lies slain on your heights.
2SA.1.19	How the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.20	Do not tell it in Gath,
2SA.1.20	don’t announce it in the marketplaces of Ashkelon,
2SA.1.20	or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,
2SA.1.20	and the daughters of the uncircumcised will celebrate.
2SA.1.21	Mountains of Gilboa,
2SA.1.21	let no dew or rain be on you,
2SA.1.21	or fields of offerings,
2SA.1.21	for there the shield of the mighty was defiled
2SA.1.21	the shield of Saul, no longer anointed with oil.
2SA.1.22	Jonathan’s bow never retreated,
2SA.1.22	Saul’s sword never returned unstained,
2SA.1.22	from the blood of the slain,
2SA.1.22	from the flesh
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan,
2SA.1.23	loved and delightful,
2SA.1.23	they were not parted in life or in death.
2SA.1.23	They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul,
2SA.1.24	who clothed you in scarlet, with luxurious things,
2SA.1.24	who decked your garments with gold ornaments.
2SA.1.25	How the mighty have fallen in the thick of battle!
2SA.1.25	Jonathan lies slain on your heights.
2SA.1.26	I grieve for you, Jonathan, my brother.
2SA.1.26	You were such a friend to me.
2SA.1.26	Your love for me was more wondrous
2SA.1.26	than the love of women.
2SA.1.27	How the mighty have fallen
2SA.1.27	and the weapons of war have perished!
2SA.2.1	Some time later, David inquired of the 
2SA.2.1	The 
2SA.2.1	Then David asked, “Where should I go?”
2SA.2.1	“To Hebron,”
2SA.2.2	So David went there with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelite and Abigail, the widow of Nabal the Carmelite.
2SA.2.3	In addition, David brought the men who were with him, each one with his family, and they settled in the towns near Hebron.
2SA.2.4	Then the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.
2SA.2.5	David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, “The 
2SA.2.6	Now, may the 
2SA.2.7	Therefore, be strong
2SA.2.8	Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army,
2SA.2.9	He made him king over Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin — over all Israel. 
2SA.2.10	Saul’s son Ish-bosheth was forty years old when he became king over Israel; he reigned for two years. The house of Judah, however, followed David. 
2SA.2.11	The length of time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	Abner son of Ner and soldiers of Ish-bosheth son of Saul marched out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	So Joab son of Zeruiah and David’s soldiers marched out and met them by the pool of Gibeon.
2SA.2.14	Then Abner said to Joab, “Let’s have the young men get up and compete in front of us.”
2SA.2.14	“Let them get up,” Joab replied.
2SA.2.15	So they got up and were counted off — twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth son of Saul, and twelve from David’s soldiers. 
2SA.2.16	Then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his opponent’s side so that they all died together. So this place, which is in Gibeon, is named Field of Blades.
2SA.2.17	The battle that day was extremely fierce, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by David’s soldiers. 
2SA.2.18	The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel.
2SA.2.19	He chased Abner and did not turn to the right or the left in his pursuit of him. 
2SA.2.20	Abner glanced back and said, “Is that you, Asahel?”
2SA.2.20	“Yes it is,” Asahel replied.
2SA.2.21	Abner said to him, “Turn to your right or left, seize one of the young soldiers, and take whatever you can get from him.” But Asahel would not stop chasing him. 
2SA.2.22	Once again, Abner warned Asahel, “Stop chasing me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How could I ever look your brother Joab in the face?” 
2SA.2.23	But Asahel refused to turn away, so Abner hit him in the stomach with the butt of his spear. The spear went through his body, and he fell and died right there. As they all came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, they stopped, 
2SA.2.24	but Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. By sunset, they had gone as far as the hill of Ammah, which is opposite Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.
2SA.2.25	The Benjaminites rallied to Abner; they formed a unit and took their stand on top of a hill. 
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called out to Joab: “Must the sword devour forever? Don’t you realize this will only end in bitterness? How long before you tell the troops to stop pursuing their brothers?”
2SA.2.27	“As God lives,” Joab replied, “if you had not spoken up, the troops wouldn’t have stopped pursuing their brothers until morning.”
2SA.2.28	Then Joab blew the ram’s horn, and all the troops stopped; they no longer pursued Israel or continued to fight. 
2SA.2.29	So Abner and his men marched through the Arabah all that night. They crossed the Jordan, marched all morning,
2SA.2.30	When Joab had turned back from pursuing Abner, he gathered all the troops. In addition to Asahel, nineteen of David’s soldiers were missing, 
2SA.2.31	but they had killed 360 of the Benjaminites and Abner’s men. 
2SA.2.32	Afterward, they carried Asahel to his father’s tomb in Bethlehem and buried him. Then Joab and his men marched all night and reached Hebron at dawn.
2SA.3.1	During the long war between the house of Saul and the house of David,
2SA.3.2	Sons were born to David in Hebron:
2SA.3.2	His firstborn was Amnon,
2SA.3.2	by Ahinoam
2SA.3.3	his second was Chileab,
2SA.3.3	by Abigail,
2SA.3.3	the third was Absalom,
2SA.3.3	son of Maacah the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur;
2SA.3.4	the fourth was Adonijah,
2SA.3.4	son of Haggith;
2SA.3.4	the fifth was Shephatiah,
2SA.3.4	son of Abital;
2SA.3.5	the sixth was Ithream,
2SA.3.5	by David’s wife Eglah.
2SA.3.5	These were born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner kept acquiring more power in the house of Saul.
2SA.3.7	Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah
2SA.3.8	Abner was very angry about Ish-bosheth’s accusation. “Am I a dog’s head
2SA.3.9	May God punish Abner and do so severely if I don’t do for David what the 
2SA.3.10	to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul and establish the throne of David over Israel and Judah
2SA.3.11	Ish-bosheth did not dare respond to Abner because he was afraid of him.
2SA.3.12	Abner sent messengers as his representatives to say to David, “Whose land is it? Make your covenant with me, and you can be certain I am on your side to turn all Israel over to you.”
2SA.3.13	David replied, “Good, I will make a covenant with you. However, there’s one thing I require of you: You will not see my face unless you first bring Saul’s daughter Michal
2SA.3.14	Then David sent messengers to say to Ish-bosheth son of Saul, “Give me back my wife, Michal. I was engaged to her for the price of a hundred Philistine foreskins.”
2SA.3.15	So Ish-bosheth sent someone to take her away from her husband, Paltiel son of Laish.
2SA.3.16	Her husband followed her, weeping all the way to Bahurim. Abner said to him, “Go back.” So he went back.
2SA.3.17	Abner conferred with the elders of Israel: “In the past you wanted David to be king over you. 
2SA.3.18	Now take action, because the 
2SA.3.19	Abner also informed the Benjaminites and went to Hebron to inform David about all that was agreed on by Israel and the whole house of Benjamin.
2SA.3.20	When Abner and twenty men came to David at Hebron, David held a banquet for him and his men.
2SA.3.21	Abner said to David, “Let me now go and I will gather all Israel to my lord the king. They will make a covenant with you,
2SA.3.22	Just then David’s soldiers and Joab returned from a raid and brought a large amount of plundered goods with them. Abner was not with David in Hebron because David had dismissed him, and he had gone in peace. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and his whole army arrived, Joab was informed, “Abner son of Ner came to see the king, the king dismissed him, and he went in peace.”
2SA.3.24	Joab went to the king and said, “What have you done? Look here, Abner came to you. Why did you dismiss him? Now he’s getting away. 
2SA.3.25	You know that Abner son of Ner came to deceive you and to find out about your military activities
2SA.3.26	Then Joab left David and sent messengers after Abner. They brought him back from the well
2SA.3.27	When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab pulled him aside to the middle of the city gate, as if to speak to him privately, and there Joab stabbed him in the stomach. So Abner died in revenge for the death of Asahel,
2SA.3.28	David heard about it later and said: “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the 
2SA.3.29	May it hang over Joab’s head and his father’s whole family, and may the house of Joab never be without someone who has a discharge or a skin disease,
2SA.3.30	Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.
2SA.3.31	David then ordered Joab and all the people who were with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth,
2SA.3.32	When they buried Abner in Hebron, the king wept aloud at Abner’s tomb. All the people wept, 
2SA.3.33	and the king sang a lament for Abner:
2SA.3.33	Should Abner die as a fool dies?
2SA.3.34	Your hands were not bound,
2SA.3.34	your feet not placed in bronze shackles.
2SA.3.34	You fell like one who falls victim to criminals.
2SA.3.34	And all the people wept over him even more.
2SA.3.35	Then they came to urge David to eat food while it was still day, but David took an oath: “May God punish me and do so severely if I taste bread or anything else before sunset!” 
2SA.3.36	All the people took note of this, and it pleased them. In fact, everything the king did pleased them. 
2SA.3.37	On that day all the troops and all Israel were convinced that the king had no part in the killing of Abner son of Ner.
2SA.3.38	Then the king said to his soldiers, “You must know that a great leader has fallen in Israel today. 
2SA.3.39	As for me, even though I am the anointed king, I have little power today. These men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too fierce for me.
2SA.4.1	When Saul’s son Ish-bosheth heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he gave up,
2SA.4.2	Saul’s son had two men who were leaders of raiding parties: one named Baanah and the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the Benjaminites. Beeroth is also considered part of Benjamin, 
2SA.4.3	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and still reside there as aliens today.
2SA.4.4	Saul’s son Jonathan had a son whose feet were crippled. He was five years old when the report about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. His nanny
2SA.4.5	Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, set out and arrived at Ish-bosheth’s house during the heat of the day while the king was taking his midday nap. 
2SA.4.6	They entered the interior of the house as if to get wheat and stabbed him in the stomach. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped. 
2SA.4.7	They had entered the house while Ish-bosheth was lying on his bed in his bedroom and stabbed and killed him. They removed his head, took it, and traveled by way of the Arabah
2SA.4.8	They brought Ish-bosheth’s head to David at Hebron and said to the king, “Here’s the head of Ish-bosheth son of Saul, your enemy who intended to take your life. Today the 
2SA.4.9	But David answered Rechab and his brother Baanah, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, “As the 
2SA.4.10	when the person told me, ‘Look, Saul is dead,’ he thought he was a bearer of good news, but I seized him and put him to death at Ziklag.
2SA.4.11	How much more when wicked men kill a righteous man in his own house on his own bed! So now, should I not require his blood from you and purge you from the earth?” 
2SA.4.12	So David gave orders to the young men, and they killed Rechab and Baanah. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies by the pool in Hebron, but they took Ish-bosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	All the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron
2SA.5.2	Even while Saul was king over us, you were the one who led us out to battle and brought us back.
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron. King David made a covenant with them
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he began his reign;
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
2SA.5.6	The king and his men marched to Jerusalem against the Jebusites
2SA.5.7	Yet David did capture the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David.
2SA.5.8	He said that day, “Whoever attacks the Jebusites must go through the water shaft to reach the lame and the blind who are despised by David.”
2SA.5.9	David took up residence in the stronghold, which he named the city of David. He built it up all the way around from the supporting terraces inward. 
2SA.5.10	David became more and more powerful,
2SA.5.11	King Hiram of Tyre sent envoys to David; he also sent cedar logs, carpenters, and stonemasons,
2SA.5.12	Then David knew that the 
2SA.5.13	After he arrived from Hebron, David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, and more sons and daughters were born to him. 
2SA.5.14	These are the names of those born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan,
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel,
2SA.5.18	So the Philistines came and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim.
2SA.5.19	Then David inquired of the 
2SA.5.19	The 
2SA.5.20	So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated them there and said, “Like a bursting flood, the 
2SA.5.21	The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his men carried them off.
2SA.5.22	The Philistines came up again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	So David inquired of the 
2SA.5.24	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, act decisively, for then the 
2SA.5.25	So David did exactly as the 
2SA.6.1	David again assembled all the fit young men in Israel:
2SA.6.2	He and all his troops set out
2SA.6.3	They set the ark of God on a new cart and transported it from Abinadab’s house, which was on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio,
2SA.6.4	and brought it with the ark of God from Abinadab’s house on the hill. Ahio walked in front of the ark. 
2SA.6.5	David and the whole house of Israel were dancing before the 
2SA.6.6	When they came to Nacon’s threshing floor, Uzzah reached out to the ark of God and took hold of it because the oxen had stumbled. 
2SA.6.7	Then the 
2SA.6.8	David was angry because of the 
2SA.6.9	David feared the 
2SA.6.10	So he was not willing to bring the ark of the 
2SA.6.11	The ark of the 
2SA.6.12	It was reported to King David: “The 
2SA.6.13	When those carrying the ark of the 
2SA.6.14	David was dancing
2SA.6.15	He and the whole house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the 
2SA.6.16	As the ark of the 
2SA.6.17	They brought the ark of the 
2SA.6.18	When David had finished offering the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	Then he distributed a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake to each one in the entire Israelite community, both men and women.
2SA.6.20	When David returned home to bless his household,
2SA.6.21	David replied to Michal, “It was before the 
2SA.6.22	and I will dishonor myself and humble myself even more.
2SA.6.23	And Saul’s daughter Michal had no child to the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	When the king had settled into his palace
2SA.7.2	the king said to the prophet Nathan,
2SA.7.3	So Nathan told the king, “Go and do all that is on your mind, for the 
2SA.7.4	But that night the word of the 
2SA.7.5	“Go to my servant David and say, ‘This is what the 
2SA.7.6	From the time I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until today I have not dwelt in a house; instead, I have been moving around with a tent as my dwelling.
2SA.7.7	In all my journeys with all the Israelites, have I ever spoken a word to one of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, asking: Why haven’t you built me a house of cedar?’
2SA.7.8	“So now this is what you are to say to my servant David: ‘This is what the 
2SA.7.9	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you. I will make a great name
2SA.7.10	I will designate a place
2SA.7.11	ever since the day I ordered judges to be over my people Israel.
2SA.7.11	“‘The 
2SA.7.12	When your time comes and you rest with your fathers, I will raise up after you your descendant, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom.
2SA.7.13	He is the one who will build a house for my name,
2SA.7.14	I will be his father, and he will be my son.
2SA.7.15	But my faithful love will never leave him
2SA.7.16	Your house and kingdom will endure before me
2SA.7.17	Nathan reported all these words and this entire vision to David.
2SA.7.18	Then King David went in,
2SA.7.18	Who am I, Lord 
2SA.7.19	What you have done so far
2SA.7.20	What more can David say to you? You know your servant,
2SA.7.21	Because of your word and according to your will, you have revealed all these great things to your servant.
2SA.7.22	This is why you are great,
2SA.7.23	And who is like your people Israel? God came to one nation on earth in order to redeem a people for himself, to make a name for himself, and to perform for them
2SA.7.24	You established your people Israel to be your own people forever, and you, 
2SA.7.25	Now, 
2SA.7.26	so that your name will be exalted forever, when it is said, “The 
2SA.7.27	since you, 
2SA.7.28	Lord 
2SA.7.29	Now, please bless your servant’s house so that it will continue before you forever. For you, Lord 
2SA.8.1	After this, David defeated the Philistines,
2SA.8.2	He also defeated the Moabites, and after making them lie down on the ground, he measured them off with a cord. He measured every two cord lengths of those to be put to death and one full length of those to be kept alive. So the Moabites became David’s subjects and brought tribute.
2SA.8.3	David also defeated Hadadezer
2SA.8.4	David captured seventeen hundred horsemen
2SA.8.5	When the Arameans of Damascus
2SA.8.6	Then he placed garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans became David’s subjects and brought tribute. The 
2SA.8.7	David took the gold shields of Hadadezer’s officers and brought them to Jerusalem.
2SA.8.8	King David also took huge quantities of bronze from Betah
2SA.8.9	When King Toi of Hamath
2SA.8.10	he sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and to congratulate him because David had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Toi and Hadadezer had fought many wars. Joram had items of silver, gold, and bronze with him. 
2SA.8.11	King David also dedicated these to the 
2SA.8.12	from Edom,
2SA.8.13	David made a reputation
2SA.8.14	He placed garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David.
2SA.8.15	So David reigned over all Israel, administering justice and righteousness for all his people.
2SA.8.16	Joab son of Zeruiah was over the army;
2SA.8.16	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was court historian;
2SA.8.17	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests;
2SA.8.17	Seraiah was court secretary;
2SA.8.18	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites;
2SA.8.18	and David’s sons were chief officials.
2SA.9.1	David asked, “Is there anyone remaining from the family of Saul I can show kindness
2SA.9.2	There was a servant of Saul’s family named Ziba.
2SA.9.2	“I am your servant,” he replied.
2SA.9.3	So the king asked, “Is there anyone left of Saul’s family that I can show the kindness of God to?”
2SA.9.3	Ziba said to the king, “There is still Jonathan’s son who was injured in both feet.”
2SA.9.4	The king asked him, “Where is he?”
2SA.9.4	Ziba answered the king, “You’ll find him in Lo-debar at the house of Machir son of Ammiel.” 
2SA.9.5	So King David had him brought from the house of Machir son of Ammiel in Lo-debar.
2SA.9.6	Mephibosheth son of Jonathan son of Saul came to David, fell facedown, and paid homage. David said, “Mephibosheth!”
2SA.9.6	“I am your servant,” he replied.
2SA.9.7	“Don’t be afraid,” David said to him, “since I intend to show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will restore to you all your grandfather Saul’s fields, and you will always eat meals at my table.”
2SA.9.8	Mephibosheth paid homage and said, “What is your servant that you take an interest in a dead dog
2SA.9.9	Then the king summoned Saul’s attendant Ziba and said to him, “I have given to your master’s grandson all that belonged to Saul and his family. 
2SA.9.10	You, your sons, and your servants are to work the ground for him, and you are to bring in the crops so your master’s grandson will have food to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, is always to eat at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.
2SA.9.11	Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do all my lord the king commands.”
2SA.9.11	So Mephibosheth ate at David’s
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica.
2SA.9.13	However, Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem because he always ate at the king’s table. His feet had been injured.
2SA.10.1	Some time later, the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king in his place.
2SA.10.2	Then David said, “I’ll show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.”
2SA.10.2	So David sent his emissaries to console Hanun concerning his father. However, when they arrived in the land of the Ammonites, 
2SA.10.3	the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun their lord, “Just because David has sent men with condolences for you, do you really believe he’s showing respect for your father? Instead, hasn’t David sent his emissaries in order to scout out the city, spy on it, and demolish it?” 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun took David’s emissaries, shaved off half their beards,
2SA.10.5	When this was reported to David, he sent someone to meet them, since they were deeply humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back; then return.”
2SA.10.6	When the Ammonites realized they had become repulsive to David, they hired twenty thousand foot soldiers from the Arameans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, one thousand men from the king of Maacah, and twelve thousand men from Tob.
2SA.10.7	David heard about it and sent Joab and all the elite troops. 
2SA.10.8	The Ammonites marched out and lined up in battle formation at the entrance to the city gate while the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were in the field by themselves. 
2SA.10.9	When Joab saw that there was a battle line in front of him and another behind him, he chose some of Israel’s finest young men and lined up in formation to engage the Arameans. 
2SA.10.10	He placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai. They lined up in formation to engage the Ammonites.
2SA.10.11	“If the Arameans are too strong for me,” Joab said, “then you will be my help. However, if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll come to help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be strong! Let’s prove ourselves strong for our people and for the cities of our God.
2SA.10.13	Joab and his troops advanced to fight against the Arameans, and they fled before him. 
2SA.10.14	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they too fled before Abishai and entered the city. So Joab withdrew from the attack against the Ammonites and went to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	When the Arameans saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped. 
2SA.10.16	Hadadezer sent messengers to bring the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River, and they came to Helam with Shobach, commander of Hadadezer’s army, leading them.
2SA.10.17	When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel, crossed the Jordan, and went to Helam. Then the Arameans lined up to engage David in battle and fought against him. 
2SA.10.18	But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers.
2SA.10.19	When all the kings who were Hadadezer’s subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their subjects. After this, the Arameans were afraid to ever help the Ammonites again.
2SA.11.1	In the spring when kings march out to war, David sent Joab with his officers and all Israel. They destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah, but David remained in Jerusalem.
2SA.11.2	One evening David got up from his bed and strolled around on the roof of the palace. From the roof he saw a woman bathing — a very beautiful woman. 
2SA.11.3	So David sent someone to inquire about her, and he said, “Isn’t this Bathsheba,
2SA.11.4	David sent messengers to get her, and when she came to him, he slept with her. Now she had just been purifying herself from her uncleanness.
2SA.11.5	The woman conceived and sent word to inform David: “I am pregnant.”
2SA.11.6	David sent orders to Joab: “Send me Uriah the Hethite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David. 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah came to him, David asked how Joab and the troops were doing and how the war was going. 
2SA.11.8	Then he said to Uriah, “Go down to your house and wash your feet.” So Uriah left the palace, and a gift from the king followed him. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the door of the palace with all his master’s servants; he did not go down to his house.
2SA.11.10	When it was reported to David, “Uriah didn’t go home,” David questioned Uriah, “Haven’t you just come from a journey? Why didn’t you go home?”
2SA.11.11	Uriah answered David, “The ark, Israel, and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my master Joab and his soldiers
2SA.11.12	“Stay here today also,” David said to Uriah, “and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
2SA.11.13	Then David invited Uriah to eat and drink with him, and David got him drunk. He went out in the evening to lie down on his cot with his master’s servants, but he did not go home.
2SA.11.14	The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	In the letter he wrote:
2SA.11.15	Put Uriah
2SA.11.16	When Joab was besieging the city, he put Uriah in the place where he knew the best enemy soldiers were. 
2SA.11.17	Then the men of the city came out and attacked Joab, and some of the men from David’s soldiers fell in battle; Uriah the Hethite also died.
2SA.11.18	Joab sent someone to report to David all the details of the battle. 
2SA.11.19	He commanded the messenger, “When you’ve finished telling the king all the details of the battle —  
2SA.11.20	if the king’s anger gets stirred up and he asks you, ‘Why did you get so close to the city to fight? Didn’t you realize they would shoot from the top of the wall? 
2SA.11.21	At Thebez, who struck Abimelech son of Jerubbesheth?
2SA.11.22	Then the messenger left.
2SA.11.22	When he arrived, he reported to David all that Joab had sent him to tell. 
2SA.11.23	The messenger reported to David, “The men gained the advantage over us and came out against us in the field, but we counterattacked right up to the entrance of the city gate. 
2SA.11.24	However, the archers shot down on your servants from the top of the wall, and some of the king’s servants died. Your servant Uriah the Hethite is also dead.”
2SA.11.25	David told the messenger, “Say this to Joab: ‘Don’t let this matter upset you because the sword devours all alike. Intensify your fight against the city and demolish it.’ Encourage him.”
2SA.11.26	When Uriah’s
2SA.11.27	When the time of mourning ended, David had her brought to his house. She became his wife and bore him a son. However, the 
2SA.12.1	So the 
2SA.12.1	There were two men in a certain city, one rich and the other poor. 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had very large flocks and herds, 
2SA.12.3	but the poor man had nothing except one small ewe lamb that he had bought. He raised her, and she grew up with him and with his children. From his meager food she would eat, from his cup she would drink, and in his arms she would sleep. She was like a daughter to him. 
2SA.12.4	Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man could not bring himself to take one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for his guest.
2SA.12.5	David was infuriated with the man and said to Nathan: “As the 
2SA.12.6	Because he has done this thing and shown no pity, he must pay four lambs for that lamb.”
2SA.12.7	Nathan replied to David, “You are the man! This is what the 
2SA.12.8	I gave your master’s house to you and your master’s wives into your arms,
2SA.12.9	Why then have you despised the 
2SA.12.10	Now therefore, the sword will never leave your house
2SA.12.11	“This is what the 
2SA.12.12	You acted in secret, but I will do this before all Israel and in broad daylight.’”
2SA.12.13	David responded to Nathan, “I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.13	Then Nathan replied to David, “And the 
2SA.12.14	However, because you treated
2SA.12.15	Then Nathan went home.
2SA.12.15	The 
2SA.12.16	David pleaded with God for the boy. He fasted, went home, and spent the night lying on the ground.
2SA.12.17	The elders of his house stood beside him to get him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat anything with them.
2SA.12.18	On the seventh day the baby died. But David’s servants were afraid to tell him the baby was dead. They said, “Look, while the baby was alive, we spoke to him, and he wouldn’t listen to us. So how can we tell him the baby is dead? He may do something desperate.”
2SA.12.19	When David saw that his servants were whispering to each other, he guessed that the baby was dead. So he asked his servants, “Is the baby dead?”
2SA.12.19	“He is dead,” they replied.
2SA.12.20	Then David got up from the ground. He washed, anointed himself, changed his clothes, went to the 
2SA.12.21	His servants asked him, “Why have you done this? While the baby was alive, you fasted and wept, but when he died, you got up and ate food.”
2SA.12.22	He answered, “While the baby was alive, I fasted and wept because I thought, ‘Who knows? The 
2SA.12.23	But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I’ll go to him, but he will never return to me.”
2SA.12.24	Then David comforted
2SA.12.25	and he sent a message through the prophet Nathan, who named
2SA.12.26	Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites
2SA.12.27	Then Joab sent messengers to David to say, “I have fought against Rabbah and have also captured its water supply. 
2SA.12.28	Now therefore, assemble the rest of the troops, lay siege to the city, and capture it. Otherwise I will be the one to capture the city, and it will be named after me.” 
2SA.12.29	So David assembled all the troops and went to Rabbah; he fought against it and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	He took the crown from the head of their king,
2SA.12.31	He removed the people who were in the city and put them to work with saws, iron picks, and iron axes, and to labor at brickmaking.
2SA.13.1	Some time passed. David’s son Absalom
2SA.13.2	Amnon was frustrated to the point of making himself sick over his sister Tamar because she was a virgin, but it seemed impossible to do anything to her. 
2SA.13.3	Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, a son of David’s brother Shimeah.
2SA.13.4	and he asked Amnon, “Why are you, the king’s son, so miserable
2SA.13.4	Amnon replied, “I’m in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.”
2SA.13.5	Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend you’re sick. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat. Let her prepare a meal in my presence
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. When the king came to see him, Amnon said to him, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my presence so I can eat from her hand.”
2SA.13.7	David sent word to Tamar at the palace: “Please go to your brother Amnon’s house and prepare a meal for him.”
2SA.13.8	Then Tamar went to his house while Amnon was lying down. She took dough, kneaded it, made cakes in his presence, and baked them. 
2SA.13.9	She brought the pan and set it down in front of him, but he refused to eat. Amnon said, “Everyone leave me!” And everyone left him. 
2SA.13.10	“Bring the meal to the bedroom,” Amnon told Tamar, “so I can eat from your hand.” Tamar took the cakes she had made and went to her brother Amnon’s bedroom. 
2SA.13.11	When she brought them to him to eat, he grabbed her and said,
2SA.13.12	“Don’t, my brother!” she cried. “Don’t disgrace
2SA.13.13	Where could I ever go with my humiliation? And you — you would be like one of the outrageous fools in Israel! Please, speak to the king, for he won’t keep me from you.” 
2SA.13.14	But he refused to listen to her, and because he was stronger than she was, he disgraced her by raping her.
2SA.13.15	So Amnon hated Tamar with such intensity that the hatred he hated her with was greater than the love he had loved her with. “Get out of here!” he said.
2SA.13.16	“No,” she cried,
2SA.13.16	But he refused to listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	Instead, he called to the servant who waited on him: “Get this away from me, throw her out, and bolt the door behind her!” 
2SA.13.18	Amnon’s servant threw her out and bolted the door behind her. Now Tamar was wearing a long-sleeved
2SA.13.19	Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long-sleeved garment she was wearing. She put her hand on her head
2SA.13.20	Her brother Absalom said to her: “Has your brother Amnon been with you? Be quiet for now, my sister. He is your brother. Don’t take this thing to heart.” So Tamar lived as a desolate woman
2SA.13.21	When King David heard about all these things, he was furious.
2SA.13.22	Absalom didn’t say anything to Amnon, either good or bad, because he hated Amnon since he disgraced his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	Two years later, Absalom’s sheepshearers were at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons. 
2SA.13.24	Then he went to the king and said, “Your servant has just hired sheepshearers. Will the king and his servants please come with your servant?”
2SA.13.25	The king replied to Absalom, “No, my son, we should not all go, or we would be a burden to you.” Although Absalom urged him, he wasn’t willing to go, though he did bless him.
2SA.13.26	“If not,” Absalom said, “please let my brother Amnon go with us.”
2SA.13.26	The king asked him, “Why should he go with you?” 
2SA.13.27	But Absalom urged him, so he sent Amnon and all the king’s sons.
2SA.13.28	Now Absalom commanded his young men, “Watch Amnon until he is in a good mood from the wine. When I order you to strike Amnon, then kill him. Don’t be afraid. Am I not the one who has commanded you? Be strong and valiant!” 
2SA.13.29	So Absalom’s young men did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the rest of the king’s sons got up, and each fled on his mule.
2SA.13.30	While they were on the way, a report reached David: “Absalom struck down all the king’s sons; not even one of them survived!” 
2SA.13.31	In response the king stood up, tore his clothes, and lay down on the ground, and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn.
2SA.13.32	But Jonadab, son of David’s brother Shimeah,
2SA.13.33	So now, my lord the king, don’t take seriously the report that says all the king’s sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead.”
2SA.13.34	Meanwhile, Absalom had fled. When the young man who was standing watch looked up, there were many people coming from the road west of him from the side of the mountain.
2SA.13.35	Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the king’s sons have come! It’s exactly like your servant said.” 
2SA.13.36	Just as he finished speaking, the king’s sons entered and wept loudly. Then the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly. 
2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled and went to Talmai son of Ammihud, king of Geshur.
2SA.13.38	After Absalom had fled to Geshur and had been there three years, 
2SA.13.39	King David
2SA.14.1	Joab son of Zeruiah realized that the king’s mind was on Absalom. 
2SA.14.2	So Joab sent someone to Tekoa
2SA.14.3	Go to the king and speak these words to him.” Then Joab told her exactly what to say.
2SA.14.4	When the woman from Tekoa came
2SA.14.5	“What’s the matter?” the king asked her.
2SA.14.5	“Sadly, I am a widow; my husband died,” she said.
2SA.14.6	“Your servant had two sons. They were fighting in the field with no one to separate them, and one struck the other and killed him. 
2SA.14.7	Now the whole clan has risen up against your servant and said, ‘Hand over the one who killed his brother so we may put him to death for the life of the brother he murdered. We will eliminate the heir! ’ They would extinguish my one remaining ember by not preserving my husband’s name or posterity on earth.”
2SA.14.8	The king told the woman, “Go home. I will issue a command on your behalf.”
2SA.14.9	Then the woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord the king, may any blame be on me
2SA.14.10	“Whoever speaks to you,” the king said, “bring him to me. He will not trouble you again!”
2SA.14.11	She replied, “Please, may the king invoke the 
2SA.14.11	“As the 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, “Please, may your servant speak a word to my lord the king?”
2SA.14.12	“Speak,” he replied.
2SA.14.13	The woman asked, “Why have you devised something similar against the people of God? When the king spoke as he did about this matter, he has pronounced his own guilt. The king has not brought back his own banished one. 
2SA.14.14	We will certainly die
2SA.14.15	“Now therefore, I’ve come to present this matter to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. Your servant thought: I must speak to the king. Perhaps the king will grant his servant’s request. 
2SA.14.16	The king will surely listen in order to keep his servant from the grasp of this man who would eliminate both me and my son from God’s inheritance. 
2SA.14.17	Your servant thought: May the word of my lord the king bring relief, for my lord the king is able to discern the good and the bad like the angel of God.
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered the woman, “I’m going to ask you something; don’t conceal it from me!”
2SA.14.18	“Let my lord the king speak,” the woman replied.
2SA.14.19	The king asked, “Did Joab put you up to
2SA.14.19	The woman answered. “As you live, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or left from all my lord the king says. Yes, your servant Joab is the one who gave orders to me; he told your servant exactly what to say.
2SA.14.20	Joab your servant has done this to address the issue indirectly,
2SA.14.21	Then the king said to Joab, “I hereby grant this request. Go, bring back the young man Absalom.”
2SA.14.22	Joab fell with his face to the ground in homage and blessed the king. “Today,” Joab said, “your servant knows I have found favor with you, my lord the king, because the king has granted the request of your servant.”
2SA.14.23	So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom
2SA.14.24	However, the king added, “He may return to his house, but he may not see my face.” So Absalom returned to his house, but he did not see the king.
2SA.14.25	No man in all Israel was as handsome
2SA.14.26	When he shaved his head — he shaved it at the end of every year because his hair got so heavy for him that he had to shave it off — he would weigh the hair from his head and it would be five pounds
2SA.14.27	Three sons were born to Absalom, and a daughter named Tamar, who was a beautiful woman. 
2SA.14.28	Absalom resided in Jerusalem two years but never saw the king. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent for Joab in order to send him to the king, but Joab was unwilling to come to him. So he sent again, a second time, but he still would not come. 
2SA.14.30	Then Absalom said to his servants, “See, Joab has a field right next to mine, and he has barley there. Go and set fire to it!” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire.
2SA.14.31	Then Joab came to Absalom’s house and demanded, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?”
2SA.14.32	“Look,” Absalom explained to Joab, “I sent for you and said, ‘Come here. I want to send you to the king to ask: Why have I come back from Geshur? I’d be better off if I were still there.’ So now, let me see the king. If I am guilty, let him kill me.”
2SA.14.33	Joab went to the king and told him. So David summoned Absalom, who came to the king and paid homage with his face to the ground before him. Then the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	After this, Absalom got himself a chariot, horses, and fifty men to run before him.
2SA.15.2	He would get up early and stand beside the road leading to the city gate.
2SA.15.3	Absalom said to him, “Look, your claims are good and right, but the king does not have anyone to listen to you.” 
2SA.15.4	He added, “If only someone would appoint me judge in the land. Then anyone who had a grievance or dispute could come to me, and I would make sure he received justice.” 
2SA.15.5	When a person approached to pay homage to him, Absalom reached out his hand, took hold of him, and kissed him.
2SA.15.6	Absalom did this to all the Israelites who came to the king for a settlement. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.
2SA.15.7	When four
2SA.15.8	For your servant made a vow when I lived in Geshur of Aram,
2SA.15.9	“Go in peace,” the king said to him.
2SA.15.10	Then Absalom sent agents throughout the tribes of Israel with this message: “When you hear the sound of the ram’s horn,
2SA.15.11	Two hundred men from Jerusalem went with Absalom. They had been invited and were going innocently, for they did not know the whole situation. 
2SA.15.12	While he was offering the sacrifices, Absalom sent for David’s adviser Ahithophel the Gilonite,
2SA.15.13	Then an informer came to David and reported, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.”
2SA.15.14	David said to all the servants with him in Jerusalem, “Get up. We have to flee, or we will not escape from Absalom!
2SA.15.15	The king’s servants said to the king, “Whatever my lord the king decides, we are your servants.” 
2SA.15.16	Then the king set out, and his entire household followed him. But he left behind ten concubines to take care of the palace. 
2SA.15.17	So the king set out, and all the people followed him. They stopped at the last house 
2SA.15.18	while all his servants marched past him. Then all the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and the people of Gath— six hundred men who came with him from there
2SA.15.19	The king said to Ittai of Gath,
2SA.15.20	Besides, you only arrived yesterday; should I make you wander around with us today while I go wherever I can? Go back and take your brothers with you. May the 
2SA.15.21	But in response, Ittai vowed to the king, “As the 
2SA.15.22	“March on,” David replied to Ittai. So Ittai of Gath marched past with all his men and the dependents who were with him. 
2SA.15.23	Everyone in the countryside was weeping loudly while all the people were marching out of the city. As the king was crossing the Kidron Valley, all the people were marching past on the road that leads to the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	Zadok was also there, and all the Levites with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set the ark of God down, and Abiathar offered sacrifices
2SA.15.25	Then the king instructed Zadok, “Return the ark of God to the city.
2SA.15.26	However, if he should say, ‘I do not delight in you,’ then here I am — he can do with me whatever pleases him.”
2SA.15.27	The king also said to the priest Zadok,
2SA.15.28	Remember, I’ll wait at the fords
2SA.15.29	So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and stayed there.
2SA.15.30	David was climbing the slope of the Mount of Olives,
2SA.15.31	Then someone reported to David: “Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.”
2SA.15.31	“
2SA.15.32	When David came to the summit where he used to worship God, Hushai the Archite
2SA.15.33	David said to him, “If you go away with me, you’ll be a burden to me, 
2SA.15.34	but if you return to the city and tell Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, Your Majesty! Previously, I was your father’s servant, but now I will be your servant,’ then you can counteract Ahithophel’s counsel for me. 
2SA.15.35	Won’t the priests Zadok and Abiathar be there with you? Report everything you hear from the palace to the priests Zadok and Abiathar. 
2SA.15.36	Take note: their two sons are there with them—Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan. Send them to tell me everything you hear.” 
2SA.15.37	So Hushai,
2SA.16.1	When David had gone a little beyond the summit,
2SA.16.2	The king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?”
2SA.16.2	Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for the king’s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for those to drink who become exhausted in the wilderness.”
2SA.16.3	“Where is your master’s grandson?” the king asked.
2SA.16.3	“Why, he’s staying in Jerusalem,” Ziba replied to the king, “for he said, ‘Today, the house of Israel will restore my grandfather’s kingdom to me.’”
2SA.16.4	The king said to Ziba, “All that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!” 
2SA.16.4	“I bow before you,” Ziba said. “May I find favor with you, my lord the king!”
2SA.16.5	When King David got to Bahurim, a man belonging to the family of the house of Saul was just coming out.
2SA.16.6	He threw stones at David and at all the royal
2SA.16.7	Shimei said as he cursed: “Get out, get out, you man of bloodshed, you wicked man!
2SA.16.8	The 
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog
2SA.16.10	The king replied, “Sons of Zeruiah, do we agree on anything?
2SA.16.11	Then David said to Abishai and all his servants, “Look, my own son, my own flesh and blood,
2SA.16.12	Perhaps the 
2SA.16.13	So David and his men proceeded along the road as Shimei was going along the ridge of the hill opposite him. As Shimei went, he cursed David, threw stones at him, and kicked up dust. 
2SA.16.14	Finally, the king and all the people with him arrived
2SA.16.15	Now Absalom and all the Israelites came to Jerusalem. Ahithophel was also with him. 
2SA.16.16	When David’s friend Hushai the Archite came to Absalom, Hushai said to Absalom, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” 
2SA.16.17	“Is this your loyalty to your friend?” Absalom asked Hushai. “Why didn’t you go with your friend?”
2SA.16.18	“Not at all,” Hushai answered Absalom. “I am on the side of the one that the 
2SA.16.19	Furthermore, whom will I serve if not his son? As I served in your father’s presence, I will also serve in yours.”
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give me your advice. What should we do?”
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel replied to Absalom, “Sleep with your father’s concubines whom he left to take care of the palace.
2SA.16.22	So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and he slept with his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
2SA.16.23	Now the advice Ahithophel gave in those days was like someone asking about a word from God
2SA.17.1	Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out in pursuit of David tonight. 
2SA.17.2	I will attack him while he is weary and discouraged,
2SA.17.3	and bring all the people back to you. When everyone returns except the man you’re looking for, all
2SA.17.4	This proposal seemed right to Absalom and all the elders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	Then Absalom said, “Summon Hushai the Archite also. Let’s hear what he has to say as well.”
2SA.17.6	So Hushai came to Absalom, and Absalom told him: “Ahithophel offered this proposal. Should we carry out his proposal? If not, what do you say?”
2SA.17.7	Hushai replied to Absalom, “The advice Ahithophel has given this time is not good.” 
2SA.17.8	Hushai continued, “You know your father and his men. They are warriors and are desperate like a wild bear robbed of her cubs.
2SA.17.9	He’s probably already hiding in one of the caves
2SA.17.10	Then, even a brave man with the heart of a lion
2SA.17.11	Instead, I advise that all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba — as numerous as the sand by the sea
2SA.17.12	Then we will attack David wherever we find him, and we will descend on him like dew on the ground. Not even one will be left—neither he nor any of the men with him. 
2SA.17.13	If he retreats to some city, all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag its stones
2SA.17.14	Since the 
2SA.17.15	Hushai then told the priests Zadok and Abiathar, “This is what
2SA.17.16	Now send someone quickly and tell David, ‘Don’t spend the night at the wilderness ford,
2SA.17.17	Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En-rogel, where a servant girl would come and pass along information to them. They in turn would go and inform King David, because they dared not be seen entering the city. 
2SA.17.18	However, a young man did see them and informed Absalom. So the two left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it. 
2SA.17.19	Then his wife took the cover, placed it over the mouth of the well, and scattered grain on it so nobody would know anything.
2SA.17.20	Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
2SA.17.20	“They passed by toward the water,”
2SA.17.21	After they had gone, Ahimaaz and Jonathan climbed out of the well and went and informed King David. They told him, “Get up and immediately ford the river, for Ahithophel has given this advice against you.” 
2SA.17.22	So David and all the people with him got up and crossed the Jordan. By daybreak, there was no one who had not crossed the Jordan. 
2SA.17.23	When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown. He set his house in order and hanged himself.
2SA.17.24	David had arrived at Mahanaim by the time Absalom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel. 
2SA.17.25	Now Absalom had appointed Amasa
2SA.17.26	And Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead. 
2SA.17.27	When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi son of Nahash
2SA.17.28	brought beds, basins,
2SA.17.29	honey, curds, sheep, goats, and cheese
2SA.18.1	David reviewed his troops and appointed commanders of thousands and of hundreds over them. 
2SA.18.2	He then sent out the troops, a third under Joab, a third under Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and a third under Ittai of Gath. The king said to the troops, “I must also march out with you.”
2SA.18.3	“You must not go!” 
2SA.18.4	“I will do whatever you think is best,” the king replied to them. So he stood beside the city gate while all the troops marched out by hundreds and thousands. 
2SA.18.5	The king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “Treat the young man Absalom gently for my sake.” All the people heard the king’s orders to all the commanders about Absalom.
2SA.18.6	Then David’s forces marched into the field to engage Israel in battle, which took place in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	Israel’s army was defeated by David’s soldiers, and the slaughter there was vast that day — twenty thousand dead. 
2SA.18.8	The battle spread over the entire area, and that day the forest claimed more people than the sword.
2SA.18.9	Absalom was riding on his mule when he happened to meet David’s soldiers. When the mule went under the tangled branches of a large oak tree, Absalom’s head was caught fast in the tree. The mule under him kept going, so he was suspended in midair.
2SA.18.10	One of the men saw him and informed Joab. He said, “I just saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!”
2SA.18.11	“You just saw him!” Joab exclaimed.
2SA.18.12	The man replied to Joab, “Even if I had the weight of a thousand pieces of silver
2SA.18.13	If I had jeopardized my own
2SA.18.14	Joab said, “I’m not going to waste time with you!” He then took three spears in his hand and thrust them into Absalom’s chest. While Absalom was still alive in the oak tree, 
2SA.18.15	ten young men who were Joab’s armor-bearers surrounded Absalom, struck him, and killed him. 
2SA.18.16	Joab blew the ram’s horn, and the troops broke off their pursuit of Israel because Joab restrained them. 
2SA.18.17	They took Absalom, threw him into a large pit in the forest, and raised up a huge mound of stones over him.
2SA.18.18	When he was alive, Absalom had taken a pillar and raised it up
2SA.18.19	Ahimaaz son of Zadok
2SA.18.20	Joab replied to him, “You are not the man to take good news today. You may do it another day, but today you aren’t taking good news, because the king’s son is dead.” 
2SA.18.21	Joab then said to a Cushite, “Go tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed to Joab and took off running.
2SA.18.22	However, Ahimaaz son of Zadok persisted and said to Joab, “No matter what, please let me also run behind the Cushite!”
2SA.18.22	Joab replied, “My son, why do you want to run since you won’t get a reward?” 
2SA.18.23	“No matter what, I want to run!”
2SA.18.23	“Then run!” Joab said to him. So Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the Cushite.
2SA.18.24	David was sitting between the city gates
2SA.18.25	He called out and told the king.
2SA.18.25	The king said, “If he’s alone, he bears good news.”
2SA.18.25	As the first runner came closer, 
2SA.18.26	the watchman saw another man running. He called out to the gatekeeper, “Look! Another man is running alone!”
2SA.18.26	“This one is also bringing good news,” said the king.
2SA.18.27	The watchman said, “The way the first man runs looks to me like the way Ahimaaz son of Zadok runs.”
2SA.18.27	“This is a good man; he comes with good news,”
2SA.18.28	Ahimaaz called out to the king, “All is well,” and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground. He continued, “Blessed be the 
2SA.18.29	The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom all right?”
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz replied, “When Joab sent the king’s servant and your servant, I saw a big disturbance, but I don’t know what it was.”
2SA.18.30	The king said, “Move aside and stand here.” So he stood to one side.
2SA.18.31	Just then the Cushite came and said, “May my lord the king hear the good news: The 
2SA.18.32	The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom all right?”
2SA.18.32	The Cushite replied, “I wish that the enemies of my lord the king, along with all who rise up against you with evil intent, would become like that young man.”
2SA.18.33	The king was deeply moved and went up to the chamber above the city gate and wept. As he walked, he cried, “My son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you, Absalom, my son, my son!” 
2SA.19.1	It was reported to Joab, “The king is weeping. He’s mourning over Absalom.” 
2SA.19.2	That day’s victory was turned into mourning for all the troops because on that day the troops heard, “The king is grieving over his son.” 
2SA.19.3	So they returned to the city quietly that day like troops come in when they are humiliated after fleeing in battle. 
2SA.19.4	But the king covered his face
2SA.19.5	Then Joab went into the house to the king and said, “Today you have shamed all your soldiers — those who saved your life as well as your sons, your wives, and your concubines —  
2SA.19.6	by loving your enemies and hating those who love you! Today you have made it clear that the commanders and soldiers mean nothing to you. In fact, today I know that if Absalom were alive and all of us were dead, it would be fine with you!
2SA.19.7	“Now get up! Go out and encourage
2SA.19.8	So the king got up and sat in the city gate,
2SA.19.8	Meanwhile, each Israelite had fled to his tent.
2SA.19.9	People throughout all the tribes of Israel were arguing among themselves, saying, “The king rescued us from the grasp of our enemies,
2SA.19.10	But Absalom, the man we anointed over us, has died in battle. So why do you say nothing about restoring the king?”
2SA.19.11	King David sent word to the priests Zadok and Abiathar:
2SA.19.12	You are my brothers, my flesh and blood.
2SA.19.13	And tell Amasa,
2SA.19.14	So he won over
2SA.19.15	Then the king returned. When he arrived at the Jordan, Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king and escort him across the Jordan.
2SA.19.16	Shimei son of Gera,
2SA.19.17	There were a thousand men from Benjamin with him. Ziba, an attendant from the house of Saul,
2SA.19.18	They forded the Jordan to bring the king’s household across and do whatever the king desired.
2SA.19.18	When Shimei son of Gera crossed the Jordan, he fell facedown before the king 
2SA.19.19	and said to him, “My lord, don’t hold me guilty, and don’t remember your servant’s wrongdoing on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem.
2SA.19.20	For your servant knows that I have sinned. But look! Today I am the first one of the entire house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”
2SA.19.21	Abishai son of Zeruiah asked, “Shouldn’t Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the 
2SA.19.22	David answered, “Sons of Zeruiah, do we agree on anything?
2SA.19.23	So the king said to Shimei, “You will not die.” Then the king gave him his oath.
2SA.19.24	Mephibosheth,
2SA.19.25	When he came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Mephibosheth, why didn’t you come with me?”
2SA.19.26	“My lord the king,” he replied, “my servant Ziba betrayed me. Actually your servant said: ‘I’ll saddle the donkey for myself
2SA.19.27	Ziba slandered your servant to my lord the king.
2SA.19.28	For my grandfather’s entire family deserves death from my lord the king, but you set your servant among those who eat at your table.
2SA.19.29	The king said to him, “Why keep on speaking about these matters of yours? I hereby declare: you and Ziba are to divide the land.”
2SA.19.30	Mephibosheth said to the king, “Instead, since my lord the king has come to his palace safely, let Ziba take it all!”
2SA.19.31	Barzillai the Gileadite
2SA.19.32	Barzillai was a very old man — eighty years old — and since he was a very wealthy man, he had provided for the needs of the king while he stayed in Mahanaim.
2SA.19.33	The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me, and I’ll provide for you
2SA.19.34	Barzillai replied to the king, “How many years of my life are left that I should go up to Jerusalem with the king? 
2SA.19.35	I’m now eighty years old.
2SA.19.36	Since your servant is only going with the king a little way across the Jordan, why should the king repay me with such a reward? 
2SA.19.37	Please let your servant return so that I may die in my own city near the tomb of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham:
2SA.19.38	The king replied, “Chimham will cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you, and whatever you desire from me I will do for you.” 
2SA.19.39	So all the people crossed the Jordan, and then the king crossed. The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and Barzillai returned to his home.
2SA.19.40	The king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him. All the troops of Judah and half of Israel’s escorted the king. 
2SA.19.41	Suddenly, all the men of Israel came to the king. They asked him, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, take you away secretly and transport the king and his household across the Jordan, along with all of David’s men?”
2SA.19.42	All the men of Judah responded to the men of Israel, “Because the king is our relative. Why does this make you angry? Have we ever eaten anything of the king’s or been honored at all?” 
2SA.19.43	The men of Israel answered the men of Judah: “We have ten shares in the king,
2SA.20.1	Now a wicked man, a Benjaminite named Sheba son of Bichri, happened to be there. He blew the ram’s horn and shouted:
2SA.20.1	We have no portion in David,
2SA.20.1	no inheritance in Jesse’s son.
2SA.20.1	Each man to his tent,
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bichri, but the men of Judah from the Jordan all the way to Jerusalem remained loyal to their king.
2SA.20.3	When David came to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and placed them under guard.
2SA.20.4	The king said to Amasa, “Summon the men of Judah to me within three days and be here yourself.” 
2SA.20.5	Amasa went to summon Judah, but he took longer than the time allotted him. 
2SA.20.6	So David said to Abishai, “Sheba son of Bichri will do more harm to us than Absalom. Take your lord’s soldiers and pursue him, or he will find fortified cities and elude us.”
2SA.20.7	So Joab’s men, the Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the warriors marched out under Abishai’s command;
2SA.20.8	They were at the great stone in Gibeon when Amasa joined them. Joab was wearing his uniform and over it was a belt around his waist with a sword in its sheath. As he approached, the sword fell out. 
2SA.20.9	Joab asked Amasa, “Are you well, my brother?” Then with his right hand Joab grabbed Amasa by the beard to kiss him.
2SA.20.10	Amasa was not on guard against the sword in Joab’s hand, and Joab stabbed him in the stomach with it and spilled his intestines out on the ground. Joab did not stab him again, and Amasa died.
2SA.20.10	Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba son of Bichri. 
2SA.20.11	One of Joab’s young men had stood over Amasa saying, “Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, follow Joab!” 
2SA.20.12	Now Amasa had been writhing in his blood in the middle of the highway, and the man had seen that all the troops stopped. So he moved Amasa from the highway to the field and threw a garment over him because he realized that all those who encountered Amasa were stopping. 
2SA.20.13	When he was removed from the highway, all the men passed by and followed Joab to pursue Sheba son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	Sheba passed through all the tribes of Israel to Abel of Beth-maacah. All the Berites
2SA.20.15	Joab’s troops came and besieged Sheba in Abel of Beth-maacah. They built a siege ramp
2SA.20.16	a wise woman called out from the city, “Listen! Listen! Please tell Joab to come here and let me speak with him.”
2SA.20.17	When he had come near her, the woman asked, “Are you Joab?”
2SA.20.17	“I am,” he replied.
2SA.20.17	“Listen to the words of your servant,” she said to him.
2SA.20.17	He answered, “I’m listening.”
2SA.20.18	She said, “In the past they used to say, ‘Seek counsel in Abel,’ and that’s how they settled disputes. 
2SA.20.19	I am one of the peaceful and faithful in Israel, but you’re trying to destroy a city that is like a mother in Israel. Why would you devour the 
2SA.20.20	Joab protested: “Never! I would never devour or demolish! 
2SA.20.21	That is not the case. There is a man named Sheba son of Bichri, from the hill country of Ephraim, who has rebelled against King David. Deliver this one man, and I will withdraw from the city.”
2SA.20.21	The woman replied to Joab, “Watch! His head will be thrown over the wall to you.” 
2SA.20.22	The woman went to all the people with her wise counsel,
2SA.20.23	Joab commanded the whole army of Israel;
2SA.20.23	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and Pelethites;
2SA.20.24	Adoram
2SA.20.24	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was court historian;
2SA.20.25	Sheva was court secretary;
2SA.20.25	Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
2SA.20.26	and in addition, Ira the Jairite was David’s priest.
2SA.21.1	During David’s reign there was a famine for three successive years, so David inquired
2SA.21.2	The Gibeonites were not Israelites but rather a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelites had taken an oath concerning them,
2SA.21.3	He asked the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? How can I make atonement so that you will bring a blessing on
2SA.21.4	The Gibeonites said to him, “We are not asking for silver and gold from Saul or his family,
2SA.21.4	“Whatever you say, I will do for you,” he said.
2SA.21.5	They replied to the king, “As for the man who annihilated us and plotted to destroy us so we would not exist within the whole territory of Israel, 
2SA.21.6	let seven of his male descendants be handed over to us so we may hang
2SA.21.6	The king answered, “I will hand them over.”
2SA.21.7	David spared Mephibosheth, the son of Saul’s son Jonathan, because of the oath of the 
2SA.21.8	But the king took Armoni and Mephibosheth, who were the two sons whom Rizpah
2SA.21.9	and handed them over to the Gibeonites. They hanged
2SA.21.10	Rizpah, Aiah’s daughter, took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on the rock from the beginning of the harvest
2SA.21.11	When it was reported to David what Saul’s concubine Rizpah daughter of Aiah had done, 
2SA.21.12	he went and got the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from the citizens of Jabesh-gilead. They had stolen them from the public square of Beth-shan where the Philistines had hung the bodies the day the Philistines killed Saul at Gilboa.
2SA.21.13	David had the bones brought from there. They gathered up the bones of Saul’s family who had been hanged 
2SA.21.14	and buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan at Zela in the land of Benjamin in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish. They did everything the king commanded. After this, God was receptive to prayer for the land.
2SA.21.15	The Philistines again waged war against Israel. David went down with his soldiers, and they fought the Philistines, but David became exhausted. 
2SA.21.16	Then Ishbi-benob, one of the descendants of the giant,
2SA.21.17	But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to his aid, struck the Philistine, and killed him. Then David’s men swore to him: “You must never again go out with us to battle. You must not extinguish the lamp of Israel.”
2SA.21.18	After this,
2SA.21.19	Once again there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan son of Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite killed
2SA.21.20	At Gath there was still another battle. A huge man was there with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot — twenty-four in all. He, too, was descended from the giant. 
2SA.21.21	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan, son of David’s brother Shimei, killed him.
2SA.21.22	These four were descended from the giant in Gath and were killed by David and his soldiers.
2SA.22.1	David spoke the words of this song to the 
2SA.22.2	He said:
2SA.22.2	The 
2SA.22.3	my God,
2SA.22.3	My shield, the horn of my salvation,
2SA.22.3	and my Savior, you save me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I called to the 
2SA.22.4	and I was saved from my enemies.
2SA.22.5	For the waves of death engulfed me;
2SA.22.5	the torrents of destruction terrified me.
2SA.22.6	The ropes of Sheol entangled me;
2SA.22.6	the snares of death confronted me.
2SA.22.7	I called to the 
2SA.22.7	I called to my God.
2SA.22.7	From his temple he heard my voice,
2SA.22.7	and my cry for help reached his ears.
2SA.22.8	Then the earth shook and quaked;
2SA.22.8	the foundations of the heavens
2SA.22.8	they shook because he burned with anger.
2SA.22.9	Smoke rose from his nostrils,
2SA.22.9	and consuming fire came from his mouth;
2SA.22.9	coals were set ablaze by it.
2SA.22.10	He bent the heavens and came down,
2SA.22.10	total darkness beneath his feet.
2SA.22.11	He rode on a cherub and flew,
2SA.22.11	soaring
2SA.22.12	He made darkness a canopy around him,
2SA.22.12	a gathering
2SA.22.13	From the radiance of his presence,
2SA.22.13	blazing coals were ignited.
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.14	the Most High made his voice heard.
2SA.22.15	He shot arrows and scattered them;
2SA.22.15	he hurled lightning bolts and routed them.
2SA.22.16	The depths of the sea became visible,
2SA.22.16	the foundations of the world were exposed
2SA.22.16	at the rebuke of the 
2SA.22.16	at the blast of the breath
2SA.22.17	He reached down from on high
2SA.22.17	and took hold of me;
2SA.22.17	he pulled me out of deep water.
2SA.22.18	He rescued me from my powerful enemy
2SA.22.18	and from those who hated me,
2SA.22.18	for they were too strong for me.
2SA.22.19	They confronted me in the day of my calamity,
2SA.22.19	but the 
2SA.22.20	He brought me out to a spacious place;
2SA.22.20	he rescued me because he delighted in me.
2SA.22.21	The 
2SA.22.21	according to my righteousness;
2SA.22.21	he repaid me
2SA.22.21	according to the cleanness of my hands.
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the 
2SA.22.22	and have not turned from my God to wickedness.
2SA.22.23	Indeed, I let all his ordinances
2SA.22.23	and have not disregarded his statutes.
2SA.22.24	I was blameless before him
2SA.22.24	and kept myself from my iniquity.
2SA.22.25	So the 
2SA.22.25	according to my righteousness,
2SA.22.25	according to my cleanness
2SA.22.26	With the faithful
2SA.22.26	you prove yourself faithful,
2SA.22.26	with the blameless
2SA.22.26	you prove yourself blameless,
2SA.22.27	with the pure
2SA.22.27	you prove yourself pure;
2SA.22.27	but with the crooked
2SA.22.27	you prove yourself shrewd.
2SA.22.28	You rescue an oppressed people,
2SA.22.28	but your eyes are set against the proud —
2SA.22.28	you humble them.
2SA.22.29	the 
2SA.22.30	With you I can attack a barricade,
2SA.22.30	and with my God I can leap over a wall.
2SA.22.31	God — his way is perfect;
2SA.22.31	the word of the 
2SA.22.31	He is a shield to all who take refuge in him.
2SA.22.32	For who is God besides the 
2SA.22.32	And who is a rock? Only our God.
2SA.22.33	God is my strong refuge;
2SA.22.33	he makes my way perfect.
2SA.22.34	He makes my feet like the feet of a deer
2SA.22.34	and sets me securely on the
2SA.22.35	He trains my hands for war;
2SA.22.35	my arms can bend a bow of bronze.
2SA.22.36	You have given me the shield of your salvation;
2SA.22.36	your help
2SA.22.37	You make a spacious place beneath me for my steps,
2SA.22.37	and my ankles do not give way.
2SA.22.38	I pursue my enemies and destroy them;
2SA.22.38	I do not turn back until they are wiped out.
2SA.22.39	I wipe them out and crush them,
2SA.22.39	and they do not rise;
2SA.22.39	they fall beneath my feet.
2SA.22.40	You have clothed me with strength for battle;
2SA.22.40	you subdue my adversaries beneath me.
2SA.22.41	You have made my enemies retreat before me;
2SA.22.41	I annihilate those who hate me.
2SA.22.42	They look, but there is no one to save them —
2SA.22.42	they look to the 
2SA.22.43	I pulverize them like dust of the earth;
2SA.22.43	I crush them and trample them like mud in the streets.
2SA.22.44	You have freed me from the feuds among my people;
2SA.22.44	you have preserved me as head of nations;
2SA.22.44	a people I had not known serve me.
2SA.22.45	Foreigners submit to me cringing;
2SA.22.45	as soon as they hear, they obey me.
2SA.22.46	Foreigners lose heart
2SA.22.46	and come trembling from their fortifications.
2SA.22.47	The 
2SA.22.47	God, the rock of my salvation,
2SA.22.48	God — he grants me vengeance
2SA.22.48	and casts down peoples under me.
2SA.22.49	He frees me from my enemies.
2SA.22.49	You exalt me above my adversaries;
2SA.22.49	you rescue me from violent men.
2SA.22.50	Therefore I will give thanks to you among the nations, 
2SA.22.50	I will sing praises about your name.
2SA.22.51	He is a tower of salvation for
2SA.22.51	he shows loyalty to his anointed,
2SA.22.51	to David and his descendants forever.
2SA.23.1	These are the last words of David:
2SA.23.1	The declaration of David son of Jesse,
2SA.23.1	the declaration of the man raised on high,
2SA.23.1	the one anointed by the God of Jacob.
2SA.23.1	This is the most delightful of Israel’s songs.
2SA.23.2	The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.2	his word was on my tongue.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel spoke;
2SA.23.3	the Rock of Israel said to me,
2SA.23.3	“The one who rules the people with justice,
2SA.23.3	who rules in the fear of God,
2SA.23.4	is like the morning light when the sun rises
2SA.23.4	on a cloudless morning,
2SA.23.4	the glisten of rain on sprouting grass.”
2SA.23.5	Is it not true my house is with God?
2SA.23.5	For he has established a permanent covenant
2SA.23.5	ordered and secured in every detail.
2SA.23.5	Will he not bring about
2SA.23.5	my whole salvation and my every desire?
2SA.23.6	But all the wicked are like thorns raked aside;
2SA.23.6	they can never be picked up by hand.
2SA.23.7	The man who touches them
2SA.23.7	must be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear.
2SA.23.7	They will be completely burned up on the spot.
2SA.23.8	These are the names of David’s warriors:
2SA.23.8	Josheb-basshebeth the Tahchemonite was chief of the officers.
2SA.23.9	After him, Eleazar son of Dodo son of an Ahohite was among the three warriors with David when they defied the Philistines. The men of Israel retreated in the place they had gathered for battle, 
2SA.23.10	but Eleazar stood his ground and attacked the Philistines until his hand was tired and stuck to his sword. The 
2SA.23.11	After him was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines had assembled in formation where there was a field full of lentils. The troops fled from the Philistines, 
2SA.23.12	but Shammah took his stand in the middle of the field, defended it, and struck down the Philistines. So the 
2SA.23.13	Three of the thirty leading warriors went down at harvest time and came to David at the cave of Adullam,
2SA.23.14	At that time David was in the stronghold,
2SA.23.15	David was extremely thirsty
2SA.23.16	So three of the warriors broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem. They brought it back to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to the 
2SA.23.17	David said, “
2SA.23.18	Abishai, Joab’s brother and son of Zeruiah,
2SA.23.19	Was he not more honored than the Three? He became their commander even though he did not become one of the Three.
2SA.23.20	Benaiah son of Jehoiada
2SA.23.21	He also killed an Egyptian, an impressive man. Even though the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, Benaiah went down to him with a club, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand, and then killed him with his own spear. 
2SA.23.22	These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who had a reputation among the three warriors. 
2SA.23.23	He was the most honored of the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.
2SA.23.24	Among the Thirty were
2SA.23.24	Joab’s brother Asahel,
2SA.23.24	Elhanan son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
2SA.23.25	Shammah the Harodite,
2SA.23.25	Elika the Harodite,
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite,
2SA.23.26	Ira son of Ikkesh the Tekoite,
2SA.23.27	Abiezer the Anathothite,
2SA.23.27	Mebunnai the Hushathite,
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite,
2SA.23.28	Maharai the Netophathite,
2SA.23.29	Heleb son of Baanah the Netophathite,
2SA.23.29	Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah of the Benjaminites,
2SA.23.30	Benaiah the Pirathonite,
2SA.23.30	Hiddai from the wadis of Gaash,
2SA.23.31	Abi-albon the Arbathite,
2SA.23.31	Azmaveth the Barhumite,
2SA.23.32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite,
2SA.23.32	the sons of Jashen,
2SA.23.32	Jonathan son of
2SA.23.33	Shammah the Hararite,
2SA.23.33	Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite,
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet son of Ahasbai son of the Maacathite,
2SA.23.34	Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite,
2SA.23.35	Hezro the Carmelite,
2SA.23.35	Paarai the Arbite,
2SA.23.36	Igal son of Nathan from Zobah,
2SA.23.36	Bani the Gadite,
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite,
2SA.23.37	Naharai the Beerothite, the armor-bearer for Joab son of Zeruiah,
2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite,
2SA.23.38	Gareb the Ithrite,
2SA.23.39	and Uriah
2SA.23.39	There were thirty-seven in all.
2SA.24.1	The 
2SA.24.2	So the king said to Joab, the commander of his army, “Go through all the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba and register the troops so I can know their number.”
2SA.24.3	Joab replied to the king, “May the 
2SA.24.4	Yet the king’s order prevailed over Joab and the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army left the king’s presence to register the troops of Israel.
2SA.24.5	They crossed the Jordan and camped in Aroer,
2SA.24.6	They went to Gilead and to the land of the Hittites
2SA.24.7	They went to the fortress of Tyre and all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites. Afterward, they went to the Negev of Judah at Beer-sheba.
2SA.24.8	When they had gone through the whole land, they returned to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 
2SA.24.9	Joab gave the king the total of the registration of the troops. There were eight hundred thousand valiant armed men
2SA.24.10	David’s conscience troubled him
2SA.24.11	When David got up in the morning, the word of the 
2SA.24.12	“Go and say to David, ‘This is what the 
2SA.24.13	So Gad went to David, told him the choices, and asked him, “Do you want three
2SA.24.14	David answered Gad, “I have great anxiety. Please, let us fall into the 
2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	Then the angel extended his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it,
2SA.24.17	When David saw the angel striking the people, he said to the 
2SA.24.18	Gad came to David that day and said to him, “Go up and set up an altar to the 
2SA.24.19	David went up in obedience to Gad’s command, just as the 
2SA.24.20	Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants coming toward him, so he went out and paid homage to the king with his face to the ground.
2SA.24.21	Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”
2SA.24.21	David replied, “To buy the threshing floor from you in order to build an altar to the 
2SA.24.22	Araunah said to David, “My lord the king may take whatever he wants
2SA.24.23	Your Majesty, Araunah gives everything here to the king.” Then he said to the king, “May the 
2SA.24.24	The king answered Araunah, “No, I insist on buying it from you for a price, for I will not offer to the 
2SA.24.25	He built an altar to the 
1KI.1.1	Now King David was old and advanced in age.
1KI.1.2	So his servants said to him: “Let us
1KI.1.3	They searched for a beautiful girl throughout the territory of Israel; they found Abishag
1KI.1.4	The girl was of unsurpassed beauty,
1KI.1.5	Adonijah son of Haggith
1KI.1.6	But his father had never once infuriated
1KI.1.7	He conspired
1KI.1.8	but the priest Zadok,
1KI.1.9	Adonijah sacrificed sheep, goats, cattle, and fattened cattle near the stone of Zoheleth, which is next to En-rogel.
1KI.1.10	but he did not invite the prophet Nathan, Benaiah, the royal guard, or his brother Solomon.
1KI.1.11	Then Nathan
1KI.1.12	Now please come and let me advise you.
1KI.1.13	Go, approach King David and say to him, ‘My lord the king, did you not swear to your servant: Your son Solomon is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne?
1KI.1.14	At that moment, while you are still there speaking with the king, I’ll come in after you and confirm your words.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went to the king in his bedroom. Since the king was very old, Abishag the Shunammite was attending to him.
1KI.1.16	Bathsheba knelt low and paid homage to the king, and he asked, “What do you want?”
1KI.1.17	She replied, “My lord, you swore to your servant by the 
1KI.1.18	Now look, Adonijah has become king. And,
1KI.1.19	He has lavishly sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep. He invited all the king’s sons, the priest Abiathar, and Joab the commander of the army, but he did not invite your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.20	Now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you to tell them who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. 
1KI.1.21	Otherwise, when my lord the king rests with his fathers,
1KI.1.22	At that moment, while she was still speaking with the king, the prophet Nathan arrived,
1KI.1.23	and it was announced to the king, “The prophet Nathan is here.” He came into the king’s presence and paid homage to him with his face to the ground.
1KI.1.24	“My lord the king,” Nathan said, “did you say, ‘Adonijah is to become king after me, and he is the one who is to sit on my throne’? 
1KI.1.25	For today he went down and lavishly sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep. He invited all the sons of the king, the commanders of the army, and the priest Abiathar. And look! They’re eating and drinking in his presence, and they’re saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ 
1KI.1.26	But he did not invite me — me, your servant — or the priest Zadok or Benaiah son of Jehoiada or your servant Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	I’m certain my lord the king would not have let this happen without letting your servant
1KI.1.28	King David responded by saying, “Call in Bathsheba for me.” So she came into the king’s presence and stood before him. 
1KI.1.29	The king swore an oath and said, “As the 
1KI.1.30	just as I swore to you by the 
1KI.1.31	Bathsheba knelt low with her face to the ground, paying homage to the king,
1KI.1.32	King David then said, “Call in the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada for me.”
1KI.1.33	The king said to them, “Take my servants
1KI.1.34	There, the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan are to anoint him as king over Israel.
1KI.1.35	You are to come up after him, and he is to come in and sit on my throne. He is the one who is to become king in my place; he is the one I have commanded to be ruler
1KI.1.36	“Amen,” Benaiah son of Jehoiada replied to the king. “May the 
1KI.1.37	Just as the 
1KI.1.38	Then the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites
1KI.1.39	The priest Zadok took the horn of oil from the tabernacle and anointed Solomon.
1KI.1.40	All the people went up after him, playing flutes and rejoicing with such a great joy
1KI.1.41	Adonijah and all the invited guests who were with him
1KI.1.42	He was still speaking when Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest,
1KI.1.43	“Unfortunately not,” Jonathan answered him. “Our lord King David has made Solomon king. 
1KI.1.44	And with Solomon, the king has sent the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have had him ride on the king’s mule. 
1KI.1.45	The priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan have anointed him king in Gihon.
1KI.1.46	Solomon has even taken his seat on the royal throne.
1KI.1.47	“The king’s servants have also gone to congratulate our lord King David, saying, ‘May your God make the name of Solomon more well known than your name, and may he make his throne greater than your throne.’
1KI.1.48	And the king went on to say this: ‘Blessed be the 
1KI.1.49	Then all of Adonijah’s guests got up trembling and went their separate ways. 
1KI.1.50	Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, so he got up and went to take hold of the horns of the altar.
1KI.1.51	It was reported to Solomon: “Look, Adonijah fears King Solomon, and he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying, ‘Let King Solomon first
1KI.1.52	Then Solomon said, “If he is a man of character, not a single hair of his will fall to the ground,
1KI.1.53	So King Solomon sent for him, and they took him down from the altar. He came and paid homage to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, “Go to your home.”
1KI.2.1	As the time approached for David to die,
1KI.2.2	“As for me, I am going the way of all of the earth.
1KI.2.3	and keep your obligation to the 
1KI.2.4	and so that the 
1KI.2.5	“You also know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me
1KI.2.6	Act according to your wisdom, and do not let his gray head descend to Sheol in peace.
1KI.2.7	“Show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite and let them be among those who eat at your table
1KI.2.8	“Keep an eye on Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim who is with you. He uttered malicious curses against me the day I went to Mahanaim.
1KI.2.9	So don’t let him go unpunished, for you are a wise man. You know how to deal with him to bring his gray head down to Sheol with blood.”
1KI.2.10	Then David rested with his fathers
1KI.2.11	The length of time David reigned over Israel was forty years: he reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
1KI.2.12	Solomon sat on the throne of his father David, and his kingship was firmly established.
1KI.2.13	Now Adonijah son of Haggith
1KI.2.13	“Peacefully,” he replied,
1KI.2.14	and then asked, “May I talk with you?” 
1KI.2.14	“Go ahead,” she answered.
1KI.2.15	“You know the kingship was mine,”
1KI.2.16	So now I have just one request of you; don’t turn me down.”
1KI.2.16	She said to him, “Go on.”
1KI.2.17	He replied, “Please speak to King Solomon since he won’t turn you down. Let him give me Abishag the Shunammite
1KI.2.18	“Very well,” Bathsheba replied. “I will speak to the king for you.”
1KI.2.19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him about Adonijah. The king stood up to greet her, bowed to her, sat down on his throne, and had a throne placed for the king’s mother.
1KI.2.20	Then she said, “I have just one small request of you. Don’t turn me down.”
1KI.2.20	“Go ahead and ask, mother,” the king replied, “for I won’t turn you down.”
1KI.2.21	So she said, “Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to your brother Adonijah as a wife.”
1KI.2.22	King Solomon answered his mother, “Why are you requesting Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Since he is my elder brother,
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon took an oath by the 
1KI.2.24	And now, as the 
1KI.2.25	Then King Solomon dispatched Benaiah son of Jehoiada,
1KI.2.26	The king said to the priest Abiathar,
1KI.2.27	So Solomon banished Abiathar from being the 
1KI.2.28	The news reached Joab. Since he had supported Adonijah
1KI.2.29	It was reported to King Solomon: “Joab has fled to the 
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah went to the tabernacle and said to Joab, “This is what the king says: ‘Come out!’” 
1KI.2.30	But Joab said, “No, for I will die here.”
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah took a message back to the king, “This is what Joab said, and this is how he answered me.”
1KI.2.31	The king said to him, “Do just as he says. Strike him down and bury him in order to remove from me and from my father’s family the blood that Joab shed without just cause.
1KI.2.32	The 
1KI.2.33	The responsibility for their deaths will come back to Joab and to his descendants
1KI.2.34	Benaiah son of Jehoiada
1KI.2.35	Then the king appointed Benaiah son of Jehoiada in Joab’s place over the army,
1KI.2.36	Then the king summoned Shimei
1KI.2.37	On the day you do leave and cross the Kidron Valley,
1KI.2.38	Shimei said to the king, “The sentence is fair; your servant will do as my lord the king has spoken.” And Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
1KI.2.39	But then, at the end of three years, two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish
1KI.2.40	So Shimei saddled his donkey and set out to Achish at Gath to search for his slaves. He went and brought them back from Gath.
1KI.2.41	It was reported to Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned. 
1KI.2.42	So the king summoned Shimei and said to him, “Didn’t I make you swear by the 
1KI.2.43	So why have you not kept the 
1KI.2.44	The king also said, “You yourself know all the evil that you did to my father David.
1KI.2.45	but King Solomon will be blessed, and David’s throne will remain established before the 
1KI.2.46	Then the king commanded Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck Shimei down, and he died. So the kingdom was established in Solomon’s hand.
1KI.3.1	Solomon made an alliance
1KI.3.2	However, the people were sacrificing on the high places,
1KI.3.3	Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.4	The king went to Gibeon
1KI.3.5	At Gibeon the 
1KI.3.6	And Solomon replied, “You have shown great and faithful love to your servant, my father David, because he walked before you in faithfulness, righteousness, and integrity.
1KI.3.7	“
1KI.3.8	Your servant is among your people you have chosen,
1KI.3.9	So give your servant a receptive heart to judge
1KI.3.10	Now it pleased the Lord that Solomon had requested this. 
1KI.3.11	So God said to him, “Because you have requested this and did not ask for long life
1KI.3.12	I will therefore do what you have asked.
1KI.3.13	In addition, I will give you what you did not ask for: both riches and honor,
1KI.3.14	If you walk in my ways and keep my statutes and commands just as your father David did, I will give you a long life.”
1KI.3.15	Then Solomon woke up
1KI.3.16	Then two women who were prostitutes came to the king and stood before him.
1KI.3.17	One woman said, “Please, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I had a baby while she was in the house. 
1KI.3.18	On the third day after I gave birth, she also had a baby and we were alone. No one else
1KI.3.19	During the night this woman’s son died because she lay on him. 
1KI.3.20	She got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while your servant was asleep. She laid him in her arms, and she put her dead son in my arms. 
1KI.3.21	When I got up in the morning to nurse my son, I discovered he was dead. That morning, when I looked closely at him I realized that he was not the son I gave birth to.”
1KI.3.22	“No,” the other woman said. “My son is the living one; your son is the dead one.”
1KI.3.22	The first woman said, “No, your son is the dead one; my son is the living one.” So they argued before the king.
1KI.3.23	The king replied, “This woman says, ‘This is my son who is alive, and your son is dead,’ but that woman says, ‘No, your son is dead, and my son is alive.’” 
1KI.3.24	The king continued, “Bring me a sword.” So they brought the sword to the king. 
1KI.3.25	And the king said, “Cut the living boy in two and give half to one and half to the other.”
1KI.3.26	The woman whose son was alive spoke to the king because she felt great compassion
1KI.3.26	But the other one said, “He will not be mine or yours. Cut him in two!”
1KI.3.27	The king responded, “Give the living baby to the first woman, and don’t kill him. She is his mother.” 
1KI.3.28	All Israel heard about the judgment the king had given, and they stood in awe of the king because they saw that God’s wisdom
1KI.4.1	King Solomon reigned over all Israel,
1KI.4.2	and these were his officials:
1KI.4.2	Azariah son of Zadok, priest;
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha, secretaries;
1KI.4.3	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud, court historian;
1KI.4.4	Benaiah son of Jehoiada, in charge of the army;
1KI.4.4	Zadok and Abiathar, priests;
1KI.4.5	Azariah son of Nathan, in charge of the deputies;
1KI.4.5	Zabud son of Nathan, a priest and adviser to the king;
1KI.4.6	Ahishar, in charge of the palace;
1KI.4.6	and Adoniram son of Abda, in charge of forced labor.
1KI.4.7	Solomon had twelve deputies for all Israel. They provided food for the king and his household; each one made provision for one month out of the year.
1KI.4.8	These were their names:
1KI.4.8	Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim;
1KI.4.9	Ben-deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-beth-hanan;
1KI.4.10	Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (he had Socoh and the whole land of Hepher);
1KI.4.11	Ben-abinadab, in all Naphath-dor (Taphath daughter of Solomon was his wife);
1KI.4.12	Baana son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as the other side of Jokmeam;
1KI.4.13	Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (he had the villages of Jair son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, and he had the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars);
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he also had married a daughter of Solomon — Basemath);
1KI.4.16	Baana son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth;
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat son of Paruah, in Issachar;
1KI.4.18	Shimei son of Ela, in Benjamin;
1KI.4.19	Geber son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of King Sihon of the Amorites and of King Og of Bashan.
1KI.4.19	There was one deputy in the land of Judah.
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand by the sea;
1KI.4.21	Solomon ruled all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and as far as the border of Egypt.
1KI.4.22	Solomon’s provisions for one day were 150 bushels
1KI.4.23	ten fattened cattle, twenty range cattle, and a hundred sheep and goats, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and pen-fed poultry,
1KI.4.24	for he had dominion over everything west of the Euphrates from Tiphsah to Gaza and over all the kings west of the Euphrates. He had peace on all his surrounding borders. 
1KI.4.25	Throughout Solomon’s reign, Judah and Israel lived in safety from Dan to Beer-sheba,
1KI.4.26	Solomon had forty thousand
1KI.4.27	Each of those deputies for a month in turn provided food for King Solomon and for everyone who came to King Solomon’s table. They neglected nothing. 
1KI.4.28	Each man brought the barley and the straw for the chariot teams and the other horses
1KI.4.29	God gave Solomon wisdom, very great insight, and understanding
1KI.4.30	Solomon’s wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the people of the East,
1KI.4.31	He was wiser than anyone
1KI.4.32	Solomon spoke 3,000 proverbs,
1KI.4.33	He spoke about trees, from the cedar in Lebanon to the hyssop growing out of the wall. He also spoke about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. 
1KI.4.34	Emissaries of all peoples, sent by every king on earth who had heard of his wisdom, came to listen to Solomon’s wisdom.
1KI.5.1	King Hiram of Tyre
1KI.5.2	Solomon sent this message to Hiram: 
1KI.5.3	“You know my father David was not able to build a temple for the name of the 
1KI.5.4	The 
1KI.5.5	So I plan to build a temple for the name of the 
1KI.5.6	“Therefore, command that cedars from Lebanon be cut down for me. My servants will be with your servants, and I will pay your servants’ wages according to whatever you say, for you know that not a man among us knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians.”
1KI.5.7	When Hiram heard Solomon’s words, he rejoiced greatly and said, “Blessed be the 
1KI.5.8	Then Hiram sent a reply to Solomon, saying, “I have heard your message; I will do everything you want regarding the cedar and cypress timber. 
1KI.5.9	My servants will bring the logs down from Lebanon to the sea, and I will make them into rafts to go by sea to the place you indicate. I will break them apart there, and you can take them away. You then can meet my needs by providing my household with food.”
1KI.5.10	So Hiram provided Solomon with all the cedar and cypress timber he wanted, 
1KI.5.11	and Solomon provided Hiram with one hundred thousand bushels
1KI.5.12	The 
1KI.5.13	Then King Solomon drafted forced laborers from all Israel;
1KI.5.14	He sent ten thousand to Lebanon each month in shifts; one month they were in Lebanon, two months they were at home. Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. 
1KI.5.15	Solomon had seventy thousand porters and eighty thousand stonecutters in the mountains,
1KI.5.16	not including his thirty-three hundred
1KI.5.17	The king commanded them to quarry large, costly stones to lay the foundation of the temple with dressed stones.
1KI.5.18	So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders,
1KI.6.1	Solomon began to build the temple for the 
1KI.6.2	The temple that King Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	The portico in front of the temple sanctuary was thirty feet long extending across the temple’s width, and fifteen feet deep
1KI.6.4	He also made windows with beveled frames
1KI.6.5	He then built a chambered structure
1KI.6.6	The lowest chamber was 7½ feet
1KI.6.7	The temple’s construction used finished stones cut at the quarry so that no hammer, chisel, or any iron tool was heard in the temple while it was being built.
1KI.6.8	The door for the lowest
1KI.6.9	When he finished building the temple,
1KI.6.10	He built the chambers along the entire temple, joined to the temple with cedar beams;
1KI.6.11	The word of the 
1KI.6.12	“As for this temple you are building — if you walk in my statutes, observe my ordinances, and keep all my commands by walking in them,
1KI.6.13	I will dwell among the Israelites and not abandon my people Israel.”
1KI.6.14	When Solomon finished building the temple,
1KI.6.15	he paneled the interior temple walls with cedar boards; from the temple floor to the surface of the ceiling he overlaid the interior with wood. He also overlaid the floor with cypress boards.
1KI.6.16	Then he lined thirty feet of the rear of the temple with cedar boards from the floor to the surface of the ceiling,
1KI.6.17	The temple, that is, the sanctuary in front of the most holy place,
1KI.6.18	The cedar paneling inside the temple was carved with ornamental gourds
1KI.6.19	He prepared the inner sanctuary
1KI.6.20	The interior of the sanctuary was thirty feet long, thirty feet wide, and thirty feet high; he overlaid it with pure gold.
1KI.6.21	Next, Solomon overlaid the interior of the temple with pure gold, and he hung
1KI.6.22	So he added the gold overlay to the entire temple until everything was completely finished, including the entire altar
1KI.6.23	In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim
1KI.6.24	One wing of the first cherub was 7½ feet long, and the other wing was 7½ feet long. The wingspan was 15 feet from tip to tip. 
1KI.6.25	The second cherub also was 15 feet; both cherubim had the same size and shape. 
1KI.6.26	The first cherub’s height was 15 feet and so was the second cherub’s. 
1KI.6.27	Then he put the cherubim inside the inner temple. Since their wings were spread out, the first one’s wing touched one wall while the second cherub’s wing touched the other
1KI.6.28	He also overlaid the cherubim with gold.
1KI.6.29	He carved all the surrounding temple walls with carved engravings — cherubim,
1KI.6.30	He overlaid the temple floor with gold in both the inner and the outer sanctuaries.
1KI.6.31	For the entrance of the inner sanctuary, he made olive wood doors.
1KI.6.32	The two doors were made of olive wood. He carved cherubim, palm trees, and flower blossoms on them and overlaid them with gold, hammering gold over the cherubim and palm trees. 
1KI.6.33	In the same way, he made four-sided
1KI.6.34	The two doors
1KI.6.35	He carved cherubim, palm trees, and flower blossoms on them and overlaid them with gold applied evenly over the carving. 
1KI.6.36	He built the inner courtyard
1KI.6.37	The foundation of the 
1KI.6.38	In his eleventh year in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month,
1KI.7.1	Solomon completed his entire palace complex after thirteen years of construction.
1KI.7.2	He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon.
1KI.7.3	It was paneled above with cedar at the top of the chambers that rested on forty-five pillars, fifteen per row. 
1KI.7.4	There were three rows of window frames, facing each other
1KI.7.5	All the doors and doorposts had rectangular frames, the openings facing each other
1KI.7.6	He made the hall of pillars seventy-five feet long and forty-five feet wide. A portico was in front of the pillars, and a canopy with pillars
1KI.7.7	He made the Hall of the Throne where he would judge
1KI.7.8	Solomon’s own palace where he would live, in the other courtyard behind the hall, was of similar construction. And he made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter, his wife.
1KI.7.9	All of these buildings were of costly stones, cut to size and sawed with saws on the inner and outer surfaces, from foundation to coping and from the outside to the great courtyard. 
1KI.7.10	The foundation was made of large, costly stones twelve and fifteen feet
1KI.7.11	Above were also costly stones, cut to size, as well as cedar wood. 
1KI.7.12	Around the great courtyard, as well as the inner courtyard of the 
1KI.7.13	King Solomon had Hiram
1KI.7.14	He was a widow’s son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a bronze craftsman. Hiram had great skill,
1KI.7.15	He cast two bronze pillars,
1KI.7.16	He also made two capitals
1KI.7.17	The capitals on top of the pillars had gratings of latticework, wreaths
1KI.7.18	He made the pillars with two encircling rows of pomegranates on the one grating to cover the capital on top; he did the same for the second capital. 
1KI.7.19	And the capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were shaped like lilies, six feet
1KI.7.20	The capitals on the two pillars were also immediately above the rounded surface next to the grating, and two hundred pomegranates
1KI.7.21	He set up the pillars at the portico
1KI.7.22	The tops of the pillars were shaped like lilies. Then the work of the pillars was completed.
1KI.7.23	He made the cast metal basin,
1KI.7.24	Ornamental gourds
1KI.7.25	It stood on twelve oxen,
1KI.7.26	The basin was three inches
1KI.7.27	Then he made ten bronze water carts.
1KI.7.28	This was the design of the carts: They had frames; the frames were between the cross-pieces, 
1KI.7.29	and on the frames between the cross-pieces were lions, oxen, and cherubim.
1KI.7.30	Each cart
1KI.7.31	And the water cart’s opening inside the crown on top was eighteen inches
1KI.7.32	There were four wheels under the frames, and the wheel axles were part of the water cart; each wheel was twenty-seven inches
1KI.7.33	The wheels’ design was similar to that of chariot wheels: their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs were all of cast metal. 
1KI.7.34	Four supports were at the four corners of each water cart; each support was one piece with the water cart. 
1KI.7.35	At the top of the cart was a band nine inches
1KI.7.36	He engraved cherubim, lions, and palm trees
1KI.7.37	In this way he made the ten water carts using the same casting, dimensions, and shape for all of them.
1KI.7.38	Then he made ten bronze basins
1KI.7.39	He set five water carts on the right side of the temple and five on the left side. He put the basin near the right side of the temple toward the southeast.
1KI.7.40	Then Hiram made
1KI.7.40	So Hiram finished all the work that he was doing for King Solomon on the 
1KI.7.41	two pillars;
1KI.7.42	the four hundred pomegranates for the two gratings (two rows of pomegranates for each grating covering both capitals’ bowls on top of the pillars
1KI.7.43	the ten water carts;
1KI.7.44	the basin;
1KI.7.45	and the pots, shovels, and sprinkling basins.
1KI.7.46	The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth
1KI.7.47	Solomon left all the utensils unweighed because there were so many; the weight of the bronze was not determined.
1KI.7.48	Solomon also made all the equipment in the 
1KI.7.49	the pure gold lampstands in front of the inner sanctuary, five on the right and five on the left;
1KI.7.50	the pure gold ceremonial bowls, wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, ladles,
1KI.7.51	So all the work King Solomon did in the 
1KI.8.1	At that time Solomon assembled the elders
1KI.8.2	So all the men of Israel were assembled in the presence of King Solomon in the month of Ethanim, which is the seventh month,
1KI.8.3	All the elders
1KI.8.4	The priests and the Levites brought the ark of the 
1KI.8.5	King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel, who had gathered around him and were with him in front of the ark, were sacrificing sheep, goats, and cattle that could not be counted or numbered, because there were so many.
1KI.8.6	The priests brought the ark of the 
1KI.8.7	For the cherubim were spreading their wings over
1KI.8.8	The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen from outside the sanctuary; they are still there today.
1KI.8.9	Nothing was in the ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had put there at Horeb,
1KI.8.10	When the priests came out of the holy place, the cloud filled the 
1KI.8.11	and because of the cloud, the priests were not able to continue ministering, for the glory
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon said:
1KI.8.12	The 
1KI.8.13	I have indeed built an exalted temple
1KI.8.13	a place for your dwelling forever.
1KI.8.14	The king turned around and blessed
1KI.8.15	He said:
1KI.8.15	Blessed be the 
1KI.8.15	He spoke directly to my father David,
1KI.8.15	and he has fulfilled the promise
1KI.8.15	He said,
1KI.8.16	“Since the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt,
1KI.8.16	I have not chosen a city to build a temple in
1KI.8.16	among any of the tribes of Israel,
1KI.8.16	so that my name
1KI.8.16	But I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.”
1KI.8.17	My father David had his heart set
1KI.8.17	on building a temple for the name of the 
1KI.8.18	But the 
1KI.8.18	“Since your heart was set on building a temple for my name,
1KI.8.18	you have done well to have this desire.
1KI.8.19	Yet you are not the one to build it;
1KI.8.19	instead, your son, your own offspring,
1KI.8.19	will build it for my name.”
1KI.8.20	The 
1KI.8.20	I have taken the place of my father David,
1KI.8.20	and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the 
1KI.8.20	I have built the temple for the name of the 
1KI.8.21	I have provided a place there for the ark,
1KI.8.21	where the 
1KI.8.21	that he made with our ancestors
1KI.8.21	when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood
1KI.8.23	He said:
1KI.8.23	there is no God like you
1KI.8.23	in heaven above or on earth below,
1KI.8.23	who keeps the gracious covenant
1KI.8.23	with your servants who walk before you
1KI.8.23	with all their heart.
1KI.8.24	You have kept what you promised
1KI.8.24	to your servant, my father David.
1KI.8.24	You spoke directly to him
1KI.8.24	and you fulfilled your promise by your power
1KI.8.24	as it is today.
1KI.8.25	Therefore, 
1KI.8.25	keep what you promised
1KI.8.25	to your servant, my father David:
1KI.8.25	You will never fail to have a man
1KI.8.25	to sit before me on the throne of Israel,
1KI.8.25	if only your sons take care to walk before me
1KI.8.25	as you have walked before me.
1KI.8.26	Now 
1KI.8.26	please confirm what you promised
1KI.8.26	to your servant, my father David.
1KI.8.27	But will God indeed live on earth?
1KI.8.27	Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain you,
1KI.8.27	much less this temple I have built.
1KI.8.28	Listen
1KI.8.28	so that you may hear the cry and the prayer
1KI.8.28	that your servant prays before you today,
1KI.8.29	so that your eyes may watch over this temple night and day,
1KI.8.29	toward the place where you said,
1KI.8.29	“My name will be there,”
1KI.8.29	and so that you may hear the prayer
1KI.8.29	that your servant prays toward this place.
1KI.8.30	Hear the petition of your servant
1KI.8.30	and your people Israel,
1KI.8.30	which they pray toward this place.
1KI.8.30	May you hear in your dwelling place in heaven.
1KI.8.30	May you hear and forgive.
1KI.8.31	When a man sins against his neighbor
1KI.8.31	and is forced to take an oath,
1KI.8.31	and he comes to take an oath
1KI.8.31	before your altar in this temple,
1KI.8.32	may you hear in heaven and act.
1KI.8.32	May you judge your servants,
1KI.8.32	condemning the wicked man by bringing
1KI.8.32	what he has done on his own head
1KI.8.32	and providing justice for the righteous
1KI.8.32	by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
1KI.8.33	When your people Israel are defeated before an enemy,
1KI.8.33	because they have sinned against you,
1KI.8.33	and they return to you and praise your name,
1KI.8.33	and they pray and plead with you
1KI.8.33	for mercy in this temple,
1KI.8.34	may you hear in heaven
1KI.8.34	and forgive the sin of your people Israel.
1KI.8.34	May you restore them to the land
1KI.8.34	you gave their ancestors.
1KI.8.35	When the skies are shut and there is no rain,
1KI.8.35	because they have sinned against you,
1KI.8.35	and they pray toward this place
1KI.8.35	and praise your name,
1KI.8.35	and they turn from their sins
1KI.8.35	because you are afflicting them,
1KI.8.36	may you hear in heaven
1KI.8.36	and forgive the sin of your servants
1KI.8.36	and your people Israel,

1KI.8.36	May you send rain on your land

1KI.8.37	When there is famine in the land,
1KI.8.37	when there is pestilence,
1KI.8.37	when there is blight or mildew, locust or grasshopper,
1KI.8.37	when their enemy besieges them

1KI.8.38	every prayer or petition
1KI.8.38	that any person or that all your people Israel may have —
1KI.8.38	they each know their own affliction
1KI.8.38	as they spread out their hands toward this temple,
1KI.8.39	may you hear in heaven, your dwelling place,
1KI.8.39	and may you forgive, act, and give to everyone
1KI.8.39	according to all their ways, since you know each heart,
1KI.8.39	for you alone know every human heart,
1KI.8.40	so that they may fear
1KI.8.40	all the days they live on the land
1KI.8.40	you gave our ancestors.
1KI.8.41	Even for the foreigner who is not of your people Israel
1KI.8.41	but has come from a distant land

1KI.8.42	strong hand,

1KI.8.48	in the land of their enemies who took them captive,
1KI.8.48	and when they pray to you in the direction of their land
1KI.8.48	that you gave their ancestors,

1KI.8.50	so that they may treat them compassionately.
1KI.8.51	For they are your people and your inheritance;
1KI.8.51	you brought them out of Egypt,
1KI.8.51	out of the middle of an iron furnace.
1KI.8.52	May your eyes be open to your servant’s petition
1KI.8.52	and to the petition of your people Israel,
1KI.8.52	listening to them whenever they call to you.
1KI.8.53	For you, Lord 
1KI.8.53	from all peoples of the earth,
1KI.8.53	as you spoke through your servant Moses
1KI.8.53	when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt.
1KI.8.54	When Solomon finished praying this entire prayer and petition to the 
1KI.8.55	and he stood and blessed the whole congregation of Israel
1KI.8.56	“Blessed be the 
1KI.8.57	May the 
1KI.8.58	so that he causes us to be devoted
1KI.8.59	May my words with which I have made my petition before the 
1KI.8.60	May all the peoples of the earth know that the 
1KI.8.61	Be wholeheartedly devoted to the 
1KI.8.62	The king and all Israel with him were offering sacrifices in the 
1KI.8.63	Solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the 
1KI.8.64	On the same day, the king consecrated the middle of the courtyard that was in front of the 
1KI.8.65	Solomon and all Israel with him — a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath
1KI.8.66	On the fifteenth day
1KI.9.1	When Solomon finished building the temple of the 
1KI.9.2	the 
1KI.9.3	The 
1KI.9.3	I have heard your prayer and petition you have made before me. I have consecrated this temple you have built, to put
1KI.9.4	As for you, if you walk before me as your father David walked, with a heart of integrity and in what is right, doing everything I have commanded you, and if you keep my statutes and ordinances,
1KI.9.5	I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised your father David: You will never fail to have a man on the throne of Israel.
1KI.9.6	If you or your sons turn away from following me and do not keep my commands — my statutes that I have set before you — and if you go and serve other gods and bow in worship to them,
1KI.9.7	I will cut off Israel from the land I gave them,
1KI.9.8	Though this temple is now exalted,
1KI.9.9	Then they will say: Because they abandoned the 
1KI.9.10	At the end of twenty years during which Solomon had built the two houses, the 
1KI.9.11	King Hiram of Tyre
1KI.9.12	So Hiram went out from Tyre to look over the towns that Solomon had given him, but he was not pleased with them. 
1KI.9.13	So he said, “What are these towns you’ve given me, my brother?” So he called them the Land of Cabul,
1KI.9.14	Now Hiram had sent the king nine thousand pounds
1KI.9.15	This is the account of the forced labor
1KI.9.16	Pharaoh king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. He then burned it, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and gave it as a dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
1KI.9.17	Then Solomon rebuilt Gezer, Lower Beth-horon,
1KI.9.18	Baalath,
1KI.9.19	all the storage cities that belonged to Solomon, the chariot cities,
1KI.9.20	As for all the peoples who remained of the Amorites, Hethites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not Israelites —  
1KI.9.21	their descendants who remained in the land after them, those whom the Israelites were unable to destroy completely
1KI.9.22	But Solomon did not consign the Israelites to slavery;
1KI.9.23	These were the deputies
1KI.9.24	Pharaoh’s daughter moved from the city of David
1KI.9.25	Three times a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the 
1KI.9.26	King Solomon put together a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber,
1KI.9.27	With the fleet, Hiram sent his servants, experienced seamen, along with Solomon’s servants. 
1KI.9.28	They went to Ophir
1KI.10.1	The queen of Sheba
1KI.10.2	She came to Jerusalem with a very large entourage, with camels bearing
1KI.10.3	So Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for the king to explain to her. 
1KI.10.4	When the queen of Sheba observed all of Solomon’s wisdom, the palace he had built,
1KI.10.5	the food at his table,
1KI.10.6	She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and about your wisdom is true. 
1KI.10.7	But I didn’t believe the reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, I was not even told half. Your wisdom and prosperity far exceed the report I heard.
1KI.10.8	How happy are your men.
1KI.10.9	Blessed be the 
1KI.10.10	Then she gave the king four and a half tons
1KI.10.11	In addition, Hiram’s fleet that carried gold from Ophir brought from Ophir a large quantity of almug
1KI.10.12	The king made the almug wood into steps for the 
1KI.10.13	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba her every desire — whatever she asked — besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty. Then she, along with her servants, returned to her own country.
1KI.10.14	The weight
1KI.10.15	besides what came from merchants,
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; fifteen pounds
1KI.10.17	He made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; nearly four pounds
1KI.10.18	The king also made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with fine gold. 
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps; there was a rounded top at the back of the throne, armrests on either side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests. 
1KI.10.20	Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps, one at each end. Nothing like it had ever been made in any other kingdom.
1KI.10.21	All of King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon
1KI.10.22	for the king had ships of Tarshish
1KI.10.23	King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the world in riches and in wisdom.
1KI.10.24	The whole world wanted an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom that God had put in his heart.
1KI.10.25	Every man would bring his annual tribute: items
1KI.10.26	Solomon accumulated 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen
1KI.10.27	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones,
1KI.10.28	Solomon’s horses were imported from Egypt and Kue.
1KI.10.29	A chariot was imported from Egypt for fifteen pounds
1KI.11.1	King Solomon loved many foreign women in addition to Pharaoh’s daughter:
1KI.11.2	from the nations about which the 
1KI.11.3	He had seven hundred wives who were princesses and three hundred who were concubines,
1KI.11.4	When Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart away to follow other gods. He was not wholeheartedly devoted to the 
1KI.11.5	Solomon followed Ashtoreth,
1KI.11.6	Solomon did what was evil in the 
1KI.11.7	At that time, Solomon built a high place
1KI.11.8	He did the same for all his foreign wives, who were burning incense and offering sacrifices to their gods.
1KI.11.9	The 
1KI.11.10	He had commanded him about this, so that he would not follow other gods, but Solomon did not do what the 
1KI.11.11	Then the 
1KI.11.12	However, I will not do it during your lifetime for the sake of your father David;
1KI.11.13	Yet I will not tear the entire kingdom away from him. I will give one tribe to your son
1KI.11.14	So the 
1KI.11.15	Earlier, when David was in Edom, Joab, the commander of the army, had gone to bury the dead and had struck down every male in Edom. 
1KI.11.16	For Joab and all Israel had remained there six months, until he had killed every male in Edom.
1KI.11.17	Hadad fled to Egypt, along with some Edomites from his father’s servants. At the time Hadad was a small boy. 
1KI.11.18	Hadad and his men set out from Midian and went to Paran.
1KI.11.19	Pharaoh liked Hadad so much
1KI.11.20	Tahpenes’s sister gave birth to Hadad’s son Genubath. Tahpenes herself weaned him in Pharaoh’s palace, and Genubath lived there along with Pharaoh’s sons.
1KI.11.21	When Hadad heard in Egypt that David rested with his fathers and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “Let me leave, so I may go to my own country.”
1KI.11.22	But Pharaoh asked him, “What do you lack here with me for you to want to go back to your own country?”
1KI.11.22	“Nothing,” he replied, “but please let me leave.”
1KI.11.23	God raised up Rezon son of Eliada as an enemy
1KI.11.24	and gathered men to himself. He became leader of a raiding party when David killed the Zobaites. He
1KI.11.25	Rezon was Israel’s enemy throughout Solomon’s reign, adding to the trouble Hadad had caused. He reigned over Aram
1KI.11.26	Now Solomon’s servant,
1KI.11.27	and this is the reason he rebelled against the king: Solomon had built the supporting terraces
1KI.11.28	Now the man Jeroboam was capable, and Solomon noticed the young man because he was getting things done. So he appointed him over the entire labor force of the house of Joseph.
1KI.11.29	During that time, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite
1KI.11.30	Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he had on, tore it into twelve pieces,
1KI.11.31	and said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces for yourself, for this is what the 
1KI.11.32	but one tribe will remain his for the sake of my servant David
1KI.11.33	For they have abandoned me; they have bowed down to Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, to Chemosh, the god of Moab, and to Milcom, the god of the Ammonites.
1KI.11.34	“‘However, I will not take the whole kingdom from him but will let him be ruler all the days of his life for the sake of my servant David, whom I chose and who kept my commands and my statutes. 
1KI.11.35	I will take ten tribes of the kingdom from his son and give them to you. 
1KI.11.36	I will give one tribe
1KI.11.37	I will appoint you,
1KI.11.38	“‘After that, if you obey all I command you, walk in my ways, and do what is right in my sight in order to keep my statutes and my commands as my servant David did, I will be with you.
1KI.11.39	I will humble David’s descendants, because of their unfaithfulness, but not forever.’”
1KI.11.40	Therefore, Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam,
1KI.11.41	The rest of the events of Solomon’s reign, along with all his accomplishments and his wisdom, are written in the Book of Solomon’s Events.
1KI.11.42	The length of Solomon’s reign in Jerusalem over all Israel totaled forty years.
1KI.11.43	Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam
1KI.12.1	Then Rehoboam
1KI.12.2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about it, he stayed in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon’s presence.
1KI.12.3	But they summoned him, and Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam: 
1KI.12.4	“Your father made our yoke harsh.
1KI.12.5	Rehoboam replied, “Go away for three days and then return to me.” So the people left. 
1KI.12.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders
1KI.12.7	They replied, “Today if you will be a servant to this people and serve them, and if you respond to them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.”
1KI.12.8	But he rejected the advice of the elders who had advised him
1KI.12.9	He asked them, “What message do you advise that we send back to this people who said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”
1KI.12.10	Then the young men who had grown up with him told him, “This is what you should say to this people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you, make it lighter on us! ’ This is what you should tell them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! 
1KI.12.11	Although my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with barbed whips.’”
1KI.12.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had ordered: “Return to me on the third day.” 
1KI.12.13	Then the king answered the people harshly. He rejected the advice the elders had given him 
1KI.12.14	and spoke to them according to the young men’s advice: “My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with barbed whips.”
1KI.12.15	The king did not listen to the people, because this turn of events came from the 
1KI.12.16	When all Israel saw that the king had not listened to them, the people answered him:
1KI.12.16	What portion do we have in David?
1KI.12.16	We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.
1KI.12.16	Israel, return to your tents;
1KI.12.16	David, now look after your own house!
1KI.12.16	So Israel went to their tents, 
1KI.12.17	but Rehoboam reigned over the Israelites living in the cities of Judah.
1KI.12.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram,
1KI.12.19	Israel is still in rebellion against the house of David today.
1KI.12.20	When all Israel heard that Jeroboam had come back,
1KI.12.21	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem,
1KI.12.22	But the word of God came to Shemaiah,
1KI.12.23	“Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, to the whole house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, 
1KI.12.24	‘This is what the 
1KI.12.24	So they listened to the word of the 
1KI.12.25	Jeroboam built Shechem
1KI.12.26	Jeroboam said to himself, “The kingdom might now return to the house of David.
1KI.12.27	If these people regularly go to offer sacrifices in the 
1KI.12.28	So the king sought advice.
1KI.12.28	Then he made two golden calves, and he said to the people, “Going to Jerusalem is too difficult for you. Israel, here are your gods
1KI.12.29	He set up one in Bethel,
1KI.12.30	This led to sin;
1KI.12.31	Jeroboam also made shrines
1KI.12.32	Jeroboam made a festival in the eighth month on the fifteenth day of the month, like the festival in Judah.
1KI.12.33	He offered sacrifices on
1KI.13.1	A man of God
1KI.13.2	The man of God cried out against the altar by the word of the 
1KI.13.3	He gave a sign
1KI.13.4	When the king heard the message that the man of God had cried out against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar and said, “Arrest him!” But the hand he stretched out against him withered, and he could not pull it back to himself. 
1KI.13.5	The altar was ripped apart, and the ashes poured from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the 
1KI.13.6	Then the king responded to the man of God, “Plead for the favor of the 
1KI.13.7	Then the king declared to the man of God, “Come home with me, refresh yourself, and I’ll give you a reward.”
1KI.13.8	But the man of God replied, “If you were to give me half your house,
1KI.13.9	for this is what I was commanded by the word of the 
1KI.13.10	So he went another way; he did not go back by the way he had come to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now a certain old prophet was living in Bethel.
1KI.13.12	Then their father asked them, “Which way did he go?” His sons had seen
1KI.13.13	Then he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him, and he got on it. 
1KI.13.14	He followed the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree. He asked him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”
1KI.13.14	“I am,” he said.
1KI.13.15	Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat some food.”
1KI.13.16	But he answered, “I cannot go back with you or accompany you; I will not eat food or drink water with you in this place. 
1KI.13.17	For a message came to me by the word of the 
1KI.13.18	He said to him, “I am also a prophet
1KI.13.19	and the man of God went back with him, ate food in his house, and drank water.
1KI.13.20	While they were sitting at the table, the word of the 
1KI.13.21	and the prophet cried out to the man of God who had come from Judah, “This is what the 
1KI.13.22	but you went back and ate food and drank water in the place that he said to you, “Do not eat food and do not drink water”
1KI.13.23	So after he had eaten food and after he had drunk, the old prophet saddled the donkey for the prophet he had brought back. 
1KI.13.24	When he left,
1KI.13.25	There were men passing by who saw the corpse thrown on the road and the lion standing beside it, and they went and spoke about it in the city where the old prophet lived. 
1KI.13.26	When the prophet who had brought him back from his way heard about it, he said, “He is the man of God who disobeyed the 
1KI.13.27	Then the old prophet instructed his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” They saddled it,
1KI.13.28	and he went and found the corpse thrown on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside the corpse. The lion had not eaten the corpse or mauled the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	So the prophet lifted the corpse of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back. The old prophet came into the city to mourn and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	Then he laid the corpse in his own grave,
1KI.13.31	After he had buried him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones, 
1KI.13.32	for the message that he cried out by the word of the 
1KI.13.33	Even after this,
1KI.13.34	This was the sin that caused the house of Jeroboam to be cut off and obliterated from the face of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah son of Jeroboam became sick.
1KI.14.2	Jeroboam said to his wife, “Go disguise yourself,
1KI.14.3	Take with you ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey,
1KI.14.4	Jeroboam’s wife did that: she went to Shiloh and arrived at Ahijah’s house. Ahijah could not see; he was blind
1KI.14.5	But the 
1KI.14.6	When Ahijah heard the sound of her feet entering the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you disguised?
1KI.14.7	Go tell Jeroboam, ‘This is what the 
1KI.14.8	tore the kingdom away from the house of David, and gave it to you.
1KI.14.9	You behaved more wickedly than all who were before you.
1KI.14.10	Because of all this, I am about to bring disaster on the house of Jeroboam:
1KI.14.10	I will wipe out all of Jeroboam’s males,
1KI.14.10	both slave and free,
1KI.14.10	I will sweep away the house of Jeroboam
1KI.14.10	as one sweeps away dung until it is all gone!
1KI.14.11	Anyone who belongs to Jeroboam and dies in the city,
1KI.14.11	the dogs will eat,
1KI.14.11	and anyone who dies in the field,
1KI.14.11	the birds
1KI.14.11	for the 
1KI.14.12	“As for you, get up and go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the boy will die.
1KI.14.13	All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He alone out of Jeroboam’s house will be given a proper burial because out of the house of Jeroboam something favorable to the 
1KI.14.14	The 
1KI.14.15	For the 
1KI.14.16	He will give up Israel because of Jeroboam’s sins that he committed and caused Israel to commit.”
1KI.14.17	Then Jeroboam’s wife got up and left and went to Tirzah.
1KI.14.18	He was buried, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the 
1KI.14.19	As for the rest of the events of Jeroboam’s reign, how he waged war
1KI.14.20	The length of Jeroboam’s reign was twenty-two years. He rested with his fathers, and his son Nadab became king in his place.
1KI.14.21	Now Rehoboam, Solomon’s son, reigned in Judah.
1KI.14.22	Judah did what was evil in the 
1KI.14.23	They also built for themselves high places,
1KI.14.24	there were even male cult prostitutes in the land.

1KI.17.8	Then the word of the 
1KI.17.9	“Get up, go to Zarephath
1KI.17.10	So Elijah got up and went to Zarephath. When he arrived at the city gate, there was a widow gathering wood. Elijah called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a cup and let me drink.”
1KI.17.11	As she went to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a piece of bread in your hand.”
1KI.17.12	But she said, “As the 
1KI.17.13	Then Elijah said to her, “Don’t be afraid; go and do as you have said. But first make me a small loaf from it and bring it out to me. Afterward, you may make some for yourself and your son, 
1KI.17.14	for this is what the 
1KI.17.15	So she proceeded to do according to the word of Elijah. Then the woman, Elijah, and her household ate for many days.
1KI.17.16	The flour jar did not become empty, and the oil jug did not run dry, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.17	After this, the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. His illness got worse until he stopped breathing.
1KI.17.18	She said to Elijah, “Man of God,
1KI.17.19	But Elijah said to her, “Give me your son.” So he took him from her arms, brought him up to the upstairs room
1KI.17.20	Then he cried out to the 
1KI.17.21	Then he stretched himself out over the boy three times.
1KI.17.22	So the 
1KI.17.23	Then Elijah took the boy, brought him down from the upstairs room into the house, and gave him to his mother.
1KI.17.24	Then the woman said to Elijah, “Now I know you are a man of God
1KI.18.1	After a long time, the word of the 
1KI.18.2	So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab.
1KI.18.2	The famine was severe in Samaria.
1KI.18.3	Ahab called for Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace.
1KI.18.4	and took a hundred prophets and hid them, fifty men to a cave, and provided them with food and water when Jezebel
1KI.18.5	Ahab said to Obadiah, “Go throughout the land to every spring and to every wadi. Perhaps we’ll find grass so we can keep the horses and mules alive and not have to destroy any cattle.”
1KI.18.6	They divided the land between them in order to cover it. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went the other way by himself.
1KI.18.7	While Obadiah was walking along the road, Elijah suddenly met him.
1KI.18.8	“It is I,” he replied. “Go tell your lord, ‘Elijah is here!’” 
1KI.18.9	But Obadiah said, “What sin have I committed,
1KI.18.10	As the 
1KI.18.11	“Now you say, ‘Go tell your lord, “Elijah is here!”’ 
1KI.18.12	But when I leave you, the Spirit of the 
1KI.18.13	Wasn’t it reported to my lord what I did when Jezebel slaughtered the 
1KI.18.14	Now you say, ‘Go tell your lord, “Elijah is here!” ’ He will kill me!”
1KI.18.15	Then Elijah said, “As the 
1KI.18.16	Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him. Then Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
1KI.18.17	When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, “Is that you, the one ruining Israel?” 
1KI.18.18	He replied, “I have not ruined Israel, but you and your father’s family have, because you have abandoned the 
1KI.18.19	Now summon all Israel to meet me at Mount Carmel,
1KI.18.20	So Ahab summoned all the Israelites and gathered the prophets at Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	Then Elijah approached all the people and said, “How long will you waver between two opinions?
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah said to the people, “I am the only remaining prophet of the 
1KI.18.23	Let two bulls be given to us. They are to choose one bull for themselves, cut it in pieces, and place it on the wood but not light the fire. I will prepare the other bull and place it on the wood but not light the fire. 
1KI.18.24	Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the 
1KI.18.24	All the people answered, “That’s fine.”
1KI.18.25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “Since you are so numerous, choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first. Then call on the name of your god but don’t light the fire.”
1KI.18.26	So they took the bull that he gave them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, “Baal, answer us!” But there was no sound;
1KI.18.27	At noon Elijah mocked them. He said, “Shout loudly, for he’s a god! Maybe he’s thinking it over; maybe he has wandered away;
1KI.18.28	They shouted loudly, and cut themselves
1KI.18.29	All afternoon they kept on raving until the offering of the evening sacrifice,
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Come near me.” So all the people approached him. Then he repaired the 
1KI.18.31	Elijah took twelve stones — according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the 
1KI.18.32	and he built an altar
1KI.18.33	Next, he arranged the wood, cut up the bull, and placed it on the wood. He said, “Fill four water pots with water and pour it on the offering to be burned and on the wood.” 
1KI.18.34	Then he said, “A second time!” and they did it a second time. And then he said, “A third time!” and they did it a third time. 
1KI.18.35	So the water ran all around the altar; he even filled the trench with water.
1KI.18.36	At the time for offering the evening sacrifice,
1KI.18.37	Answer me, 
1KI.18.38	Then the 
1KI.18.39	When all the people saw it, they fell facedown
1KI.18.40	Then Elijah ordered them, “Seize the prophets of Baal!
1KI.18.41	Elijah said to Ahab, “Go up, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a rainstorm.”
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went to eat and drink, but Elijah went up to the summit of Carmel.
1KI.18.43	Then he said to his servant, “Go up and look toward the sea.”
1KI.18.43	So he went up, looked, and said, “There’s nothing.”
1KI.18.43	Seven times Elijah said, “Go back.”
1KI.18.44	On the seventh
1KI.18.44	Then Elijah said, “Go and tell Ahab, ‘Get your chariot ready and go down so the rain doesn’t stop you.’”
1KI.18.45	In a little while, the sky grew dark with clouds and wind, and there was a downpour. So Ahab got in his chariot and went to Jezreel.
1KI.18.46	The power of the 
1KI.19.1	Ahab told Jezebel
1KI.19.2	So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “May the gods punish me and do so severely
1KI.19.3	Then Elijah became afraid
1KI.19.4	but he went on a day’s journey into the wilderness. He sat down under a broom tree
1KI.19.5	Then he lay down and slept under the broom tree.
1KI.19.5	Suddenly, an angel touched him.
1KI.19.6	Then he looked, and there at his head was a loaf of bread baked over hot stones, and a jug of water.
1KI.19.7	Then the angel of the 
1KI.19.8	So he got up, ate, and drank. Then on the strength from that food, he walked forty days and forty nights
1KI.19.9	He entered a cave
1KI.19.9	Suddenly, the word of the 
1KI.19.10	He replied, “I have been very zealous
1KI.19.11	Then he said, “Go out and stand on the mountain in the 
1KI.19.11	At that moment, the 
1KI.19.12	After the earthquake there was a fire,
1KI.19.13	When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his mantle
1KI.19.13	Suddenly, a voice came to him and said, “What are you doing here, Elijah?”
1KI.19.14	“I have been very zealous for the 
1KI.19.15	Then the 
1KI.19.16	You are to anoint Jehu
1KI.19.17	Then Jehu will put to death whoever escapes the sword of Hazael,
1KI.19.18	But I will leave seven thousand in Israel
1KI.19.19	Elijah left there and found Elisha
1KI.19.20	Elisha left the oxen, ran to follow Elijah, and said, “Please let me kiss my father and mother, and then I will follow you.”
1KI.19.20	“Go on back,” he replied, “for what have I done to you?”
1KI.19.21	So he turned back from following him, took the team of oxen, and slaughtered
1KI.20.1	Now King Ben-hadad
1KI.20.2	He sent messengers into the city to King Ahab of Israel and said to him, “This is what Ben-hadad says: 
1KI.20.3	‘Your silver and your gold are mine! And your best wives and children are mine as well!’” 
1KI.20.4	Then the king of Israel answered, “Just as you say, my lord the king: I am yours, along with all that I have.”
1KI.20.5	The messengers then returned and said, “This is what Ben-hadad says: ‘I have sent messengers to you, saying: You are to give me your silver, your gold, your wives, and your children. 
1KI.20.6	But at this time tomorrow I will send my servants to you,
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called for all the elders of the land and said, “Recognize
1KI.20.8	All the elders and all the people said to him, “Don’t listen or agree.”
1KI.20.9	So he said to Ben-hadad’s messengers, “Say to my lord the king, ‘Everything you demanded of your servant the first time, I will do, but this thing I cannot do.’” So the messengers left and took word back to him.
1KI.20.10	Then Ben-hadad sent messengers to him and said, “May the gods punish me and do so severely
1KI.20.11	The king of Israel answered, “Say this: ‘Don’t let the one who puts on his armor boast
1KI.20.12	When Ben-hadad heard this response, while he and the kings were drinking
1KI.20.13	A prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and said, “This is what the 
1KI.20.14	Ahab asked, “By whom?”
1KI.20.14	And the prophet said, “This is what the 
1KI.20.14	Then he asked, “Who is to start the battle?” 
1KI.20.14	He said, “You.”
1KI.20.15	So Ahab mobilized the young men of the provincial leaders, and there were 232. After them he mobilized all the Israelite troops: 7,000.
1KI.20.16	They marched out at noon while Ben-hadad and the thirty-two kings
1KI.20.17	The young men of the provincial leaders marched out first. Then Ben-hadad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, saying, “Men are marching out of Samaria.”
1KI.20.18	So he said, “If they have marched out in peace,
1KI.20.19	The young men of the provincial leaders and the army behind them marched out from the city, 
1KI.20.20	and each one struck down his opponent.
1KI.20.21	Then the king of Israel marched out and attacked the cavalry and the chariots. He inflicted a severe slaughter on Aram.
1KI.20.22	The prophet approached the king of Israel and said to him, “Go and strengthen yourself, then consider carefully
1KI.20.23	Now the king of Aram’s servants said to him, “Their gods are gods of the hill country.
1KI.20.24	Also do this: remove each king from his position and appoint captains in their place. 
1KI.20.25	Raise another army for yourself like the army you lost — horse for horse, chariot for chariot — and let’s fight with them on the plain; and we will certainly be stronger than they are.” The king listened to them and did it.
1KI.20.26	In the spring, Ben-hadad mobilized the Arameans and went up to Aphek
1KI.20.27	The Israelites mobilized, gathered supplies, and went to fight them. The Israelites camped in front of them like two little flocks of goats, while the Arameans filled the landscape.
1KI.20.28	Then the man of God
1KI.20.29	They camped opposite each other for seven days. On the seventh day,
1KI.20.30	The ones who remained fled into the city of Aphek, and the wall fell on those twenty-seven thousand remaining men.
1KI.20.30	Ben-hadad also fled and went into an inner room
1KI.20.31	His servants said to him, “Consider this: we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. So let’s put sackcloth around our waists
1KI.20.32	So they dressed with sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads, went to the king of Israel, and said, “Your servant Ben-hadad says, ‘Please spare my life.’”
1KI.20.32	So he said, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
1KI.20.33	Now the men were looking for a sign of hope, so they quickly picked up on this
1KI.20.33	Then he said, “Go and bring him.”
1KI.20.33	So Ben-hadad came out to him, and Ahab had him come up into the chariot. 
1KI.20.34	Then Ben-hadad said to him, “I restore to you the cities that my father took from your father,
1KI.20.34	Ahab responded, “On the basis of this treaty, I release you.” So he made a treaty with him and released him.
1KI.20.35	One of the sons of the prophets
1KI.20.36	He told him, “Because you did not listen to the 
1KI.20.37	The prophet found another man and said to him, “Strike me!” So the man struck him, inflicting a wound. 
1KI.20.38	Then the prophet went and waited for the king on the road. He disguised
1KI.20.39	As the king was passing by, he cried out to the king and said, “Your servant marched out into the middle of the battle. Suddenly, a man turned aside and brought someone to me and said, ‘Guard this man! If he is ever missing, it will be your life in place of his life,
1KI.20.40	But while your servant was busy here and there, he disappeared.”
1KI.20.40	The king of Israel said to him, “That will be your sentence; you yourself have decided it.”
1KI.20.41	He quickly removed the bandage from his eyes. The king of Israel recognized that he was one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	The prophet said to him, “This is what the 
1KI.20.43	The king of Israel left for home resentful and angry,
1KI.21.1	Some time passed after these events. Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard; it was in Jezreel
1KI.21.2	So Ahab spoke to Naboth, saying, “Give me your vineyard
1KI.21.3	But Naboth said to Ahab, “I will never give my fathers’ inheritance
1KI.21.4	So Ahab went to his palace resentful and angry
1KI.21.5	Then his wife Jezebel came to him and said to him, “Why are you so upset that you refuse to eat?”
1KI.21.6	“Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite,” he replied. “I told him: Give me your vineyard for silver, or if you wish, I will give you a vineyard in its place. But he said, ‘I won’t give you my vineyard! ’”
1KI.21.7	Then his wife Jezebel said to him, “Now, exercise your royal power over Israel. Get up, eat some food, and be happy. For I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.”
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters
1KI.21.9	In the letters, she wrote:
1KI.21.9	Proclaim a fast
1KI.21.10	Then seat two wicked men
1KI.21.11	The men of his city, the elders and nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them, just as it was written in the letters she had sent them. 
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the people. 
1KI.21.13	The two wicked men came in and sat opposite him. Then the wicked men testified against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, “Naboth has cursed God and the king!” So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones. 
1KI.21.14	Then they sent word to Jezebel: “Naboth has been stoned to death.”
1KI.21.15	When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she said to Ahab, “Get up and take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite who refused to give it to you for silver,
1KI.21.16	When Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, he got up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	Then the word of the 
1KI.21.18	“Get up and go to meet King Ahab of Israel,
1KI.21.19	Tell him, ‘This is what the 
1KI.21.20	Ahab said to Elijah, “So, my enemy, you’ve found me, have you?” 
1KI.21.20	He replied, “I have found you because you devoted
1KI.21.21	This is what the 
1KI.21.21	I will wipe out all of Ahab’s males,
1KI.21.21	both slave and free,
1KI.21.22	I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam
1KI.21.23	The 
1KI.21.24	Anyone who belongs to Ahab and dies in the city, the dogs will eat,
1KI.21.24	and anyone who dies in the field, the birds
1KI.21.25	Still, there was no one like Ahab, who devoted himself to do what was evil in the 
1KI.21.26	He committed the most detestable acts by following idols
1KI.21.27	When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes, put sackcloth over his body, and fasted. He lay down in sackcloth
1KI.21.28	Then the word of the 
1KI.21.29	“Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? I will not bring the disaster during his lifetime,
1KI.22.1	There was
1KI.22.2	However, in the third year, King Jehoshaphat
1KI.22.3	The king of Israel had said to his servants, “Don’t you know that Ramoth-gilead
1KI.22.4	So
1KI.22.4	Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, “I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
1KI.22.5	But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “First, please ask what the 
1KI.22.6	So the king of Israel gathered the prophets, about four hundred men,
1KI.22.6	They replied, “March up, and the Lord will hand it over to the king.”
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the 
1KI.22.8	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man who can inquire of the 
1KI.22.8	“The king shouldn’t say that!” Jehoshaphat replied.
1KI.22.9	So the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Hurry and get Micaiah son of Imlah!”
1KI.22.10	Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah,
1KI.22.11	Then Zedekiah
1KI.22.12	And all the prophets were prophesying the same: “March up to Ramoth-gilead
1KI.22.13	The messenger
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah said, “As the 
1KI.22.15	So he went to the king, and the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-gilead for war, or should we refrain?”
1KI.22.15	Micaiah told him, “March up and succeed. The 
1KI.22.16	But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the 
1KI.22.17	So Micaiah said:
1KI.22.17	I saw all Israel scattered on the hills
1KI.22.17	like sheep without a shepherd.
1KI.22.17	And the 
1KI.22.17	“They have no master;
1KI.22.17	let everyone return home in peace.”
1KI.22.18	So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster?”
1KI.22.19	Then Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the 
1KI.22.20	And the 
1KI.22.21	“Then a spirit came forward, stood in the 
1KI.22.22	“The 
1KI.22.22	“He said, ‘I will go and become a lying spirit
1KI.22.22	“Then he said, ‘You will certainly entice him and prevail.
1KI.22.23	“You see, the 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah
1KI.22.25	Micaiah replied, “You will soon see when you go to hide in an inner chamber on that day.”
1KI.22.26	Then the king of Israel ordered, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king’s son,
1KI.22.27	and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this guy in prison
1KI.22.28	But Micaiah said, “If you ever return safely, the 
1KI.22.29	Then
1KI.22.30	But the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise
1KI.22.31	Now the king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders,
1KI.22.32	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they shouted, “He must be the king of Israel!” So they turned to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out. 
1KI.22.33	When the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
1KI.22.34	But a man drew his bow
1KI.22.35	The battle raged throughout that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. He died that evening,
1KI.22.36	Then the cry rang out in the army as the sun set, declaring:
1KI.22.36	Each man to his own city,
1KI.22.36	and each man to his own land!
1KI.22.37	So the king died and was brought to Samaria. They buried the king in Samaria.
1KI.22.38	Then someone washed the chariot at the pool of Samaria. The dogs licked up his blood, and the prostitutes bathed in it, according to the word of the 
1KI.22.39	The rest of the events of Ahab’s reign, along with all his accomplishments, including the ivory palace
1KI.22.40	Ahab rested with his fathers,
1KI.22.41	Jehoshaphat
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king; he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	He walked in all the ways of his father Asa;
1KI.22.44	Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat’s reign, along with the might he exercised and how he waged war, are written in the Historical Record of Judah’s Kings.
1KI.22.46	He eradicated from the land the rest of the male cult prostitutes who were left from the days of his father Asa.
1KI.22.47	There was no king in Edom;
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish
1KI.22.49	At that time, Ahaziah
1KI.22.50	Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his ancestor David.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah
1KI.22.52	He did what was evil in the 
1KI.22.53	He served Baal and bowed in worship to him.
2KI.1.1	After Ahab’s death, Moab
2KI.1.2	Ahaziah
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Therefore, this is what the 
2KI.1.5	The messengers returned to the king, who asked them, “Why have you come back?”
2KI.1.6	They replied, “A man came to meet us and said, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and declare to him: This is what the 
2KI.1.7	The king asked them, “What sort of man came up to meet you and spoke those words to you?”
2KI.1.8	They replied, “A hairy man with a leather belt around his waist.”
2KI.1.8	He said, “It’s Elijah the Tishbite.”
2KI.1.9	So King Ahaziah sent a captain with his fifty men
2KI.1.10	Elijah responded to the captain, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” Then fire came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men.
2KI.1.11	So the king sent another captain with his fifty men to Elijah. He took in the situation
2KI.1.12	Elijah responded, “If I am a man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men.” So a divine fire
2KI.1.13	Then the king sent a third captain with his fifty men. The third captain went up and fell on his knees in front of Elijah and begged him, “Man of God,
2KI.1.14	Already fire has come down from heaven and consumed the first two captains with their companies, but this time let my life be precious to you.”
2KI.1.15	The angel of the 
2KI.1.16	Then Elijah said to King Ahaziah, “This is what the 
2KI.1.17	Ahaziah died according to the word of the 
2KI.1.18	The rest of the events of Ahaziah’s reign, along with his accomplishments, are written in the Historical Record of Israel’s Kings.
2KI.2.1	The time had come for the 
2KI.2.2	and Elijah said to Elisha,
2KI.2.2	But Elisha replied, “As the 
2KI.2.3	Then the sons of the prophets
2KI.2.3	He said, “Yes, I know. Be quiet.”
2KI.2.4	Elijah said to him, “Elisha, stay here; the 
2KI.2.4	But Elisha said, “As the 
2KI.2.5	Then the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho came up to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the 
2KI.2.5	He said, “Yes, I know. Be quiet.”
2KI.2.6	Elijah said to him, “Stay here; the 
2KI.2.6	But Elisha said, “As the 
2KI.2.7	Fifty men from the sons of the prophets came and stood observing them at a distance while the two of them stood by the Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	Elijah took his mantle,
2KI.2.9	When they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “Tell me what I can do for you before I am taken from you.”
2KI.2.9	So Elisha answered, “Please, let me inherit two shares of your spirit.”
2KI.2.10	Elijah replied, “You have asked for something difficult. If you see me being taken from you,
2KI.2.11	As they continued walking and talking, a chariot of fire with horses of fire
2KI.2.12	As Elisha watched, he kept crying out, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!” 
2KI.2.12	When he could see him no longer, he took hold of his own clothes, tore them in two,
2KI.2.13	picked up the mantle
2KI.2.14	He took the mantle Elijah had dropped, and he struck the water. “Where is the 
2KI.2.15	When the sons of the prophets from Jericho who were observing saw him, they said, “The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha.” They came to meet him and bowed down to the ground in front of him.
2KI.2.16	Then the sons of the prophets said to Elisha, “Since there are fifty strong men here with your servants, please let them go and search for your master. Maybe the Spirit of the 
2KI.2.16	He answered, “Don’t send them.”
2KI.2.17	However, they urged him to the point of embarrassment,
2KI.2.18	When they returned to him in Jericho
2KI.2.19	The men of the city said to Elisha, “My lord can see that even though the city’s location is good, the water is bad and the land unfruitful.”
2KI.2.20	He replied, “Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it.”
2KI.2.20	After they had brought him one, 
2KI.2.21	Elisha went out to the spring, threw salt in it,
2KI.2.22	Therefore, the water still remains healthy today according to the word that Elisha spoke.
2KI.2.23	From there Elisha went up to Bethel.
2KI.2.24	He turned around, looked at them, and cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel,
2KI.3.1	Joram son of Ahab became king over Israel in Samaria during the eighteenth year of Judah’s King Jehoshaphat, and he reigned twelve years.
2KI.3.2	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless, Joram clung to the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit.
2KI.3.4	King Mesha of Moab
2KI.3.5	but when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
2KI.3.6	So King Joram marched out from Samaria at that time and mobilized all Israel. 
2KI.3.7	Then he sent a message to King Jehoshaphat
2KI.3.7	Jehoshaphat said, “I will go. I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses.”
2KI.3.8	He asked, “Which route should we take?”
2KI.3.8	He replied, “The route of the Wilderness of Edom.”
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom
2KI.3.10	Then the king of Israel said, “Oh no, the 
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat said, “Isn’t there a prophet of the 
2KI.3.11	One of the servants of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat,
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat affirmed, “The word of the 
2KI.3.13	However, Elisha said to King Joram of Israel, “What do we have in common? Go to the prophets of your father and your mother!” 
2KI.3.13	But the king of Israel replied, “No, because it is the 
2KI.3.14	Elisha responded, “By the life of the 
2KI.3.15	Now, bring me a musician.”
2KI.3.15	While the musician played,
2KI.3.16	Then he said, “This is what the 
2KI.3.17	For the 
2KI.3.18	This is easy in the 
2KI.3.19	Then you will attack every fortified city and every choice city. You will cut down every good tree and stop up every spring. You will ruin every good piece of land with stones.”
2KI.3.20	About the time for the grain offering
2KI.3.21	All Moab had heard that the kings
2KI.3.22	When they got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water, and the Moabites saw that the water across from them was red like blood.
2KI.3.23	“This is blood!” they exclaimed. “The kings
2KI.3.24	However, when the Moabites came to Israel’s camp, the Israelites attacked them, and they fled from them. So Israel went into the land attacking the Moabites. 
2KI.3.25	They would destroy the cities, and each of them would throw a stone to cover every good piece of land. They would stop up every spring and cut down every good tree. This went on until only the buildings of Kir-hareseth
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took seven hundred swordsmen with him to try to break through to the king of Edom,
2KI.3.27	So he took his firstborn son,
2KI.4.1	One of the wives of the sons of the prophets
2KI.4.2	Elisha asked her, “What can I do for you? Tell me, what do you have in the house?”
2KI.4.2	She said, “Your servant has nothing in the house except a jar of oil.”
2KI.4.3	Then he said, “Go out and borrow empty containers from all your neighbors. Do not get just a few.
2KI.4.4	Then go in and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour oil into all these containers. Set the full ones to one side.” 
2KI.4.5	So she left.
2KI.4.5	After she had shut the door behind her and her sons, they kept bringing her containers, and she kept pouring.
2KI.4.6	When they were full, she said to her son, “Bring me another container.”
2KI.4.6	But he replied, “There aren’t any more.” Then the oil stopped.
2KI.4.7	She went and told the man of God,
2KI.4.8	One day Elisha went to Shunem.
2KI.4.9	Then she said to her husband, “I know that the one who often passes by here is a holy man of God, 
2KI.4.10	so let’s make a small, walled-in upper room and put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp there for him. Whenever he comes, he can stay there.”
2KI.4.11	One day he came there and stopped at the upstairs room to lie down. 
2KI.4.12	He ordered his attendant Gehazi,
2KI.4.13	Then he said to Gehazi, “Say to her, ‘Look, you’ve gone to all this trouble for us. What can we do for you?
2KI.4.13	She answered, “I am living among my own people.”
2KI.4.14	So he asked, “Then what should be done for her?”
2KI.4.14	Gehazi answered, “Well, she has no son, and her husband is old.”
2KI.4.15	“Call her,” Elisha said. So Gehazi called her, and she stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	Elisha said, “At this time next year you will have a son in your arms.”
2KI.4.16	Then she said, “No, my lord. Man of God, do not lie to your servant.”
2KI.4.17	The woman conceived and gave birth to a son at the same time the following year, as Elisha had promised her.
2KI.4.18	The child grew and one day went out to his father and the harvesters.
2KI.4.19	Suddenly he complained to his father, “My head! My head!”
2KI.4.19	His father told his servant, “Carry him to his mother.” 
2KI.4.20	So he picked him up and took him to his mother. The child sat on her lap until noon and then died. 
2KI.4.21	She went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, shut him in, and left.
2KI.4.22	She summoned her husband and said, “Please send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys, so I can hurry to the man of God and come back again.”
2KI.4.23	But he said, “Why go to him today? It’s not a New Moon or a Sabbath.”
2KI.4.23	She replied, “Everything is all right.”
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Go fast; don’t slow the pace for me unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	So she came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.
2KI.4.25	When the man of God saw her at a distance, he said to his attendant Gehazi,
2KI.4.26	Run out to meet her and ask, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your son all right? ’”
2KI.4.26	And she answered, “Everything’s all right.”
2KI.4.27	When she came up to the man of God at the mountain, she clung to his feet.
2KI.4.28	Then she said, “Did I ask my lord for a son? Didn’t I say, ‘Do not lie to me?’” 
2KI.4.29	So Elisha said to Gehazi, “Tuck your mantle
2KI.4.30	The boy’s mother said to Elisha, “As the 
2KI.4.31	Gehazi went ahead of them and placed the staff on the boy’s face, but there was no sound or sign of life, so he went back to meet Elisha and told him, “The boy didn’t wake up.”
2KI.4.32	When Elisha got to the house, he discovered the boy lying dead on his bed.
2KI.4.33	So he went in, closed the door behind the two of them, and prayed to the 
2KI.4.34	Then he went up and lay on the boy:
2KI.4.35	Elisha got up, went into the house, and paced back and forth. Then he went up and bent down over him again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
2KI.4.36	Elisha called Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite woman.” He called her and she came. Then Elisha said, “Pick up your son.” 
2KI.4.37	She came, fell at his feet, and bowed to the ground; she picked up her son and left.
2KI.4.38	When Elisha returned to Gilgal,
2KI.4.39	One went out to the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine from which he gathered as many wild gourds as his garment would hold. Then he came back and cut them up into the pot of stew, but they were unaware of what they were.
2KI.4.40	They served some for the men to eat, but when they ate the stew they cried out, “There’s death in the pot,
2KI.4.41	Then Elisha said, “Get some flour.” He threw it into the pot and said, “Serve it for the people to eat.” And there was nothing bad in the pot.
2KI.4.42	A man from Baal-shalishah
2KI.4.43	But Elisha’s attendant asked, “What? Am I to set this before a hundred men?” 
2KI.4.43	“Give it to the people to eat,” Elisha said, “for this is what the 
2KI.4.44	So he set it before them, and as the 
2KI.5.1	Naaman,
2KI.5.2	Aram had gone on raids
2KI.5.3	She said to her mistress, “If only my master were with the prophet who is in Samaria, he would cure him of his skin disease.”
2KI.5.4	So Naaman went and told his master what the girl from the land of Israel had said. 
2KI.5.5	Therefore, the king of Aram said, “Go, and I will send a letter with you to the king of Israel.”
2KI.5.5	So he went and took with him 750 pounds
2KI.5.6	He brought the letter to the king of Israel, and it read:
2KI.5.6	When this letter comes to you, note that I have sent you my servant Naaman for you to cure him of his skin disease.
2KI.5.7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes
2KI.5.8	When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, “Why have you torn your clothes? Have him come to me, and he will know there is a prophet in Israel.”
2KI.5.9	So Naaman came with his horses and chariots and stood at the door of Elisha’s house.
2KI.5.10	Then Elisha sent him a messenger,
2KI.5.11	But Naaman got angry and left, saying, “I was telling myself: He will surely come out, stand and call on the name of the 
2KI.5.12	Aren’t Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel?
2KI.5.13	But his servants approached and said to him, “My father,
2KI.5.14	So Naaman went down and dipped himself in the Jordan seven times, according to the command of the man of God. Then his skin was restored and became like the skin of a small boy, and he was clean.
2KI.5.15	Then Naaman and his whole company went back to the man of God, stood before him, and declared, “I know there’s no God in the whole world except in Israel.
2KI.5.16	But Elisha said, “As the 
2KI.5.17	Naaman responded, “If not, please let your servant be given as much soil as a pair of mules can carry,
2KI.5.18	However, in a particular matter may the 
2KI.5.19	So he said to him, “Go in peace.”
2KI.5.19	After Naaman had traveled a short distance from Elisha, 
2KI.5.20	Gehazi,
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi pursued Naaman. When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got down from the chariot to meet him and asked, “Is everything all right?”
2KI.5.22	Gehazi said, “It’s all right.
2KI.5.23	But Naaman insisted, “Please, accept one hundred fifty pounds.”
2KI.5.24	When Gehazi came to the hill,
2KI.5.25	Gehazi came and stood by his master. “Where did you go, Gehazi?” Elisha asked him.
2KI.5.25	He replied, “Your servant didn’t go anywhere.”
2KI.5.26	“And my heart didn’t go
2KI.5.27	Therefore, Naaman’s skin disease will cling to you and your descendants forever.” So Gehazi went out from his presence diseased, resembling snow.
2KI.6.1	The sons of the prophets
2KI.6.2	Please let us go to the Jordan where we can each get a log and can build ourselves a place to live there.”
2KI.6.2	“Go,” he said.
2KI.6.3	Then one said, “Please come with your servants.”
2KI.6.3	“I’ll come,” he answered.
2KI.6.4	So he went with them, and when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees. 
2KI.6.5	As one of them was cutting down a tree, the iron ax head fell into the water, and he cried out, “Oh, my master, it was borrowed!” 
2KI.6.6	Then the man of God
2KI.6.6	When he showed him the place, the man of God cut a piece of wood, threw it there, and made the iron float.
2KI.6.7	Then he said, “Pick it up.” So he reached out and took it.
2KI.6.8	When the king of Aram
2KI.6.9	But the man of God
2KI.6.10	Consequently, the king of Israel sent word to the place the man of God had told him about. The man of God repeatedly
2KI.6.11	The king of Aram was enraged because of this matter, and he called his servants and demanded of them, “Tell me, which one of us is for the king of Israel?”
2KI.6.12	One of his servants said, “No one, my lord the king. Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in your bedroom.”
2KI.6.13	So the king said, “Go and see where he is, so I can send men to capture him.”
2KI.6.13	When he was told, “Elisha is in Dothan,”
2KI.6.14	he sent horses, chariots, and a massive army there. They went by night and surrounded the city.
2KI.6.15	When the servant of the man of God got up early and went out, he discovered an army with horses and chariots surrounding the city. So he asked Elisha, “Oh, my master, what are we to do?”
2KI.6.16	Elisha said, “Don’t be afraid,
2KI.6.17	Then Elisha prayed, “
2KI.6.18	When the Arameans came against him, Elisha prayed to the 
2KI.6.19	Then Elisha said to them, “This is not the way, and this is not the city. Follow me, and I will take you to the man you’re looking for.” And he led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	When they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “
2KI.6.21	When the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, “Should I kill them,
2KI.6.22	Elisha replied, “Don’t kill them. Do you kill those you have captured with your sword or your bow? Set food and water in front of them so they can eat and drink and go to their master.”
2KI.6.23	So he prepared a big feast for them. When they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. The Aramean raiders
2KI.6.24	Some time later, King Ben-hadad
2KI.6.25	So there was a severe famine
2KI.6.26	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, “My lord the king, help!”
2KI.6.27	He answered, “If the 
2KI.6.28	Then the king asked her, “What’s the matter?” 
2KI.6.28	She said, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son, and we will eat him today. Then we will eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	So we boiled my son and ate him, and I said to her the next day, ‘Give up your son, and we will eat him,’
2KI.6.30	When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his clothes.
2KI.6.31	He announced, “May God punish me and do so severely
2KI.6.32	Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders
2KI.6.33	While Elisha was still speaking with them, the messenger
2KI.7.1	Elisha replied, “Hear the word of the 
2KI.7.2	Then the captain, the king’s right-hand man,
2KI.7.2	Elisha announced, “You will in fact see it with your own eyes, but you won’t eat any of it.”
2KI.7.3	Now four men with a skin disease
2KI.7.4	If we say, ‘Let’s go into the city,’ we will die there because the famine is in the city, but if we sit here, we will also die. So now, come on. Let’s surrender to the Arameans’ camp.
2KI.7.5	So the diseased men got up at twilight to go to the Arameans’ camp. When they came to the camp’s edge, they discovered that no one was there, 
2KI.7.6	for the Lord
2KI.7.7	So they had gotten up and fled
2KI.7.8	When these diseased men came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent to eat and drink. Then they picked up the silver, gold, and clothing and went off and hid them. They came back and entered another tent, picked things up, and hid them.
2KI.7.9	Then they said to each other, “We’re not doing what is right. Today is a day of good news.
2KI.7.10	The diseased men came and called to the city’s gatekeepers and told them, “We went to the Aramean camp and no one was there — no human sounds. There was nothing but tethered horses and donkeys, and the tents were intact.” 
2KI.7.11	The gatekeepers called out, and the news was reported to the king’s household.
2KI.7.12	So the king got up in the night and said to his servants, “Let me tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know we are starving,
2KI.7.13	But one of his servants responded, “Please, let messengers take five of the horses that are left in the city. Their fate is like the entire Israelite community who will die,
2KI.7.14	The messengers took two chariots with horses, and the king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, “Go and see.” 
2KI.7.15	So they followed them as far as the Jordan. They saw that the whole way was littered with clothes and equipment the Arameans had thrown off in their haste. The messengers returned and told the king.
2KI.7.16	Then the people went out and plundered the Aramean camp.
2KI.7.17	The king had appointed the captain, his right-hand man,
2KI.7.18	When the man of God had said to the king, “About this time tomorrow twelve quarts of barley will sell for a half ounce of silver and six quarts of fine flour will sell for a half ounce of silver at Samaria’s gate,” 
2KI.7.19	this captain had answered the man of God, “Look, even if the 
2KI.7.20	This is what happened to him: the people trampled him in the city gate, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Elisha said to the woman whose son he had restored to life,
2KI.8.2	So the woman got ready and did what the man of God said. She and her household lived as resident aliens in the land of the Philistines for seven years. 
2KI.8.3	When the woman returned from the land of the Philistines at the end of seven years,
2KI.8.4	The king had been speaking to Gehazi,
2KI.8.5	While he was telling the king how Elisha restored the dead son to life, the woman whose son he had restored to life came to appeal to the king for her house and field. So Gehazi said, “My lord the king, this is the woman and this is the son Elisha restored to life.”
2KI.8.6	When the king asked the woman, she told him the story. So the king appointed a court official for her, saying, “Restore all that was hers, along with all the income from the field from the day she left the country until now.”
2KI.8.7	Elisha came to Damascus
2KI.8.8	So the king said to Hazael,
2KI.8.9	Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him a gift: forty camel-loads of all the finest products of Damascus. When he came and stood before him, he said, “Your son,
2KI.8.10	Elisha told him, “Go say to him, ‘You are sure to
2KI.8.11	Then he stared steadily at him until he was ashamed.
2KI.8.11	The man of God wept,
2KI.8.12	and Hazael asked, “Why is my lord weeping?”
2KI.8.12	He replied, “Because I know the evil you will do to the people of Israel. You will set their fortresses on fire. You will kill their young men with the sword. You will dash their children to pieces. You will rip open their pregnant women.”
2KI.8.13	Hazael said, “How could your servant, a mere dog,
2KI.8.13	Elisha answered, “The 
2KI.8.14	Hazael left Elisha and went to his master, who asked him, “What did Elisha say to you?”
2KI.8.14	He responded, “He told me you are sure to recover.” 
2KI.8.15	The next day Hazael took a heavy cloth, dipped it in water, and spread it over the king’s face. Ben-hadad died, and Hazael reigned in his place.
2KI.8.16	In the fifth year
2KI.8.17	He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2KI.8.18	He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done, for Ahab’s daughter was his wife. He did what was evil in the 
2KI.8.19	For the sake of his servant David, the 
2KI.8.20	During Jehoram’s reign, Edom rebelled against Judah’s control and appointed their own king.
2KI.8.21	So Jehoram crossed over to Zair with all his chariots. Then at night he set out to attack the Edomites who had surrounded him and the chariot commanders, but his troops fled to their tents.
2KI.8.22	So Edom is still in rebellion against Judah’s control today. Libnah
2KI.8.23	The rest of the events of Jehoram’s reign, along with all his accomplishments, are written in the Historical Record of Judah’s Kings.
2KI.8.24	Jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and his son Ahaziah became king in his place.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Israel’s King Joram son of Ahab,
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, granddaughter of Israel’s King Omri.
2KI.8.27	He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab and did what was evil in the 
2KI.8.28	Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to fight against King Hazael
2KI.8.29	So King Joram returned to Jezreel
2KI.9.1	The prophet Elisha called one of the sons of the prophets
2KI.9.2	When you get there, look for Jehu
2KI.9.3	Then take the flask of oil, pour it on his head, and say, ‘This is what the 
2KI.9.4	So the young prophet
2KI.9.5	When he arrived, the army commanders were sitting there, so he said, “I have a message for you, commander.”
2KI.9.5	Jehu asked, “For which one of us?”
2KI.9.5	He answered, “For you, commander.”
2KI.9.6	So Jehu got up and went into the house. The young prophet poured the oil on his head and said, “This is what the 
2KI.9.7	You are to strike down the house of your master Ahab so that I may avenge the blood shed by the hand of Jezebel — the blood of my servants the prophets and of all the servants of the 
2KI.9.8	The whole house of Ahab will perish, and I will wipe out all of Ahab’s males,
2KI.9.9	I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha son of Ahijah.
2KI.9.10	The dogs will eat Jezebel in the plot of land at Jezreel — no one will bury her.’”
2KI.9.11	When Jehu came out to his master’s servants, they asked, “Is everything all right? Why did this crazy person
2KI.9.11	Then he said to them, “You know the sort and their ranting.”
2KI.9.12	But they replied, “That’s a lie! Tell us!”
2KI.9.12	So Jehu said, “He talked to me about this and that and said, ‘This is what the 
2KI.9.13	Each man quickly took his garment and put it under Jehu on the bare steps.
2KI.9.14	Then Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram.
2KI.9.15	But King Joram had returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him when he fought against Aram’s King Hazael. Jehu said, “If you commanders wish to make me king,
2KI.9.16	Jehu got into his chariot and went to Jezreel since Joram was laid up there and King Ahaziah of Judah had gone down to visit Joram. 
2KI.9.17	Now the watchman
2KI.9.17	Joram responded, “Choose a rider and send him to meet them and have him ask, ‘Do you come in peace?’” 
2KI.9.18	So a horseman went to meet Jehu and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Do you come in peace? ’”
2KI.9.18	Jehu replied, “What do you have to do with peace?
2KI.9.18	The watchman reported, “The messenger reached them but hasn’t started back.”
2KI.9.19	So he sent out a second horseman, who went to them and said, “This is what the king asks: ‘Do you come in peace? ’”
2KI.9.19	Jehu answered, “What do you have to do with peace? Fall in behind me.”
2KI.9.20	Again the watchman reported, “He reached them but hasn’t started back. Also, the driving is like that of Jehu son of Nimshi
2KI.9.21	“Get the chariot ready!” Joram shouted, and they got it ready. Then King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah set out, each in his own chariot, and met Jehu at the plot of land of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2KI.9.22	When Joram saw Jehu he asked, “Do you come in peace, Jehu?”
2KI.9.22	He answered, “What peace can there be as long as there is so much prostitution and sorcery from your mother Jezebel?” 
2KI.9.23	Joram turned around and fled, shouting to Ahaziah, “It’s treachery,
2KI.9.24	Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow went through his heart, and he slumped down in his chariot.
2KI.9.25	Jehu said to Bidkar his aide, “Pick him up and throw him on the plot of ground belonging to Naboth the Jezreelite.
2KI.9.26	‘As surely as I saw the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons yesterday’ — this is the 
2KI.9.27	When King Ahaziah of Judah saw what was happening, he fled up the road toward Beth-haggan. Jehu pursued him, shouting, “Shoot him too!” So they shot him in his chariot
2KI.9.28	Then his servants carried him to Jerusalem in a chariot and buried him in his fathers’ tomb in the city of David.
2KI.9.29	It was in the eleventh year of Joram son of Ahab that Ahaziah had become king over Judah.
2KI.9.30	When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it, so she painted her eyes,
2KI.9.31	As Jehu entered the city gate, she said, “Do you come in peace, Zimri,
2KI.9.32	He looked up toward the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs
2KI.9.33	and he said, “Throw her down!” So they threw her down, and some of her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses, and Jehu rode over her.
2KI.9.34	Then he went in, ate and drank, and said, “Take care of this cursed
2KI.9.35	But when they went out to bury her, they did not find anything but the skull, the feet, and the hands. 
2KI.9.36	So they went back and told him, and he said, “This fulfills the 
2KI.9.37	Jezebel’s corpse will be like manure
2KI.10.1	Since Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria,
2KI.10.2	Your master’s sons are with you, and you have chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weaponry, so when this letter
2KI.10.3	select the most qualified
2KI.10.4	However, they were terrified and reasoned, “Look, two kings
2KI.10.5	So the overseer of the palace, the overseer of the city, the elders, and the guardians sent a message to Jehu: “We are your servants, and we will do whatever you tell us. We will not make anyone king. Do whatever you think is right.”
2KI.10.6	Then Jehu wrote them a second letter, saying:
2KI.10.6	If you are on my side, and if you will obey me, bring me the heads of your master’s sons
2KI.10.6	All seventy of the king’s sons were being cared for by the city’s prominent men. 
2KI.10.7	When the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and slaughtered all seventy, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	When the messenger came and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons,” the king said, “Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate until morning.”
2KI.10.9	The next morning when he went out and stood at the gate, he said to all the people, “You are innocent. It was I who conspired against my master and killed him.
2KI.10.10	Know, then, that not a word the 
2KI.10.11	So Jehu killed all who remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel — all his great men, close friends, and priests — leaving him no survivors.
2KI.10.12	Then he set out and went to Samaria. On the way, while he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds, 
2KI.10.13	Jehu met the relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah and asked, “Who are you?”
2KI.10.13	They answered, “We’re Ahaziah’s
2KI.10.14	Then Jehu ordered, “Take them alive.” So they took them alive and then slaughtered them at the pit of Beth-eked — forty-two men. He didn’t spare any of them.
2KI.10.15	When he left there, he found Jehonadab son of Rechab
2KI.10.15	“It is,” Jehonadab replied.
2KI.10.15	Jehu said, “If it is,
2KI.10.15	So he gave him his hand, and Jehu pulled him up into the chariot with him. 
2KI.10.16	Then he said, “Come with me and see my zeal
2KI.10.17	When Jehu came to Samaria, he struck down all who remained from the house of Ahab in Samaria until he had annihilated his house, according to the word of the 
2KI.10.18	Then Jehu brought all the people together and said to them, “Ahab served Baal
2KI.10.19	Now, therefore, summon to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests.
2KI.10.20	Jehu commanded, “Consecrate a solemn assembly
2KI.10.21	Then Jehu sent messengers throughout all Israel, and all the servants of Baal
2KI.10.22	Then he said to the custodian of the wardrobe, “Bring out the garments for all the servants of Baal.” So he brought out their garments.
2KI.10.23	Then Jehu and Jehonadab son of Rechab entered the temple of Baal, and Jehu said to the servants of Baal, “Look carefully to see that there are no servants of the 
2KI.10.24	Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.
2KI.10.24	Now Jehu had stationed eighty men outside, and he warned them, “Whoever allows any of the men I am placing in your hands to escape will forfeit his life for theirs.”
2KI.10.25	When he finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to the guards and officers, “Go in and kill them. Don’t let anyone out.”
2KI.10.26	They brought out the pillar of the temple of Baal and burned it, 
2KI.10.27	and they tore down the pillar
2KI.10.28	Jehu eliminated Baal worship from Israel, 
2KI.10.29	but he did not turn away from the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to commit — worshiping the gold calves that were in Bethel and Dan.
2KI.10.30	Nevertheless, the 
2KI.10.31	Yet Jehu was not careful to follow the instruction of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days the 
2KI.10.33	from the Jordan eastward: the whole land of Gilead — the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites — from Aroer
2KI.10.34	The rest of the events of Jehu’s reign, along with all his accomplishments and all his might, are written in the Historical Record of Israel’s Kings.
2KI.10.35	Jehu rested with his fathers and was buried in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz
2KI.10.36	The length of Jehu’s reign over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2KI.11.1	When Athaliah,
2KI.11.2	Jehosheba,
2KI.11.3	Joash was in hiding with her in the 
2KI.11.4	In
2KI.11.5	and commanded them, “This is what you are to do: A third of you who come on duty on the Sabbath
2KI.11.6	A third are to be at the Foundation
2KI.11.7	“Your two divisions that go off duty on the Sabbath are to provide the king protection at the 
2KI.11.8	Completely surround the king with weapons in hand. Anyone who approaches the ranks is to be put to death. Be with the king in all his daily tasks.”
2KI.11.9	So the commanders of hundreds did everything the priest Jehoiada commanded. They each brought their men — those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty — and came to the priest Jehoiada.
2KI.11.10	The priest gave to the commanders of hundreds King David’s spears and shields
2KI.11.11	Then the guards stood with their weapons in hand surrounding the king — from the right side of the temple to the left side, by the altar and by the temple.
2KI.11.12	Jehoiada brought out the king’s son, put the crown
2KI.11.13	When Athaliah
2KI.11.14	She looked, and there was the king standing by the pillar
2KI.11.15	Then the priest Jehoiada
2KI.11.16	So they arrested her, and she went through the horse entrance
2KI.11.17	Then
2KI.11.18	So all the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed its altars and images to pieces,
2KI.11.18	Then Jehoiada the priest appointed guards for the 
2KI.11.19	He took the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards,
2KI.11.20	All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death by the sword in the king’s palace.
2KI.11.21	Joash
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu, Joash became king, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah; she was from Beer-sheba.
2KI.12.2	Throughout the time the priest Jehoiada
2KI.12.3	Yet the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
2KI.12.4	Then
2KI.12.5	each priest is to take it from his assessor
2KI.12.6	But by the twenty-third year
2KI.12.7	So King Joash called the priest Jehoiada
2KI.12.8	So the priests agreed that they would receive no silver from the people and would not be the ones to repair the temple’s damage.
2KI.12.9	Then the priest Jehoiada took a chest,
2KI.12.10	Whenever they saw there was a large amount of silver in the chest, the king’s secretary
2KI.12.11	Then they would give the weighed silver to those doing the work — those who oversaw the 
2KI.12.12	the masons, and the stonecutters — and would use it to buy timber and quarried stone to repair the damage to the 
2KI.12.13	However, no silver bowls, wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, trumpets, or any articles of gold or silver
2KI.12.14	Instead, it was given to those doing the work, and they repaired the 
2KI.12.15	No accounting was required from the men who received the silver to pay those doing the work, since they worked with integrity.
2KI.12.16	The silver from the guilt offering and the sin offering was not brought to the 
2KI.12.17	At that time King Hazael
2KI.12.18	So King Joash of Judah took all the items consecrated by himself and by his ancestors — Judah’s kings Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah — as well as all the gold found in the treasuries of the 
2KI.12.19	The rest of the events of Joash’s reign, along with all his accomplishments, are written in the Historical Record of Judah’s Kings.

2KI.13.14	When Elisha became sick with the illness from which he died, King Jehoash of Israel went down and wept over him and said, “My father, my father, the chariots and horsemen of Israel!” 
2KI.13.15	Elisha responded, “Get a bow and arrows.” So he got a bow and arrows.
2KI.13.16	Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Grasp the bow.” So the king grasped it, and Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands. 
2KI.13.17	Elisha said, “Open the east window.” So he opened it. Elisha said, “Shoot!” So he shot.
2KI.13.18	Then Elisha said, “Take the arrows!” So he took them. Then Elisha said to the king of Israel, “Strike the ground!” So he struck the ground three times and stopped. 
2KI.13.19	The man of God
2KI.13.20	Then Elisha died and was buried.
2KI.13.20	Now Moabite raiders
2KI.13.21	Once, as the Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a raiding party, so they threw the man into Elisha’s tomb. When he touched Elisha’s bones, the man revived and stood up!

2KI.13.23	but the 
2KI.13.24	King Hazael of Aram died, and his son Ben-hadad
2KI.13.25	Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz took back from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the cities that Hazael had taken in war from Jehoash’s father Jehoahaz. Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad three times and recovered the cities of Israel.

2KI.14.5	As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp, Amaziah killed his servants who had killed his father the king.
2KI.14.6	However, he did not put the children of the killers to death, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses where the 
2KI.14.7	Amaziah killed ten thousand Edomites in Salt Valley.
2KI.14.8	Amaziah then sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, and challenged him: “Come, let’s meet face to face.”
2KI.14.9	King Jehoash of Israel sent word to King Amaziah of Judah, saying, “The thistle in Lebanon once sent a message to the cedar
2KI.14.10	You have indeed defeated Edom, and you have become overconfident.
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not listen, so King Jehoash of Israel advanced. He and King Amaziah of Judah met face to face at Beth-shemesh
2KI.14.12	Judah was routed before Israel, and each man fled to his own tent.

2KI.15.23	In the fiftieth year of Judah’s King Azariah, Pekahiah son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned two years. 
2KI.15.24	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.15.25	Then his officer, Pekah
2KI.15.26	As for the rest of the events of Pekahiah’s reign, along with all his accomplishments, they are written in the Historical Record of Israel’s Kings.
2KI.15.27	In the fifty-second year of Judah’s King Azariah, Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria, and he reigned twenty years. 
2KI.15.28	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.15.29	In the days of King Pekah of Israel, King Tiglath-pileser
2KI.15.30	Then Hoshea
2KI.15.31	As for the rest of the events of Pekah’s reign, along with all his accomplishments, they are written in the Historical Record of Israel’s Kings.
2KI.15.32	In the second year of Israel’s King Pekah son of Remaliah, Jotham
2KI.15.33	He was twenty-five years old when he became king,
2KI.15.34	He did what was right in the 
2KI.15.35	Yet the high places were not taken away; the people continued sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
2KI.15.35	Jotham built the Upper Gate of the 
2KI.15.36	The rest
2KI.15.37	In those days the 
2KI.15.38	Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of his ancestor David.
2KI.16.1	In the seventeenth year of Pekah son of Remaliah,
2KI.16.2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. He did not do what was right in the sight of the 
2KI.16.3	but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel.
2KI.16.4	He sacrificed and burned incense
2KI.16.5	Then
2KI.16.6	At that time Aram’s King Rezin recovered Elath for Aram and expelled the Judahites from Elath.
2KI.16.7	So Ahaz sent messengers
2KI.16.8	Ahaz also took the silver and gold found in the 
2KI.16.9	So the king of Assyria listened to him
2KI.16.10	King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet King Tiglath-pileser
2KI.16.11	Uriah built the altar according to all the instructions King Ahaz sent from Damascus. Therefore, by the time King Ahaz came back from Damascus, the priest Uriah had completed it. 
2KI.16.12	When the king came back from Damascus, he saw the altar. Then he approached the altar
2KI.16.13	He offered his burnt offering
2KI.16.14	He took the bronze altar
2KI.16.15	Then King Ahaz commanded the priest Uriah, “Offer on the great altar the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, and the king’s burnt offering and his grain offering. Also offer the burnt offering of all the people of the land, their grain offering, and their drink offerings. Splatter on the altar all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of sacrifice. The bronze altar will be for me to seek guidance.”
2KI.16.16	The priest Uriah did everything King Ahaz commanded.
2KI.16.17	Then King Ahaz cut off the frames of the water carts
2KI.16.18	To satisfy the king of Assyria, he removed from the 
2KI.16.19	The rest
2KI.16.20	Ahaz rested with his fathers
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Judah’s King Ahaz, Hoshea
2KI.17.2	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.17.3	King Shalmaneser
2KI.17.4	But the king of Assyria caught Hoshea in a conspiracy: He had sent envoys to So king of Egypt
2KI.17.5	The king of Assyria invaded the whole land, marched up to Samaria, and besieged it for three years.
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hoshea,
2KI.17.7	This disaster happened because the people of Israel sinned against the 
2KI.17.8	They lived according to the customs of the nations that the 
2KI.17.9	The Israelites secretly did things
2KI.17.10	They set up for themselves sacred pillars
2KI.17.11	They burned incense there on all the high places just like the nations that the 
2KI.17.12	They served idols, although the 
2KI.17.13	Still, the 
2KI.17.14	But they would not listen. Instead they became obstinate like
2KI.17.15	They rejected his statutes and his covenant he had made with their ancestors
2KI.17.16	They abandoned all the commands of the 
2KI.17.17	They sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire
2KI.17.18	Therefore, the 
2KI.17.19	Even Judah did not keep the commands of the 
2KI.17.20	So the 
2KI.17.21	When the 
2KI.17.22	The Israelites persisted in all the sins that Jeroboam committed and did not turn away from them.
2KI.17.23	Finally, the 
2KI.17.24	Then the king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and settled them in place of the Israelites in the cities of Samaria. The settlers took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
2KI.17.25	When they first lived there, they did not fear the 
2KI.17.26	The settlers said to the king of Assyria, “The nations that you have deported and placed in the cities of Samaria do not know the requirements of the god of the land. Therefore he has sent lions among them that are killing them because the people don’t know the requirements of the god of the land.”
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria issued a command: “Send back one of the priests you deported.
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests they had deported came and lived in Bethel,
2KI.17.29	But the people of each nation were still making their own gods in the cities where they lived and putting them in the shrines of the high places that the people of Samaria had made.
2KI.17.30	The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth made Nergal, the men of Hamath made Ashima, 
2KI.17.31	the Avvites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burned their children in the fire
2KI.17.32	They feared the 
2KI.17.33	They feared the 
2KI.17.34	They are still observing the former practices to this day. None of them fear the 
2KI.17.35	The 
2KI.17.36	Instead fear the 
2KI.17.37	You are to be careful always
2KI.17.38	Do not forget the covenant that I have made with you.
2KI.17.39	but fear the 
2KI.17.40	However, these nations would not listen but continued observing their former practices. 
2KI.17.41	They feared the 
2KI.18.1	In the third year of Israel’s King Hoshea
2KI.18.2	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abi
2KI.18.3	He did what was right in the 
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places, shattered the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles.
2KI.18.5	Hezekiah relied on the 
2KI.18.6	He remained faithful to the 
2KI.18.7	The 
2KI.18.8	He defeated the Philistines as far as Gaza and its borders,
2KI.18.9	In the fourth year of King Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Israel’s King Hoshea son of Elah, Assyria’s King Shalmaneser marched against Samaria and besieged it.
2KI.18.10	The Assyrians captured it at the end of three years. In the sixth year of Hezekiah, which was the ninth year of Israel’s King Hoshea, Samaria was captured. 
2KI.18.11	The king of Assyria deported the Israelites to Assyria and put them in Halah, along the Habor (Gozan’s river), and in the cities of the Medes,
2KI.18.12	because they did not listen to the 
2KI.18.13	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Assyria’s King Sennacherib attacked all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
2KI.18.14	So King Hezekiah of Judah sent word to the king of Assyria at Lachish:
2KI.18.15	So Hezekiah gave him all the silver found in the 
2KI.18.16	At that time Hezekiah stripped the gold from the doors of the 
2KI.18.17	Then the king of Assyria sent the field marshal,
2KI.18.18	They called for the king, but Eliakim
2KI.18.19	Then
2KI.18.20	You think mere words are strategy and strength for war. Who are you now relying on so that you have rebelled against me?
2KI.18.21	Now look, you are relying on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff
2KI.18.22	Suppose you say to me, “We rely on the 
2KI.18.23	“So now, make a bargain with my master the king of Assyria. I’ll give you two thousand horses if you’re able to supply riders for them! 
2KI.18.24	How then can you drive back a single officer
2KI.18.25	Now, have I attacked this place to destroy it without the 
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebnah, and Joah said to the royal spokesman, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic,
2KI.18.27	But the royal spokesman said to them, “Has my master sent me to speak these words only to your master and to you? Hasn’t he also sent me to the men who sit on the wall, destined with you to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?” 
2KI.18.28	The royal spokesman stood and called out loudly in Hebrew: “Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria. 
2KI.18.29	This is what the king says: ‘Don’t let Hezekiah deceive
2KI.18.30	Don’t let Hezekiah persuade you to rely on the 
2KI.18.31	“Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: ‘Make peace
2KI.18.32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land — a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olive trees and honey
2KI.18.33	Has any of the gods of the nations ever rescued
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?
2KI.18.35	Who among all the gods of the lands has rescued his land from my power? So will the 
2KI.18.36	But the people kept silent; they did not answer him at all, for the king’s command was, “Don’t answer him.” 
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the court historian,
2KI.19.1	When King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes, covered himself with sackcloth,
2KI.19.2	He sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary,
2KI.19.3	They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: ‘Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace, for children have come to the point of birth,
2KI.19.4	Perhaps the 
2KI.19.5	So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah, 
2KI.19.6	who said to them, “Tell your master, ‘The 
2KI.19.7	I am about to put a spirit in him, and he will hear a rumor and return to his own land,
2KI.19.8	When
2KI.19.9	The king had heard concerning King Tirhakah of Cush, “Look, he has set out to fight against you.” So he again sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
2KI.19.10	“Say this to King Hezekiah of Judah: ‘Don’t let your God, on whom you rely,
2KI.19.11	Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries: They completely destroyed them. Will you be rescued? 
2KI.19.12	Did the gods of the nations
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of
2KI.19.14	Hezekiah took
2KI.19.15	Then Hezekiah prayed before the 
2KI.19.16	Listen closely, 
2KI.19.17	, it is true that the kings of Assyria have devastated the nations and their lands.
2KI.19.18	They have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods but made by human hands — wood and stone.
2KI.19.19	Now, 
2KI.19.20	Then
2KI.19.21	This is the word the 
2KI.19.21	Virgin Daughter Zion
2KI.19.21	despises you and scorns you;
2KI.19.21	Daughter Jerusalem
2KI.19.21	shakes her head behind your back.
2KI.19.22	Who is it you mocked and blasphemed?
2KI.19.22	Against whom have you raised your voice
2KI.19.22	and lifted your eyes in pride?
2KI.19.22	Against the Holy One of Israel!
2KI.19.23	You have mocked the Lord
2KI.19.23	You have said, ‘With my many chariots
2KI.19.23	I have gone up to the heights of the mountains,
2KI.19.23	to the far recesses of Lebanon.
2KI.19.23	I cut down its tallest cedars,
2KI.19.23	its choice cypress trees.
2KI.19.23	I came to its farthest outpost,
2KI.19.23	its densest forest.
2KI.19.24	I dug wells
2KI.19.24	and drank water in foreign lands.
2KI.19.24	I dried up all the streams of Egypt
2KI.19.24	with the soles of my feet.’
2KI.19.25	Have you not heard?
2KI.19.25	I designed it long ago;
2KI.19.25	I planned it in days gone by.
2KI.19.25	I have now brought it to pass,
2KI.19.25	and you have crushed fortified cities
2KI.19.25	into piles of rubble.
2KI.19.26	Their inhabitants have become powerless,
2KI.19.26	dismayed, and ashamed.
2KI.19.26	They are plants of the field,
2KI.19.26	tender grass,
2KI.19.26	grass on the rooftops,
2KI.19.26	blasted by the east wind.
2KI.19.27	But I know your sitting down,
2KI.19.27	your going out and your coming in,
2KI.19.27	and your raging against me.
2KI.19.28	Because your raging against me
2KI.19.28	and your arrogance have reached my ears,
2KI.19.28	I will put my hook in your nose
2KI.19.28	and my bit in your mouth;
2KI.19.28	I will make you go back
2KI.19.28	the way you came.
2KI.19.29	“This will be the sign
2KI.19.30	The surviving remnant
2KI.19.31	For a remnant will go out from Jerusalem, and survivors, from Mount Zion.
2KI.19.32	Therefore, this is what the 
2KI.19.32	He will not enter this city,
2KI.19.32	shoot an arrow here,
2KI.19.32	come before it with a shield,
2KI.19.32	or build up a siege ramp against it.
2KI.19.33	He will go back
2KI.19.33	the way he came,
2KI.19.33	and he will not enter this city.
2KI.19.33	This is the 
2KI.19.34	I will defend this city and rescue it
2KI.19.34	for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.”
2KI.19.35	That night the angel of the 
2KI.19.36	So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and left. He returned home and lived in Nineveh.
2KI.19.37	One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech
2KI.20.1	In those days
2KI.20.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall
2KI.20.3	“Please, 
2KI.20.4	Isaiah had not yet gone out of the inner courtyard when the word of the 
2KI.20.5	“Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader
2KI.20.6	I will add fifteen years to your life. I will rescue you and this city from the grasp of the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.’”
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah said, “Bring a lump of pressed figs.” So they brought it and applied it to his infected skin, and he recovered.
2KI.20.8	Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, “What is the sign
2KI.20.9	Isaiah said, “This is the sign
2KI.20.10	Then Hezekiah answered, “It’s easy for the shadow to lengthen ten steps. No, let the shadow go back ten steps.” 
2KI.20.11	So the prophet Isaiah called out to the 
2KI.20.12	At that time
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah listened to the letters and showed the envoys his whole treasure house — the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil — and his armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his palace and in all his realm that Hezekiah did not show them.
2KI.20.14	Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “Where did these men come from and what did they say to you?”
2KI.20.14	Hezekiah replied, “They came from a distant country, from Babylon.”
2KI.20.15	Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your palace?”
2KI.20.15	Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything in my palace. There isn’t anything in my treasuries that I didn’t show them.”
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the 
2KI.20.17	‘Look, the days are coming when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until today will be carried off to Babylon; nothing will be left,’
2KI.20.18	‘Some of your descendants — who come from you, whom you father — will be taken away,
2KI.20.19	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the 
2KI.20.20	The rest of the events of Hezekiah’s reign, along with all his might and how he made the pool
2KI.20.21	Hezekiah rested with his fathers, and his son Manasseh became king in his place.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh
2KI.21.2	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.21.3	He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed
2KI.21.4	He built altars in the 
2KI.21.5	He built altars to all the stars in the sky
2KI.21.6	He sacrificed his son in the fire,
2KI.21.7	Manasseh set up the carved image of Asherah, which he made, in the temple that the 
2KI.21.8	I will never again cause the feet of the Israelites to wander from the land I gave to their ancestors if only they will be careful to do all I have commanded them — the whole law that my servant Moses commanded them.”
2KI.21.9	But they did not listen; Manasseh caused them to stray so that they did worse evil than the nations the 
2KI.21.10	The 
2KI.21.11	“Since King Manasseh of Judah has committed all these detestable acts
2KI.21.12	this is what the 
2KI.21.13	I will stretch over Jerusalem the measuring line used on Samaria and the mason’s level used on the house of Ahab,
2KI.21.14	I will abandon the remnant
2KI.21.15	because they have done what is evil in my sight and have angered me from the day their ancestors came out of Egypt until today.’”
2KI.21.16	Manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled Jerusalem with it from one end to another.
2KI.21.17	The rest
2KI.21.18	Manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, the garden of Uzza. His son Amon became king in his place.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king,
2KI.21.20	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.21.21	He walked in all the ways his father had walked; he served the idols his father had served, and he bowed in worship to them.
2KI.21.22	He abandoned the 
2KI.21.23	Amon’s servants conspired against him and put the king to death in his own house.
2KI.21.24	The common people
2KI.21.25	The rest of the events of Amon’s reign, along with his accomplishments, are written in the Historical Record of Judah’s Kings. 
2KI.21.26	He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah became king in his place.
2KI.22.1	Josiah
2KI.22.2	He did what was right in the 
2KI.22.3	In the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent the court secretary Shaphan son of Azaliah, son of Meshullam, to the 
2KI.22.4	“Go up to the high priest Hilkiah so that he may total up the silver brought into the 
2KI.22.5	It is to be given to those doing the work — those who oversee the 
2KI.22.6	They are to give it to the carpenters, builders, and masons to buy timber and quarried stone to repair the temple.
2KI.22.7	But no accounting is to be required from them for the silver given to them since they work with integrity.”
2KI.22.8	The high priest Hilkiah told the court secretary Shaphan, “I have found the book of the law
2KI.22.9	Then the court secretary Shaphan went to the king and reported,
2KI.22.10	Then the court secretary Shaphan told the king, “The priest Hilkiah has given me a book,” and Shaphan read it in the presence of the king.
2KI.22.11	When the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes.
2KI.22.12	Then he commanded the priest Hilkiah, Ahikam
2KI.22.13	“Go and inquire of the 
2KI.22.14	So
2KI.22.15	She said to them, “This is what the 
2KI.22.16	‘This is what the 
2KI.22.17	because they have abandoned me and burned incense to other gods in order to anger me with all the work of their hands. My wrath will be kindled against this place, and it will not be quenched.’
2KI.22.18	Say this to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the 
2KI.22.19	because your heart was tender and you humbled yourself before the 
2KI.22.20	‘Therefore, I will indeed gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace.
2KI.22.20	Then they reported
2KI.23.1	So the king sent messengers,
2KI.23.2	Then the king went to the 
2KI.23.3	Next, the king stood by the pillar
2KI.23.4	Then the king commanded the high priest Hilkiah
2KI.23.5	Then he did away with the idolatrous priests the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense at the high places
2KI.23.6	He brought out the Asherah pole
2KI.23.7	He also tore down the houses of the male cult prostitutes
2KI.23.8	Then Josiah brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and he defiled the high places
2KI.23.9	The priests of the high places, however, did not come up to the altar of the 
2KI.23.10	He defiled Topheth,
2KI.23.11	He did away with the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They had been at the entrance of the 
2KI.23.12	The king tore down the altars that the kings of Judah had made on the roof
2KI.23.13	The king also defiled the high places that were across from Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Destruction, which King Solomon of Israel had built for Ashtoreth, the abhorrent idol of the Sidonians; for Chemosh, the abhorrent idol of Moab; and for Milcom, the detestable idol of the Ammonites.
2KI.23.14	He broke the sacred pillars into pieces,
2KI.23.15	He even tore down the altar at Bethel
2KI.23.16	As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the mountain. He sent someone to take the bones out of the tombs, and he burned them on the altar.
2KI.23.17	Then he said, “What is this monument I see?”
2KI.23.17	The men of the city told him, “It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that you have done to the altar at Bethel.”
2KI.23.18	So he said, “Let him rest. Don’t let anyone disturb his bones.” So they left his bones undisturbed with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.
2KI.23.19	Josiah also removed all the shrines of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to anger the 
2KI.23.20	He slaughtered on the altars all the priests of those high places,
2KI.23.21	The king commanded all the people, “Observe the Passover of the 
2KI.23.22	No such Passover had ever been observed from the time of the judges who judged Israel through the entire time of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2KI.23.23	But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, the 
2KI.23.24	In addition, Josiah eradicated the mediums, the spiritists,
2KI.23.25	Before him there was no king like him who turned to the 
2KI.23.26	In spite of all that, the 
2KI.23.27	For the 
2KI.23.28	The rest of the events of Josiah’s reign,
2KI.23.29	During his reign, Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt
2KI.23.30	From Megiddo his servants carried his dead body in a chariot, brought him into Jerusalem, and buried him in his own tomb.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz
2KI.23.32	He did what was evil in the 
2KI.23.33	Pharaoh Neco imprisoned him at Riblah
2KI.23.34	Then
2KI.23.35	So Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but at Pharaoh’s command he taxed the land to give it. He exacted the silver and the gold from the common people, each according to his assessment,
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah; she was from Rumah. 
2KI.23.37	He did what was evil

1CH.11.7	Then David took up residence in the stronghold; therefore, it was called the city of David. 
1CH.11.8	He built up the city all the way around, from the supporting terraces to the surrounding parts, and Joab restored the rest of the city. 
1CH.11.9	David steadily grew more powerful,
1CH.11.10	The following were the chiefs of David’s warriors who, together with all Israel, strongly supported him in his reign to make him king according to the 
1CH.11.11	This
1CH.11.11	Jashobeam son of Hachmoni was chief
1CH.11.12	After him, Eleazar son of Dodo
1CH.11.13	He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines had gathered there for battle. There was a portion of a field full of barley, where the troops had fled from the Philistines.
1CH.11.14	But Eleazar and David
1CH.11.15	Three of the thirty chief men went down to David, to the rock at the cave of Adullam,
1CH.11.16	At that time David was in the stronghold,
1CH.11.17	David was extremely thirsty
1CH.11.18	So the Three broke through the Philistine camp and drew water from the well at the gate of Bethlehem. They brought it back to David, but he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out to the 
1CH.11.19	David said, “I would never do such a thing in the presence of my God! How can I drink the blood of these men who risked their lives?” For they brought it at the risk of their lives. So he would not drink it. Such were the exploits of the three warriors.
1CH.11.20	Abishai,
1CH.11.21	He was more honored than the Three and became their commander even though he did not become one of the Three.
1CH.11.22	Benaiah son of Jehoiada
1CH.11.23	He also killed an Egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall.
1CH.11.24	These were the exploits of Benaiah son of Jehoiada, who had a reputation among the three warriors. 
1CH.11.25	He was the most honored of the Thirty, but he did not become one of the Three. David put him in charge of his bodyguard.

1CH.12.1	The following were the men who came to David at Ziklag while he was still banned from the presence of Saul son of Kish.
1CH.12.2	They were archers who could use either the right or left hand, both to sling stones and shoot arrows from a bow.
1CH.12.3	Their chief was Ahiezer son of Shemaah the Gibeathite.
1CH.12.3	Then there was his brother Joash;
1CH.12.3	Jeziel and Pelet sons of Azmaveth;

1CH.12.7	and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham from Gedor.
1CH.12.8	Some Gadites defected to David at his stronghold in the desert. They were valiant warriors, trained for battle, expert with shield and spear. Their faces were like the faces of lions, and they were as swift as gazelles on the mountains.
1CH.12.9	Ezer was the chief, Obadiah second, Eliab third,
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth,
1CH.12.11	Attai sixth, Eliel seventh,
1CH.12.12	Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth,
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah tenth, and Machbannai eleventh.
1CH.12.14	These Gadites were army commanders; the least of them was a match for a hundred, and the greatest of them for a thousand.
1CH.12.15	These are the men who crossed the Jordan in the first month
1CH.12.16	Other Benjaminites and men from Judah also went to David at the stronghold.
1CH.12.17	David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come in peace to help me, my heart will be united with you, but if you have come to betray me to my enemies even though my hands have done no wrong, may the God of our ancestors look on it and judge.”
1CH.12.18	Then the Spirit enveloped
1CH.12.18	We are yours, David,
1CH.12.18	we are with you, son of Jesse!
1CH.12.18	Peace, peace to you,
1CH.12.18	and peace to him who helps you,
1CH.12.18	for your God helps you.
1CH.12.18	So David received them and made them leaders of his troops.
1CH.12.19	Some Manassites defected to David when he went with the Philistines to fight against Saul. However, they did not help the Philistines because the Philistine rulers sent David away after a discussion. They said, “It will be our heads if he defects to his master Saul.”
1CH.12.20	When David went to Ziklag, some men from Manasseh defected to him: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, chiefs of thousands in Manasseh. 
1CH.12.21	They helped David against the raiders,
1CH.12.22	At that time, men came day after day to help David until there was a great army, like an army of God.
1CH.12.23	The numbers of the armed troops who came to David at Hebron to turn Saul’s kingdom over to him,
1CH.12.24	From the Judahites: 6,800 armed troops bearing shields and spears.

1CH.12.27	in addition to Jehoiada, leader of the house of Aaron, with 3,700 men;

1CH.12.29	From the Benjaminites, the relatives of Saul:
1CH.12.30	From the Ephraimites: 20,800 valiant warriors who were famous men in their ancestral families.
1CH.12.31	From half the tribe of Manasseh: 18,000 designated by name to come and make David king.
1CH.12.32	From the Issacharites, who understood the times
1CH.12.33	From Zebulun: 50,000 who could serve in the army, trained for battle with all kinds of weapons of war, with one purpose

1CH.12.37	From across the Jordan — from the Reubenites, Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh: 120,000 men equipped with all the military weapons of war.
1CH.12.38	All these warriors, lined up in battle formation, came to Hebron wholeheartedly determined to make David king over all Israel. All the rest of Israel was also of one mind to make David king.
1CH.12.39	They spent three days there eating and drinking with David, for their relatives had provided for them. 
1CH.12.40	In addition, their neighbors from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali came and brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen — abundant provisions of flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine and oil, herds, and flocks.
1CH.13.1	David consulted with all his leaders, the commanders of hundreds and of thousands. 
1CH.13.2	Then he said to the whole assembly of Israel, “If it seems good to you, and if this is from the 
1CH.13.3	Then let us bring back the ark of our God, for we did not inquire of him
1CH.13.4	Since the proposal seemed right to all the people, the whole assembly agreed to do it.
1CH.13.5	So David assembled all Israel,
1CH.13.6	David
1CH.13.7	At Abinadab’s house
1CH.13.8	David and all Israel were dancing with all their might before God with songs and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
1CH.13.9	When they came to Chidon’s threshing floor,
1CH.13.10	Then the 
1CH.13.11	David was angry because of the 
1CH.13.12	David feared God that day and said, “How can I ever bring the ark of God to me?” 
1CH.13.13	So David did not bring the ark of God home
1CH.13.14	The ark of God remained with Obed-edom’s family in his house for three months, and the 
1CH.14.1	King Hiram of Tyre sent envoys to David,
1CH.14.2	Then David knew that the 
1CH.14.3	David took more wives in Jerusalem, and he became the father of more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	These
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they all went in search of David; when David heard of this, he went out to face them. 
1CH.14.9	Now the Philistines had come and raided in the Valley of Rephaim,
1CH.14.10	so David inquired of God, “Should I attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?”
1CH.14.10	The 
1CH.14.11	So the Israelites went up to Baal-perazim, and David defeated the Philistines there. Then David said, “Like a bursting flood, God has used me to burst out against my enemies.” Therefore, they named that place The Lord Bursts Out.
1CH.14.12	The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David ordered that they be burned in the fire.
1CH.14.13	Once again the Philistines raided in the valley. 
1CH.14.14	So David again inquired of God, and God answered him, “Do not pursue them directly. Circle around them and attack them opposite the balsam trees. 
1CH.14.15	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle, for God will have gone out ahead of you to strike down the army of the Philistines.” 
1CH.14.16	So David did as God commanded him, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 
1CH.14.17	Then David’s fame spread throughout the lands, and the 
1CH.15.1	David built houses for himself in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
1CH.15.2	Then David said, “No one but the Levites may carry the ark of God, because the 
1CH.15.3	David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem
1CH.15.4	Then he gathered together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites:
1CH.15.5	From the Kohathites, Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.6	from the Merarites, Asaiah the leader and 220 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.7	from the Gershomites,
1CH.15.8	from the Elizaphanites, Shemaiah the leader and 200 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.9	from the Hebronites, Eliel the leader and 80 of his relatives; 
1CH.15.10	from the Uzzielites, Amminadab the leader and 112 of his relatives.
1CH.15.11	David summoned the priests Zadok
1CH.15.12	He said to them, “You are the heads of the Levite families. You and your relatives must consecrate yourselves
1CH.15.13	For the 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	Then the Levites carried the ark of God the way Moses had commanded according to the word of the 
1CH.15.16	Then David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their relatives as singers and to have them raise their voices with joy accompanied by musical instruments — harps, lyres, and cymbals.
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel; from his relatives, Asaph son of Berechiah; and from their relatives the Merarites, Ethan son of Kushaiah. 
1CH.15.18	With them were their relatives second in rank: Zechariah, Jaaziel,
1CH.15.19	The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals; 
1CH.15.20	Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah were to play harps according to 
1CH.15.21	and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah were to lead the music with lyres according to the 
1CH.15.22	Chenaniah, the leader of the Levites in music, was to direct the music because he was skillful. 
1CH.15.23	Berechiah and Elkanah were to be gatekeepers for the ark. 
1CH.15.24	The priests, Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, were to blow trumpets
1CH.15.25	David,
1CH.15.26	Because God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.27	Now David was dressed in a robe of fine linen, as were all the Levites who were carrying the ark, as well as the singers and Chenaniah, the music leader of the singers. David also wore a linen ephod. 
1CH.15.28	So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.29	As the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.1	They
1CH.16.2	When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	Then he distributed to each and every Israelite, both men and women, a loaf of bread, a date cake, and a raisin cake.
1CH.16.4	David appointed some of the Levites to be ministers before the ark of the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph was the chief and Zechariah was second to him. Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel played the harps and lyres, while Asaph sounded the cymbals 
1CH.16.6	and the priests Benaiah and Jahaziel blew the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of God.
1CH.16.7	On that day David decreed for the first time that thanks be given to the 
1CH.16.8	Give thanks
1CH.16.8	proclaim his deeds among the peoples.
1CH.16.9	Sing to him; sing praise to him;
1CH.16.9	tell about all his wondrous works!
1CH.16.10	Honor his holy name;
1CH.16.10	let the hearts of those who seek the 
1CH.16.11	Seek the 
1CH.16.11	seek his face always.

1CH.16.12	his wonders, and the judgments he has pronounced,

1CH.16.13	Jacob’s descendants — his chosen ones.
1CH.16.14	He is the 
1CH.16.14	his judgments govern the whole earth.
1CH.16.15	Remember his covenant forever —
1CH.16.15	the promise he ordained for a thousand generations,
1CH.16.16	the covenant he made with Abraham,
1CH.16.16	swore
1CH.16.17	and confirmed to Jacob as a decree,
1CH.16.17	and to Israel as a permanent covenant:
1CH.16.18	“I will give the land of Canaan to you
1CH.16.18	as your inherited portion.”
1CH.16.19	When they
1CH.16.19	very few indeed,
1CH.16.20	wandering from nation to nation
1CH.16.20	and from one kingdom to another,
1CH.16.21	he allowed no one to oppress them;
1CH.16.21	he rebuked kings on their behalf:
1CH.16.22	“Do not touch my anointed ones
1CH.16.22	or harm my prophets.”
1CH.16.23	Let the whole earth sing
1CH.16.23	Proclaim his salvation from day to day.
1CH.16.24	Declare his glory among the nations,
1CH.16.24	his wondrous works among all peoples.
1CH.16.25	For the 
1CH.16.25	he is feared above all gods.
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
1CH.16.26	but the 
1CH.16.27	Splendor and majesty are before him;
1CH.16.27	strength and joy are in his place.

1CH.16.30	it cannot be shaken.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice,
1CH.16.31	and let them say among the nations, “The 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea and all that fills it resound;
1CH.16.32	let the fields and everything in them exult.
1CH.16.33	Then the trees of the forest will shout for joy before the 
1CH.16.33	for he is coming to judge the earth.
1CH.16.34	Give thanks to the 
1CH.16.34	his faithful love endures forever.
1CH.16.35	And say:
1CH.16.35	gather us and rescue us from the nations
1CH.16.35	so that we may give thanks to your holy name
1CH.16.35	and rejoice in your praise.
1CH.16.36	Blessed be the 
1CH.16.36	from everlasting to everlasting.”
1CH.16.36	Then all the people said, “Amen” and “Praise the 
1CH.16.37	So David left Asaph and his relatives there before the ark of the 
1CH.16.38	He assigned Obed-edom
1CH.16.39	David left the priest Zadok and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the 
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings regularly, morning and evening, to the 
1CH.16.41	With them were Heman,
1CH.16.42	Heman and Jeduthun had with them trumpets and cymbals to play and musical instruments of God.
1CH.16.43	Then all the people went home, and David returned home to bless his household.
1CH.17.1	When David
1CH.17.2	So Nathan told David, “Do all that is on your mind, for God is with you.”
1CH.17.3	But that night
1CH.17.4	“Go to David my servant and say, ‘This is what the 
1CH.17.5	From the time I brought Israel out of Egypt until today I have not dwelt in a house; instead, I have moved from one tent site to another, and from one tabernacle location to another.
1CH.17.6	In all my journeys throughout Israel, have I ever spoken a word to even one of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people, asking: Why haven’t you built me a house of cedar? ’ 
1CH.17.7	“So now this is what you are to say to my servant David: ‘This is what the 
1CH.17.8	I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before you. I will make a name for you like that of the greatest on the earth. 
1CH.17.9	I will designate a place for my people Israel and plant them,
1CH.17.10	ever since the day I ordered judges to be over my people Israel. I will also subdue all your enemies.
1CH.17.10	“‘Furthermore, I declare to you that the 
1CH.17.11	When your time comes to be with your fathers, I will raise up after you your descendant, who is one of your own sons, and I will establish his kingdom. 
1CH.17.12	He is the one who will build a house for me,
1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he will be my son.
1CH.17.14	I will appoint him over my house and my kingdom forever, and his throne will be established forever.’”
1CH.17.15	Nathan reported all these words and this entire vision to David.
1CH.17.16	Then
1CH.17.16	Who am I, 
1CH.17.17	This was a little thing to you,
1CH.17.18	What more can David say to you for honoring your servant? You know your servant. 
1CH.17.19	, you have done this whole great thing, making known all these great promises for the sake of your servant and according to your will.
1CH.17.20	, there is no one like you, and there is no God besides you, as all we have heard confirms. 
1CH.17.21	And who is like your people Israel? God, you came to one nation on earth to redeem a people for yourself, to make a name for yourself through great and awesome works by driving out nations before your people you redeemed from Egypt.
1CH.17.22	You made your people Israel your own people forever, and you, 
1CH.17.23	Now, 
1CH.17.24	Let your name be confirmed and magnified forever in the saying, “The 
1CH.17.25	Since you, my God, have revealed to
1CH.17.26	, you indeed are God, and you have promised this good thing to your servant. 
1CH.17.27	So now, you have been pleased to bless your servant’s house that it may continue before you forever. For you, 
1CH.18.1	After this,
1CH.18.2	He also defeated the Moabites, and they became David’s subjects and brought tribute.
1CH.18.3	David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah at Hamath when he went to establish his control at the Euphrates River. 
1CH.18.4	David captured one thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand foot soldiers from him, hamstrung all the horses, and kept a hundred chariots.
1CH.18.5	When the Arameans of Damascus came to assist King Hadadezer of Zobah,
1CH.18.6	Then he placed garrisons
1CH.18.7	David took the gold shields carried by Hadadezer’s officers and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	From Tibhath and Cun, Hadadezer’s cities, David also took huge quantities of bronze, from which Solomon made the bronze basin,
1CH.18.9	When King Tou of Hamath heard that David had defeated the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah, 
1CH.18.10	he sent his son Hadoram to King David to greet him and to congratulate him because David had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him, for Tou and Hadadezer had fought many wars. Hadoram brought all kinds of gold, silver, and bronze items. 
1CH.18.11	King David also dedicated these to the 
1CH.18.12	Abishai son of Zeruiah struck down eighteen thousand Edomites in the Salt Valley. 
1CH.18.13	He put garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites were subject to David. The 
1CH.18.14	So David reigned over all Israel,
1CH.18.15	Joab
1CH.18.15	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was court historian;
1CH.18.16	Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech
1CH.18.16	Shavsha was court secretary;
1CH.18.17	Benaiah son of Jehoiada
1CH.18.17	and David’s sons were the chief officials at the king’s side.
1CH.19.1	Some time later,
1CH.19.2	Then David said, “I’ll show kindness to Hanun son of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.”
1CH.19.2	So David sent messengers to console him concerning his father. However, when David’s emissaries arrived in the land of the Ammonites to console him, 
1CH.19.3	the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Just because David has sent men with condolences for you, do you really believe he’s showing respect for your father? Instead, haven’t his emissaries come in order to scout out, overthrow, and spy on the land?” 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun took David’s emissaries, shaved them, cut their clothes in half at the hips, and sent them away.
1CH.19.5	It was reported to David about his men, so he sent messengers to meet them, since the men were deeply humiliated. The king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back; then return.”
1CH.19.6	When the Ammonites realized
1CH.19.7	They hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah with his army, who came and camped near Medeba.
1CH.19.8	David heard about this and sent Joab and all the elite troops. 
1CH.19.9	The Ammonites marched out and lined up in battle formation at the entrance of the city while the kings who had come were in the field by themselves. 
1CH.19.10	When Joab saw that there was a battle line in front of him and another behind him, he chose some of Israel’s finest young men
1CH.19.11	He placed the rest of the forces under the command of his brother Abishai. They lined up in formation to engage the Ammonites.
1CH.19.12	“If the Arameans are too strong for me,” Joab said, “then you’ll be my help. However, if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I’ll help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be strong! Let’s prove ourselves strong for our people and for the cities of our God.
1CH.19.14	Joab and the people with him approached the Arameans for battle, and they fled before him. 
1CH.19.15	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they likewise fled before Joab’s brother Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab went to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	When the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent messengers to summon the Arameans who were beyond the Euphrates River. They were led by Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army.
1CH.19.17	When this was reported to David, he gathered all Israel and crossed the Jordan. He came up to the Arameans and lined up against them. When David lined up to engage them, they fought against him. 
1CH.19.18	But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach, commander of the army. 
1CH.19.19	When Hadadezer’s subjects saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and became his subjects. After this, the Arameans were never willing to help the Ammonites again.
1CH.20.1	In the spring
1CH.20.2	Then David took the crown from the head of their king,
1CH.20.3	He brought out the people who were in it and put them to work with saws,
1CH.20.4	After this,
1CH.20.5	Once again there was a battle with the Philistines, and Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi the brother of Goliath of Gath. The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam.
1CH.20.6	There was still another battle at Gath where there was a man of extraordinary stature with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot — twenty-four in all. He, too, was descended from the giant.
1CH.20.7	When he taunted Israel, Jonathan son of David’s brother Shimei killed him.
1CH.20.8	These were the descendants of the giant in Gath killed by David and his soldiers.
1CH.21.1	Satan
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan and bring a report to me so I can know their number.”
1CH.21.3	Joab replied, “May the 
1CH.21.4	Yet the king’s order prevailed over Joab. So Joab left and traveled throughout Israel and then returned to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	Joab gave the total troop registration to David. In all Israel there were one million one hundred thousand armed men
1CH.21.6	But he did not include Levi and Benjamin in the count because the king’s command was detestable to him. 
1CH.21.7	This command was also evil in God’s sight, so he afflicted Israel.
1CH.21.8	David said to God, “I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing. Now, please take away your servant’s guilt, for I’ve been very foolish.”
1CH.21.9	Then
1CH.21.10	“Go and say to David, ‘This is what the 
1CH.21.11	So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the 
1CH.21.12	three years of famine, or three months of devastation by your foes with the sword of your enemy overtaking you, or three days of the sword of the 
1CH.21.13	David answered Gad, “I’m in anguish. Please, let me fall into the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	Then God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it, but when the angel was about to destroy the city,
1CH.21.16	When David looked up and saw the angel of the 
1CH.21.17	David said to God, “Wasn’t I the one who gave the order to count the people? I am the one who has sinned and acted very wickedly. But these sheep, what have they done? 
1CH.21.18	So the angel of the 
1CH.21.19	David went up at Gad’s command spoken in the name of the 
1CH.21.20	Ornan was threshing wheat when he turned and saw the angel. His four sons, who were with him, hid. 
1CH.21.21	David came to Ornan, and when Ornan looked and saw David, he left the threshing floor and bowed to David with his face to the ground.
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, “Give me this threshing-floor plot so that I may build an altar to the 
1CH.21.23	Ornan said to David, “Take it! My lord the king may do whatever he wants.
1CH.21.24	King David answered Ornan, “No, I insist on paying the full price, for I will not take for the 
1CH.21.25	So David gave Ornan fifteen pounds of gold
1CH.21.26	He built an altar to the 
1CH.21.27	Then the 
1CH.21.28	At that time, David offered sacrifices there when he saw that the

1CH.22.1	Then David said, “This is the house of the 
1CH.22.2	So David gave orders to gather the resident aliens that were in the land of Israel,
1CH.22.3	David supplied a great deal of iron to make the nails for the doors of the gates and for the fittings, together with an immeasurable quantity of bronze,
1CH.22.4	and innumerable cedar logs because the Sidonians and Tyrians had brought a large quantity of cedar logs to David.
1CH.22.5	David said, “My son Solomon is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the 
1CH.22.6	Then he summoned his son Solomon and charged him to build a house for the 
1CH.22.7	“My son,” David said to Solomon, “It was in my heart to build a house for the name of the 
1CH.22.8	but the word of the 
1CH.22.9	But a son will be born to you; he will be a man of rest. I will give him rest from all his surrounding enemies,
1CH.22.10	He is the one who will build a house for my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.’
1CH.22.11	“Now, my son, may the 
1CH.22.12	Above all, may the 
1CH.22.13	Then you will succeed if you carefully follow the statutes and ordinances the 
1CH.22.14	“Notice I have taken great pains to provide for the house of the 
1CH.22.15	You also have many workers: stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and people skilled in every kind of work 
1CH.22.16	in gold, silver, bronze, and iron — beyond number. Now begin the work, and may the 
1CH.22.17	Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon: 
1CH.22.18	“The 
1CH.22.19	Now determine in your mind and heart to seek the 
1CH.23.1	When David was old and full of days,
1CH.23.2	Then he gathered all the leaders of Israel, the priests, and the Levites. 
1CH.23.3	The Levites thirty years old or more were counted;
1CH.23.4	“Of these,” David said, “twenty-four thousand are to be in charge of the work on the 
1CH.23.5	four thousand are to be gatekeepers, and four thousand are to praise the 
1CH.23.6	Then David divided them into divisions according to Levi’s sons:

1CH.23.27	for according to the last words of David, the Levites twenty years old or more were to be counted —

1CH.27.23	David didn’t count the men aged twenty or under, for the 
1CH.27.24	Joab son of Zeruiah began to count them, but he didn’t complete it. There was wrath against Israel because of this census,
1CH.27.25	Azmaveth son of Adiel was in charge of the king’s storehouses.
1CH.27.25	Jonathan son of Uzziah was in charge of the storehouses in the country, in the cities, in the villages, and in the fortresses.
1CH.27.26	Ezri son of Chelub was in charge of those who worked in the fields tilling the soil.
1CH.27.27	Shimei the Ramathite was in charge of the vineyards.
1CH.27.27	Zabdi the Shiphmite was in charge of the produce of the vineyards for the wine cellars.
1CH.27.28	Baal-hanan the Gederite was in charge of the olive and sycamore trees
1CH.27.28	Joash was in charge of the stores of olive oil.
1CH.27.29	Shitrai the Sharonite was in charge of the herds that grazed in Sharon,
1CH.27.30	Obil the Ishmaelite was in charge of the camels.
1CH.27.30	Jehdeiah the Meronothite was in charge of the donkeys.
1CH.27.31	Jaziz the Hagrite
1CH.27.31	All these were officials in charge of King David’s property.
1CH.27.32	David’s uncle Jonathan was a counselor; he was a man of understanding and a scribe. Jehiel son of Hachmoni attended
1CH.27.33	Ahithophel
1CH.27.34	After Ahithophel came Jehoiada son of Benaiah,
1CH.28.1	David assembled all the leaders of Israel in Jerusalem:
1CH.28.2	Then King David rose to his feet and said, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people. It was in my heart to build a house as a resting place for the ark of the 
1CH.28.3	but God said to me, ‘You are not to build a house for my name because you are a man of war and have shed blood.’
1CH.28.4	“Yet the 
1CH.28.5	And out of all my sons
1CH.28.6	He said to me,
1CH.28.7	I will establish his kingdom forever if he perseveres in keeping my commands and my ordinances as he is doing today.’
1CH.28.8	“So now in the sight of all Israel, the assembly of the 
1CH.28.9	“As for you, Solomon my son, know the God of your father, and serve him wholeheartedly and with a willing mind,
1CH.28.10	Realize now that the 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave his son Solomon the plans
1CH.28.12	The plans contained everything he had in mind
1CH.28.13	Also included were plans for the divisions of the priests and the Levites; all the work of service in the 
1CH.28.14	the weight of gold for all the articles for every kind of service; the weight of all the silver articles for every kind of service; 
1CH.28.15	the weight of the gold lampstands
1CH.28.16	the weight of gold for each table for the rows of the Bread of the Presence and the silver for the silver tables; 
1CH.28.17	the pure gold for the forks, sprinkling basins, and pitchers; the weight of each gold dish; the weight of each silver bowl; 
1CH.28.18	the weight of refined gold for the altar of incense;
1CH.28.19	David concluded, “By the 
1CH.28.20	Then David said to his son Solomon, “Be strong and courageous,
1CH.28.21	Here are the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of God’s house.
1CH.29.1	Then King David said to all the assembly, “My son Solomon — God has chosen him alone — is young and inexperienced. The task is great
1CH.29.2	So to the best of my ability I’ve made provision for the house of my God:
1CH.29.3	Moreover, because of my delight in the house of my God, I now give my personal treasures of gold and silver for the house of my God over and above all that I’ve provided for the holy house: 
1CH.29.4	100 tons
1CH.29.5	the gold for the gold work and the silver for the silver, for all the work to be done by the craftsmen. Now who will volunteer to consecrate himself to the 
1CH.29.6	Then the leaders of the households, the leaders of the tribes of Israel, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds,
1CH.29.7	For the service of God’s house they gave 185 tons
1CH.29.8	Whoever had precious stones gave them to the treasury of the 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced because of their leaders’ willingness to give, for they had given to the 
1CH.29.10	Then David blessed the 
1CH.29.10	May you be blessed, 
1CH.29.11	Yours, 
1CH.29.12	Riches and honor come from you, and you are the ruler of everything.
1CH.29.13	Now therefore, our God, we give you thanks and praise your glorious name.
1CH.29.14	But who am I, and who are my people, that we should be able to give as generously as this? For everything comes from you, and we have given you only what comes from your own hand.
1CH.29.15	For we are aliens and temporary residents in your presence as were all our ancestors.
1CH.29.16	 our God, all this wealth that we’ve provided for building you a house for your holy name comes from your hand; everything belongs to you. 
1CH.29.17	I know, my God, that you test the heart
1CH.29.18	 God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep this desire forever in the thoughts of the hearts of your people, and confirm their hearts toward you. 
1CH.29.19	Give my son Solomon an undivided heart to keep and to carry out all your commands, your decrees, and your statutes,
1CH.29.20	Then David said to the whole assembly, “Blessed be the 
1CH.29.21	The following day they offered sacrifices to the 
1CH.29.22	They ate and drank with great joy in the 
1CH.29.22	Then, for a second time,
1CH.29.23	Solomon sat on the 
1CH.29.24	All the leaders and the mighty men, and all of King David’s sons as well, pledged their allegiance to King Solomon. 
1CH.29.25	The 
1CH.29.26	David son of Jesse was king over all Israel.
1CH.29.27	The length of his reign over Israel was forty years; he reigned in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for thirty-three.
1CH.29.28	He died at a good old age,
1CH.29.29	As for the events of King David’s reign, from beginning to end, note that they are written in the Events of the Seer Samuel,
1CH.29.30	along with all his reign, his might, and the incidents that affected him and Israel and all the kingdoms of the surrounding lands.
2CH.1.1	Solomon son of David strengthened his hold on his kingdom.
2CH.1.2	Then Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to every leader in all Israel — the family heads.
2CH.1.3	Solomon and the whole assembly with him went to the high place that was in Gibeon
2CH.1.4	Now David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place
2CH.1.5	but he put
2CH.1.6	Solomon offered sacrifices there in the 
2CH.1.7	That night
2CH.1.8	And Solomon said to God: “You have shown great and faithful love to my father David, and you have made me king in his place.
2CH.1.9	 God, let your promise to my father David now come true.
2CH.1.10	Now grant me wisdom and knowledge so that I may lead these people,
2CH.1.11	God said to Solomon, “Since this was in your heart, and you have not requested riches, wealth, or glory, or for the life of those who hate you, and you have not even requested long life, but you have requested for yourself wisdom and knowledge that you may judge my people over whom I have made you king, 
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge are given to you. I will also give you riches, wealth, and glory, unlike what was given to the kings who were before you, or will be given to those after you.”
2CH.1.13	So Solomon went to Jerusalem from
2CH.1.14	Solomon
2CH.1.15	The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as abundant as sycamore in the Judean foothills. 
2CH.1.16	Solomon’s horses came from Egypt and Kue.
2CH.1.17	A chariot could be imported from Egypt for fifteen pounds
2CH.2.1	Solomon decided to build a temple for the name of the 
2CH.2.2	so he assigned 70,000 men as porters, 80,000 men as stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 as supervisors over them.
2CH.2.3	Then Solomon sent word to King Hiram
2CH.2.3	Do for me what you did for my father David. You sent him cedars to build him a house to live in.
2CH.2.4	Now I am building a temple for the name of the 
2CH.2.5	The temple that I am building will be great, for our God is greater than any of the gods.
2CH.2.6	But who is able to build a temple for him, since even heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain him?
2CH.2.7	Therefore, send me an artisan who is skilled in engraving to work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and with purple, crimson, and blue yarn. He will work with the artisans who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem,
2CH.2.8	Also, send me cedar, cypress, and algum
2CH.2.9	to prepare logs for me in abundance because the temple I am building will be great and wondrous. 
2CH.2.10	I will give your servants, the woodcutters who cut the trees, one hundred thousand bushels
2CH.2.11	Then King Hiram of Tyre wrote a letter
2CH.2.11	Because the 
2CH.2.12	Hiram also said:
2CH.2.12	Blessed be the 
2CH.2.13	I have now sent Huram-abi,
2CH.2.14	He is the son of a woman from the daughters of Dan. His father is a man of Tyre. He knows how to work with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, with purple, blue, crimson yarn, and fine linen. He knows how to do all kinds of engraving and to execute any design that may be given him. I have sent him to be with your artisans and the artisans of my lord, your father David. 
2CH.2.15	Now, let my lord send the wheat, barley, oil, and wine to his servants as promised.
2CH.2.16	We will cut logs from Lebanon, as many as you need, and bring them to you as rafts by sea to Joppa. You can then take them up to Jerusalem.
2CH.2.17	Solomon took a census of all the resident alien men in the land of Israel, after the census that his father David had conducted,
2CH.2.18	Solomon made 70,000 of them porters, 80,000 stonecutters in the mountains, and 3,600 supervisors to make the people work.
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began
2CH.3.2	He began to build on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign. 
2CH.3.3	These are Solomon’s foundations
2CH.3.4	The portico, which was across the front extending across the width of the temple, was thirty feet wide; its height was thirty feet;
2CH.3.5	The larger room
2CH.3.6	He adorned the temple with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was the gold of Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	He overlaid the temple — the beams, the thresholds, its walls and doors — with gold,
2CH.3.8	Then he made the most holy place; its length corresponded to the width of the temple, 30 feet, and its width was 30 feet.
2CH.3.9	The weight of the nails was twenty ounces
2CH.3.10	He made
2CH.3.11	The overall length of the wings of the cherubim was 30 feet: the wing of one was 7½ feet,
2CH.3.12	The wing of the other
2CH.3.13	The wingspan of these cherubim was 30 feet. They stood on their feet and faced the larger room.
2CH.3.14	He made the curtain of blue, purple, and crimson yarn and fine linen, and he wove cherubim into it.
2CH.3.15	In front of the temple
2CH.3.16	He had made chainwork in the inner sanctuary and also put it on top of the pillars.
2CH.3.17	Then he set up the pillars in front of the sanctuary, one on the right and one on the left. He named the one on the right Jachin
2CH.4.1	He made a bronze altar
2CH.4.2	Then he made the cast metal basin,
2CH.4.3	The likeness of oxen
2CH.4.4	It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The basin was on top of them and all their hindquarters were toward the center. 
2CH.4.5	The basin was three inches
2CH.4.6	He made ten basins for washing and he put five on the right and five on the left.
2CH.4.7	He made the ten gold lampstands according to their specifications and put them in the sanctuary, five on the right and five on the left.
2CH.4.8	He made ten tables and placed them in the sanctuary, five on the right and five on the left.
2CH.4.9	He made the courtyard
2CH.4.10	He put the basin on the right side, toward the southeast.
2CH.4.11	Then Huram
2CH.4.11	So Huram finished doing the work that he was doing for King Solomon in God’s temple: 
2CH.4.12	two pillars; the bowls and the capitals on top of the two pillars; the two gratings for covering both bowls of the capitals that were on top of the pillars; 
2CH.4.13	the four hundred pomegranates for the two gratings (two rows of pomegranates for each grating covering both capitals’ bowls on top of the pillars
2CH.4.14	He also made the water carts
2CH.4.15	The one basin and the twelve oxen underneath it, 
2CH.4.16	the pots, the shovels, the forks, and all their utensils — Huram-abi
2CH.4.17	The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah. 
2CH.4.18	Solomon made all these utensils in such great abundance that the weight of the bronze was not determined.
2CH.4.19	Solomon also made all the equipment in God’s temple: the gold altar; the tables on which to put the Bread of the Presence;
2CH.4.20	the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn in front of the inner sanctuary according to specifications;
2CH.4.21	the flowers, lamps, and gold tongs — of purest gold; 
2CH.4.22	the wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, ladles,
2CH.5.1	So all the work Solomon did for the 
2CH.5.2	At that time
2CH.5.3	So all the men of Israel were assembled in the king’s presence at the festival; this was in the seventh month.
2CH.5.4	All the elders of Israel came, and the Levites picked up the ark. 
2CH.5.5	They brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and the holy utensils that were in the tent. The priests and the Levites brought them up. 
2CH.5.6	King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel who had gathered around him were in front of the ark sacrificing sheep, goats, and cattle that could not be counted or numbered because there were so many. 
2CH.5.7	The priests brought the ark of the 
2CH.5.8	And the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark so that the cherubim formed a cover above the ark and its poles. 
2CH.5.9	The poles were so long that their ends were seen from the holy place
2CH.5.10	Nothing was in the ark except the two tablets that Moses had put in it at Horeb,
2CH.5.11	Now all the priests who were present had consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions.
2CH.5.12	the Levitical singers dressed in fine linen and carrying cymbals, harps, and lyres
2CH.5.13	The trumpeters and singers joined together to praise and thank the 
2CH.5.13	For he is good;
2CH.5.13	his faithful love endures forever.
2CH.5.13	The temple, the 
2CH.5.14	And because of the cloud, the priests were not able to continue ministering, for the glory of the 
2CH.6.1	Then Solomon said:
2CH.6.1	The 
2CH.6.2	but I have built an exalted temple for you,
2CH.6.2	a place for your residence forever.
2CH.6.3	Then the king turned and blessed the entire congregation of Israel while they were standing. 
2CH.6.4	He said:
2CH.6.4	Blessed be the 
2CH.6.4	He spoke directly to my father David,
2CH.6.4	and he has fulfilled the promise
2CH.6.4	by his power.
2CH.6.4	He said,
2CH.6.5	“Since the day I brought my people Israel
2CH.6.5	out of the land of Egypt,
2CH.6.5	I have not chosen a city to build a temple in
2CH.6.5	among any of the tribes of Israel,
2CH.6.5	so that my name would be there,
2CH.6.5	and I have not chosen a man
2CH.6.5	to be ruler over my people Israel.
2CH.6.6	But I have chosen Jerusalem
2CH.6.6	so that my name will be there,
2CH.6.6	and I have chosen David
2CH.6.6	to be over my people Israel.”
2CH.6.7	My father David had his heart set
2CH.6.7	on building a temple for the name of the 
2CH.6.8	However, the 
2CH.6.8	“Since it was your desire to build a temple for my name,
2CH.6.8	you have done well to have this desire.
2CH.6.9	Yet, you are not the one to build the temple,
2CH.6.9	but your son, your own offspring,
2CH.6.9	will build the temple for my name.”
2CH.6.10	So the 
2CH.6.10	I have taken the place of my father David
2CH.6.10	and I sit on the throne of Israel, as the 
2CH.6.10	I have built the temple for the name of the 
2CH.6.11	I have put the ark there,
2CH.6.11	where the 
2CH.6.11	that he made with the Israelites.
2CH.6.12	Then Solomon stood before the altar of the 
2CH.6.13	For Solomon had made a bronze platform 7½ feet
2CH.6.14	He said:
2CH.6.14	there is no God like you
2CH.6.14	in heaven or on earth,
2CH.6.14	who keeps his gracious covenant
2CH.6.14	with your servants who walk before you
2CH.6.14	with all their heart.
2CH.6.15	You have kept what you promised
2CH.6.15	to your servant, my father David.
2CH.6.15	You spoke directly to him,
2CH.6.15	and you fulfilled your promise by your power,
2CH.6.15	as it is today.
2CH.6.16	Therefore, 
2CH.6.16	keep what you promised
2CH.6.16	to your servant, my father David:
2CH.6.16	“You will never fail to have a man
2CH.6.16	to sit before me on the throne of Israel,
2CH.6.16	if only your sons guard their way to walk in my Law
2CH.6.16	as you have walked before me.”
2CH.6.17	Now, 
2CH.6.17	what you promised to your servant David.
2CH.6.18	But will God indeed live on earth with humans?
2CH.6.18	Even heaven, the highest heaven, cannot contain you,
2CH.6.18	much less this temple I have built.
2CH.6.19	Listen
2CH.6.19	so that you may hear the cry and the prayer
2CH.6.19	that your servant prays before you,
2CH.6.20	so that your eyes watch over this temple
2CH.6.20	day and night,
2CH.6.20	toward the place where you said
2CH.6.20	you would put your name;
2CH.6.20	and so that you may hear the prayer
2CH.6.20	your servant prays toward this place.
2CH.6.21	Hear the petitions of your servant
2CH.6.21	and your people Israel,
2CH.6.21	which they pray toward this place.
2CH.6.21	May you hear in your dwelling place in heaven.
2CH.6.21	May you hear and forgive.
2CH.6.22	If a man sins against his neighbor
2CH.6.22	and is forced to take an oath
2CH.6.22	and he comes to take an oath
2CH.6.22	before your altar in this temple,
2CH.6.23	may you hear in heaven and act.
2CH.6.23	May you judge your servants,
2CH.6.23	condemning the wicked man by bringing
2CH.6.23	what he has done on his own head
2CH.6.23	and providing justice for the righteous
2CH.6.23	by rewarding him according to his righteousness.
2CH.6.24	If your people Israel are defeated before an enemy,
2CH.6.24	because they have sinned against you,
2CH.6.24	and they return to you and praise your name,
2CH.6.24	and they pray and plead for mercy
2CH.6.24	before you in this temple,
2CH.6.25	may you hear in heaven
2CH.6.25	and forgive the sin of your people Israel.
2CH.6.25	May you restore them to the land
2CH.6.25	you gave them and their ancestors.
2CH.6.26	When the skies are shut and there is no rain
2CH.6.26	because they have sinned against you,
2CH.6.26	and they pray toward this place
2CH.6.26	and praise your name,
2CH.6.26	and they turn from their sins
2CH.6.26	because you are afflicting
2CH.6.27	may you hear in heaven
2CH.6.27	and forgive the sin of your servants
2CH.6.27	and your people Israel,
2CH.6.27	so that you may teach them the good way
2CH.6.27	they should walk in.
2CH.6.27	May you send rain on your land
2CH.6.27	that you gave your people for an inheritance.
2CH.6.28	When there is famine in the land,
2CH.6.28	when there is pestilence,
2CH.6.28	when there is blight or mildew, locust or grasshopper,
2CH.6.28	when their enemies besiege them
2CH.6.28	in the land and its cities,
2CH.6.28	when there is any plague or illness,
2CH.6.29	every prayer or petition
2CH.6.29	that any person or that all your people Israel may have —
2CH.6.29	they each know their own affliction
2CH.6.29	as they spread out their hands toward this temple,
2CH.6.30	may you hear in heaven, your dwelling place,
2CH.6.30	and may you forgive and give to everyone
2CH.6.30	according to all their ways, since you know each heart,
2CH.6.30	for you alone know the human heart,
2CH.6.31	so that they may fear you
2CH.6.31	and walk in your ways
2CH.6.31	all the days they live on the land
2CH.6.31	you gave our ancestors.
2CH.6.32	Even for the foreigner who is not of your people Israel
2CH.6.32	but has come from a distant land
2CH.6.32	because of your great name
2CH.6.32	and your strong hand and outstretched arm:
2CH.6.32	when he comes and prays toward this temple,
2CH.6.33	may you hear in heaven in your dwelling place,
2CH.6.33	and do all the foreigner asks you.
2CH.6.33	Then all the peoples of the earth will know your name,
2CH.6.33	to fear you as your people Israel do
2CH.6.33	and know that this temple I have built
2CH.6.33	bears your name.
2CH.6.34	When your people go out to fight against their enemies,
2CH.6.34	wherever you send them,
2CH.6.34	and they pray to you
2CH.6.34	in the direction of this city you have chosen
2CH.6.34	and the temple that I have built for your name,
2CH.6.35	may you hear their prayer and petition in heaven
2CH.6.35	and uphold their cause.
2CH.6.36	When they sin against you —
2CH.6.36	for there is no one who does not sin
2CH.6.36	and you are angry with them
2CH.6.36	and hand them over to the enemy,
2CH.6.36	and their captors deport them
2CH.6.36	to a distant or nearby country,
2CH.6.37	and when they come to their senses
2CH.6.37	in the land where they were deported
2CH.6.37	and repent and petition you in their captors’ land,
2CH.6.37	saying: “We have sinned and done wrong;
2CH.6.37	we have been wicked,”
2CH.6.38	and when they return to you with all their mind and all their heart
2CH.6.38	in the land of their captivity where they were taken captive,
2CH.6.38	and when they pray in the direction of their land
2CH.6.38	that you gave their ancestors,
2CH.6.38	and the city you have chosen,
2CH.6.38	and toward the temple I have built for your name,
2CH.6.39	may you hear their prayer and petitions in heaven,
2CH.6.39	your dwelling place,
2CH.6.39	and uphold their cause.
2CH.6.39	May you forgive your people
2CH.6.39	who sinned against you.
2CH.6.40	Now, my God,
2CH.6.40	please let your eyes be open
2CH.6.40	and your ears attentive
2CH.6.40	to the prayer of this place.
2CH.6.41	Now therefore:
2CH.6.41	Arise, 
2CH.6.41	you and your powerful ark.
2CH.6.41	May your priests, 
2CH.6.41	and may your faithful people rejoice in goodness.
2CH.6.42	remember the promises to your servant David.
2CH.7.1	When Solomon finished praying,
2CH.7.2	The priests were not able to enter the 
2CH.7.3	All the Israelites were watching when the fire descended and the glory of the 
2CH.7.3	For he is good,
2CH.7.3	for his faithful love endures forever.
2CH.7.4	The king and all the people were offering sacrifices in the 
2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep and goats. In this manner the king and all the people dedicated God’s temple. 
2CH.7.6	The priests and the Levites were standing at their stations. The Levites had the musical instruments of the 
2CH.7.7	Since the bronze altar that Solomon had made
2CH.7.8	So Solomon and all Israel with him — a very great assembly, from the entrance to Hamath
2CH.7.9	On the eighth day
2CH.7.10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people home,
2CH.7.11	So Solomon finished the 
2CH.7.12	Then the 
2CH.7.12	I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple of sacrifice.
2CH.7.13	If I shut the sky so there is no rain, or if I command the grasshopper to consume the land, or if I send pestilence on my people,
2CH.7.14	and my people, who bear my name, humble themselves, pray and seek my face, and turn from their evil ways, then I will hear from heaven, forgive their sin, and heal their land.
2CH.7.15	My eyes will now be open and my ears attentive to prayer from this place.
2CH.7.16	And I have now chosen and consecrated this temple so that my name may be there forever; my eyes and my heart will be there at all times.
2CH.7.17	As for you, if you walk before me as your father David walked, doing everything I have commanded you, and if you keep my statutes and ordinances, 
2CH.7.18	I will establish your royal throne, as I promised your father David: You will never fail to have a man ruling in Israel.
2CH.7.19	However, if you turn away and abandon my statutes and my commands that I have set before you and if you go and serve other gods and bow in worship to them,
2CH.7.20	then I will uproot Israel from the soil that I gave them, and this temple that I have sanctified for my name I will banish from my presence;
2CH.7.21	As for this temple, which was exalted, everyone who passes by will be appalled and will say:
2CH.7.22	Then they will say: Because they abandoned the 
2CH.8.1	At the end of twenty years
2CH.8.2	Solomon had rebuilt the cities Hiram
2CH.8.3	Solomon went to Hamath-zobah and seized it. 
2CH.8.4	He built Tadmor in the wilderness along with all the storage cities that he built in Hamath. 
2CH.8.5	He built Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon
2CH.8.6	Baalath, all the storage cities that belonged to Solomon, all the chariot cities, the cavalry cities, and everything Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, or anywhere else in the land of his dominion.
2CH.8.7	As for all the peoples who remained of the Hethites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who were not from Israel
2CH.8.8	their descendants who remained in the land after them, those the Israelites had not completely destroyed — Solomon imposed forced labor on them; it is this way today.
2CH.8.9	But Solomon did not consign the Israelites to be slaves for his work; they were soldiers, commanders of his captains, and commanders of his chariots and his cavalry. 
2CH.8.10	These were King Solomon’s deputies: 250 who supervised the people.
2CH.8.11	Solomon brought the daughter of Pharaoh from the city of David to the house he had built for her,
2CH.8.12	At that time
2CH.8.13	He followed the daily requirement
2CH.8.14	According to the ordinances of his father David, he appointed the divisions of the priests over their service,
2CH.8.15	They did not turn aside from the king’s command regarding the priests and the Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasuries.
2CH.8.16	All of Solomon’s work was carried out from the day the foundation was laid for the 
2CH.8.17	At that time
2CH.8.18	So Hiram
2CH.9.1	The queen of Sheba heard of Solomon’s fame,
2CH.9.2	So Solomon answered all her questions; nothing was too difficult for Solomon to explain to her. 
2CH.9.3	When the queen of Sheba observed Solomon’s wisdom, the palace he had built, 
2CH.9.4	the food at his table, his servants’ residence, his attendants’ service and their attire, his cupbearers and their attire, and the burnt offerings he offered at the 
2CH.9.5	She said to the king, “The report I heard in my own country about your words and about your wisdom is true. 
2CH.9.6	But I didn’t believe their reports until I came and saw with my own eyes. Indeed, I was not even told half of your great wisdom! You far exceed the report I heard. 
2CH.9.7	How happy are your men.
2CH.9.8	Blessed be the 
2CH.9.9	Then she gave the king four and a half tons
2CH.9.10	In addition, Hiram’s servants and Solomon’s servants who brought gold from Ophir
2CH.9.11	The king made the algum wood into walkways for the 
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba her every desire, whatever she asked — far more than she had brought the king. Then she, along with her servants, returned to her own country.
2CH.9.13	The weight of gold that came to Solomon
2CH.9.14	besides what was brought by the merchants and traders. All the Arabian kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2CH.9.15	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold; 15 pounds
2CH.9.16	He made three hundred small shields of hammered gold; 7½ pounds
2CH.9.17	The king also made a large ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	The throne had six steps; there was a footstool covered in gold for the throne, armrests on either side of the seat, and two lions standing beside the armrests. 
2CH.9.19	Twelve lions were standing there on the six steps, one at each end. Nothing like it had ever been made in any other kingdom.
2CH.9.20	All of King Solomon’s drinking cups were gold, and all the utensils of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were pure gold. There was no silver, since it was considered as nothing in Solomon’s time, 
2CH.9.21	for the king’s ships kept going to Tarshish
2CH.9.22	King Solomon surpassed all the kings of the world in riches and wisdom.
2CH.9.23	All the kings of the world wanted an audience with Solomon to hear the wisdom God had put in his heart. 
2CH.9.24	Each of them would bring his own gift — items
2CH.9.25	Solomon
2CH.9.26	He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines and as far as the border of Egypt.
2CH.9.27	The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar as abundant as sycamore in the Judean foothills. 
2CH.9.28	They were bringing horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all the countries.
2CH.9.29	The remaining events
2CH.9.30	Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. 
2CH.9.31	Solomon rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of his father David.
2CH.10.1	Then Rehoboam went to Shechem,
2CH.10.2	When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard about it — for he was in Egypt where he had fled from King Solomon’s presence — Jeroboam returned from Egypt.
2CH.10.3	So they summoned him. Then Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam: 
2CH.10.4	“Your father made our yoke harsh. Therefore, lighten your father’s harsh service and the heavy yoke he put on us, and we will serve you.”
2CH.10.5	Rehoboam replied, “Return to me in three days.” So the people left.
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had attended his father Solomon when he was alive, asking, “How do you advise me to respond to this people?”
2CH.10.7	They replied, “If you will be kind to this people and please them by speaking kind words to them, they will be your servants forever.”
2CH.10.8	But he rejected the advice of the elders who had advised him, and he consulted with the young men who had grown up with him, the ones attending him. 
2CH.10.9	He asked them, “What message do you advise we send back to this people who said to me, ‘Lighten the yoke your father put on us’?”
2CH.10.10	Then the young men who had grown up with him told him, “This is what you should say to the people who said to you, ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you, make it lighter on us! ’ This is what you should say to them: ‘My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist! 
2CH.10.11	Now therefore, my father burdened you with a heavy yoke, but I will add to your yoke; my father disciplined you with whips, but I, with barbed whips.’”
2CH.10.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had ordered, saying, “Return to me on the third day.” 
2CH.10.13	Then the king answered them harshly. King Rehoboam rejected the elders’ advice 
2CH.10.14	and spoke to them according to the young men’s advice, saying, “My father made your yoke heavy,
2CH.10.15	The king did not listen to the people because the turn of events came from God,
2CH.10.16	When
2CH.10.16	What portion do we have in David?
2CH.10.16	We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse.
2CH.10.16	Israel, each to your tent;
2CH.10.16	David, look after your own house now!
2CH.10.16	So all Israel went to their tents. 
2CH.10.17	But as for the Israelites living in the cities of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
2CH.10.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram,
2CH.10.19	Israel is in rebellion against the house of David until today.
2CH.11.1	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem,
2CH.11.2	But the word of the 
2CH.11.3	“Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people: 
2CH.11.4	‘This is what the 
2CH.11.4	So they listened to what the 
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam stayed in Jerusalem, and he fortified cities
2CH.11.6	He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron, which are fortified cities in Judah and in Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	He strengthened their fortifications and put leaders in them with supplies of food, oil, and wine. 
2CH.11.12	He also put large shields and spears in each and every city to make them very strong. So Judah and Benjamin were his.
2CH.11.13	The priests and Levites from all their regions throughout Israel took their stand with Rehoboam, 
2CH.11.14	for the Levites left their pasturelands and their possessions
2CH.11.15	Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the high places,
2CH.11.16	Those from every tribe of Israel who had determined in their hearts to seek the 
2CH.11.17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and supported Rehoboam son of Solomon for three years,
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam married Mahalath, daughter of David’s son Jerimoth and of Abihail daughter of Jesse’s son Eliab.
2CH.11.19	She bore sons to him: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	After her, he married Maacah daughter
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam loved Maacah daughter of Absalom more than all his wives and concubines. He acquired eighteen wives
2CH.11.22	Rehoboam appointed Abijah son of Maacah as chief, leader among his brothers, intending to make him king.
2CH.11.23	Rehoboam also showed discernment by dispersing some of his sons to all the regions of Judah and Benjamin and to all the fortified cities. He gave them plenty of provisions and sought many wives for them.
2CH.12.1	When Rehoboam had established his sovereignty and royal power,
2CH.12.2	Because they were unfaithful to the 
2CH.12.3	with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 cavalrymen, and countless people who came with him from Egypt — Libyans,
2CH.12.4	He captured the fortified cities
2CH.12.5	Then the prophet Shemaiah
2CH.12.6	So the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, “The 
2CH.12.7	When the 
2CH.12.8	However, they will become his servants so that they may recognize the difference between serving me and serving the kingdoms of other lands.”
2CH.12.9	So King Shishak of Egypt went to war
2CH.12.10	King Rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and committed them into the care of the captains of the guards
2CH.12.11	Whenever the king entered the 
2CH.12.12	When Rehoboam humbled himself, the 
2CH.12.13	King Rehoboam
2CH.12.14	Rehoboam did what was evil, because he did not determine in his heart to seek the 
2CH.12.15	The events
2CH.12.16	Rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Abijah
2CH.13.1	In the eighteenth year
2CH.13.2	and he reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Micaiah
2CH.13.2	There was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah set his army of warriors in order with four hundred thousand fit young men. Jeroboam arranged his mighty army of eight hundred thousand fit young men in battle formation against him. 
2CH.13.4	Then Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim,
2CH.13.5	Don’t you know that the 
2CH.13.6	But Jeroboam son of Nebat, a servant of Solomon son of David, rose up and rebelled against his lord.
2CH.13.7	Then worthless and wicked men gathered around him to resist Rehoboam son of Solomon when Rehoboam was young, inexperienced, and unable to assert himself against them.
2CH.13.8	“And now you are saying you can assert yourselves against the 
2CH.13.9	Didn’t you banish the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	“But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	They offer a burnt offering and fragrant incense to the 
2CH.13.12	Look, God and his priests are with us at our head. The trumpets are ready to sound the charge against you. Israelites, don’t fight against the 
2CH.13.13	Now Jeroboam had sent an ambush
2CH.13.14	Judah turned and discovered that the battle was in front of them and behind them, so they cried out to the 
2CH.13.15	and the men of Judah raised the battle cry. When the men of Judah raised the battle cry, God routed Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
2CH.13.16	So the Israelites fled before Judah, and God handed them over to them.
2CH.13.17	Then Abijah and his people struck them with a mighty blow, and five hundred thousand fit young men of Israel were killed. 
2CH.13.18	The Israelites were subdued at that time. The Judahites succeeded because they depended on the 
2CH.13.19	Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured some cities from him: Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron,
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam no longer retained his power
2CH.13.21	However, Abijah grew strong, acquired fourteen wives, and fathered twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	The rest of the events of Abijah’s reign, along with his ways and his sayings, are written in the Writing
2CH.14.1	Abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Asa became king in his place.
2CH.14.2	Asa did what was good and right
2CH.14.3	He removed the pagan altars and the high places. He shattered their sacred pillars and chopped down their Asherah poles.
2CH.14.4	He told the people of Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	He also removed the high places and the shrines
2CH.14.6	Because the land experienced peace, Asa built fortified cities in Judah.
2CH.14.7	So he said to the people of Judah, “Let’s build these cities and surround them with walls and towers, with doors and bars.
2CH.14.8	Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah bearing large shields and spears,
2CH.14.9	Then Zerah the Cushite came against them with an army of one million men and three hundred
2CH.14.10	So Asa marched out against him and lined up in battle formation in Zephathah Valley at Mareshah.
2CH.14.11	Then Asa cried out to the 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	Then Asa and the people who were with him pursued them as far as Gerar.
2CH.14.14	Then they attacked all the cities around Gerar because the terror of the 
2CH.14.15	They also attacked the tents of the herdsmen and captured many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	The Spirit of God came on Azariah son of Oded.
2CH.15.2	So he went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Asa and all Judah and Benjamin, hear me. The 
2CH.15.3	For many years Israel has been without the true God,
2CH.15.4	but when they turned to the 
2CH.15.5	In those times there was no peace for those who went about their daily activities because the residents of the lands had many conflicts. 
2CH.15.6	Nation was crushed by nation and city by city, for God troubled them with every possible distress. 
2CH.15.7	But as for you, be strong; don’t give up,
2CH.15.8	When Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Azariah son of Oded the prophet, he took courage and removed the abhorrent idols from the whole land of Judah and Benjamin and from the cities he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim.
2CH.15.9	Then he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, as well as those from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were residing among them, for they had defected to him from Israel in great numbers when they saw that the 
2CH.15.10	They were gathered in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s reign. 
2CH.15.11	At that time they sacrificed to the 
2CH.15.12	Then they entered into a covenant to seek the 
2CH.15.13	Whoever would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	They took an oath to the 
2CH.15.15	All Judah rejoiced over the oath, for they had sworn it with all their mind. They had sought him with all their heart, and he was found by them.
2CH.15.16	King Asa
2CH.15.17	The high places were not taken away from Israel; nevertheless, Asa was wholeheartedly devoted his entire life.
2CH.15.18	He brought his father’s consecrated gifts and his own consecrated gifts into God’s temple: silver, gold, and utensils.
2CH.15.19	There was no war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa,
2CH.16.2	So Asa brought out the silver and gold from the treasuries of the 
2CH.16.3	“There’s a treaty between me and you, between my father and your father. Look, I have sent you silver and gold. Go break your treaty with Israel’s King Baasha so that he will withdraw from me.”
2CH.16.4	Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies to the cities of Israel. They attacked Ijon, Dan, Abel-maim,
2CH.16.5	When Baasha heard about it, he quit building Ramah and stopped his work. 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa brought all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timbers Baasha had built it with. Then he built Geba and Mizpah with them.
2CH.16.7	At that time, the seer Hanani
2CH.16.8	Were not the Cushites and Libyans a vast army with many chariots and horsemen?
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the 
2CH.16.10	Asa was enraged with the seer and put him in prison
2CH.16.11	Note that the events
2CH.16.12	In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a disease in his feet, and his disease became increasingly severe. Yet even in his disease he didn’t seek the 
2CH.16.13	Asa rested with his fathers; he died in the forty-first year of his reign. 
2CH.16.14	He was buried in his own tomb that he had made for himself in the city of David. They laid him out in a coffin that was full of spices and various mixtures of prepared ointments;
2CH.17.1	His son Jehoshaphat became king in his place
2CH.17.2	He stationed troops in every fortified city of Judah
2CH.17.3	Now the 
2CH.17.4	but sought the God of his father and walked by his commands, not according to the practices of Israel.
2CH.17.5	So the 
2CH.17.6	His mind rejoiced in the 
2CH.17.7	In the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials — Ben-hail,
2CH.17.8	The Levites with them were Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah,
2CH.17.9	They taught throughout Judah, having the book of the 
2CH.17.10	The terror of the 
2CH.17.11	Some of the Philistines also brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and the Arabs brought him flocks: 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats.
2CH.17.12	Jehoshaphat grew stronger and stronger. He built fortresses
2CH.17.13	and carried out great works in the towns of Judah. He had fighting men, valiant warriors, in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	These are their numbers according to their ancestral families.
2CH.17.14	Adnah the commander and three hundred thousand valiant warriors with him;
2CH.17.15	next to him, Jehohanan the commander and two hundred eighty thousand with him;
2CH.17.16	next to him, Amasiah son of Zichri, the volunteer
2CH.17.17	from Benjamin, Eliada, a valiant warrior, and two hundred thousand with him armed with bow and shield;
2CH.17.18	next to him, Jehozabad and one hundred eighty thousand with him equipped for war.
2CH.17.19	These were the ones who served the king, besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout all Judah.
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat
2CH.18.2	Then after some years, he went down to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab sacrificed many sheep, goats, and cattle for him and for the people who were with him. Then he persuaded him to attack Ramoth-gilead, 
2CH.18.3	for Israel’s King Ahab asked Judah’s King Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?”
2CH.18.3	He replied to him, “I am as you are, my people as your people; we will be with you in the battle.” 
2CH.18.4	But Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “First, please ask what the 
2CH.18.5	So the king of Israel gathered the prophets, four hundred men, and asked them, “Should we go to Ramoth-gilead for war or should I refrain?”
2CH.18.5	They replied, “March up, and God will hand it over to the king.”
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the 
2CH.18.7	The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “There is still one man who can inquire of the 
2CH.18.7	“The king shouldn’t say that,” Jehoshaphat replied.
2CH.18.8	So the king of Israel called an officer and said, “Hurry and get Micaiah son of Imlah!”
2CH.18.9	Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, clothed in royal attire, were each sitting on his own throne. They were sitting on the threshing floor at the entrance to Samaria’s gate,
2CH.18.10	Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah made iron horns and said, “This is what the 
2CH.18.11	And all the prophets were prophesying the same, saying, “March up to Ramoth-gilead and succeed, for the 
2CH.18.12	The messenger who went to call Micaiah instructed him, “Look, the words of the prophets are unanimously favorable for the king. So let your words be like theirs, and speak favorably.”
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah said, “As the 
2CH.18.14	So he went to the king, and the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we go to Ramoth-gilead for war, or should I
2CH.18.14	Micaiah said, “March up and succeed, for they will be handed over to you.”
2CH.18.15	But the king said to him, “How many times must I make you swear not to tell me anything but the truth in the name of the 
2CH.18.16	So Micaiah said:
2CH.18.16	I saw all Israel scattered on the hills
2CH.18.16	like sheep without a shepherd.
2CH.18.16	And the 
2CH.18.16	“They have no master;
2CH.18.16	let each return home in peace.”
2CH.18.17	So the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Didn’t I tell you he never prophesies good about me, but only disaster?”
2CH.18.18	Then Micaiah said, “Therefore, hear the word of the 
2CH.18.19	And the 
2CH.18.20	“Then
2CH.18.20	“The 
2CH.18.21	“So he said, ‘I will go and become a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.’
2CH.18.21	“Then he said, ‘You will entice him and also prevail. Go and do that.’
2CH.18.22	“Now, you see, the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah son of Chenaanah came up, hit Micaiah on the cheek, and demanded, “Which way did the spirit from the 
2CH.18.24	Micaiah replied, “You will soon see when you go to hide in an inner chamber on that day.”
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel ordered, “Take Micaiah and return him
2CH.18.26	and say, ‘This is what the king says: Put this guy in prison
2CH.18.27	But Micaiah said, “If you ever return safely, the 
2CH.18.28	Then the king of Israel and Judah’s King Jehoshaphat went up to Ramoth-gilead. 
2CH.18.29	But the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your royal attire.” So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Aram had ordered his chariot commanders, “Do not fight with anyone at all
2CH.18.31	When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they shouted, “He must be the king of Israel!” So they turned to attack him, but Jehoshaphat cried out
2CH.18.32	When the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.
2CH.18.33	But a man drew his bow without taking special aim and struck the king of Israel through the joints of his armor. So he said to the charioteer, “Turn around and take me out of the battle,
2CH.18.34	The battle raged throughout that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans until evening. Then he died at sunset.
2CH.19.1	King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned to his home in Jerusalem in peace. 
2CH.19.2	Then Jehu
2CH.19.3	However, some good is found in you, for you have eradicated the Asherah poles from the land and have decided to seek God.”
2CH.19.4	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, and once again he went out among the people from Beer-sheba to the hill country of Ephraim and brought them back to the 
2CH.19.5	He appointed judges in all the fortified cities of the land of Judah, city by city.
2CH.19.6	Then he said to the judges, “Consider what you are doing, for you do not judge for a mere mortal, but for the 
2CH.19.7	And now, may the terror of the 
2CH.19.8	Jehoshaphat also appointed in Jerusalem some of the Levites and priests and some of the Israelite family heads for deciding the 
2CH.19.9	He commanded them, saying, “In the fear of the 
2CH.19.10	For every dispute that comes to you from your brothers who dwell in their cities — whether it regards differences of bloodguilt, law, commandment, statutes, or judgments
2CH.19.11	“Note that Amariah, the chief priest, is over you in all matters related to the 
2CH.20.1	After this, the Moabites and Ammonites, together with some of the Meunites,
2CH.20.2	People came and told Jehoshaphat, “A vast number from beyond the Dead Sea and from Edom
2CH.20.3	Jehoshaphat was afraid, and he resolved
2CH.20.4	who gathered to seek the 
2CH.20.5	Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the 
2CH.20.6	He said:
2CH.20.7	Are you not our God who drove out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel
2CH.20.8	They have lived in the land and have built you a sanctuary in it for your name and have said, 
2CH.20.9	“If disaster comes on us — sword or judgment, pestilence or famine
2CH.20.10	Now here are the Ammonites, Moabites, and the inhabitants of Mount Seir.
2CH.20.11	Look how they repay us by coming to drive us out of your possession that you gave us as an inheritance. 
2CH.20.12	Our God, will you not judge them?
2CH.20.13	All Judah was standing before the 
2CH.20.14	In the middle of the congregation, the Spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	and he said, “Listen carefully, all Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat. This is what the 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow, go down against them. You will see them coming up the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley facing the Wilderness of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	You do not have to fight this battle. Position yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of the 
2CH.20.18	Then Jehoshaphat knelt low with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell down before the 
2CH.20.19	Then the Levites from the sons of the Kohathites and the Korahites
2CH.20.20	In the morning they got up early and went out to the wilderness of Tekoa. As they were about to go out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem. Believe in the 
2CH.20.21	Then he consulted with the people and appointed some to sing for the 
2CH.20.21	Give thanks to the 
2CH.20.21	for his faithful love endures forever.
2CH.20.22	The moment they began their shouts and praises, the 
2CH.20.23	The Ammonites and Moabites turned against the inhabitants of Mount Seir and completely annihilated them.
2CH.20.24	When Judah came to a place overlooking the wilderness, they looked for the large army, but there were only corpses lying on the ground; nobody had escaped. 
2CH.20.25	Then Jehoshaphat and his people went to gather the plunder. They found among them
2CH.20.26	They assembled in the Valley of Beracah
2CH.20.27	Then all the men of Judah and Jerusalem turned back with Jehoshaphat their leader, returning joyfully to Jerusalem, for the 
2CH.20.28	So they came into Jerusalem to the 
2CH.20.29	The terror of God
2CH.20.30	Then Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was quiet, for his God gave him rest on every side.
2CH.20.31	Jehoshaphat became king over Judah.
2CH.20.32	He walked in the ways of Asa his father; he did not turn away from it but did what was right in the 
2CH.20.33	However, the high places were not taken away;
2CH.20.34	The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat’s reign from beginning to end are written in the Events of Jehu
2CH.20.35	After this,
2CH.20.36	Jehoshaphat formed an alliance with him to make ships to go to Tarshish,
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, “Because you formed an alliance with Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.1	Jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His son Jehoram
2CH.21.2	He had brothers, sons of Jehoshaphat: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of King Jehoshaphat of Judah.
2CH.21.3	Their father had given them many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable things, along with fortified cities
2CH.21.4	When Jehoram had established himself over his father’s kingdom, he strengthened his position by killing with the sword all his brothers as well as some of the princes of Israel.
2CH.21.5	Jehoram
2CH.21.6	He walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Ahab had done,
2CH.21.7	but for the sake of the covenant the 
2CH.21.8	During Jehoram’s reign, Edom rebelled against Judah’s control and appointed their own king. 
2CH.21.9	So Jehoram crossed into Edom with his commanders and all his chariots. Then at night he set out to attack the Edomites who had surrounded him and the chariot commanders. 
2CH.21.10	And now Edom is still in rebellion against Judah’s control today. Libnah also rebelled at that time against his control because he had abandoned the 
2CH.21.11	Jehoram also built high places
2CH.21.12	Then a letter came to Jehoram from the prophet Elijah, saying:
2CH.21.12	This is what the 
2CH.21.13	but have walked in the ways of the kings of Israel,
2CH.21.14	the 
2CH.21.15	You yourself will be struck with many illnesses, including a disease of the intestines, until your intestines come out day after day because of the disease.”
2CH.21.16	The 
2CH.21.17	So they went to war against Judah and invaded it. They carried off all the possessions found in the king’s palace and also his sons and wives; not a son was left to him except Jehoahaz,
2CH.21.18	After all these things, the 
2CH.21.19	This continued day after day until two full years passed. Then his intestines came out because of his disease, and he died from severe
2CH.21.20	Jehoram
2CH.22.1	Then the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his place, because the troops that had come with the Arabs
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah
2CH.22.3	He walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother gave him evil advice. 
2CH.22.4	So he did what was evil in the 
2CH.22.5	He also followed their advice and went with Joram
2CH.22.6	so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds they inflicted on him in Ramoth-gilead
2CH.22.7	Ahaziah’s downfall came from God when he went to Joram.
2CH.22.8	So when Jehu executed judgment on the house of Ahab,
2CH.22.9	Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah,
2CH.22.10	When
2CH.22.11	Jehoshabeath,
2CH.22.12	While Athaliah reigned over the land, he was hiding with them in God’s temple six years.
2CH.23.1	Then, in the seventh year,
2CH.23.2	They made a circuit throughout Judah. They gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the family heads of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
2CH.23.3	Then the whole assembly made a covenant with the king in God’s temple. Jehoiada said to them, “Here is the king’s son! He will reign, just as the 
2CH.23.4	This is what you are to do: a third of you, priests and Levites who are coming on duty on the Sabbath,
2CH.23.5	A third are to be at the king’s palace, and a third are to be at the Foundation Gate, and all the troops will be in the courtyards of the 
2CH.23.6	No one is to enter the 
2CH.23.7	Completely surround the king with weapons in hand. Anyone who enters the temple is to be put to death. Be with the king in all his daily tasks.”
2CH.23.8	So the commanders of hundreds did everything the priest Jehoiada commanded. They each brought their men — those coming on duty on the Sabbath and those going off duty on the Sabbath — for the priest Jehoiada did not release the divisions.
2CH.23.9	The priest Jehoiada gave to the commanders of hundreds King David’s spears, shields, and quivers
2CH.23.10	Then he stationed all the troops with their weapons in hand surrounding the king — from the right side of the temple to the left side, by the altar and by the temple.
2CH.23.11	They brought out the king’s son, put the crown on him, gave him the testimony,
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the noise from the troops, the guards, and those praising the king, she went to the troops in the 
2CH.23.13	As she looked, there was the king standing by his pillar
2CH.23.14	Then the priest Jehoiada sent out the commanders of hundreds, those in charge of the army, saying, “Take her out between the ranks, and put anyone who follows her to death by the sword,” for the priest had said, “Don’t put her to death in the 
2CH.23.15	So they arrested her, and she went by the entrance of the Horse Gate
2CH.23.16	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself, the king, and the people that they would be the 
2CH.23.17	So all the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They smashed its altars and images and killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, at the altars.
2CH.23.18	Then Jehoiada put the oversight of the 
2CH.23.19	He stationed gatekeepers
2CH.23.20	Then he took with him the commanders of hundreds, the nobles, the governors of the people, and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the 
2CH.23.21	All the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet, for they had put Athaliah to death by the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash
2CH.24.2	Throughout the time of the priest Jehoiada, Joash did what was right in the 
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada acquired two wives for him, and he was the father of sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	Afterward,
2CH.24.5	So he gathered the priests and Levites and said, “Go out to the cities of Judah and collect silver from all Israel to repair the temple of your God as needed year by year,
2CH.24.5	However, the Levites did not hurry. 
2CH.24.6	So the king called Jehoiada the high priest and said, “Why haven’t you required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax imposed by the 
2CH.24.7	For the sons of that wicked Athaliah broke into the 
2CH.24.8	At the king’s command a chest was made and placed outside the gate of the 
2CH.24.9	Then a proclamation
2CH.24.10	All the leaders and all the people rejoiced, brought the tax, and put it in the chest until it was full. 
2CH.24.11	Whenever the chest was brought by the Levites to the king’s overseers, and when they saw that there was a large amount of silver, the king’s secretary and the high priest’s deputy came and emptied the chest, picked it up, and returned it to its place. They did this daily and gathered the silver in abundance. 
2CH.24.12	Then the king and Jehoiada gave it to those in charge of the labor on the 
2CH.24.13	The workmen did their work, and through them the repairs progressed. They restored God’s temple to its specifications and reinforced it. 
2CH.24.14	When they finished, they presented the rest of the silver to the king and Jehoiada, who made articles for the 
2CH.24.15	Jehoiada died when he was old and full of days; he was 130 years old at his death. 
2CH.24.16	He was buried in the city of David with the kings
2CH.24.17	However, after Jehoiada died, the rulers of Judah came and paid homage to the king. Then the king listened to them, 
2CH.24.18	and they abandoned the temple of the 
2CH.24.19	Nevertheless, he sent them prophets
2CH.24.20	The Spirit of God enveloped
2CH.24.21	But they conspired against him and stoned him at the king’s command in the courtyard of the 
2CH.24.22	King Joash didn’t remember the kindness that Zechariah’s father Jehoiada had extended to him, but killed his son. While he was dying, he said, “May the 
2CH.24.23	At the turn of the year, an Aramean army attacked Joash.
2CH.24.24	Although the Aramean army came with only a few men, the 
2CH.24.25	When
2CH.24.26	Those who conspired against him were Zabad, son of the Ammonite woman Shimeath, and Jehozabad, son of the Moabite woman Shimrith.
2CH.24.27	The accounts concerning his sons, the many divine pronouncements about him, and the restoration
2CH.25.1	Amaziah
2CH.25.2	He did what was right in the 
2CH.25.3	As soon as the kingdom was firmly in his grasp,
2CH.25.4	However, he did not put their children to death, because — as it is written in the Law, in the book of Moses,
2CH.25.5	Then Amaziah gathered Judah and assembled them according to ancestral families,
2CH.25.6	Then for 7,500 pounds
2CH.25.7	However, a man of God
2CH.25.8	But if you go with them, do it! Be strong for battle! But God will make you stumble before the enemy,
2CH.25.9	Then Amaziah said to the man of God, “What should I do about the 7,500 pounds of silver I gave to Israel’s division?”
2CH.25.9	The man of God replied, “The 
2CH.25.10	So Amaziah released the division that came to him from Ephraim to go home. But they got very angry with Judah and returned home in a fierce rage.
2CH.25.11	Amaziah strengthened his position and led his people to the Salt Valley. He struck down ten thousand Seirites,
2CH.25.12	and the Judahites captured ten thousand alive. They took them to the top of a cliff where they threw them off, and all of them were dashed to pieces.
2CH.25.13	As for the men of the division that Amaziah sent back so they would not go with him into battle, they raided the cities of Judah from Samaria to Beth-horon, struck down three thousand of their people, and took a great deal of plunder.
2CH.25.14	After Amaziah came from the attack on the Edomites, he brought the gods of the Seirites and set them up as his gods. He worshiped before them and burned incense to them.
2CH.25.15	So the 
2CH.25.16	While he was still speaking to him, the king asked, “Have we made you the king’s counselor? Stop, why should you lose your life?”
2CH.25.16	So the prophet stopped, but he said, “I know that God intends to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to my advice.”
2CH.25.17	King Amaziah of Judah took counsel
2CH.25.18	King Jehoash of Israel sent word to King Amaziah of Judah, saying, “The thistle in Lebanon sent a message to the cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as a wife.’ Then a wild animal in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thistle.
2CH.25.19	You have said, ‘Look, I
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not listen, for this turn of events was from God in order to hand them over to their enemies because they went after the gods of Edom. 
2CH.25.21	So King Jehoash of Israel advanced. He and King Amaziah of Judah met face to face at Beth-shemesh that belonged to Judah. 
2CH.25.22	Judah was routed before Israel, and each man fled to his own tent. 
2CH.25.23	King Jehoash of Israel captured Judah’s King Amaziah son of Joash, son of Jehoahaz,
2CH.25.24	He took all the gold, silver, all the utensils that were found with Obed-edom
2CH.25.25	Judah’s King Amaziah
2CH.25.26	The rest of the events of Amaziah’s reign, from beginning to end, are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
2CH.25.27	From the time Amaziah turned from following the 
2CH.25.28	They carried him back on horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2CH.26.1	All the people
2CH.26.2	After Amaziah the king rested with his fathers, Uzziah rebuilt Eloth
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old
2CH.26.4	He did what was right in the 
2CH.26.5	He sought God
2CH.26.6	Uzziah went out to wage war against the Philistines,
2CH.26.7	God helped him against the Philistines, the Arabs that live in Gur-baal, and the Meunites. 
2CH.26.8	The Ammonites
2CH.26.9	Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate,
2CH.26.10	Since he had many cattle both in the Judean foothills
2CH.26.11	Uzziah had an army equipped for combat that went out to war by division according to their assignments, as recorded by Jeiel the court secretary and Maaseiah the officer under the authority of Hananiah, one of the king’s commanders. 
2CH.26.12	The total number of family heads was 2,600 valiant warriors. 
2CH.26.13	Under their authority was an army of 307,500 equipped for combat, a powerful force to help the king against the enemy.
2CH.26.14	Uzziah provided the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and slingstones. 
2CH.26.15	He made skillfully designed devices in Jerusalem to shoot arrows and catapult large stones for use on the towers and on the corners. So his fame spread even to distant places, for he was wondrously helped until he became strong.
2CH.26.16	But when he became strong, he grew arrogant,
2CH.26.17	The priest Azariah,
2CH.26.18	They took their stand
2CH.26.19	Uzziah, with a firepan in his hand to offer incense, was enraged. But when he became enraged with the priests, in the presence of the priests in the 
2CH.26.20	Then Azariah the chief priest and all the priests turned to him and saw that he was diseased on his forehead. They rushed him out of there. He himself also hurried to get out because the 
2CH.26.21	So King Uzziah was diseased to the time of his death.
2CH.26.22	Now the prophet Isaiah
2CH.26.23	Uzziah rested with his fathers, and he was buried with his fathers in the burial ground of the kings’ cemetery,
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty-five years old
2CH.27.2	He did what was right in the 
2CH.27.3	Jotham built the Upper Gate of the 
2CH.27.4	He also built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests.
2CH.27.5	He waged war against the king of the Ammonites. He overpowered the Ammonites, and that year they gave him 7,500 pounds
2CH.27.6	So Jotham strengthened his position because he did not waver in obeying
2CH.27.7	As for the rest of the events
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	Jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. His son Ahaz became king in his place.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old
2CH.28.2	for he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel
2CH.28.3	He burned incense in Ben Hinnom Valley
2CH.28.4	He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places,
2CH.28.5	So the 
2CH.28.5	Ahaz was also handed over to the king of Israel, who struck him with great force: 
2CH.28.6	Pekah son of Remaliah killed one hundred twenty thousand in Judah in one day — all brave men — because they had abandoned the 
2CH.28.7	An Ephraimite warrior named Zichri killed the king’s son Maaseiah, Azrikam governor of the palace, and Elkanah who was second to the king. 
2CH.28.8	Then the Israelites took two hundred thousand captives from their brothers — women, sons, and daughters.
2CH.28.9	A prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	Now you plan to reduce the people of Judah and Jerusalem, male and female, to slavery. Are you not also guilty before the 
2CH.28.11	Listen to me and return the captives you took from your brothers,
2CH.28.12	So some men who were leaders of the Ephraimites — Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berechiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai — stood in opposition to those coming from the war. 
2CH.28.13	They said to them, “You must not bring the captives here, for you plan to bring guilt on us from the 
2CH.28.14	The army left the captives and the plunder in the presence of the officers and the congregation. 
2CH.28.15	Then the men who were designated by name
2CH.28.16	At that time King Ahaz asked the king of Assyria for help.
2CH.28.17	The Edomites came again, attacked Judah, and took captives.
2CH.28.18	The Philistines also raided the cities of the Judean foothills
2CH.28.19	For the 
2CH.28.20	Then King Tiglath-pileser
2CH.28.21	Although Ahaz plundered the 
2CH.28.22	At the time of his distress, King Ahaz himself became more unfaithful to the 
2CH.28.23	He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus which had defeated him; he said, “Since the gods of the kings of Aram are helping them, I will sacrifice to them so that they will help me.”
2CH.28.24	Then Ahaz gathered up the utensils of God’s temple, cut them into pieces,
2CH.28.25	He made high places in every city of Judah to offer incense to other gods, and he angered the 
2CH.28.26	As for the rest of his deeds
2CH.28.27	Ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city, in Jerusalem, but they did not bring him into the tombs of the kings of Israel. His son Hezekiah became king in his place.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah was twenty-five years old
2CH.29.2	He did what was right in the 
2CH.29.3	In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the 
2CH.29.4	Then he brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the eastern public square.
2CH.29.5	He said to them, “Hear me, Levites. Consecrate yourselves
2CH.29.6	For our fathers were unfaithful and did what is evil in the sight of the 
2CH.29.7	They also closed the doors of the portico, extinguished the lamps, did not burn incense, and did not offer burnt offerings in the holy place of the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	Therefore, the wrath of the 
2CH.29.9	Our fathers fell by the sword, and our sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity because of this.
2CH.29.10	It is in my heart now to make a covenant with the 
2CH.29.11	My sons, don’t be negligent now, for the 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites stood up:
2CH.29.12	Mahath
2CH.29.12	Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel from the Merarites;
2CH.29.12	Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah from the Gershonites;
2CH.29.13	Shimri and Jeuel from the Elizaphanites;
2CH.29.13	Zechariah and Mattaniah from the Asaphites;
2CH.29.14	Jehiel
2CH.29.14	Shemaiah and Uzziel from the Jeduthunites.
2CH.29.15	They gathered their brothers together, consecrated themselves,
2CH.29.16	The priests went to the entrance of the 
2CH.29.17	They began the consecration on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the portico of the 
2CH.29.18	Then they went inside to King Hezekiah and said, “We have cleansed the whole temple of the 
2CH.29.19	We have set up and consecrated all the utensils that King Ahaz rejected during his reign
2CH.29.20	King Hezekiah got up early, gathered the city officials, and went to the 
2CH.29.21	They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the sanctuary, and for Judah. Then he told the descendants of Aaron, the priests, to offer them on the altar of the 
2CH.29.22	So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests received the blood and splattered it on the altar.
2CH.29.23	Then they brought the goats for the sin offering right into the presence of the king and the congregation, who laid their hands on them.
2CH.29.24	The priests slaughtered the goats and put their blood on the altar for a sin offering, to make atonement for all Israel,
2CH.29.25	Hezekiah stationed the Levites in the 
2CH.29.26	The Levites stood with the instruments of David,
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be offered on the altar. When the burnt offerings began, the song of the 
2CH.29.28	The whole assembly was worshiping, singing the song, and blowing the trumpets — all this continued until the burnt offering was completed. 
2CH.29.29	When the burnt offerings were completed, the king and all those present with him bowed down and worshiped.
2CH.29.30	Then King Hezekiah and the officials told the Levites to sing praise to the 
2CH.29.31	Hezekiah concluded, “Now you are consecrated
2CH.29.32	The number of burnt offerings the congregation brought was seventy bulls, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for a burnt offering to the 
2CH.29.33	Six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats were consecrated.
2CH.29.34	However, since there were not enough priests, they weren’t able to skin all the burnt offerings, so their Levite brothers helped them
2CH.29.35	Furthermore, the burnt offerings were abundant, along with the fat of the fellowship offerings
2CH.29.35	So the service of the 
2CH.29.36	Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over how God had prepared the people, for it had come about suddenly.
2CH.30.1	Then Hezekiah sent word throughout all Israel and Judah, and he also wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the 
2CH.30.2	For the king and his officials and the entire congregation in Jerusalem decided to observe the Passover of the 
2CH.30.3	because they were not able to observe it at the appropriate time. Not enough of the priests had consecrated themselves,
2CH.30.4	The proposal pleased the king and the congregation, 
2CH.30.5	so they affirmed the proposal and spread the message throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan,
2CH.30.6	So the couriers
2CH.30.7	Don’t be like your fathers and your brothers who were unfaithful to the 
2CH.30.8	Don’t become obstinate
2CH.30.9	for when you return to the 
2CH.30.10	The couriers traveled from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but the inhabitants
2CH.30.11	But some from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
2CH.30.12	Also, the power of God was at work in Judah to unite them
2CH.30.13	A very large assembly of people was gathered in Jerusalem to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread in the second month. 
2CH.30.14	They proceeded to take away the altars that were in Jerusalem,
2CH.30.15	They slaughtered the Passover lamb
2CH.30.16	They stood at their prescribed posts,
2CH.30.17	for there were many in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves, and so the Levites were in charge of slaughtering the Passover lambs for every unclean person to consecrate the lambs to the 
2CH.30.18	A large number of the people — many from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun — were ritually unclean, yet they had eaten the Passover
2CH.30.19	whoever sets his whole heart on seeking God,
2CH.30.20	So the 
2CH.30.21	The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy,
2CH.30.22	Then Hezekiah encouraged
2CH.30.23	The whole congregation decided to observe
2CH.30.24	for King Hezekiah of Judah contributed one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for the congregation. Also, the officials contributed one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep for the congregation,
2CH.30.25	Then the whole assembly of Judah with the priests and Levites, the whole assembly that came from Israel, the resident aliens who came from the land of Israel, and those who were living in Judah, rejoiced. 
2CH.30.26	There was great rejoicing in Jerusalem, for nothing like this was known since the days of Solomon son of David, the king of Israel.
2CH.30.27	Then the priests and the Levites
2CH.31.1	When all this was completed, all Israel who had attended went out to the cities of Judah and broke up the sacred pillars, chopped down the Asherah poles, and tore down the high places and altars
2CH.31.2	Hezekiah reestablished the divisions
2CH.31.3	The king contributed
2CH.31.4	He told the people who lived in Jerusalem to give a contribution
2CH.31.5	When the word spread, the Israelites gave liberally of the best of the grain, new wine, fresh oil, honey, and of all the produce of the field, and they brought in an abundance, a tenth
2CH.31.6	As for the Israelites and Judahites who lived in the cities of Judah, they also brought a tenth of the herds and flocks, and a tenth of the dedicated things that were consecrated to the 
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began building up the piles, and they finished in the seventh month. 
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and his officials came and viewed the piles, they blessed the 
2CH.31.9	Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the piles. 
2CH.31.10	The chief priest Azariah, of the household of Zadok,
2CH.31.11	Hezekiah told them to prepare chambers
2CH.31.12	The offering, the tenth, and the dedicated things were brought faithfully. Conaniah the Levite was the officer in charge of them, and his brother Shimei was second.
2CH.31.13	Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were deputies under the authority of Conaniah and his brother Shimei by appointment of King Hezekiah and of Azariah the chief official of God’s temple.
2CH.31.14	Kore son of Imnah the Levite, the keeper of the East Gate, was over the freewill offerings to God to distribute the contribution to the 
2CH.31.15	Eden,
2CH.31.16	In addition, they distributed it to males registered by genealogy three
2CH.31.17	They distributed also to those recorded by genealogy of the priests by their ancestral families and the Levites twenty years old and above,
2CH.31.18	to those registered by genealogy — with all their dependents, wives, sons, and daughters — of the whole assembly (for they had faithfully consecrated themselves as holy); 
2CH.31.19	and to the descendants of Aaron, the priests, in the common fields of their cities,
2CH.31.20	Hezekiah did this throughout all Judah. He did what was good and upright and true before the 
2CH.31.21	He was diligent in every deed that he began in the service of God’s temple, in the instruction and the commands, in order to seek his God, and he prospered.
2CH.32.1	After these faithful deeds, King Sennacherib of Assyria came and entered Judah. He laid siege to the fortified cities and intended
2CH.32.2	Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and that he planned
2CH.32.3	so he consulted with his officials and his warriors about stopping up the water of the springs that were outside the city, and they helped him. 
2CH.32.4	Many people gathered and stopped up all the springs
2CH.32.5	Then Hezekiah strengthened his position by rebuilding the entire broken-down wall
2CH.32.6	He set military commanders over the people and gathered the people in the square of the city gate. Then he encouraged them,
2CH.32.7	“Be strong and courageous!
2CH.32.8	He has only human strength,
2CH.32.9	After this,
2CH.32.10	“This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says: ‘What are you relying on that you remain in Jerusalem under siege? 
2CH.32.11	Isn’t Hezekiah misleading you to give you over to death by famine and thirst when he says, “The 
2CH.32.12	Didn’t Hezekiah himself remove his high places and his altars
2CH.32.13	“‘Don’t you know
2CH.32.14	Who among all the gods of these nations that my predecessors completely destroyed was able to rescue his people from my power, that your God should be able to deliver you from my power?
2CH.32.15	So now,
2CH.32.16	His servants said more against the 
2CH.32.17	He also wrote letters to mock the 
2CH.32.17	Just like the national gods of the lands that did not rescue their people from my power, so Hezekiah’s God will not rescue his people from my power.
2CH.32.18	Then they called out loudly in Hebrew
2CH.32.19	They spoke against the God of Jerusalem like they had spoken against the gods of the peoples of the earth, which were made by human hands.
2CH.32.20	King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed about this and cried out to heaven,
2CH.32.21	and the 
2CH.32.22	So the 
2CH.32.23	Many were bringing an offering to the 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah became sick to the point of death, so he prayed to the 
2CH.32.25	However, because his heart was proud,
2CH.32.26	Then Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart — he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem — so the 
2CH.32.27	Hezekiah had abundant riches and glory, and he made himself treasuries for silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and every desirable item. 
2CH.32.28	He made warehouses for the harvest of grain, new wine, and fresh oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and pens for flocks. 
2CH.32.29	He made cities for himself, and he acquired vast numbers of flocks and herds, for God gave him abundant possessions.
2CH.32.30	This same Hezekiah blocked the outlet of the water of the Upper Gihon
2CH.32.31	When the ambassadors of Babylon’s rulers
2CH.32.32	As for the rest of the events
2CH.32.33	Hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried on the ascent to the tombs of David’s descendants. All Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem paid him honor at his death. His son Manasseh became king in his place.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old
2CH.33.2	He did what was evil in the 
2CH.33.3	He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had torn down
2CH.33.4	He built altars
2CH.33.5	He built altars to all the stars in the sky in both courtyards
2CH.33.6	He passed his sons through the fire in Ben Hinnom Valley.
2CH.33.7	Manasseh
2CH.33.8	I will never again remove the feet of the Israelites from the land where I stationed your
2CH.33.9	So Manasseh caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to stray so that they did worse evil than the nations the 
2CH.33.10	The 
2CH.33.11	So he brought against them the military commanders of the king of Assyria. They captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him with bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon.
2CH.33.12	When he was in distress, he sought the favor of the 
2CH.33.13	He prayed to him, and the 
2CH.33.14	After this, he built the outer wall of the city of David from west of Gihon
2CH.33.15	He removed the foreign gods and the idol
2CH.33.16	He built
2CH.33.17	However, the people still sacrificed at the high places,
2CH.33.18	The rest of the events
2CH.33.19	His prayer and how God was receptive to his prayer, and all his sin and unfaithfulness and the sites where he built high places and set up Asherah poles and carved images before he humbled himself, they are written in the Events of Hozai. 
2CH.33.20	Manasseh rested with his fathers, and he was buried in his own house. His son Amon became king in his place.
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.22	He did what was evil in the 
2CH.33.23	But he did not humble himself before the 
2CH.33.24	So his servants conspired against him and put him to death
2CH.33.25	The common people
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old
2CH.34.2	He did what was right in the 
2CH.34.3	In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still a youth, Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David,
2CH.34.4	Then in his presence the altars of the Baals were torn down, and he chopped down the shrines
2CH.34.5	He burned the bones of the priests on their altars.
2CH.34.6	He did the same in the cities
2CH.34.7	He tore down the altars, and he smashed the Asherah poles and the carved images to powder. He chopped down all the shrines throughout the land of Israel and returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	In the eighteenth year of his reign,
2CH.34.9	So they went to the high priest Hilkiah
2CH.34.10	They gave it to those doing the work — those who oversaw the 
2CH.34.11	they gave it to the carpenters and builders and also used it to buy quarried stone and timbers — for joining and making beams — for the buildings that Judah’s kings had destroyed.
2CH.34.12	The men were doing the work with integrity. Their overseers were Jahath and Obadiah, Levites from the Merarites, and Zechariah and Meshullam from the Kohathites as supervisors. The Levites were all skilled with musical instruments.
2CH.34.13	They were also over the porters and were supervising all those doing the work task by task. Some of the Levites were secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers.
2CH.34.14	When they brought out the silver that had been deposited in the 
2CH.34.15	Consequently,
2CH.34.16	Shaphan took the book to the king, and also reported, “Your servants are doing all that was placed in their hands. 
2CH.34.17	They have emptied out the silver that was found in the 
2CH.34.18	Then the court secretary Shaphan told the king, “The priest Hilkiah gave me a book,” and Shaphan read from it in the presence of the king.
2CH.34.19	When the king heard the words of the law, he tore his clothes.
2CH.34.20	Then he commanded Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Abdon son of Micah, the court secretary Shaphan, and the king’s servant Asaiah, 
2CH.34.21	“Go and inquire of the 
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah and those the king had designated
2CH.34.23	She said to them, “This is what the 
2CH.34.24	‘This is what the 
2CH.34.25	because they have abandoned me
2CH.34.26	Say this to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the 
2CH.34.27	because
2CH.34.28	‘I will indeed gather you to your fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace. Your eyes will not see all the disaster that I am bringing on this place and on its inhabitants.’”
2CH.34.28	Then they reported to the king.
2CH.34.29	So the king sent messengers and gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.30	The king went up to the 
2CH.34.31	Then the king stood at his post
2CH.34.32	He had all those present in Jerusalem and Benjamin agree
2CH.34.33	So Josiah removed everything that was detestable from all the lands belonging to the Israelites,
2CH.35.1	Josiah observed the 
2CH.35.2	He appointed the priests to their responsibilities and encouraged them to serve in the 
2CH.35.3	He said to the Levites who taught all Israel
2CH.35.4	“Organize your ancestral families
2CH.35.5	Serve in the holy place by the groupings of the ancestral families
2CH.35.6	Slaughter the Passover lambs,
2CH.35.7	Then Josiah donated thirty thousand sheep, lambs, and young goats, plus three thousand cattle from his own possessions, for the Passover sacrifices for all the lay people who were present.
2CH.35.8	His officials also donated willingly for the people, the priests, and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, chief officials of God’s temple, gave twenty-six hundred Passover sacrifices and three hundred cattle for the priests. 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah
2CH.35.10	So the service was established; the priests stood at their posts and the Levites in their divisions according to the king’s command.
2CH.35.11	Then they slaughtered the Passover lambs, and while the Levites were skinning the animals,
2CH.35.12	They removed the burnt offerings so that they might be given to the groupings of the ancestral families
2CH.35.13	They roasted the Passover lambs with fire according to regulation.
2CH.35.14	Afterward, they made preparations for themselves and for the priests, since the priests, the descendants of Aaron, were busy offering up burnt offerings and fat until night. So the Levites made preparations for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
2CH.35.15	The singers, the descendants of Asaph, were at their stations according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun the king’s seer.
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the 
2CH.35.17	The Israelites who were present in Judah also observed the Passover at that time and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
2CH.35.18	No Passover had been observed
2CH.35.19	In the eighteenth year of Josiah’s reign, this Passover was observed.
2CH.35.20	After all this
2CH.35.21	But Neco sent messengers to him, saying, “What is the issue between you and me, king of Judah?
2CH.35.22	But Josiah did not turn away from him; instead, in order to fight with him he disguised himself.
2CH.35.23	The archers shot King Josiah, and he said to his servants, “Take me away, for I am severely wounded!” 
2CH.35.24	So his servants took him out of the war chariot, carried him in his second chariot, and brought him to Jerusalem. Then he died, and they buried him in the tomb of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned
2CH.35.25	Jeremiah chanted a dirge
2CH.35.26	The rest of the events
2CH.35.27	and his words, from beginning to end, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.1	Then
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz
2CH.36.3	The king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and fined the land seventy-five hundred pounds
2CH.36.4	Then King Neco of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s brother Eliakim king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took his brother Jehoahaz and brought him to Egypt.
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.6	Now King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked him
2CH.36.7	Also Nebuchadnezzar took some of the articles of the 
2CH.36.8	The rest of the deeds of Jehoiakim,
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eighteen
2CH.36.10	In the spring
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old
2CH.36.12	He did what was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.13	He also rebelled against
2CH.36.14	All the leaders of the priests and the people multiplied their unfaithful deeds, imitating all the detestable practices of the nations, and they defiled the 
2CH.36.15	But the 
2CH.36.16	But they kept ridiculing God’s messengers,
2CH.36.17	So he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans,
2CH.36.18	He took everything to Babylon — all the articles of God’s temple, large and small, the treasures of the 
2CH.36.19	Then the Chaldeans burned God’s temple.
2CH.36.20	He deported those who escaped from the sword to Babylon, and they became servants to him and his sons until the rise of the Persian
2CH.36.21	This fulfilled the word of the 
2CH.36.22	In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia,
2CH.36.23	This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: The 
EZR.1.1	In
EZR.1.2	This is what King Cyrus of Persia says: “The 
EZR.1.3	Any of his people among you, may his God be with him, and may he go to Jerusalem in Judah and build the house of the 
EZR.1.4	Let every survivor,
EZR.1.5	So the family heads of Judah and Benjamin, along with the priests and Levites — everyone whose spirit God had roused
EZR.1.6	All their neighbors supported them
EZR.1.7	King Cyrus also brought out the articles of the 
EZR.1.8	King Cyrus of Persia had them brought out under the supervision of Mithredath the treasurer, who counted them out to Sheshbazzar the prince of Judah.
EZR.1.9	This was the inventory:
EZR.1.9	30 gold basins, 1,000 silver basins,

EZR.2.70	The priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, and some of the people settled in their towns, and the rest of Israel settled in their towns.
EZR.3.1	When the seventh month arrived,
EZR.3.2	Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers the priests along with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel
EZR.3.3	They set up the altar on its foundation and offered burnt offerings for the morning and evening on it to the 
EZR.3.4	They celebrated the Festival of Shelters as prescribed, and offered burnt offerings each day, based on the number specified by ordinance for each festival day.
EZR.3.5	After that, they offered the regular burnt offering and the offerings for the beginning of each month
EZR.3.6	On the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the 
EZR.3.7	They gave money to the stonecutters and artisans, and gave food, drink, and oil to the people of Sidon and Tyre, so they would bring cedar wood from Lebanon to Joppa by sea,
EZR.3.8	In the second month of the second year after they arrived at God’s house in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak,
EZR.3.9	Jeshua with his sons and brothers, Kadmiel with his sons, and the sons of Judah
EZR.3.10	When the builders had laid the foundation of the 
EZR.3.11	They sang with praise and thanksgiving to the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the older priests, Levites, and family heads, who had seen the first temple, wept loudly when they saw the foundation of this temple,
EZR.3.13	The people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shouting from that of the
EZR.4.1	When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin
EZR.4.2	they approached Zerubbabel and the family heads and said to them, “Let us build with you, for we also worship your God and have been sacrificing to him
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other heads of Israel’s families answered them, “You may have no part with us in building a house for our God,
EZR.4.4	Then the people who were already in the land
EZR.4.5	They also bribed officials to act against them to frustrate their plans
EZR.4.6	At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus,
EZR.4.7	During the time of King Artaxerxes of Persia,
EZR.4.8	Rehum the chief deputy and Shimshai the scribe
EZR.4.9	From Rehum
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the peoples whom the great and illustrious Ashurbanipal
EZR.4.11	This is the text of the letter they sent to him:
EZR.4.11	To King Artaxerxes from your servants, the men from the region west of the Euphrates River:
EZR.4.12	Let it be known to the king that the Jews who came from you have returned to us at Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and evil city, finishing its walls, and repairing its foundations. 
EZR.4.13	Let it now be known to the king that if that city is rebuilt and its walls are finished,
EZR.4.14	Since we have taken an oath of loyalty to the king,
EZR.4.15	that a search should be made in your fathers’ record books.
EZR.4.16	We advise the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are finished, you will not have any possession west of the Euphrates.
EZR.4.17	The king sent a reply to his chief deputy Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their colleagues living in Samaria and elsewhere in the region west of the Euphrates River:
EZR.4.17	Greetings.
EZR.4.18	The letter you sent us has been translated and read
EZR.4.19	I issued a decree and a search was conducted. It was discovered that this city has had uprisings against kings since ancient times, and there have been rebellions and revolts in it. 
EZR.4.20	Powerful kings have also ruled over Jerusalem and exercised authority over the whole region west of the Euphrates River, and tribute, duty, and land tax were paid to them. 
EZR.4.21	Therefore, issue an order for these men to stop, so that this city will not be rebuilt until a further decree has been pronounced by me.
EZR.4.22	See that you not neglect this matter. Otherwise, the damage will increase and the royal interests
EZR.4.23	As soon as the text of King Artaxerxes’s letter was read to Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their colleagues,
EZR.4.24	Now the construction of God’s house in Jerusalem had stopped and remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
EZR.5.1	But when the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo
EZR.5.2	Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak
EZR.5.3	At that time Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues
EZR.5.4	They also asked them, “What are the names of the workers
EZR.5.5	But God was watching
EZR.5.6	This is the text of the letter that Tattenai the governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues, the officials in the region, sent to King Darius. 
EZR.5.7	They sent him a report, written as follows:
EZR.5.7	To King Darius:
EZR.5.7	All greetings.
EZR.5.8	Let it be known to the king that we went to the house of the great God in the province of Judah. It is being built with cut
EZR.5.9	So we questioned the elders and asked, “Who gave you the order to rebuild this temple and finish this structure?” 
EZR.5.10	We also asked them for their names, so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information.
EZR.5.11	This is the reply they gave us:
EZR.5.11	We are the servants of the God of the heavens and earth, and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.
EZR.5.12	But since our fathers angered the God of the heavens, he handed them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
EZR.5.13	However, in the first year of King Cyrus of Babylon, he issued a decree to rebuild the house of God.
EZR.5.14	He also took from the temple in Babylon the gold and silver articles of God’s house that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and carried them to the temple in Babylon.
EZR.5.15	Cyrus told him, “Take these articles, put them in the temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its original site.”
EZR.5.16	Then this same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of God’s house in Jerusalem.
EZR.5.17	So if it pleases the king, let a search of the royal archives
EZR.6.1	King Darius gave the order, and they searched
EZR.6.2	But it was in the fortress of Ecbatana in the province of Media
EZR.6.3	In the first year of King Cyrus, he issued a decree
EZR.6.3	Let the house be rebuilt as a place for offering sacrifices, and let its original foundations be retained.
EZR.6.4	with three layers of cut
EZR.6.5	The gold and silver articles of God’s house that Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and carried to Babylon must also be returned. They are to be brought to the temple in Jerusalem where they belong
EZR.6.6	Therefore, you must stay away from that place, Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and your
EZR.6.7	Leave the construction of the house of God alone. Let the governor
EZR.6.8	I hereby issue a decree concerning what you are to do, so that the elders of the Jews can rebuild the house of God:
EZR.6.8	The cost is to be paid in full to these men out of the royal revenues
EZR.6.9	Whatever is needed — young bulls, rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of the heavens, or wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as requested by the priests in Jerusalem — let it be given to them every day without fail,
EZR.6.10	so that they can offer sacrifices of pleasing aroma to the God of the heavens and pray for the life of the king and his sons.
EZR.6.11	I also issue a decree concerning any man who interferes with this directive:
EZR.6.11	Let a beam be torn from his house and raised up; he will be impaled on it, and his house will be made into a garbage dump because of this offense.
EZR.6.12	May the God who caused his name to dwell there
EZR.6.13	Then Tattenai governor of the region west of the Euphrates River, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues
EZR.6.14	So the Jewish elders continued successfully with the building under the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah son of Iddo.
EZR.6.15	This house was completed on the third day of the month of Adar
EZR.6.16	Then the Israelites, including the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the exiles, celebrated the dedication of the house of God with joy. 
EZR.6.17	For the dedication of God’s house they offered one hundred bulls, two hundred rams, and four hundred lambs, as well as twelve male goats
EZR.6.18	They also appointed the priests by their divisions and the Levites by their groups to the service of God in Jerusalem, according to what is written in the book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	The exiles
EZR.6.20	All of the priests and Levites were ceremonially clean, because they had purified themselves. They killed the Passover lamb for themselves, their priestly brothers, and all the exiles.
EZR.6.21	The Israelites who had returned from exile
EZR.6.22	They observed the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days
EZR.7.1	After these events, during the reign of King Artaxerxes
EZR.7.1	Seraiah’s
EZR.7.1	Hilkiah’s
EZR.7.2	Shallum’s son,
EZR.7.2	Zadok’s
EZR.7.3	Amariah’s son, Azariah’s son,
EZR.7.3	Meraioth’s son, 
EZR.7.4	Zerahiah’s son,
EZR.7.4	Uzzi’s son, Bukki’s son,
EZR.7.5	Abishua’s son, Phinehas’s son,
EZR.7.5	Eleazar’s son, the chief priest Aaron’s son
EZR.7.6	— came up from Babylon. He was a scribe skilled in the law of Moses,
EZR.7.7	Some of the Israelites, priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and temple servants
EZR.7.8	Ezra
EZR.7.9	He began the journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month
EZR.7.10	Now Ezra had determined in his heart to study the law of the 
EZR.7.11	This is the text of the letter King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra the priest and scribe, an expert in matters of the 
EZR.7.12	Artaxerxes, king of kings,
EZR.7.12	Greetings.
EZR.7.13	I issue a decree that any of the Israelites in my kingdom, including their priests and Levites, who want to go to Jerusalem, may go with you.
EZR.7.14	You are sent by the king and his seven counselors
EZR.7.15	You are also to bring the silver and gold the king and his counselors have willingly given to the God of Israel,
EZR.7.16	and all the silver and gold you receive throughout the province of Babylon, together with the freewill offerings given by the people and the priests to the house of their God in Jerusalem.
EZR.7.17	Then you are to be diligent to buy with this money bulls, rams, and lambs, along with their grain and drink offerings, and offer them on the altar at the house of your God in Jerusalem.
EZR.7.18	You may do whatever seems best to you and your brothers with the rest of the silver and gold, according to the will of your God. 
EZR.7.19	Deliver to the God of Jerusalem all the articles given to you for the service of the house of your God.
EZR.7.20	You may use the royal treasury
EZR.7.21	I, King Artaxerxes, issue a decree to all the treasurers in the region west of the Euphrates River:
EZR.7.21	Whatever Ezra the priest, an expert in the law of the God of the heavens, asks of you must be provided in full,
EZR.7.22	up to 7,500 pounds
EZR.7.23	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven must be done diligently for the house of the God of the heavens, so that wrath will not fall on the realm of the king and his sons.
EZR.7.24	Be advised that you do not have authority to impose tribute, duty, and land tax on any priests, Levites, singers, doorkeepers, temple servants, or other servants of this house of God.
EZR.7.25	And you, Ezra, according to
EZR.7.26	Anyone who does not keep the law of your God and the law of the king, let the appropriate judgment be executed against him, whether death, banishment, confiscation of property, or imprisonment.
EZR.7.27	Blessed be the 
EZR.7.28	and who has shown favor to me before the king,
EZR.8.1	These are the family heads and the genealogical records of those who returned with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes:
EZR.8.2	Gershom, from Phinehas’s descendants;
EZR.8.2	Daniel, from Ithamar’s descendants;
EZR.8.2	Hattush, from David’s descendants,
EZR.8.3	who was of Shecaniah’s descendants;
EZR.8.3	Zechariah, from Parosh’s
EZR.8.3	and 150 men
EZR.8.4	Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah
EZR.8.4	from Pahath-moab’s descendants,
EZR.8.4	and 200 men with him;
EZR.8.5	Shecaniah
EZR.8.5	from Zattu’s descendants,
EZR.8.5	and 300 men with him;
EZR.8.6	Ebed son of Jonathan
EZR.8.6	from Adin’s descendants,
EZR.8.6	and 50 men with him;
EZR.8.7	Jeshaiah son of Athaliah
EZR.8.7	from Elam’s descendants,
EZR.8.7	and 70 men with him;
EZR.8.8	Zebadiah son of Michael
EZR.8.8	from Shephatiah’s descendants,
EZR.8.8	and 80 men with him;
EZR.8.9	Obadiah son of Jehiel
EZR.8.9	from Joab’s descendants,
EZR.8.9	and 218 men with him;
EZR.8.10	Shelomith
EZR.8.10	from Bani’s descendants,
EZR.8.10	and 160 men with him;
EZR.8.11	Zechariah son of Bebai
EZR.8.11	from Bebai’s descendants,
EZR.8.11	and 28 men with him;
EZR.8.12	Johanan son of Hakkatan
EZR.8.12	from Azgad’s descendants,
EZR.8.12	and 110 men with him;
EZR.8.13	these are the last ones, from Adonikam’s descendants,
EZR.8.13	and their names are
EZR.8.13	Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah,
EZR.8.13	and 60 men with them;
EZR.8.14	Uthai and Zaccur
EZR.8.14	from Bigvai’s descendants,
EZR.8.14	and 70 men with them.
EZR.8.15	I gathered them at the river
EZR.8.16	Then I summoned the leaders: Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam,
EZR.8.17	I sent them to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia, with a message for
EZR.8.18	Since the gracious hand of our God was on us,
EZR.8.19	plus Hashabiah,
EZR.8.20	There were also 220 of the temple servants,
EZR.8.21	I proclaimed a fast
EZR.8.22	I did this because I was ashamed to ask the king for infantry and cavalry to protect us from enemies during the journey, since we had told him, “The hand of our God is gracious to all who seek him, but his fierce anger is against all who abandon him.”
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and pleaded with our God about this, and he was receptive to our prayer.
EZR.8.24	I selected twelve of the leading priests, along with Sherebiah,
EZR.8.25	I weighed out to them the silver, the gold, and the articles — the contribution for the house of our God that the king, his counselors, his leaders, and all the Israelites who were present had offered. 
EZR.8.26	I weighed out to them 24 tons
EZR.8.27	twenty gold bowls worth a thousand gold coins,
EZR.8.28	Then I said to them, “You are holy to the 
EZR.8.29	Guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the 
EZR.8.30	So the priests and Levites took charge of the silver, the gold, and the articles that had been weighed out, to bring them to the house of our God in Jerusalem.
EZR.8.31	We set out from the Ahava River on the twelfth day of the first month to go to Jerusalem. We were strengthened by our God,
EZR.8.32	So we arrived at Jerusalem and rested there for three days.
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day the silver, the gold, and the articles were weighed out in the house of our God into the care of the priest Meremoth son of Uriah. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him. The Levites Jozabad
EZR.8.34	Everything was verified by number and weight, and the total weight was recorded at that time.
EZR.8.35	The exiles who had returned from the captivity
EZR.8.36	They also delivered the king’s edicts to the royal satraps and governors of the region west of the Euphrates,
EZR.9.1	After these things had been done, the leaders approached me and said: “The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves
EZR.9.2	Indeed, the Israelite men
EZR.9.3	When I heard this report, I tore my tunic and robe, pulled out some of the hair from my head and beard, and sat down devastated.
EZR.9.4	Everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel
EZR.9.5	At the evening offering, I got up from my time of humiliation, with my tunic and robe torn. Then I fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the 
EZR.9.6	And I said:
EZR.9.6	My God, I am ashamed and embarrassed to lift my face toward you, my God, because our iniquities are higher than our heads and our guilt is as high as the heavens.
EZR.9.7	Our guilt has been terrible from the days of our fathers until the present. Because of our iniquities we have been handed over, along with our kings and priests, to the surrounding kings, and to the sword, captivity, plundering, and open shame,
EZR.9.8	But now, for a brief moment, grace has come from the 
EZR.9.9	Though we are slaves,
EZR.9.10	Now, our God, what can we say in light of
EZR.9.11	you gave through your servants the prophets, saying: “The land you are entering to possess is an impure land. The surrounding peoples have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness by their impurity and detestable practices.
EZR.9.12	So do not give your daughters to their sons in marriage or take their daughters for your sons.
EZR.9.13	After all that has happened to us because of our evil deeds and terrible guilt — though you, our God, have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have allowed us to survive
EZR.9.14	should we break your commands again and intermarry with the peoples who commit these detestable practices?
EZR.9.15	 God of Israel, you are righteous, for we survive as a remnant
EZR.10.1	While Ezra prayed and confessed, weeping and falling facedown
EZR.10.2	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel,
EZR.10.3	Let us therefore make a covenant before our God
EZR.10.4	Get up, for this matter is your responsibility,
EZR.10.5	Then Ezra got up and made the leading priests, Levites, and all Israel take an oath to do what had been said; so they took the oath.
EZR.10.6	Ezra then went from the house of God and walked to the chamber of Jehohanan son of Eliashib, where he spent the night.
EZR.10.7	They circulated a proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should gather at Jerusalem. 
EZR.10.8	Whoever did not come within three days would forfeit all his possessions,
EZR.10.9	So all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem within the three days. On the twentieth day of the ninth month, all the people sat in the square at the house of God,
EZR.10.10	Then the priest Ezra stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful by marrying foreign women, adding to Israel’s guilt.
EZR.10.11	Therefore, make a confession to the 
EZR.10.12	Then all the assembly responded loudly: “Yes, we will do as you say! 
EZR.10.13	But there are many people, and it is the rainy season. We don’t have the stamina to stay out in the open. This isn’t something that can be done in a day or two, for we have rebelled terribly in this matter. 
EZR.10.14	Let our leaders represent the entire assembly. Then let all those in our towns who have married foreign women come at appointed times, together with the elders and judges of each town, in order to avert the fierce anger of our God
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this, with Meshullam
EZR.10.16	The exiles did what had been proposed. The priest Ezra selected men
EZR.10.17	and by the first day of the first month they had dealt with all the men who had married foreign women.
EZR.10.18	The following were found to have married foreign women from the descendants of the priests:
EZR.10.18	from the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and his brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
EZR.10.19	They pledged
EZR.10.20	Hanani and Zebadiah from Immer’s
EZR.10.21	Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah from Harim’s
EZR.10.22	Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethanel, Jozabad, and Elasah from Pashhur’s
EZR.10.23	The Levites:
EZR.10.23	Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah (that is Kelita), Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
EZR.10.24	The singers:
EZR.10.24	Eliashib.
EZR.10.24	The gatekeepers:
EZR.10.24	Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
EZR.10.25	The Israelites:
EZR.10.25	Parosh’s descendants:
EZR.10.26	Elam’s descendants:
EZR.10.27	Zattu’s descendants:
EZR.10.28	Bebai’s descendants:
EZR.10.29	Bani’s descendants:
EZR.10.30	Pahath-moab’s descendants:
EZR.10.31	Harim’s descendants:
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah;
EZR.10.33	Hashum’s descendants:
EZR.10.34	Bani’s descendants:
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Cheluhi, 
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, Jaasu, 
EZR.10.38	Bani, Binnui, Shimei, 
EZR.10.39	Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, 
EZR.10.40	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 
EZR.10.41	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph;
EZR.10.43	Nebo’s descendants:
EZR.10.44	All of these
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah
NEH.1.1	During the month of Chislev
NEH.1.2	Hanani,
NEH.1.3	They said to me, “The remnant in the province,
NEH.1.4	When I heard these words, I sat down and wept. I mourned for a number of days, fasting and praying
NEH.1.5	I said,
NEH.1.6	let your eyes be open and your ears be attentive
NEH.1.7	We have acted corruptly toward you and have not kept the commands, statutes, and ordinances you gave your servant Moses.
NEH.1.8	Please remember what you commanded your servant Moses: “If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples.
NEH.1.9	But if you return to me and carefully observe my commands, even though your exiles were banished to the farthest horizon,
NEH.1.10	They are your servants and your people. You redeemed them by your great power and strong hand.
NEH.1.11	Please, Lord, let your ear be attentive
NEH.1.11	At the time, I was the king’s cupbearer.
NEH.2.1	During the month of Nisan in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes,
NEH.2.2	so the king said to me, “Why are you
NEH.2.2	I was overwhelmed with fear 
NEH.2.3	and replied to the king, “May the king live forever! Why should I
NEH.2.4	Then the king asked me, “What is your request?”
NEH.2.4	So I prayed to the God of the heavens
NEH.2.5	and answered the king, “If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor with you, send me to Judah and to the city where my ancestors are buried,
NEH.2.6	The king, with the queen seated beside him, asked me, “How long will your journey take, and when will you return?” So I gave him a definite time,
NEH.2.7	I also said to the king: “If it pleases the king, let me have letters written to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates River,
NEH.2.8	And let me have a letter written to Asaph, keeper of the king’s forest, so that he will give me timber to rebuild the gates of the temple’s fortress,
NEH.2.9	I went to the governors of the region west of the Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters.
NEH.2.10	When Sanballat the Horonite
NEH.2.11	After I arrived in Jerusalem and had been there three days,
NEH.2.12	I got up at night and took a few men with me. I didn’t tell anyone what my God had laid on my heart to do for Jerusalem. The only animal I took
NEH.2.13	I went out at night through the Valley Gate toward the Serpent’s
NEH.2.14	I went on to the Fountain Gate
NEH.2.15	So I went up at night by way of the valley and inspected the wall. Then heading back, I entered through the Valley Gate
NEH.2.16	The officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing, for I had not yet told the Jews, priests, nobles, officials, or the rest of those who would be doing the work. 
NEH.2.17	So I said to them, “You see the trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned.
NEH.2.18	I told them how the gracious hand of my God had been on me,
NEH.2.18	They said, “Let’s start rebuilding,” and their hands were strengthened
NEH.2.19	When Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite official,
NEH.2.20	I gave them this reply, “The God of the heavens is the one who will grant us success. We, his servants, will start building, but you have no share, right, or historic claim in Jerusalem.”
NEH.3.1	The high priest Eliashib
NEH.3.2	The men of Jericho

NEH.3.16	After him Nehemiah son of Azbuk, ruler of half the district of Beth-zur,
NEH.3.17	Next to him the Levites
NEH.3.18	After him their fellow Levites made repairs under Binnui
NEH.3.19	Next to him Ezer son of Jeshua, ruler of Mizpah, made repairs to another section opposite the ascent to the armory at the Angle.
NEH.3.20	After him Baruch son of Zabbai
NEH.3.21	Beside him Meremoth
NEH.3.22	And next to him the priests from the surrounding area made repairs.
NEH.3.23	After them Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs opposite their house. Beside them Azariah son of Maaseiah, son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his house. 
NEH.3.24	After him Binnui

NEH.3.26	and the temple servants
NEH.3.27	Next to him the Tekoites
NEH.3.28	Each of the priests made repairs above the Horse Gate,
NEH.3.29	After them Zadok son of Immer made repairs opposite his house. And beside him Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, guard of the East Gate, made repairs. 
NEH.3.30	Next to him Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph made repairs to another section.
NEH.3.30	After them Meshullam son of Berechiah made repairs opposite his room. 
NEH.3.31	Next to him Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths,
NEH.3.32	The goldsmiths
NEH.4.1	When Sanballat
NEH.4.2	before his colleagues and the powerful men
NEH.4.3	Then Tobiah the Ammonite,
NEH.4.4	Listen, our God, for we are despised. Make their insults return on their own heads and let them be taken as plunder to a land of captivity. 
NEH.4.5	Do not cover their guilt or let their sin be erased from your sight, because they have angered
NEH.4.6	So we rebuilt the wall until the entire wall was joined together up to half its height, for the people had the will to keep working.
NEH.4.7	When Sanballat, Tobiah, and the Arabs,
NEH.4.8	They all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and throw it into confusion. 
NEH.4.9	So we prayed to our God and stationed a guard because of them day and night.
NEH.4.10	In Judah, it was said:
NEH.4.10	The strength of the laborer fails,
NEH.4.10	since there is so much rubble.
NEH.4.10	We will never be able
NEH.4.10	to rebuild the wall.
NEH.4.11	And our enemies said, “They won’t realize it
NEH.4.12	When the Jews who lived nearby arrived, they said to us time and again,
NEH.4.13	So I stationed people behind the lowest sections of the wall, at the vulnerable areas. I stationed them by families with their swords, spears, and bows. 
NEH.4.14	After I made an inspection, I stood up and said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people,
NEH.4.15	When our enemies heard that we knew their scheme and that God had frustrated it, every one of us returned to his own work on the wall. 
NEH.4.16	From that day on, half of my men did the work while the other half held spears, shields, bows, and armor.
NEH.4.17	who were rebuilding the wall. The laborers who carried the loads worked with one hand and held a weapon with the other. 
NEH.4.18	Each of the builders had his sword strapped around his waist while he was building, and the trumpeter was beside me. 
NEH.4.19	Then I said to the nobles, the officials, and the rest of the people:
NEH.4.20	Wherever you hear the trumpet sound, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us!” 
NEH.4.21	So we continued the work, while half of the men were holding spears from daybreak until the stars came out. 
NEH.4.22	At that time, I also said to the people, “Let everyone and his servant spend the night inside Jerusalem, so that they can stand guard by night and work by day.” 
NEH.4.23	And I, my brothers, my servants, and the men of the guard with me never took off our clothes. Each carried his weapon, even when washing.
NEH.5.1	There was a widespread outcry from the people and their wives against their Jewish countrymen. 
NEH.5.2	Some were saying, “We, our sons, and our daughters are numerous. Let us get grain so that we can eat and live.” 
NEH.5.3	Others were saying, “We are mortgaging our fields, vineyards, and homes to get grain during the famine.”
NEH.5.4	Still others were saying, “We have borrowed money to pay the king’s tax
NEH.5.5	We and our children are just like our countrymen and their children, yet we are subjecting our sons and daughters to slavery.
NEH.5.6	I became extremely angry
NEH.5.7	After seriously considering the matter, I accused the nobles and officials, saying to them, “Each of you is charging his countrymen interest.”
NEH.5.8	and said, “We have done our best to buy back our Jewish countrymen who were sold to foreigners, but now you sell your own countrymen, and we have to buy them back.”
NEH.5.9	Then I said, “What you are doing isn’t right. Shouldn’t you walk in the fear of our God
NEH.5.10	Even I, as well as my brothers and my servants, have been lending them money and grain. Please, let us stop charging this interest.
NEH.5.11	Return their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and houses to them immediately, along with the percentage
NEH.5.12	They responded: “We will return these things and require nothing more from them.
NEH.5.12	So I summoned the priests and made everyone take an oath
NEH.5.13	I also shook the folds of my robe and said, “May God likewise shake from his house and property everyone who doesn’t keep this promise. May he be shaken out
NEH.5.13	The whole assembly said, “Amen,” and they praised the 
NEH.5.14	Furthermore, from the day King Artaxerxes
NEH.5.15	The governors
NEH.5.16	Instead, I devoted myself to the construction of this wall,
NEH.5.17	There were 150 Jews and officials, as well as guests from the surrounding nations at my table.
NEH.5.18	Each
NEH.5.19	Remember me favorably, my God, for all that I have done for this people.
NEH.6.1	When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies
NEH.6.2	Sanballat and Geshem
NEH.6.3	So I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing important work and cannot come down. Why should the work cease while I leave it and go down to you?” 
NEH.6.4	Four times they sent me the same proposal, and I gave them the same reply.
NEH.6.5	Sanballat
NEH.6.6	In it was written:
NEH.6.6	It is reported among the nations — and Geshem
NEH.6.7	and have even set up the prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim on your behalf: “There is a king in Judah.”
NEH.6.8	Then I replied to him, “There is nothing to these rumors you are spreading; you are inventing them in your own mind.”
NEH.6.9	For they were all trying to intimidate
NEH.6.9	But now, my God, strengthen my hands.
NEH.6.10	I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, who was restricted to his house. He said:
NEH.6.10	Let’s meet at the house of God,
NEH.6.10	inside the temple.
NEH.6.10	Let’s shut the temple doors
NEH.6.10	because they’re coming to kill you.
NEH.6.10	They’re coming to kill you tonight!
NEH.6.11	But I said, “Should a man like me run away? How can someone like me enter the temple and live?
NEH.6.12	I realized that God had not sent him, because of the prophecy he spoke against me. Tobiah and Sanballat
NEH.6.13	He was hired, so that I would be intimidated,
NEH.6.14	My God, remember
NEH.6.15	The wall was completed
NEH.6.16	When all our enemies
NEH.6.17	During those days, the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah,
NEH.6.18	For many in Judah were bound by oath
NEH.6.19	These nobles kept mentioning Tobiah’s good deeds to me, and they reported my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to intimidate
NEH.7.1	When the wall had been rebuilt and I had the doors installed,
NEH.7.2	Then I put my brother Hanani
NEH.7.3	I said to them, “Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot, and let the doors be shut and securely fastened while the guards are on duty. Station the citizens of Jerusalem as guards, some at their posts and some at their homes.”
NEH.7.4	The city was large and spacious, but there were few people in it, and no houses had been built yet.
NEH.7.5	Then my God put it into my mind

NEH.7.73	When the seventh month
NEH.8.1	When the seventh month came and the Israelites had settled in their towns, all the people gathered together
NEH.8.2	On the first day of the seventh month,
NEH.8.3	While he was facing the square in front of the Water Gate,
NEH.8.4	The scribe Ezra stood on a high wooden platform
NEH.8.5	Ezra opened the book in full view of all the people, since he was elevated above everyone. As he opened it, all the people stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Ezra blessed the 
NEH.8.7	Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah,
NEH.8.8	They read out of the book of the law of God, translating and giving the meaning so that the people could understand what was read. 
NEH.8.9	Nehemiah the governor,
NEH.8.10	Then he said to them, “Go and eat what is rich, drink what is sweet, and send portions to those who have nothing prepared,
NEH.8.11	And the Levites quieted all the people, saying, “Be still,
NEH.8.12	Then all the people began to eat and drink, send portions, and have a great celebration,
NEH.8.13	On the second day, the family heads of all the people, along with the priests and Levites,
NEH.8.14	They found written in the law how the 
NEH.8.15	So they proclaimed and spread this news throughout their towns and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the hill country and bring back branches of olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees to make shelters, just as it is written.”
NEH.8.16	The people went out, brought back branches, and made shelters for themselves on each of their rooftops
NEH.8.17	The whole community that had returned from exile
NEH.8.18	Ezra
NEH.9.1	On the twenty-fourth day of this month
NEH.9.2	Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners,
NEH.9.3	While they stood in their places,
NEH.9.4	Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the raised platform built for the Levites
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites — Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah
NEH.9.5	Blessed be your glorious name,
NEH.9.5	and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise.
NEH.9.6	You,
NEH.9.6	You created the heavens,
NEH.9.6	the highest heavens with all their stars,
NEH.9.6	the earth and all that is on it,
NEH.9.6	the seas and all that is in them.
NEH.9.6	You give life to all of them,
NEH.9.6	and all the stars of heaven worship you.
NEH.9.7	You, the 
NEH.9.7	are the God who chose Abram
NEH.9.7	and brought him out of Ur of the Chaldeans,
NEH.9.7	and changed his name to Abraham.
NEH.9.8	You found his heart faithful in your sight,
NEH.9.8	and made a covenant with him
NEH.9.8	to give the land of the Canaanites,
NEH.9.8	Hethites, Amorites, Perizzites,
NEH.9.8	Jebusites, and Girgashites —
NEH.9.8	to give it to his descendants.
NEH.9.8	You have fulfilled your promise,
NEH.9.8	for you are righteous.
NEH.9.9	You saw the oppression of our ancestors in Egypt
NEH.9.9	and heard their cry at the Red Sea.
NEH.9.10	You performed signs and wonders against Pharaoh,
NEH.9.10	all his officials, and all the people of his land,
NEH.9.10	for you knew how arrogantly they treated our ancestors.
NEH.9.10	You made a name for yourself
NEH.9.10	that endures to this day.
NEH.9.11	You divided the sea before them,
NEH.9.11	and they crossed through it on dry ground.
NEH.9.11	You hurled their pursuers into the depths
NEH.9.11	like a stone into raging water.
NEH.9.12	You led them with a pillar of cloud by day,
NEH.9.12	and with a pillar of fire by night,
NEH.9.12	to illuminate the way they should go.
NEH.9.13	You came down on Mount Sinai,
NEH.9.13	and spoke to them from heaven.
NEH.9.13	You gave them impartial ordinances, reliable instructions,
NEH.9.13	and good statutes and commands.
NEH.9.14	You revealed your holy Sabbath to them,
NEH.9.14	and gave them commands, statutes, and instruction
NEH.9.14	through your servant Moses.
NEH.9.15	You provided bread from heaven
NEH.9.15	you brought them water from the rock
NEH.9.15	You told them to go in and possess the land
NEH.9.15	you had sworn
NEH.9.16	But our ancestors acted arrogantly;
NEH.9.16	they became stiff-necked and did not listen to your commands.
NEH.9.17	They refused to listen
NEH.9.17	and did not remember your wonders
NEH.9.17	you performed among them.
NEH.9.17	They became stiff-necked and appointed a leader
NEH.9.17	to return to their slavery in Egypt.
NEH.9.17	But you are a forgiving God,
NEH.9.17	gracious and compassionate,
NEH.9.17	slow to anger and abounding in faithful love,
NEH.9.17	and you did not abandon them.
NEH.9.18	Even after they had cast an image of a calf
NEH.9.18	for themselves and said,
NEH.9.18	“This is your god who brought you out of Egypt,”
NEH.9.18	and they had committed terrible blasphemies,
NEH.9.19	you did not abandon them in the wilderness
NEH.9.19	because of your great compassion.
NEH.9.19	During the day the pillar of cloud
NEH.9.19	never turned away from them,
NEH.9.19	guiding them on their journey.
NEH.9.19	And during the night the pillar of fire
NEH.9.19	illuminated the way they should go.
NEH.9.20	You sent your good Spirit
NEH.9.20	You did not withhold your manna
NEH.9.20	and you gave them water for their thirst.
NEH.9.21	You provided for them in the wilderness forty years,
NEH.9.21	and they lacked nothing.
NEH.9.21	Their clothes did not wear out,
NEH.9.21	and their feet did not swell.
NEH.9.22	You gave them kingdoms and peoples
NEH.9.22	and established boundaries for them.
NEH.9.22	They took possession
NEH.9.22	of the land of King Sihon
NEH.9.22	and of the land of King Og of Bashan.
NEH.9.23	You multiplied their descendants
NEH.9.23	like the stars of the sky
NEH.9.23	and brought them to the land
NEH.9.23	you told their ancestors to go in and possess.
NEH.9.24	So their descendants went in and possessed the land:
NEH.9.24	You subdued the Canaanites who inhabited the land before them
NEH.9.24	and handed their kings and the surrounding peoples over to them,
NEH.9.24	to do as they pleased with them.
NEH.9.25	They captured fortified cities and fertile land
NEH.9.25	and took possession of well-supplied houses,
NEH.9.25	cisterns cut out of rock, vineyards,
NEH.9.25	olive groves, and fruit trees in abundance.
NEH.9.25	They ate, were filled,
NEH.9.25	became prosperous, and delighted in your great goodness.
NEH.9.26	But they were disobedient and rebelled against you.
NEH.9.26	They flung your law behind their backs
NEH.9.26	and killed your prophets
NEH.9.26	who warned them
NEH.9.26	in order to turn them back to you.
NEH.9.26	They committed terrible blasphemies.
NEH.9.27	So you handed them over to their enemies,
NEH.9.27	who oppressed them.
NEH.9.27	In their time of distress, they cried out to you,
NEH.9.27	and you heard from heaven.
NEH.9.27	In your abundant compassion
NEH.9.27	you gave them deliverers, who rescued them
NEH.9.27	from the power of their enemies.
NEH.9.28	But as soon as they had relief,
NEH.9.28	they again did what was evil in your sight.
NEH.9.28	So you abandoned them to the power of their enemies,
NEH.9.28	who dominated them.
NEH.9.28	When they cried out to you again,
NEH.9.28	you heard from heaven and rescued them
NEH.9.28	many times in your compassion.
NEH.9.29	You warned them to turn back to your law,
NEH.9.29	but they acted arrogantly
NEH.9.29	and would not obey your commands.
NEH.9.29	They sinned against your ordinances,
NEH.9.29	which a person will live by if he does them.
NEH.9.29	They stubbornly resisted,
NEH.9.29	stiffened their necks, and would not obey.
NEH.9.30	You were patient with them for many years,
NEH.9.30	and your Spirit warned them through your prophets,
NEH.9.30	but they would not listen.
NEH.9.30	Therefore, you handed them over to the surrounding peoples.
NEH.9.31	However, in your abundant compassion,
NEH.9.31	you did not destroy them or abandon them,
NEH.9.31	for you are a gracious and compassionate God.
NEH.9.32	So now, our God — the great, mighty,
NEH.9.32	and awe-inspiring God who keeps his gracious covenant
NEH.9.32	do not view lightly all the hardships that have afflicted us,
NEH.9.32	our kings and leaders,
NEH.9.32	our priests and prophets,
NEH.9.32	our ancestors and all your people,
NEH.9.32	from the days of the Assyrian kings
NEH.9.33	You are righteous concerning all that has happened to us,
NEH.9.33	because you have acted faithfully,
NEH.9.33	while we have acted wickedly.
NEH.9.34	Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors
NEH.9.34	did not obey your law
NEH.9.34	or listen to your commands

NEH.11.25	As for the farming settlements with their fields:

NEH.12.22	In the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, the heads of the families of the Levites and priests were recorded while Darius the Persian ruled. 
NEH.12.23	Levi’s descendants, the family heads, were recorded in the Book of the Historical Events
NEH.12.24	The heads of the Levites — Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua son of Kadmiel, along with their relatives opposite them — gave praise and thanks, division by division, as David the man of God had prescribed.
NEH.12.25	This included Mattaniah,
NEH.12.26	These served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor
NEH.12.27	At the dedication of the wall
NEH.12.28	The singers gathered from the region around Jerusalem, from the settlements of the Netophathites,
NEH.12.29	from Beth-gilgal, and from the fields of Geba and Azmaveth, for they had built settlements for themselves around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	After the priests and Levites had purified themselves, they purified the people, the city gates, and the wall.
NEH.12.31	Then I brought the leaders of Judah up on top of the wall, and I appointed two large processions that gave thanks. One went to the right on the wall, toward the Dung Gate.
NEH.12.32	Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed, 
NEH.12.33	along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.12.35	and some of the priests’ sons with trumpets, and Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, son of Asaph followed 
NEH.12.36	as well as his relatives — Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God.
NEH.12.37	At the Fountain Gate
NEH.12.38	The second thanksgiving procession went to the left, and I followed it with half the people along the top of the wall, past the Tower of the Ovens
NEH.12.39	above the Ephraim Gate,
NEH.12.40	The two thanksgiving processions stood in the house of God. So did I and half of the officials accompanying me, 
NEH.12.41	as well as the priests:
NEH.12.41	Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin,
NEH.12.41	Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,
NEH.12.41	and Hananiah, with trumpets;
NEH.12.42	and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar,
NEH.12.42	Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer.
NEH.12.42	Then the singers sang, with Jezrahiah as the leader. 
NEH.12.43	On that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced because God had given them great joy.
NEH.12.44	On that same day men were placed in charge of the rooms
NEH.12.45	They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, along with the singers and gatekeepers,
NEH.12.46	For long ago, in the days of David and Asaph,
NEH.12.47	So in the days of Zerubbabel
NEH.13.1	At that time
NEH.13.2	because they did not meet the Israelites with food and water. Instead, they hired Balaam against them to curse them,
NEH.13.3	When they heard the law, they separated all those of mixed descent
NEH.13.4	Now before this, the priest Eliashib
NEH.13.5	and had prepared a large room for him where they had previously stored the grain offerings, the frankincense, the articles, and the tenths of grain, new wine, and fresh oil
NEH.13.6	While all this was happening, I was not in Jerusalem, because I had returned to King Artaxerxes
NEH.13.7	so I could return to Jerusalem. Then I discovered the evil that Eliashib had done on behalf of Tobiah by providing him a room in the courts of God’s house. 
NEH.13.8	I was greatly displeased and threw all of Tobiah’s household possessions out of the room. 
NEH.13.9	I ordered that the rooms be purified,
NEH.13.10	I also found out that because the portions for the Levites had not been given,
NEH.13.11	Therefore, I rebuked the officials, asking, “Why has the house of God been neglected?” 
NEH.13.12	Then all Judah brought a tenth of the grain, new wine, and fresh oil into the storehouses.
NEH.13.13	I appointed as treasurers over the storehouses the priest Shelemiah, the scribe Zadok, and Pedaiah of the Levites, with Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah to assist them, because they were considered trustworthy.
NEH.13.14	Remember me for this, my God, and don’t erase the deeds of faithful love I have done for the house of my God and for its services.
NEH.13.15	At that time I saw people in Judah treading winepresses on the Sabbath. They were also bringing in stores of grain and loading them on donkeys, along with wine, grapes, and figs. All kinds of goods were being brought to Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them against selling food on that day.
NEH.13.16	The Tyrians living there were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them on the Sabbath to the people of Judah in Jerusalem.
NEH.13.17	I rebuked the nobles of Judah and said to them: “What is this evil you are doing — profaning the Sabbath day?
NEH.13.18	Didn’t your ancestors do the same, so that our God brought all this disaster on us and on this city?
NEH.13.19	When shadows began to fall on the city gates of Jerusalem just before the Sabbath, I gave orders that the city gates be closed and not opened until after the Sabbath.
NEH.13.20	Once or twice the merchants and those who sell all kinds of goods camped outside Jerusalem, 
NEH.13.21	but I warned them, “Why are you camping in front of the wall? If you do it again, I’ll use force
NEH.13.22	Then I instructed the Levites to purify themselves
NEH.13.22	Remember me for this also, my God,
NEH.13.23	In those days I also saw Jews who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
NEH.13.24	Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples but could not speak Hebrew.
NEH.13.25	I rebuked them, cursed them, beat some of their men, and pulled out their hair.
NEH.13.26	Didn’t King Solomon of Israel sin in matters like this? There was not a king like him among many nations. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, yet foreign women drew him into sin.
NEH.13.27	Why then should we hear about you doing all this terrible evil and acting unfaithfully against our God by marrying foreign women?” 
NEH.13.28	Even one of the sons of Jehoiada, son of the high priest Eliashib,
NEH.13.29	Remember them, my God, for defiling the priesthood as well as the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
NEH.13.30	So I purified them from everything foreign
NEH.13.31	I also arranged for the donation of wood at the appointed times and for the firstfruits.
NEH.13.31	Remember me, my God, with favor.
EST.1.1	These events took place during the days of Ahasuerus,
EST.1.2	In those days King Ahasuerus reigned from his royal throne
EST.1.3	He held a feast
EST.1.4	He displayed the glorious wealth of his kingdom and the magnificent splendor of his greatness
EST.1.5	At the end of this time, the king held a week-long banquet
EST.1.6	White and violet linen hangings were fastened with fine white and purple linen cords to silver rods on marble
EST.1.7	Drinks were served in an array of gold goblets,
EST.1.8	The drinking was according to royal decree: “There are no restrictions.” The king had ordered every wine steward in his household to serve whatever each person wanted. 
EST.1.9	Queen Vashti also gave a feast for the women of King Ahasuerus’s palace.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the king was feeling good from the wine,
EST.1.11	to bring Queen Vashti before him with her royal crown. He wanted to show off her beauty to the people and the officials, because she was very beautiful.
EST.1.12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s command that was delivered by his eunuchs. The king became furious and his anger burned within him.
EST.1.13	The king consulted the wise men
EST.1.14	The most trusted ones
EST.1.15	The king asked, “According to the law, what should be done with Queen Vashti, since she refused to obey King Ahasuerus’s command that was delivered by the eunuchs?”
EST.1.16	Memucan said in the presence of the king and his officials, “Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king, but all the officials and the peoples who are in every one of King Ahasuerus’s provinces.
EST.1.17	For the queen’s action will become public knowledge to all the women and cause them to despise their husbands and say, ‘King Ahasuerus ordered Queen Vashti brought before him, but she did not come.’ 
EST.1.18	Before this day is over, the noble women of Persia and Media who hear about the queen’s act will say the same thing to all the king’s officials, resulting in more contempt and fury.
EST.1.19	“If it meets the king’s approval, he should personally issue a royal decree. Let it be recorded in the laws of Persia and Media, so that it cannot be revoked:
EST.1.20	The decree the king issues will be heard throughout his vast kingdom,
EST.1.21	The king and his counselors approved the proposal, and he followed Memucan’s advice. 
EST.1.22	He sent letters to all the royal provinces, to each province in its own script and to each ethnic group in its own language,
EST.2.1	Some time later,
EST.2.2	The king’s personal attendants suggested, “Let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king.
EST.2.3	Let the king appoint commissioners
EST.2.4	Then the young woman who pleases the king
EST.2.5	In the fortress of Susa, there was a Jewish man named Mordecai
EST.2.6	He had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the other captives when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon took King Jeconiah of Judah into exile.
EST.2.7	Mordecai was the legal guardian of his cousin
EST.2.8	When the king’s command and edict became public knowledge and when many young women were gathered at the fortress of Susa under Hegai’s supervision, Esther was taken to the palace, into the supervision of Hegai, keeper of the women. 
EST.2.9	The young woman pleased him and gained his favor so that he accelerated the process of the beauty treatments and the special diet that she received. He assigned seven hand-picked female servants to her from the palace and transferred her and her servants to the harem’s best quarters.
EST.2.10	Esther did not reveal her ethnicity or her family background, because Mordecai had ordered her not to make them known. 
EST.2.11	Every day Mordecai took a walk in front of the harem’s courtyard to learn how Esther was doing and to see what was happening to her.
EST.2.12	During the year before each young woman’s turn to go to King Ahasuerus, the harem regulation required her to receive beauty treatments with oil of myrrh for six months and then with perfumes and cosmetics for another six months. 
EST.2.13	When the young woman would go to the king, she was given whatever she requested to take with her from the harem to the palace. 
EST.2.14	She would go in the evening, and in the morning she would return to a second harem under the supervision of the king’s eunuch Shaashgaz, keeper of the concubines.
EST.2.15	Esther was the daughter of Abihail,
EST.2.16	She was taken to King Ahasuerus in the palace in the tenth month, the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
EST.2.17	The king loved Esther more than all the other women. She won more favor and approval from him than did any of the other virgins. He placed the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti.
EST.2.18	The king held a great banquet for all his officials and staff.
EST.2.19	When the virgins
EST.2.20	(Esther had not revealed her family background or her ethnicity, as Mordecai had directed. She obeyed Mordecai’s orders, as she always had while he raised her.)
EST.2.21	During those days while Mordecai was sitting at the King’s Gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs
EST.2.22	When Mordecai learned of the plot, he reported it to Queen Esther, and she told the king on Mordecai’s behalf.
EST.2.23	When the report was investigated and verified, both men were hanged on the gallows.
EST.3.1	After all this took place, King Ahasuerus honored Haman, son of Hammedatha the Agagite.
EST.3.2	The entire royal staff at the King’s Gate
EST.3.3	The members of the royal staff at the King’s Gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you disobeying the king’s command?” 
EST.3.4	When they had warned him day after day
EST.3.5	When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing down or paying him homage, he was filled with rage.
EST.3.6	And when he learned of Mordecai’s ethnic identity, it seemed repugnant to Haman to do away with
EST.3.7	In the first month, the month of Nisan, in King Ahasuerus’s twelfth year,
EST.3.8	Then Haman informed King Ahasuerus, “There is one ethnic group, scattered throughout the peoples in every province of your kingdom,
EST.3.9	If the king approves, let an order be drawn up authorizing their destruction, and I will pay 375 tons of silver to
EST.3.10	The king removed his signet ring
EST.3.11	Then the king told Haman, “The money and people are given to you to do with as you see fit.”
EST.3.12	The royal scribes were summoned
EST.3.13	Letters were sent by couriers
EST.3.14	A copy of the text, issued as law throughout every province, was distributed to all the peoples so that they might get ready for that day. 
EST.3.15	The couriers left, spurred on by royal command, and the law was issued in the fortress of Susa.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai learned all that had occurred,
EST.4.2	He went only as far as the King’s Gate,
EST.4.3	There was great mourning among the Jewish people in every province where the king’s command and edict
EST.4.4	Esther’s female servants and her eunuchs came and reported the news to her, and the queen was overcome with fear.
EST.4.5	Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs who attended her, and dispatched him to Mordecai to learn what he was doing and why.
EST.4.6	So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square in front of the King’s Gate. 
EST.4.7	Mordecai told him everything that had happened as well as the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay the royal treasury for the slaughter of the Jews.
EST.4.8	Mordecai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa ordering their destruction, so that Hathach might show it to Esther, explain it to her, and command her to approach the king, implore his favor, and plead with him personally for her people.
EST.4.9	Hathach came and repeated Mordecai’s response to Esther.
EST.4.10	Esther spoke to Hathach and commanded him to tell Mordecai, 
EST.4.11	“All the royal officials and the people of the royal provinces know that one law applies to every man or woman who approaches the king in the inner courtyard
EST.4.12	Esther’s response was reported to Mordecai.
EST.4.13	Mordecai told the messenger to reply to Esther, “Don’t think that you will escape the fate of all the Jews because you are in the king’s palace. 
EST.4.14	If you keep silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place,
EST.4.15	Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: 
EST.4.16	“Go and assemble all the Jews who can be found in Susa and fast for me. Don’t eat or drink for three days,
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went and did everything Esther had commanded him.
EST.5.1	On the third day,
EST.5.2	As soon as the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she gained favor in his eyes. The king extended the gold scepter in his hand toward Esther, and she approached and touched the tip of the scepter.
EST.5.3	“What is it, Queen Esther?” the king asked her. “Whatever you want, even to half the kingdom, will be given to you.”
EST.5.4	“If it pleases the king,” Esther replied, “may the king and Haman come today to the banquet
EST.5.5	The king said, “Hurry, and get Haman so we can do as Esther has requested.” So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared.
EST.5.6	While drinking the
EST.5.7	Esther answered, “This is my petition and my request: 
EST.5.8	If I have found favor in the eyes of the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and perform my request,
EST.5.9	That day Haman left full of joy and in good spirits.
EST.5.10	Yet Haman controlled himself and went home. He sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh
EST.5.11	Then Haman described for them his glorious wealth and his many sons. He told them all how the king had honored him and promoted him in rank over the other officials and the royal staff.
EST.5.12	“What’s more,” Haman added, “Queen Esther invited no one but me to join the king at the banquet she had prepared. I am invited again tomorrow to join her with the king. 
EST.5.13	Still, none of this satisfies me since I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the King’s Gate all the time.”
EST.5.14	His wife Zeresh and all his friends told him, “Have them build a gallows seventy-five feet
EST.6.1	That night sleep escaped
EST.6.2	They found the written report of how Mordecai had informed on Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, when they planned to assassinate King Ahasuerus.
EST.6.3	The king inquired, “What honor and special recognition have been given to Mordecai for this act?” 
EST.6.3	The king’s personal attendants replied, “Nothing has been done for him.”
EST.6.4	The king asked, “Who is in the court?” Now Haman was just entering the outer court of the palace to ask the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows he had prepared for him.
EST.6.5	The king’s attendants answered him, “Haman is there, standing in the court.”
EST.6.5	“Have him enter,” the king ordered. 
EST.6.6	Haman entered, and the king asked him, “What should be done for the man the king wants to honor?” 
EST.6.6	Haman thought to himself, “Who is it the king would want to honor more than me?” 
EST.6.7	Haman told the king, “For the man the king wants to honor: 
EST.6.8	Have them bring a royal garment that the king himself has worn
EST.6.9	Put the garment and the horse under the charge of one of the king’s most noble officials.
EST.6.10	The king told Haman, “Hurry, and do just as you proposed. Take a garment and a horse for Mordecai the Jew,
EST.6.11	So Haman took the garment and the horse. He clothed Mordecai and paraded him through the city square, crying out before him, “This is what is done for the man the king wants to honor.”
EST.6.12	Then Mordecai returned to the King’s Gate,
EST.6.13	Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends
EST.6.14	While they were still speaking with him, the king’s eunuchs
EST.7.1	The king and Haman came to feast
EST.7.2	Once again, on the second day while drinking wine,
EST.7.3	Queen Esther answered, “If I have found favor in your eyes, Your Majesty, and if the king is pleased,
EST.7.4	For my people and I have been sold
EST.7.5	King Ahasuerus spoke up and asked Queen Esther, “Who is this, and where is the one who would devise such a scheme?” 
EST.7.6	Esther answered, “The adversary and enemy
EST.7.6	Haman stood terrified
EST.7.7	The king arose in anger
EST.7.8	Just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall,
EST.7.9	Harbona, one of the king’s eunuchs,
EST.7.9	The king said, “Hang him on it.”
EST.7.10	They hanged Haman on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai.
EST.8.1	That same day King Ahasuerus awarded Queen Esther the estate
EST.8.2	The king removed his signet ring he had recovered from Haman
EST.8.3	Then Esther addressed the king again.
EST.8.4	The king extended the gold scepter
EST.8.5	She said, “If it pleases the king and I have found favor before him, if the matter seems right to the king and I am pleasing in his eyes,
EST.8.6	For how could I bear to see the disaster that would come on my people?
EST.8.7	King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen and to Mordecai the Jew, “Look, I have given Haman’s estate to Esther,
EST.8.8	Write in the king’s name whatever pleases you
EST.8.9	On the twenty-third day of the third month
EST.8.10	Mordecai wrote in King Ahasuerus’s name and sealed the edicts with the royal signet ring. He sent the documents by mounted couriers,
EST.8.11	The king’s edict gave the Jews in each and every city the right to assemble and defend themselves, to destroy, kill, and annihilate every ethnic and provincial army hostile to them, including women and children, and to take their possessions as spoils of war.
EST.8.12	This would take place on a single day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month Adar.
EST.8.13	A copy of the text, issued as law throughout every province, was distributed to all the peoples
EST.8.14	The couriers rode out in haste on their royal horses at the king’s urgent command. The law was also issued in the fortress of Susa.
EST.8.15	Mordecai went from the king’s presence clothed in royal purple and white, with a great gold crown and a purple robe of fine linen.
EST.8.16	and the Jews celebrated
EST.8.17	In every province and every city, wherever the king’s command and his law reached, joy and rejoicing took place among the Jews. There was a celebration and a holiday.
EST.9.1	The king’s command and law
EST.9.2	In each of King Ahasuerus’s provinces
EST.9.3	All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors, and the royal civil administrators
EST.9.4	For Mordecai exercised great power in the palace,
EST.9.5	The Jews put all their enemies to the sword, killing and destroying them.
EST.9.6	In the fortress of Susa
EST.9.7	including Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha. 
EST.9.10	They killed these ten sons
EST.9.11	On that day the number of people killed in the fortress of Susa was reported to the king. 
EST.9.12	The king said to Queen Esther, “In the fortress of Susa the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men, including Haman’s ten sons. What have they done in the rest of the royal provinces? Whatever you ask will be given to you. Whatever you seek will also be done.”
EST.9.13	Esther answered, “If it pleases the king, may the Jews who are in Susa also have tomorrow
EST.9.14	The king gave the orders for this to be done, so a law was announced in Susa, and they hung the bodies of Haman’s ten sons. 
EST.9.15	The Jews in Susa assembled again on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar
EST.9.16	The rest of the Jews in the royal provinces assembled, defended themselves, and gained relief from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand
EST.9.17	They fought on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar and rested on the fourteenth, and it became a day of feasting and rejoicing.
EST.9.18	But the Jews in Susa had assembled on the thirteenth and the fourteenth days of the month. They rested on the fifteenth day of the month, and it became a day of feasting and rejoicing.
EST.9.19	This explains why the rural Jews who live in villages observe the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a time of rejoicing and feasting. It is a holiday when they send gifts to one another.
EST.9.20	Mordecai
EST.9.21	He ordered
EST.9.22	because during those days the Jews gained relief from
EST.9.23	So the Jews agreed to continue the practice they had begun, as Mordecai had written them to do. 
EST.9.24	For Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews,
EST.9.25	But when the matter was brought before the king,
EST.9.26	For this reason these days are called Purim, from the word Pur.
EST.9.27	the Jews bound themselves, their descendants, and all who joined
EST.9.28	These days are remembered and celebrated by every generation, family, province, and city, so that these days of Purim will not lose their significance in Jewish life
EST.9.29	Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail,
EST.9.30	He sent letters with assurances of peace and security
EST.9.31	in order to confirm these days of Purim at their proper time just as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had established them and just as they had committed themselves and their descendants to the practices of fasting
EST.9.32	So Esther’s command confirmed these customs of Purim, which were then written into the record.
EST.10.1	King Ahasuerus imposed a tax throughout the land
EST.10.2	All of his powerful and magnificent accomplishments
EST.10.3	Mordecai the Jew was second only to King Ahasuerus.
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the country of Uz
JOB.1.2	He had seven sons and three daughters.
JOB.1.3	His estate included seven thousand sheep and goats, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys,
JOB.1.4	His sons used to take turns having banquets at their homes. They would send an invitation to their three sisters to eat and drink with them. 
JOB.1.5	Whenever a round of banqueting was over, Job would send for his children and purify them, rising early in the morning to offer burnt offerings for
JOB.1.6	One day the sons of God
JOB.1.7	The 
JOB.1.7	“From roaming through the earth,”
JOB.1.8	Then the 
JOB.1.9	Satan answered the 
JOB.1.10	Haven’t you placed a hedge around
JOB.1.11	But stretch out your hand and strike
JOB.1.12	“Very well,” the 
JOB.1.13	One day when Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house, 
JOB.1.14	a messenger came to Job and reported: “While the oxen were plowing and the donkeys grazing nearby, 
JOB.1.15	the Sabeans
JOB.1.16	He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported: “God’s fire fell from heaven.
JOB.1.17	That messenger was still speaking when yet another came and reported: “The Chaldeans formed three bands, made a raid on the camels, and took them away. They struck down the servants with the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.18	He was still speaking when another messenger came and reported: “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother’s house. 
JOB.1.19	Suddenly a powerful wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people so that they died, and I alone have escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.20	Then Job stood up, tore
JOB.1.21	saying:
JOB.1.21	Naked I came from my mother’s womb,
JOB.1.21	and naked I will leave this life.
JOB.1.21	The 
JOB.1.21	Blessed be the name of the 
JOB.1.22	Throughout all this Job did not sin or blame God for anything.
JOB.2.1	One day the sons of God
JOB.2.2	The 
JOB.2.2	“From roaming through the earth,” Satan answered him, “and walking around on it.”
JOB.2.3	Then the 
JOB.2.4	“Skin for skin!” Satan answered the 
JOB.2.5	But stretch out your hand and strike
JOB.2.6	“Very well,” the 
JOB.2.7	So Satan left the 
JOB.2.8	Then Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself while he sat among the ashes.
JOB.2.9	His wife said to him, “Are you still holding on to your integrity? Curse God and die!”
JOB.2.10	“You speak as a foolish woman speaks,” he told her. “Should we accept only good from God and not adversity?” Throughout all this Job did not sin in what he said.
JOB.2.11	Now when Job’s three friends — Eliphaz the Temanite,
JOB.2.12	When they looked from a distance, they could barely recognize him. They wept aloud,
JOB.2.13	Then they sat on the ground with him seven days and nights,
JOB.3.1	After this, Job began to speak and cursed the day he was born. 
JOB.3.2	He said:
JOB.3.3	May the day I was born perish,
JOB.3.3	and the night that said,
JOB.3.3	“A boy is conceived.”
JOB.3.4	If only that day had turned to darkness!
JOB.3.4	May God above not care about it,
JOB.3.4	or light shine on it.
JOB.3.5	May darkness and gloom
JOB.3.5	and a cloud settle over it.
JOB.3.5	May what darkens the day terrify it.
JOB.3.6	If only darkness had taken that night away!
JOB.3.6	May it not appear
JOB.3.6	or be listed in the calendar.
JOB.3.7	Yes, may that night be barren;
JOB.3.7	may no joyful shout
JOB.3.8	Let those who curse days
JOB.3.8	condemn
JOB.3.8	those who are ready to rouse Leviathan.
JOB.3.9	May its morning stars grow dark.
JOB.3.9	May it wait for daylight but have none;
JOB.3.9	may it not see the breaking
JOB.3.10	For that night did not shut
JOB.3.10	the doors of my mother’s womb,
JOB.3.10	and hide sorrow from my eyes.
JOB.3.11	Why was I not stillborn;
JOB.3.11	why didn’t I die as I came from the womb?
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees receive me,
JOB.3.12	and why were there breasts for me to nurse?
JOB.3.13	Now I would certainly be lying down in peace;
JOB.3.13	I would be asleep.
JOB.3.13	Then I would be at rest
JOB.3.14	with the kings and counselors
JOB.3.14	who rebuilt ruined cities for themselves,
JOB.3.15	or with princes who had gold,
JOB.3.15	who filled their houses
JOB.3.16	Or why was I not hidden like a miscarried child,
JOB.3.16	like infants who never see daylight?
JOB.3.17	There the wicked
JOB.3.17	and there the weary find rest.
JOB.3.18	The captives are completely at rest;
JOB.3.18	they do not hear a taskmaster’s voice.
JOB.3.19	Both small and great are there,
JOB.3.19	and the slave is set free from his master.
JOB.3.20	Why is light given to one burdened with grief,
JOB.3.20	and life to those whose existence is bitter,
JOB.3.21	who wait for death,
JOB.3.21	and search for it more than for hidden treasure,
JOB.3.22	who are filled with much joy
JOB.3.22	and are glad when they reach the grave?
JOB.3.23	Why is life given to a man whose path is hidden,
JOB.3.23	whom God has hedged in?
JOB.3.24	I sigh when food
JOB.3.24	and my groans pour out like water.
JOB.3.25	For the thing I feared has overtaken me,
JOB.3.25	and what I dreaded has happened to me.
JOB.3.26	I cannot relax or be calm;
JOB.3.26	I have no rest,
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
JOB.4.2	Should anyone try to speak with you
JOB.4.2	when you are exhausted?
JOB.4.2	Yet who can keep from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Indeed, you have instructed many
JOB.4.3	and have strengthened
JOB.4.4	Your words have steadied the one who was stumbling
JOB.4.4	and braced the knees that were buckling.
JOB.4.5	But now that this has happened to you,
JOB.4.5	you have become exhausted.
JOB.4.5	It strikes
JOB.4.6	Isn’t your piety your confidence,
JOB.4.6	and the integrity of your life
JOB.4.7	Consider: Who has perished when he was innocent?
JOB.4.7	Where have the honest
JOB.4.8	In my experience, those who plow injustice
JOB.4.8	and those who sow trouble
JOB.4.9	They perish at a single blast
JOB.4.9	and come to an end by the breath of his nostrils.
JOB.4.10	The lion may roar and the fierce lion
JOB.4.10	but the teeth of young lions are broken.
JOB.4.11	The strong lion dies if it catches no prey,
JOB.4.11	and the cubs of the lioness are scattered.
JOB.4.12	A word was brought to me in secret;
JOB.4.12	my ears caught a whisper of it.
JOB.4.13	Among unsettling thoughts from visions in the night,
JOB.4.13	when deep sleep
JOB.4.14	fear and trembling came over me
JOB.4.14	and made all my bones shake.
JOB.4.15	I felt a draft
JOB.4.15	and the hair on my body stood up.
JOB.4.16	A figure stood there,
JOB.4.16	but I could not recognize its appearance;
JOB.4.16	a form loomed before my eyes.
JOB.4.16	I heard a whispering voice:
JOB.4.17	“Can a mortal be righteous before God?
JOB.4.17	Can a man be more pure than his Maker?” 
JOB.4.18	If God puts no trust in his servants
JOB.4.18	and he charges his angels with foolishness,
JOB.4.19	how much more those who dwell in clay houses,
JOB.4.19	whose foundation is in the dust,
JOB.4.19	who are crushed like a moth!
JOB.4.20	They are smashed to pieces from dawn to dusk;
JOB.4.20	they perish forever while no one notices.
JOB.4.21	Are their tent cords not pulled up?
JOB.4.21	They die without wisdom.
JOB.5.1	Call out! Will anyone answer you?
JOB.5.1	Which of the holy ones
JOB.5.2	For anger kills a fool,
JOB.5.2	and jealousy slays the gullible.
JOB.5.3	I have seen a fool taking root,
JOB.5.3	but I immediately pronounced a curse on his home.
JOB.5.4	His children are far from safety.
JOB.5.4	They are crushed at the city gate,
JOB.5.4	with no one to rescue them.
JOB.5.5	The hungry consume his harvest,
JOB.5.5	even taking it out of the thorns.
JOB.5.5	The thirsty
JOB.5.6	For distress does not grow out of the soil,
JOB.5.6	and trouble does not sprout from the ground.
JOB.5.7	But humans are born for trouble
JOB.5.7	as surely as sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	However, if I were you, I would appeal to God
JOB.5.8	and would present my case to him.
JOB.5.9	He does great
JOB.5.9	wonders without number.
JOB.5.10	He gives rain to the earth
JOB.5.10	and sends water to the fields.
JOB.5.11	He sets the lowly on high,
JOB.5.11	and mourners are lifted to safety.
JOB.5.12	He frustrates the schemes of the crafty
JOB.5.12	so that they
JOB.5.13	He traps the wise in their craftiness
JOB.5.13	so that the plans of the deceptive
JOB.5.13	are quickly brought to an end.
JOB.5.14	They encounter darkness by day,
JOB.5.14	and they grope at noon
JOB.5.14	as if it were night.
JOB.5.15	He saves the needy from their sharp words
JOB.5.15	and from the clutches of the powerful.
JOB.5.16	So the poor have hope,
JOB.5.16	and injustice shuts its mouth.
JOB.5.17	See how happy is the person whom God corrects;
JOB.5.17	so do not reject the discipline of the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	For he wounds but he also bandages;
JOB.5.18	he strikes, but his hands also heal.
JOB.5.19	He will rescue you from six calamities;
JOB.5.19	no harm will touch you in seven.
JOB.5.20	In famine he will redeem you from death,
JOB.5.20	and in battle, from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	You will be safe from slander
JOB.5.21	and not fear destruction when it comes.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at destruction and hunger
JOB.5.22	and not fear the land’s wild creatures.
JOB.5.23	For you will have a covenant with the stones of the field,
JOB.5.23	and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	You will know that your tent is secure,
JOB.5.24	and nothing will be missing when you inspect your home.
JOB.5.25	You will also know that your offspring will be many
JOB.5.25	and your descendants like the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	You will approach the grave
JOB.5.26	as a stack of sheaves is gathered in its season.
JOB.5.27	We have investigated this, and it is true!
JOB.5.27	Hear it and understand it for yourself.
JOB.6.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.6.2	If only my grief could be weighed
JOB.6.2	and my devastation
JOB.6.3	For then it would outweigh the sand of the seas!
JOB.6.3	That is why my words are rash.
JOB.6.4	Surely the arrows of the Almighty have pierced
JOB.6.4	my spirit drinks their poison.
JOB.6.4	God’s terrors are arrayed against me.
JOB.6.5	Does a wild donkey bray over fresh grass
JOB.6.5	or an ox low over its fodder?
JOB.6.6	Is bland food eaten without salt?
JOB.6.6	Is there flavor in an egg white?
JOB.6.7	I refuse to touch them;
JOB.6.7	they are like contaminated food.
JOB.6.8	If only my request would be granted
JOB.6.8	and God would provide what I hope for:
JOB.6.9	that he would decide to crush me,
JOB.6.9	to unleash his power and cut me off!
JOB.6.10	It would still bring me comfort,
JOB.6.10	and I would leap for joy in unrelenting pain
JOB.6.10	that I have not denied
JOB.6.11	What strength do I have, that I should continue to hope?
JOB.6.11	What is my future, that I should be patient?
JOB.6.12	Is my strength that of stone,
JOB.6.12	or my flesh made of bronze?
JOB.6.13	Since I cannot help myself,
JOB.6.13	the hope for success has been banished from me.
JOB.6.14	A despairing man should receive loyalty from his friends,
JOB.6.14	even if he abandons the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	My brothers are as treacherous as a wadi,
JOB.6.15	as seasonal streams that overflow
JOB.6.16	and become darkened
JOB.6.16	and the snow melts into them.
JOB.6.17	The wadis evaporate in warm weather;
JOB.6.17	they disappear from their channels in hot weather.
JOB.6.18	Caravans turn away from their routes,
JOB.6.18	go up into the desert, and perish.
JOB.6.19	The caravans of Tema look for these streams.
JOB.6.19	The traveling merchants of Sheba hope for them.
JOB.6.20	They are ashamed because they had been confident of finding water.
JOB.6.20	When they arrive there, they are disappointed.
JOB.6.21	So this is what you have now become to me.
JOB.6.21	When you see something dreadful, you are afraid.
JOB.6.22	Have I ever said: “Give me something”
JOB.6.22	or “Pay a bribe for me from your wealth”
JOB.6.23	or “Deliver me from the enemy’s hand”
JOB.6.23	or “Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless”?
JOB.6.24	Teach me, and I will be silent.
JOB.6.24	Help me understand what I did wrong.
JOB.6.25	How painful honest words can be!
JOB.6.25	But what does your rebuke prove?
JOB.6.26	Do you think that you can disprove my words
JOB.6.26	or that a despairing man’s words are mere wind?
JOB.6.27	No doubt you would cast lots for a fatherless child
JOB.6.27	and negotiate a price to sell your friend.
JOB.6.28	But now, please look at me;
JOB.6.28	I will not lie to your face.
JOB.6.29	Reconsider; don’t be unjust.
JOB.6.29	Reconsider; my righteousness
JOB.6.30	Is there injustice on my tongue
JOB.6.30	or can my palate not taste disaster?
JOB.7.1	Isn’t each person consigned to forced labor
JOB.7.1	Are not his days like those of a hired worker?
JOB.7.2	Like a slave he longs for shade;
JOB.7.2	like a hired worker he waits for his pay.
JOB.7.3	So I have been made to inherit months of futility,
JOB.7.3	and troubled nights have been assigned to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down I think,
JOB.7.4	“When will I get up?”
JOB.7.4	But the evening drags on endlessly,
JOB.7.4	and I toss and turn until dawn.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with maggots and encrusted with dirt.
JOB.7.5	My skin forms scabs
JOB.7.6	My days pass more swiftly than a weaver’s shuttle;
JOB.7.6	they come to an end without hope.
JOB.7.7	Remember that my life is but a breath.
JOB.7.7	My eye will never again see anything good.
JOB.7.8	The eye of anyone who looks on me
JOB.7.8	will no longer see me.
JOB.7.8	Your eyes will look for me, but I will be gone.
JOB.7.9	As a cloud fades away and vanishes,
JOB.7.9	so the one who goes down to Sheol
JOB.7.10	He will never return to his house;
JOB.7.10	his hometown will no longer remember
JOB.7.11	Therefore I will not restrain my mouth.
JOB.7.11	I will speak in the anguish of my spirit;
JOB.7.11	I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.12	Am I the sea
JOB.7.12	that you keep me under guard?
JOB.7.13	When I say, “My bed will comfort me,
JOB.7.13	and my couch will ease my complaint,”
JOB.7.14	then you frighten me with dreams,
JOB.7.14	and terrify me with visions,
JOB.7.15	so that I prefer strangling
JOB.7.15	death rather than life in this body.
JOB.7.16	I give up! I will not live forever.
JOB.7.16	Leave me alone,
JOB.7.17	What is a mere human, that you think so highly of him
JOB.7.17	and pay so much attention to him?
JOB.7.18	You inspect him every morning,
JOB.7.18	and put him to the test every moment.
JOB.7.19	Will you ever look away from me,
JOB.7.19	or leave me alone long enough to swallow?
JOB.7.20	If I have sinned, what have I done to you,
JOB.7.20	Watcher of humanity?
JOB.7.20	Why have you made me your target,
JOB.7.20	so that I have become a burden to you?
JOB.7.21	Why not forgive my sin
JOB.7.21	and pardon my iniquity?
JOB.7.21	For soon I will lie down in the grave.
JOB.7.21	You will eagerly seek me, but I will be gone.
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
JOB.8.2	How long will you go on saying these things?
JOB.8.2	Your words
JOB.8.3	Does God pervert justice?
JOB.8.3	Does the Almighty pervert what is right?
JOB.8.4	Since your children sinned against him,
JOB.8.4	he gave them over to their rebellion.
JOB.8.5	But if you earnestly seek
JOB.8.5	and ask the Almighty for mercy,
JOB.8.6	if you are pure and upright,
JOB.8.6	then he will move even now on your behalf
JOB.8.6	and restore the home where your righteousness dwells.
JOB.8.7	Then, even if your beginnings were modest,
JOB.8.7	your final days will be full of prosperity.
JOB.8.8	For ask the previous generation,
JOB.8.8	and pay attention to what their fathers discovered,
JOB.8.9	since we were born only yesterday and know nothing.
JOB.8.9	Our days on earth are but a shadow.
JOB.8.10	Will they not teach you and tell you
JOB.8.10	and speak from their understanding?
JOB.8.11	Does papyrus grow where there is no marsh?
JOB.8.11	Do reeds flourish without water?
JOB.8.12	While still uncut shoots,
JOB.8.12	they would dry up quicker than any other plant.
JOB.8.13	Such is the destiny
JOB.8.13	the hope of the godless
JOB.8.14	His source of confidence is fragile;
JOB.8.14	what he trusts in is a spider’s web.
JOB.8.15	He leans on his web, but it doesn’t stand firm.
JOB.8.15	He grabs it, but it does not hold up.
JOB.8.16	He is a well-watered plant in the sunshine;
JOB.8.16	his shoots spread out over his garden.
JOB.8.17	His roots are intertwined around a pile of rocks.
JOB.8.17	He looks for a home among the stones.
JOB.8.18	If he is uprooted
JOB.8.18	it will deny knowing him, saying, “I never saw you.”
JOB.8.19	Surely this is the joy of his way of life;
JOB.8.19	yet others will sprout from the dust.
JOB.8.20	Look, God does not reject a person of integrity,
JOB.8.20	and he will not support
JOB.8.21	He will yet fill your mouth with laughter
JOB.8.21	and your lips with a shout of joy.
JOB.8.22	Your enemies will be clothed with shame;
JOB.8.22	the tent
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.9.2	Yes, I know what you’ve said is true,
JOB.9.2	but how can a person be justified before God?
JOB.9.3	If one wanted to take
JOB.9.3	he could not answer God
JOB.9.4	God is wise
JOB.9.4	Who has opposed him and come out unharmed?
JOB.9.5	He removes mountains without their knowledge,
JOB.9.5	overturning them in his anger.
JOB.9.6	He shakes the earth from its place
JOB.9.6	so that its pillars tremble.
JOB.9.7	He commands the sun not to shine
JOB.9.7	and seals off the stars.
JOB.9.8	He alone stretches out the heavens
JOB.9.8	and treads on the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	He makes the stars: the Bear,
JOB.9.9	the Pleiades,
JOB.9.10	He does great and unsearchable things,
JOB.9.10	wonders without number.
JOB.9.11	If he passed by me, I wouldn’t see him;
JOB.9.11	if he went by, I wouldn’t recognize him.
JOB.9.12	If he snatches something, who can stop
JOB.9.12	Who can ask him, “What are you doing?” 
JOB.9.13	God does not hold back his anger;
JOB.9.13	Rahab’s
JOB.9.14	How then can I answer him
JOB.9.14	or choose my arguments against him?
JOB.9.15	Even if I were in the right, I could not answer.
JOB.9.15	I could only beg my Judge for mercy.
JOB.9.16	If I summoned him and he answered me,
JOB.9.16	I do not believe he would pay attention to what I said.
JOB.9.17	He batters me with a whirlwind
JOB.9.17	and multiplies my wounds without cause.
JOB.9.18	He doesn’t let me catch my breath
JOB.9.18	but fills me with bitter experiences.
JOB.9.19	If it is a matter of strength, look, he is the powerful one!
JOB.9.19	If it is a matter of justice, who can summon
JOB.9.20	Even if I were in the right, my own mouth would condemn me;
JOB.9.20	if I were blameless, my mouth would declare me guilty.
JOB.9.21	Though I am blameless,
JOB.9.21	I no longer care about myself;
JOB.9.21	I renounce my life.
JOB.9.22	It is all the same. Therefore I say,
JOB.9.22	“He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.”
JOB.9.23	When catastrophe
JOB.9.23	he mocks the despair of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth
JOB.9.24	he blindfolds
JOB.9.24	If it isn’t he, then who is it?
JOB.9.25	My days fly by faster than a runner;
JOB.9.25	they flee without seeing any good.
JOB.9.26	They sweep by like boats made of papyrus,
JOB.9.26	like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
JOB.9.27	If I said, “I will forget my complaint,
JOB.9.27	change my expression, and smile,”
JOB.9.28	I would still live in terror of all my pains.
JOB.9.28	I know you will not acquit me.
JOB.9.29	Since I will be found guilty,
JOB.9.29	why should I struggle in vain?
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with snow,
JOB.9.30	and cleanse my hands with lye,
JOB.9.31	then you dip me in a pit of mud,
JOB.9.31	and my own clothes despise me!
JOB.9.32	For he is not a man like me, that I can answer him,
JOB.9.32	that we can take each other to court.
JOB.9.33	There is no mediator between us,
JOB.9.33	to lay his hand on both of us.
JOB.9.34	Let him take his rod away from me
JOB.9.34	so his terror will no longer frighten me.
JOB.9.35	Then I would speak and not fear him.
JOB.9.35	But that is not the case; I am on my own.
JOB.10.1	I am disgusted with my life.
JOB.10.1	I will give vent to my complaint
JOB.10.1	and speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say to God,
JOB.10.2	“Do not declare me guilty!
JOB.10.2	Let me know why you prosecute me.
JOB.10.3	Is it good for you to oppress,
JOB.10.3	to reject the work of your hands,
JOB.10.3	and favor
JOB.10.4	Do you have eyes of flesh,
JOB.10.4	or do you see as a human sees?
JOB.10.5	Are your days like those of a human,
JOB.10.5	or your years like those of a man,
JOB.10.6	that you look for my iniquity
JOB.10.6	and search for my sin,
JOB.10.7	even though you know that I am not wicked
JOB.10.7	and that there is no one who can rescue from your power?
JOB.10.8	“Your hands shaped me and formed me.
JOB.10.8	Will you now turn and destroy me?
JOB.10.9	Please remember that you formed me like clay.
JOB.10.9	Will you now return me to dust?
JOB.10.10	Did you not pour me out like milk
JOB.10.10	and curdle me like cheese?
JOB.10.11	You clothed me with skin and flesh,
JOB.10.11	and wove me together with bones and tendons.
JOB.10.12	You gave me life and faithful love,
JOB.10.12	and your care has guarded my life.
JOB.10.13	“Yet you concealed these thoughts in your heart;
JOB.10.13	I know that this was your hidden plan:
JOB.10.14	if I sin, you would notice,
JOB.10.14	and would not acquit me of my iniquity.
JOB.10.15	If I am wicked, woe to me!
JOB.10.15	And even if I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head.
JOB.10.15	I am filled with shame
JOB.10.15	and have drunk deeply of
JOB.10.16	If I am proud,
JOB.10.16	and again display your miraculous power against me.
JOB.10.17	You produce new witnesses
JOB.10.17	and multiply your anger toward me.
JOB.10.17	Hardships assault me, wave after wave.
JOB.10.18	“Why did you bring me out of the womb?
JOB.10.18	I should have died and never been seen.
JOB.10.19	I wish
JOB.10.19	but had been carried from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.20	Are my days not few? Stop it!
JOB.10.20	Leave me alone, so that I can smile a little
JOB.10.21	before I go to a land of darkness and gloom,
JOB.10.21	never to return.
JOB.10.22	It is a land of blackness like the deepest darkness,
JOB.10.22	gloomy and chaotic,
JOB.10.22	where even the light is like
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite replied:
JOB.11.2	Should this abundance of words
JOB.11.2	and such a talker
JOB.11.3	Should your babbling put others to silence,
JOB.11.3	so that you can keep on ridiculing
JOB.11.3	with no one to humiliate you?
JOB.11.4	You have said, “My teaching
JOB.11.4	and I am pure in your sight.”
JOB.11.5	But if only God would speak
JOB.11.5	and open his lips against you!
JOB.11.6	He would show you the secrets of wisdom,
JOB.11.6	for true wisdom has two sides.
JOB.11.6	Know then that God has chosen to overlook some of your iniquity.
JOB.11.7	Can you fathom the depths of God
JOB.11.7	or discover the limits of the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	They are higher than the heavens — what can you do?
JOB.11.8	They are deeper than Sheol — what can you know?
JOB.11.9	Their measure is longer than the earth
JOB.11.9	and wider than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If he passes by and throws someone in prison
JOB.11.10	or convenes a court, who can stop him?
JOB.11.11	Surely he knows which people are worthless.
JOB.11.11	If he sees iniquity, will he not take note of it?
JOB.11.12	But a stupid person will gain understanding
JOB.11.12	as soon as a wild donkey is born a human!
JOB.11.13	As for you, if you redirect your heart
JOB.11.13	and spread out your hands to him in prayer —
JOB.11.14	if there is iniquity in your hand, remove it,
JOB.11.14	and don’t allow injustice to dwell in your tents —
JOB.11.15	then you will hold your head high, free from fault.
JOB.11.15	You will be firmly established and unafraid.
JOB.11.16	For you will forget your suffering,
JOB.11.16	recalling it only as water that has flowed by.
JOB.11.17	Your life will be brighter than noonday;
JOB.11.17	its darkness
JOB.11.18	You will be confident, because there is hope.
JOB.11.18	You will look carefully about and lie down in safety.
JOB.11.19	You will lie down with no one to frighten you,
JOB.11.19	and many will seek your favor.
JOB.11.20	But the sight of the wicked
JOB.11.20	Their way of escape will be cut off,
JOB.11.20	and their only hope is their last breath.
JOB.12.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.12.2	No doubt you are the people,
JOB.12.2	and wisdom will die with you!
JOB.12.3	But I also have a mind like you;
JOB.12.3	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.12.3	Who doesn’t know the things you are talking about?
JOB.12.4	I am a laughingstock to my
JOB.12.4	by calling on God, who answers me.
JOB.12.4	The righteous and upright man is a laughingstock.
JOB.12.5	The one who is at ease
JOB.12.5	and thinks it is prepared for those whose feet are slipping.
JOB.12.6	The tents of robbers are safe,
JOB.12.6	and those who trouble God are secure;
JOB.12.6	God holds them in his hands.
JOB.12.7	But ask the animals, and they will instruct you;
JOB.12.7	ask the birds of the sky, and they will tell you.
JOB.12.8	Or speak to the earth, and it will instruct you;
JOB.12.8	let the fish of the sea inform you.
JOB.12.9	Which of all these does not know
JOB.12.9	that the hand of the 
JOB.12.10	The life of every living thing is in his hand,
JOB.12.10	as well as the breath of all mankind.
JOB.12.11	Doesn’t the ear test words
JOB.12.11	as the palate tastes food?
JOB.12.12	Wisdom is found with the elderly,
JOB.12.12	and understanding comes with long life.
JOB.12.13	Wisdom and strength belong to God;
JOB.12.13	counsel and understanding are his.
JOB.12.14	Whatever he tears down cannot be rebuilt;
JOB.12.14	whoever he imprisons cannot be released.
JOB.12.15	When he withholds water, everything dries up,
JOB.12.15	and when he releases it, it destroys the land.
JOB.12.16	True wisdom and power belong to him.
JOB.12.16	The deceived and the deceiver are his.
JOB.12.17	He leads counselors away barefoot
JOB.12.17	and makes judges go mad.
JOB.12.18	He releases the bonds
JOB.12.18	and fastens a belt around their waists.
JOB.12.19	He leads priests away barefoot
JOB.12.19	and overthrows established leaders.
JOB.12.20	He deprives trusted advisers of speech
JOB.12.20	and takes away the elders’ good judgment.
JOB.12.21	He pours out contempt on nobles
JOB.12.21	and disarms
JOB.12.22	He reveals mysteries from the darkness
JOB.12.22	and brings the deepest darkness into the light.
JOB.12.23	He makes nations great, then destroys them;
JOB.12.23	he enlarges nations,
JOB.12.24	He deprives the world’s leaders of reason,
JOB.12.24	and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
JOB.12.25	They grope around in darkness without light;
JOB.12.25	he makes them stagger like a drunkard.
JOB.13.1	Look, my eyes have seen all this;
JOB.13.1	my ears
JOB.13.2	Everything you know, I also know;
JOB.13.2	I am not inferior to you.
JOB.13.3	Yet I prefer to speak to the Almighty
JOB.13.3	and argue my case before God.
JOB.13.4	You use lies like plaster;
JOB.13.4	you are all worthless healers.
JOB.13.5	If only you would shut up
JOB.13.5	and let that be your wisdom!
JOB.13.6	Hear now my argument,
JOB.13.6	and listen to my defense.
JOB.13.7	Would you testify unjustly on God’s behalf
JOB.13.7	or speak deceitfully for him?
JOB.13.8	Would you show partiality
JOB.13.8	or argue the case in his defense?
JOB.13.9	Would it go well if he examined you?
JOB.13.9	Could you deceive him as you would deceive a man?
JOB.13.10	Surely he would rebuke you
JOB.13.10	if you secretly showed partiality.
JOB.13.11	Would God’s majesty not terrify you?
JOB.13.11	Would his dread not fall on you?
JOB.13.12	Your memorable sayings are proverbs of ash;
JOB.13.12	your defenses are made of clay.
JOB.13.13	Be quiet,
JOB.13.13	Let whatever comes happen to me.
JOB.13.14	I will put
JOB.13.14	and take my life in my own hands.
JOB.13.15	Even if he kills me, I will hope in him.
JOB.13.15	I will still defend
JOB.13.16	Yes, this will result in my deliverance,
JOB.13.16	for no godless person
JOB.13.17	Pay close attention to my words;
JOB.13.17	let my declaration ring in your ears.
JOB.13.18	Now then, I have prepared my case;
JOB.13.18	I know that I am right.
JOB.13.19	Can anyone indict me?
JOB.13.19	If so, I will be silent and die.
JOB.13.20	Only grant these two things to me, God,
JOB.13.20	so that I will not have to hide from your presence:
JOB.13.21	remove your hand from me,
JOB.13.21	and do not let your terror frighten me.
JOB.13.22	Then call, and I will answer,
JOB.13.22	or I will speak, and you can respond to me.
JOB.13.23	How many iniquities
JOB.13.23	Reveal to me my transgression and sin.
JOB.13.24	Why do you hide your face
JOB.13.24	and consider me your enemy?
JOB.13.25	Will you frighten a wind-driven leaf?
JOB.13.25	Will you chase after dry straw?
JOB.13.26	For you record bitter accusations against me
JOB.13.26	and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth.
JOB.13.27	You put my feet in the stocks
JOB.13.27	and stand watch over all my paths,
JOB.13.27	setting a limit for the soles
JOB.13.28	A person wears out like something rotten,
JOB.13.28	like a moth-eaten garment.
JOB.14.1	Anyone born of woman
JOB.14.1	is short of days and full of trouble.
JOB.14.2	He blossoms like a flower, then withers;
JOB.14.2	he flees like a shadow and does not last.
JOB.14.3	Do you really take notice of one like this?
JOB.14.3	Will you bring me into judgment against you?
JOB.14.4	Who can produce something pure from what is impure?
JOB.14.4	No one!
JOB.14.5	Since a person’s days are determined
JOB.14.5	and the number of his months depends on you,
JOB.14.5	and since you have set
JOB.14.6	look away from him and let him rest
JOB.14.6	so that he can enjoy his day like a hired worker.
JOB.14.7	There is hope for a tree:
JOB.14.7	If it is cut down, it will sprout again,
JOB.14.7	and its shoots will not die.
JOB.14.8	If its roots grow old in the ground
JOB.14.8	and its stump starts to die in the soil,
JOB.14.9	the scent of water makes it thrive
JOB.14.9	and produce twigs like a sapling.
JOB.14.10	But a person dies and fades away;
JOB.14.10	he breathes his last — where is he?
JOB.14.11	As water disappears from a lake
JOB.14.11	and a river becomes parched and dry,
JOB.14.12	so people lie down never to rise again.
JOB.14.12	They will not wake up until the heavens are no more;
JOB.14.12	they will not stir from their sleep.
JOB.14.13	If only you would hide me in Sheol
JOB.14.13	and conceal me until your anger
JOB.14.13	If only you would appoint a time for me
JOB.14.13	and then remember me.
JOB.14.14	When a person dies, will he come back to life?
JOB.14.14	If so, I would wait
JOB.14.14	until my relief comes.
JOB.14.15	You would call, and I would answer you.
JOB.14.15	You would long for the work of your hands.
JOB.14.16	For then you would count my steps
JOB.14.16	but would not take note
JOB.14.17	My rebellion would be sealed up in a bag,
JOB.14.17	and you would cover over my iniquity.
JOB.14.18	But as a mountain collapses and crumbles
JOB.14.18	and a rock is dislodged from its place,
JOB.14.19	as water wears away stones
JOB.14.19	and torrents wash away the soil from the land,
JOB.14.19	so you destroy a man’s hope.
JOB.14.20	You completely overpower him, and he passes on;
JOB.14.20	you change his appearance and send him away.
JOB.14.21	If his sons receive honor, he does not know it;
JOB.14.21	if they become insignificant, he is unaware of it.
JOB.14.22	He feels only the pain of his own body
JOB.14.22	and mourns only for himself.
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
JOB.15.2	Does a wise man answer with empty
JOB.15.2	or fill himself
JOB.15.3	Should he argue
JOB.15.3	or with words that serve no good purpose?
JOB.15.4	But you even undermine the fear of God
JOB.15.4	and hinder meditation before him.
JOB.15.5	Your iniquity
JOB.15.5	and you choose the language of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Your own mouth condemns you, not I;
JOB.15.6	your own lips testify against you.
JOB.15.7	Were you the first human ever born,
JOB.15.7	or were you brought forth before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Do you listen in on the council of God,
JOB.15.8	or have a monopoly on wisdom?
JOB.15.9	What do you know that we don’t?
JOB.15.9	What do you understand that is not clear to us?
JOB.15.10	Both the gray-haired and the elderly are with us—
JOB.15.10	older than your father.
JOB.15.11	Are God’s consolations not enough for you,
JOB.15.11	even the words that deal gently with you?
JOB.15.12	Why has your heart misled you,
JOB.15.12	and why do your eyes flash
JOB.15.13	as you turn your anger
JOB.15.13	and allow such words to leave your mouth?
JOB.15.14	What is a mere human, that he should be pure,
JOB.15.14	or one born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
JOB.15.15	If God puts no trust in his holy ones
JOB.15.15	and the heavens are not pure in his sight,
JOB.15.16	how much less one who is revolting and corrupt,
JOB.15.16	who drinks injustice
JOB.15.17	Listen to me and I will inform you.
JOB.15.17	I will describe what I have seen,
JOB.15.18	what the wise have declared and not concealed,
JOB.15.18	that came from their ancestors,
JOB.15.19	to whom alone the land was given
JOB.15.19	when no foreigner passed among them.
JOB.15.20	A wicked person writhes in pain all his days,
JOB.15.20	throughout the number of years reserved for the ruthless.
JOB.15.21	Dreadful sounds fill his ears;
JOB.15.21	when he is at peace, a robber attacks him.
JOB.15.22	He doesn’t believe he will return from darkness;
JOB.15.22	he is destined for the sword.
JOB.15.23	He wanders about for food, asking, “Where is it?”
JOB.15.23	He knows the day of darkness is at hand.
JOB.15.24	Trouble
JOB.15.24	overwhelming him like a king prepared for battle.
JOB.15.25	For he has stretched out his hand
JOB.15.25	and has arrogantly opposed the Almighty.
JOB.15.26	He rushes headlong at him
JOB.15.26	with his thick, studded shields.
JOB.15.27	Though his face is covered with fat
JOB.15.27	and his waistline bulges with it,
JOB.15.28	he will dwell in ruined cities,
JOB.15.28	in abandoned houses destined to become piles of rubble.
JOB.15.29	He will no longer be rich; his wealth will not endure.
JOB.15.29	His possessions
JOB.15.30	He will not escape from the darkness;
JOB.15.30	flames will wither his shoots,
JOB.15.30	and by the breath of God’s mouth, he will depart.
JOB.15.31	Let him not put trust in worthless things, being led astray,
JOB.15.31	for what he gets in exchange will prove worthless.
JOB.15.32	It will be accomplished before his time,
JOB.15.32	and his branch will not flourish.
JOB.15.33	He will be like a vine that drops its unripe grapes
JOB.15.33	and like an olive tree that sheds its blossoms.
JOB.15.34	For the company of the godless
JOB.15.34	and fire will consume the tents of those who offer bribes.
JOB.15.35	They conceive trouble
JOB.15.35	their womb
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.16.2	I have heard many things like these.
JOB.16.2	You are all miserable comforters.
JOB.16.3	Is there no end to your empty
JOB.16.3	What provokes you that you continue testifying?
JOB.16.4	If you were in my place I could also talk like you.
JOB.16.4	I could string words together against you
JOB.16.4	and shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	Instead, I would encourage you with my mouth,
JOB.16.5	and the consolation from my lips would bring relief.
JOB.16.6	If I speak, my suffering is not relieved,
JOB.16.6	and if I hold back, does any of it leave me?
JOB.16.7	Surely he
JOB.16.7	You have devastated my entire family.
JOB.16.8	You have shriveled me up
JOB.16.8	my frailty rises up against me and testifies to my face.
JOB.16.9	His anger tears at me, and he harasses
JOB.16.9	He gnashes his teeth at me.
JOB.16.9	My enemy pierces me with his eyes.
JOB.16.10	They open their mouths against me
JOB.16.10	and strike my cheeks with contempt;
JOB.16.10	they join themselves together against me.
JOB.16.11	God hands me over to the unjust;
JOB.16.11	he throws me to the wicked.
JOB.16.12	I was at ease, but he shattered me;
JOB.16.12	he seized me by the scruff of the neck
JOB.16.12	and smashed me to pieces.
JOB.16.12	He set me up as his target;
JOB.16.13	his archers
JOB.16.13	He pierces my kidneys without mercy
JOB.16.13	and pours my bile on the ground.
JOB.16.14	He breaks through my defenses again and again;
JOB.16.14	he charges at me like a warrior.
JOB.16.15	I have sewn sackcloth over my skin;
JOB.16.15	I have buried my strength
JOB.16.16	My face has grown red with weeping,
JOB.16.16	and darkness
JOB.16.17	although my hands are free from violence
JOB.16.17	and my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	Earth, do not cover my blood;
JOB.16.18	may my cry for help find no resting place.
JOB.16.19	Even now my witness is in heaven,
JOB.16.19	and my advocate is in the heights!
JOB.16.20	My friends scoff at me
JOB.16.20	as I weep before God.
JOB.16.21	I wish that someone might argue for a man with God
JOB.16.21	just as anyone
JOB.16.22	For only a few years will pass
JOB.16.22	before I go the way of no return.
JOB.17.1	My spirit is broken.
JOB.17.1	My days are extinguished.
JOB.17.1	A graveyard
JOB.17.2	Surely mockers surround
JOB.17.2	and my eyes must gaze at their rebellion.
JOB.17.3	Accept my pledge! Put up security for me.
JOB.17.3	Who else will be my sponsor?
JOB.17.4	You have closed their minds to understanding,
JOB.17.4	therefore you will not honor them.
JOB.17.5	If a man denounces his friends for a price,
JOB.17.5	the eyes of his children will fail.
JOB.17.6	He has made me an object of scorn to the people;
JOB.17.6	I have become a man people spit at.
JOB.17.7	My eyes have grown dim from grief,
JOB.17.7	and my whole body has become but a shadow.
JOB.17.8	The upright are appalled
JOB.17.8	and the innocent are roused against the godless.
JOB.17.9	Yet the righteous person will hold to his way,
JOB.17.9	and the one whose hands are clean
JOB.17.10	But come back and try again, all of you.
JOB.17.10	I will not find a wise man among you.
JOB.17.11	My days have slipped by;
JOB.17.11	my plans have been ruined,
JOB.17.11	even the things dear to my heart.
JOB.17.12	They turned night into day
JOB.17.12	and made light seem near in the face of darkness.
JOB.17.13	If I await Sheol as my home,
JOB.17.13	spread out my bed in darkness,
JOB.17.14	and say to corruption, “You are my father,”
JOB.17.14	and to the maggot, “My mother” or “My sister,”
JOB.17.15	where then is my hope?
JOB.17.15	Who can see any hope for me?
JOB.17.16	Will it go down to the gates of Sheol,
JOB.17.16	or will we descend together to the dust?
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite
JOB.18.2	How long until you stop talking?
JOB.18.2	Show some sense, and then we can talk.
JOB.18.3	Why are we regarded as cattle,
JOB.18.3	as stupid in your sight?
JOB.18.4	You who tear yourself in anger
JOB.18.4	should the earth be abandoned on your account,
JOB.18.4	or a rock be removed from its place?
JOB.18.5	Yes, the light
JOB.18.5	the flame of his fire does not glow.
JOB.18.6	The light in his tent grows dark,
JOB.18.6	and the lamp beside him is put out.
JOB.18.7	His powerful stride is shortened,
JOB.18.7	and his own schemes trip him up.
JOB.18.8	For his own feet lead him into a net,
JOB.18.8	and he strays into its mesh.
JOB.18.9	A trap catches him by the heel;
JOB.18.9	a noose seizes him.
JOB.18.10	A rope lies hidden for him on the ground,
JOB.18.10	and a snare waits for him along the path.
JOB.18.11	Terrors frighten him on every side
JOB.18.11	and harass him at every step.
JOB.18.12	His strength is depleted;
JOB.18.12	disaster lies ready for him to stumble.
JOB.18.13	Parts of his skin are eaten away;
JOB.18.13	death’s firstborn consumes his limbs.
JOB.18.14	He is ripped from the security of his tent
JOB.18.14	and marched away to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	Nothing he owned remains in his tent.
JOB.18.15	Burning sulfur
JOB.18.16	His roots below dry up,
JOB.18.16	and his branches above wither away.
JOB.18.17	All memory
JOB.18.17	he has no name anywhere.
JOB.18.18	He is driven from light to darkness
JOB.18.18	and chased from the inhabited world.
JOB.18.19	He has no children or descendants among his people,
JOB.18.19	no survivor where he used to live.
JOB.18.20	Those in the west are appalled
JOB.18.20	while those in the east tremble in horror.
JOB.18.21	Indeed, such is the dwelling of the unjust man,
JOB.18.21	and this is the place of the one who does not know God.
JOB.19.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.19.2	How long will you torment me
JOB.19.2	and crush me with words?
JOB.19.3	You have humiliated me ten times now,
JOB.19.3	and you mistreat
JOB.19.4	Even if it is true that I have sinned,
JOB.19.4	my mistake concerns only
JOB.19.5	If you really want to appear superior
JOB.19.5	and would use my disgrace as evidence against me,
JOB.19.6	then understand that it is God who has wronged me
JOB.19.6	and caught me in his net.
JOB.19.7	I cry out: “Violence!” but get no response;
JOB.19.7	I call for help, but there is no justice.
JOB.19.8	He has blocked
JOB.19.8	he has veiled my paths with darkness.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped me of my honor
JOB.19.9	and removed the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He tears me down on every side so that I am ruined.
JOB.19.10	He uproots my hope like a tree.
JOB.19.11	His anger
JOB.19.11	and he regards me as one of his enemies.
JOB.19.12	His troops advance together;
JOB.19.12	they construct a ramp
JOB.19.12	and camp
JOB.19.13	He has removed my brothers from me;
JOB.19.13	my acquaintances have abandoned me.
JOB.19.14	My relatives stop coming by,
JOB.19.14	and my close friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	My house guests
JOB.19.15	I am a foreigner in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I call for my servant, but he does not answer,
JOB.19.16	even if I beg him with my own mouth.
JOB.19.17	My breath is offensive to my wife,
JOB.19.17	and my own family
JOB.19.18	Even young boys scorn me.
JOB.19.18	When I stand up, they mock me.
JOB.19.19	All of my best friends
JOB.19.19	and those I love have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My skin and my flesh cling to my bones;
JOB.19.20	I have escaped with only the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	Have mercy on me, my friends,
JOB.19.21	for God’s hand
JOB.19.22	Why do you persecute me as God does?
JOB.19.22	Will you never get enough of my flesh?
JOB.19.23	I wish that my words were written down,
JOB.19.23	that they were recorded on a scroll
JOB.19.24	or were inscribed in stone forever
JOB.19.24	by an iron stylus and lead!
JOB.19.25	But I know that my Redeemer lives,
JOB.19.25	and at the end he will stand on the dust.
JOB.19.26	Even after my skin has been destroyed,
JOB.19.26	yet I will see God in
JOB.19.27	I will see him myself;
JOB.19.27	my eyes will look at him, and not as a stranger.
JOB.19.27	My heart longs
JOB.19.28	If you say, “How will we pursue him,
JOB.19.28	since the root of the problem lies with him?” 
JOB.19.29	then be afraid of the sword,
JOB.19.29	because wrath brings punishment by the sword,
JOB.19.29	so that you may know there is a judgment.
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite
JOB.20.2	This is why my unsettling thoughts compel me to answer,
JOB.20.2	because I am upset!
JOB.20.3	I have heard a rebuke that insults me,
JOB.20.3	and my understanding
JOB.20.4	Don’t you know that ever since antiquity,
JOB.20.4	from the time a human was placed on earth,
JOB.20.5	the joy of the wicked has been brief
JOB.20.5	and the happiness of the godless has lasted only a moment?
JOB.20.6	Though his arrogance reaches heaven,
JOB.20.6	and his head touches the clouds,
JOB.20.7	he will vanish forever like his own dung.
JOB.20.7	Those who know
JOB.20.8	He will fly away like a dream and never be found;
JOB.20.8	he will be chased away like a vision in the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye that saw him will see him no more,
JOB.20.9	and his household will no longer see him.
JOB.20.10	His children will beg from
JOB.20.10	for his own hands must give back his wealth.
JOB.20.11	His frame may be full of youthful vigor,
JOB.20.11	but it will lie down with him in dust.
JOB.20.12	Though evil tastes sweet in his mouth
JOB.20.12	and he conceals it under his tongue,
JOB.20.13	though he cherishes it and will not let it go
JOB.20.13	but keeps it in his mouth,
JOB.20.14	yet the food in his stomach turns
JOB.20.14	into cobras’ venom inside him.
JOB.20.15	He swallows wealth but must vomit it up;
JOB.20.15	God will force it from his stomach.
JOB.20.16	He will suck the poison of cobras;
JOB.20.16	a viper’s fangs
JOB.20.17	He will not enjoy the streams,
JOB.20.17	the rivers flowing with honey and curds.
JOB.20.18	He must return the fruit of his labor without consuming it;
JOB.20.18	he doesn’t enjoy the profits from his trading.
JOB.20.19	For he oppressed and abandoned the poor;
JOB.20.19	he seized a house he did not build.
JOB.20.20	Because his appetite is never satisfied,
JOB.20.20	he does not let anything he desires escape.
JOB.20.21	Nothing is left for him to consume;
JOB.20.21	therefore, his prosperity will not last.
JOB.20.22	At the height of his success
JOB.20.22	the full weight of misery
JOB.20.23	When he fills his stomach,
JOB.20.23	God will send his burning anger against him,
JOB.20.23	raining
JOB.20.24	If he flees from an iron weapon,
JOB.20.24	an arrow from a bronze bow will pierce him.
JOB.20.25	He pulls it out of his back,
JOB.20.25	the flashing tip out of his liver.
JOB.20.25	Terrors come over him.
JOB.20.26	Total darkness is reserved for his treasures.
JOB.20.26	A fire unfanned by human hands will consume
JOB.20.26	it will feed on what is left in his tent.
JOB.20.27	The heavens will expose his iniquity,
JOB.20.27	and the earth will rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The possessions in his house will be removed,
JOB.20.28	flowing away on the day of God’s anger.
JOB.20.29	This is the wicked person’s lot
JOB.20.29	the inheritance God ordained for him.
JOB.21.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.21.2	Pay close attention to my words;
JOB.21.2	let this be the consolation you offer.
JOB.21.3	Bear with me while I speak;
JOB.21.3	then after I have spoken, you may continue mocking.
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint
JOB.21.4	Then why shouldn’t I be impatient?
JOB.21.5	Look at me and shudder;
JOB.21.5	put your hand over your mouth.
JOB.21.6	When I think about it, I am terrified
JOB.21.6	and my body trembles
JOB.21.7	Why do the wicked continue to live,
JOB.21.7	growing old and becoming powerful?
JOB.21.8	Their children are established while they are still alive,
JOB.21.8	and their descendants, before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their homes are secure and free of fear;
JOB.21.9	no rod from God strikes them.
JOB.21.10	Their bulls breed without fail;
JOB.21.10	their cows calve and do not miscarry.
JOB.21.11	They let their little ones run around like lambs;
JOB.21.11	their children skip about,
JOB.21.12	singing to the tambourine and lyre
JOB.21.12	and rejoicing at the sound of the flute.
JOB.21.13	They spend
JOB.21.13	and go down to Sheol in peace.
JOB.21.14	Yet they say to God, “Leave us alone!
JOB.21.14	We don’t want to know your ways.
JOB.21.15	Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him,
JOB.21.15	and what will we gain by pleading with him?” 
JOB.21.16	But their prosperity is not of their own doing.
JOB.21.16	The counsel of the wicked is far from me!
JOB.21.17	How often is the lamp
JOB.21.17	Does disaster
JOB.21.17	Does he apportion destruction in his anger?
JOB.21.18	Are they like straw before the wind,
JOB.21.18	like chaff
JOB.21.19	God reserves a person’s punishment for his children.
JOB.21.19	Let God repay the person himself, so that he may know it.
JOB.21.20	Let his own eyes see his demise;
JOB.21.20	let him drink from the Almighty’s wrath!
JOB.21.21	For what does he care about his family once he is dead,
JOB.21.21	when the number of his months has run out?
JOB.21.22	Can anyone teach God knowledge,
JOB.21.22	since he judges the exalted ones?
JOB.21.23	One person dies in excellent health,
JOB.21.23	completely secure
JOB.21.24	His body is
JOB.21.24	and his bones are full of marrow.
JOB.21.25	Yet another person dies with a bitter
JOB.21.25	having never tasted prosperity.
JOB.21.26	But they both lie in the dust,
JOB.21.26	and worms cover them.
JOB.21.27	I know your thoughts very well,
JOB.21.27	the schemes by which you would wrong me.
JOB.21.28	For you say, “Where now is the nobleman’s house?”
JOB.21.28	and “Where are the tents
JOB.21.29	Have you never consulted those who travel the roads?
JOB.21.29	Don’t you accept their reports?
JOB.21.30	Indeed, the evil person is spared from the day of disaster,
JOB.21.30	rescued from the day of wrath.
JOB.21.31	Who would denounce his behavior to his face?
JOB.21.31	Who would repay
JOB.21.32	He is carried to the grave,
JOB.21.32	and someone keeps watch over his tomb.
JOB.21.33	The dirt on his grave is
JOB.21.33	Everyone follows behind him,
JOB.21.33	and those who go before him are without number.
JOB.21.34	So how can you offer me such futile comfort?
JOB.21.34	Your answers are deceptive.
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied:
JOB.22.2	Can a man be of any use to God?
JOB.22.2	Can even a wise man be of use to him?
JOB.22.3	Does it delight the Almighty if you are righteous?
JOB.22.3	Does he profit if you perfect your behavior?
JOB.22.4	Does he correct you and take you to court
JOB.22.4	because of your piety?
JOB.22.5	Isn’t your wickedness abundant
JOB.22.5	and aren’t your iniquities endless?
JOB.22.6	For you took collateral
JOB.22.6	stripping off their clothes and leaving them naked.
JOB.22.7	You gave no water to the thirsty
JOB.22.7	and withheld food from the famished,
JOB.22.8	while the land belonged to a powerful man
JOB.22.8	and an influential man lived on it.
JOB.22.9	You sent widows away empty-handed,
JOB.22.9	and the strength of the fatherless
JOB.22.10	Therefore snares surround you,
JOB.22.10	and sudden dread terrifies
JOB.22.11	or darkness, so you cannot see,
JOB.22.11	and a flood of water covers you.
JOB.22.12	Isn’t God as high as the heavens?
JOB.22.12	And look at the highest stars — how lofty they are!
JOB.22.13	Yet you say, “What does God know?
JOB.22.13	Can he judge through total darkness?
JOB.22.14	Clouds
JOB.22.14	as he walks on the circle of the sky.”
JOB.22.15	Will you continue on the ancient path
JOB.22.15	that wicked men have walked?
JOB.22.16	They were snatched away before their time,
JOB.22.16	and their foundations
JOB.22.17	They were the ones who said to God, “Leave us alone!”
JOB.22.17	and “What can the Almighty do to us?” 
JOB.22.18	But it was he who filled their houses with good things.
JOB.22.18	The counsel of the wicked is far from me!
JOB.22.19	The righteous see this and rejoice;
JOB.22.19	the innocent mock them, saying,
JOB.22.20	“Surely our opponents are destroyed,
JOB.22.20	and fire has consumed what they left behind.”
JOB.22.21	Come to terms with God and be at peace;
JOB.22.21	in this way
JOB.22.22	Receive instruction from his mouth,
JOB.22.22	and place his sayings
JOB.22.23	If you return
JOB.22.23	If you banish injustice from your tent
JOB.22.24	and consign your gold to the dust,
JOB.22.24	the gold of Ophir
JOB.22.25	the Almighty will be your gold
JOB.22.25	and your finest silver.
JOB.22.26	Then you will delight
JOB.22.26	and lift up your face to God.
JOB.22.27	You will pray to him, and he will hear you,
JOB.22.27	and you will fulfill your vows.
JOB.22.28	When you make a decision, it will be carried out,
JOB.22.28	and light will shine on your ways.
JOB.22.29	When others are humiliated and you say, “Lift them up,”
JOB.22.29	God will save the humble.
JOB.22.30	He will even rescue the guilty one,
JOB.22.30	who will be rescued by the purity of your hands.
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.23.2	Today also my complaint is bitter.
JOB.23.2	His
JOB.23.3	If only I knew how to find him,
JOB.23.3	so that I could go to his throne.
JOB.23.4	I would plead my case before him
JOB.23.4	and fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would learn how
JOB.23.5	and understand what he would say to me.
JOB.23.6	Would he prosecute
JOB.23.6	No, he would certainly pay attention to me.
JOB.23.7	Then an upright man could reason
JOB.23.7	and I would escape from my Judge
JOB.23.8	If I go east, he is not there,
JOB.23.8	and if I go west, I cannot perceive him.
JOB.23.9	When he is at work to the north, I cannot see him;
JOB.23.9	when he turns south, I cannot find him.
JOB.23.10	Yet he knows the way I have taken;
JOB.23.10	when he has tested me,
JOB.23.11	My feet have followed in his tracks;
JOB.23.11	I have kept to his way
JOB.23.12	I have not departed from the commands from his lips;
JOB.23.12	I have treasured
JOB.23.12	more than my daily food.
JOB.23.13	But he is unchangeable; who can oppose him?
JOB.23.13	He does what he desires.
JOB.23.14	He will certainly accomplish what he has decreed for me,
JOB.23.14	and he has many more things like these in mind.
JOB.23.15	Therefore I am terrified
JOB.23.15	when I consider this, I am afraid of him.
JOB.23.16	God has made my heart faint;
JOB.23.16	the Almighty has terrified me.
JOB.23.17	Yet I am not destroyed
JOB.23.17	by the thick darkness that covers my face.
JOB.24.1	Why does the Almighty not reserve times for judgment?
JOB.24.1	Why do those who know him never see his days?
JOB.24.2	The wicked displace boundary markers.
JOB.24.2	They steal a flock and provide pasture for it.
JOB.24.3	They drive away the donkeys owned by the fatherless
JOB.24.3	and take the widow’s ox as collateral.
JOB.24.4	They push the needy off the road;
JOB.24.4	the poor of the land are forced into hiding.
JOB.24.5	Like wild donkeys in the wilderness,
JOB.24.5	the poor go out to their task of foraging for food;
JOB.24.5	the desert provides nourishment for their children.
JOB.24.6	They gather their fodder in the field
JOB.24.6	and glean the vineyards of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	Without clothing, they spend the night naked,
JOB.24.7	having no covering against the cold.
JOB.24.8	Drenched by mountain rains,
JOB.24.8	they huddle against
JOB.24.9	The fatherless infant is snatched from the breast;
JOB.24.9	the nursing child of the poor is seized as collateral.
JOB.24.10	Without clothing, they wander about naked.
JOB.24.10	They carry sheaves but go hungry.
JOB.24.11	They crush olives in their presses;
JOB.24.11	they tread the winepresses, but go thirsty.
JOB.24.12	From the city, men
JOB.24.12	the mortally wounded cry for help,
JOB.24.12	yet God pays no attention to this crime.
JOB.24.13	The wicked are those who rebel against the light.
JOB.24.13	They do not recognize its ways
JOB.24.13	or stay on its paths.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rises at dawn
JOB.24.14	to kill the poor and needy,
JOB.24.14	and by night he becomes a thief.
JOB.24.15	The adulterer’s eye watches for twilight,
JOB.24.15	thinking, “No eye will see me,”
JOB.24.15	and he covers his face.
JOB.24.16	In the dark they break
JOB.24.16	by day they lock themselves in,
JOB.24.16	never experiencing the light.
JOB.24.17	For the morning is like darkness to them.
JOB.24.17	Surely they are familiar with the terrors of darkness!
JOB.24.18	They float
JOB.24.18	Their section of the land is cursed,
JOB.24.18	so that they never go to their vineyards.
JOB.24.19	As dry ground and heat snatch away the melted snow,
JOB.24.19	so Sheol
JOB.24.20	The womb forgets them;
JOB.24.20	worms feed on them;
JOB.24.20	they are remembered
JOB.24.20	So injustice is broken like a tree.
JOB.24.21	They prey on
JOB.24.21	and do not deal kindly with the widow.
JOB.24.22	Yet God drags away
JOB.24.22	when he rises up, they have no assurance of life.
JOB.24.23	He gives them a sense of security, so they can rely on it,
JOB.24.23	but his eyes
JOB.24.24	They are exalted for a moment, then gone;
JOB.24.24	they are brought low and shrivel up like everything else.
JOB.24.24	They wither like heads of grain.
JOB.24.25	If this is not true, then who can prove me a liar
JOB.24.25	and show that my speech is worthless?
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite replied:
JOB.25.2	Dominion and dread
JOB.25.2	the one who establishes harmony in his heights.
JOB.25.3	Can his troops be numbered?
JOB.25.3	Does his light not shine on everyone?
JOB.25.4	How can a human be justified before God?
JOB.25.4	How can one born of woman be pure?
JOB.25.5	If even the moon does not shine
JOB.25.5	and the stars are not pure in his sight,
JOB.25.6	how much less a human, who is a maggot,
JOB.25.6	a son of man,
JOB.26.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.26.2	How you have helped
JOB.26.2	and delivered the arm that is weak!
JOB.26.3	How you have counseled the unwise
JOB.26.3	and abundantly provided insight!
JOB.26.4	With whom did you speak these words?
JOB.26.4	Whose breath came out of your mouth?
JOB.26.5	The departed spirits tremble
JOB.26.5	beneath the waters and all that inhabit them.
JOB.26.6	Sheol
JOB.26.6	and Abaddon
JOB.26.7	He stretches the northern skies over empty space;
JOB.26.7	he hangs the earth on nothing.
JOB.26.8	He wraps up the water in his clouds,
JOB.26.8	yet the clouds do not burst beneath its weight.
JOB.26.9	He obscures the view of his throne,
JOB.26.9	spreading his cloud over it.
JOB.26.10	He laid out the horizon on the surface of the waters
JOB.26.10	at the boundary between light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	The pillars that hold up the sky tremble,
JOB.26.11	astounded at his rebuke.
JOB.26.12	By his power he stirred
JOB.26.12	and by his understanding he crushed Rahab.
JOB.26.13	By his breath the heavens gained their beauty;
JOB.26.13	his hand pierced the fleeing serpent.
JOB.26.14	These are but the fringes of his ways;
JOB.26.14	how faint is the word we hear of him!
JOB.26.14	Who can understand his mighty thunder?
JOB.27.1	Job continued his discourse, saying:
JOB.27.2	As God lives, who has deprived me of justice,
JOB.27.2	and the Almighty who has made me bitter,
JOB.27.3	as long as my breath is still in me
JOB.27.3	and the breath from God remains in my nostrils,
JOB.27.4	my lips will not speak unjustly,
JOB.27.4	and my tongue will not utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	I will never affirm that you are right.
JOB.27.5	I will maintain my integrity
JOB.27.6	I will cling to my righteousness and never let it go.
JOB.27.6	My conscience
JOB.27.7	May my enemy be like the wicked
JOB.27.7	and my opponent like the unjust.
JOB.27.8	For what hope does the godless person
JOB.27.8	when God takes away his life?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry
JOB.27.9	when distress comes on him?
JOB.27.10	Will he delight
JOB.27.10	Will he call on God at all times?
JOB.27.11	I will teach you about God’s power.
JOB.27.11	I will not conceal what the Almighty has planned.
JOB.27.12	All of you have seen this for yourselves,
JOB.27.12	why do you keep up this empty talk?
JOB.27.13	This is a wicked man’s lot
JOB.27.13	the inheritance the ruthless receive from the Almighty.
JOB.27.14	Even if his children increase, they are destined for the sword;
JOB.27.14	his descendants will never have enough food.
JOB.27.15	Those who survive him will be buried by the plague,
JOB.27.15	yet their widows will not weep for them.
JOB.27.16	Though he piles up silver like dust
JOB.27.16	and heaps up fine clothing like clay —
JOB.27.17	he may heap it up, but the righteous will wear it,
JOB.27.17	and the innocent will divide up his silver.
JOB.27.18	The house he built is like a moth’s cocoon
JOB.27.18	or a shelter set up by a watchman.
JOB.27.19	He lies down wealthy, but will do so no more;
JOB.27.19	when he opens his eyes, it is gone.
JOB.27.20	Terrors overtake him like a flood;
JOB.27.20	a storm
JOB.27.21	An east wind picks him up, and he is gone;
JOB.27.21	it carries him away from his place.
JOB.27.22	It blasts at him without mercy,
JOB.27.22	while he flees desperately from its force.
JOB.27.23	It claps
JOB.27.23	and scoffs at him from its place.
JOB.28.1	Surely there is a mine for silver
JOB.28.1	and a place where gold is refined.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken from the ground,
JOB.28.2	and copper is smelted from ore.
JOB.28.3	A miner puts an end to the darkness;
JOB.28.3	he probes
JOB.28.3	for ore in the gloomy darkness.
JOB.28.4	He cuts a shaft far from human habitation,
JOB.28.4	in places unknown to those who walk above ground.
JOB.28.4	Suspended far away from people,
JOB.28.4	the miners swing back and forth.
JOB.28.5	Food may come from the earth,
JOB.28.5	but below the surface the earth is transformed as by fire.
JOB.28.6	Its rocks are a source of lapis lazuli,
JOB.28.6	containing flecks of gold.
JOB.28.7	No bird of prey knows that path;
JOB.28.7	no falcon’s eye has seen it.
JOB.28.8	Proud beasts have never walked on it;
JOB.28.8	no lion has ever prowled over it.
JOB.28.9	The miner uses a flint tool
JOB.28.9	and turns up ore from the root of the mountains.
JOB.28.10	He cuts out channels in the rocks,
JOB.28.10	and his eyes spot every treasure.
JOB.28.11	He dams up the streams from flowing
JOB.28.11	so that he may bring to light what is hidden.
JOB.28.12	But where can wisdom
JOB.28.12	and where is understanding located?
JOB.28.13	No one can know its value,
JOB.28.13	since it cannot be found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The ocean depths say, “It’s not in me,”
JOB.28.14	while the sea declares, “I don’t have it.”
JOB.28.15	Gold cannot be exchanged for it,
JOB.28.15	and silver cannot be weighed out for its price.
JOB.28.16	Wisdom cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir,
JOB.28.16	in precious onyx or lapis lazuli.
JOB.28.17	Gold and glass do not compare with it,
JOB.28.17	and articles of fine gold cannot be exchanged for it.
JOB.28.18	Coral and quartz are not worth mentioning.
JOB.28.18	The price of wisdom is beyond pearls.
JOB.28.19	Topaz from Cush cannot compare with it,
JOB.28.19	and it cannot be valued in pure gold.
JOB.28.20	Where then does wisdom come from,
JOB.28.20	and where is understanding located?
JOB.28.21	It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing
JOB.28.21	and concealed from the birds of the sky.
JOB.28.22	Abaddon and Death
JOB.28.22	“We have heard news of it with our ears.”
JOB.28.23	But God understands the way to wisdom,
JOB.28.23	and he knows its location.
JOB.28.24	For he looks to the ends of the earth
JOB.28.24	and sees everything under the heavens.
JOB.28.25	When God fixed the weight of the wind
JOB.28.25	and distributed the water by measure,
JOB.28.26	when he established a limit
JOB.28.26	and a path for the lightning,
JOB.28.27	he considered wisdom and evaluated it;
JOB.28.27	he established it and examined it.
JOB.28.28	He said to mankind,
JOB.28.28	“The fear of the Lord—that is wisdom.
JOB.28.28	And to turn from evil is understanding.”
JOB.29.1	Job continued his discourse, saying:
JOB.29.2	If only I could be as in months gone by,
JOB.29.2	in the days when God watched over me,
JOB.29.3	when his lamp shone above my head,
JOB.29.3	and I walked through darkness by his light!
JOB.29.4	I would be as I was in the days of my youth
JOB.29.4	when God’s friendship
JOB.29.5	when the Almighty was still with me
JOB.29.5	and my children were around me,
JOB.29.6	when my feet were bathed in curds
JOB.29.6	and the rock
JOB.29.7	When I went out to the city gate
JOB.29.7	and took my seat in the town square,
JOB.29.8	the young men saw me and withdrew,
JOB.29.8	while older men stood to their feet.
JOB.29.9	City officials stopped talking
JOB.29.9	and covered their mouths with their hands.
JOB.29.10	The noblemen’s voices were hushed,
JOB.29.10	and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
JOB.29.11	When they heard me, they blessed me,
JOB.29.11	and when they saw me, they spoke well of me.
JOB.29.12	For I rescued the poor who cried out for help,
JOB.29.12	and the fatherless child who had no one to support him.
JOB.29.13	The dying blessed me,
JOB.29.13	and I made the widow’s heart rejoice.
JOB.29.14	I clothed myself in righteousness,
JOB.29.14	and it enveloped me;
JOB.29.14	my just decisions were like a robe and a turban.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind
JOB.29.15	and feet to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the needy,
JOB.29.16	and I examined the case of the stranger.
JOB.29.17	I shattered the fangs of the unjust
JOB.29.17	and snatched the prey from his teeth.
JOB.29.18	So I thought, “I will die in my own nest
JOB.29.18	and multiply my days as the sand.
JOB.29.19	My roots will have access to water,
JOB.29.19	and the dew will rest on my branches all night.
JOB.29.20	My whole being will be refreshed within me,
JOB.29.20	and my bow will be renewed in my hand.”
JOB.29.21	Men listened to me with expectation,
JOB.29.21	waiting silently for my advice.
JOB.29.22	After a word from me they did not speak again;
JOB.29.22	my speech settled on them like dew.
JOB.29.23	They waited for me as for the rain
JOB.29.23	and opened their mouths as for spring showers.
JOB.29.24	If I smiled at them, they couldn’t believe it;
JOB.29.24	they were thrilled at
JOB.29.25	I directed their course and presided as chief.
JOB.29.25	I lived as a king among his troops,
JOB.29.25	like one who comforts those who mourn.
JOB.30.1	But now they mock
JOB.30.1	men younger than I am,
JOB.30.1	whose fathers I would have refused to put
JOB.30.1	with my sheep dogs.
JOB.30.2	What use to me was the strength of their hands?
JOB.30.2	Their vigor had left them.
JOB.30.3	Emaciated from poverty and hunger,
JOB.30.3	they gnawed the dry land,
JOB.30.3	the desolate wasteland by night.
JOB.30.4	They plucked mallow
JOB.30.4	and the roots of the broom tree were their food.
JOB.30.5	They were banished from human society;
JOB.30.5	people shouted at them as if they were thieves.
JOB.30.6	They are living on the slopes of the wadis,
JOB.30.6	among the rocks and in holes in the ground.
JOB.30.7	They bray among the shrubs;
JOB.30.7	they huddle beneath the thistles.
JOB.30.8	Foolish
JOB.30.8	They were forced to leave the land.
JOB.30.9	Now I am mocked by their songs;
JOB.30.9	I have become an object of scorn to them.
JOB.30.10	They despise me and keep their distance from me;
JOB.30.10	they do not hesitate to spit
JOB.30.11	Because God has loosened my
JOB.30.11	they have cast off restraint in my presence.
JOB.30.12	The rabble
JOB.30.12	they trap
JOB.30.12	and construct their siege ramp
JOB.30.13	They tear up my path;
JOB.30.13	they contribute to my destruction,
JOB.30.13	without anyone to help them.
JOB.30.14	They advance as through a gaping breach;
JOB.30.14	they keep rolling in through the ruins.
JOB.30.15	Terrors
JOB.30.15	they chase my dignity away like the wind,
JOB.30.15	and my prosperity has passed by like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	Now my life is poured out before me,
JOB.30.16	and days of suffering
JOB.30.17	Night pierces my bones,
JOB.30.17	but my gnawing pains never rest.
JOB.30.18	My clothing is distorted with great force;
JOB.30.18	he chokes me by the neck of my garment.
JOB.30.19	He throws me into the mud,
JOB.30.19	and I have become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry out to you for help, but you do not answer me;
JOB.30.20	when I stand up, you merely look at me.
JOB.30.21	You have turned against me with cruelty;
JOB.30.21	you harass
JOB.30.22	You lift me up on the wind and make me ride it;
JOB.30.22	you scatter me in the storm.
JOB.30.23	Yes, I know that you will lead me to death —
JOB.30.23	the place
JOB.30.24	Yet no one would stretch out his hand
JOB.30.24	against a ruined person
JOB.30.24	when he cries out to him for help
JOB.30.24	because of his distress.
JOB.30.25	Have I not wept for those who have fallen on hard times?
JOB.30.25	Has my soul not grieved for the needy?
JOB.30.26	But when I hoped for good, evil came;
JOB.30.26	when I looked for light, darkness
JOB.30.27	I am churning within
JOB.30.27	days of suffering confront me.
JOB.30.28	I walk about blackened, but not by the sun.
JOB.30.28	I stood in the assembly and cried out for help.
JOB.30.29	I have become a brother to jackals
JOB.30.29	and a companion of ostriches.
JOB.30.30	My skin blackens and flakes off,
JOB.30.30	and my bones burn with fever.
JOB.30.31	My lyre is used for mourning
JOB.30.31	and my flute for the sound of weeping.
JOB.31.1	I have made a covenant with my eyes.
JOB.31.1	How then could I look at a young woman?
JOB.31.2	For what portion
JOB.31.2	or what inheritance from the Almighty on high?
JOB.31.3	Doesn’t disaster come to the unjust
JOB.31.3	and misfortune to evildoers?
JOB.31.4	Does he not see my ways
JOB.31.4	and number all my steps?
JOB.31.5	If I have walked in falsehood
JOB.31.5	or my foot has rushed to deceit,
JOB.31.6	let God weigh me on accurate scales,
JOB.31.6	and he will recognize my integrity.
JOB.31.7	If my step has turned from the way,
JOB.31.7	my heart has followed my eyes,
JOB.31.7	or impurity has stained my hands,
JOB.31.8	let someone else eat what I have sown,
JOB.31.8	and let my crops be uprooted.
JOB.31.9	If my heart has gone astray over a woman
JOB.31.9	or I have lurked at my neighbor’s door,
JOB.31.10	let my own wife grind grain for another man,
JOB.31.10	and let other men sleep with
JOB.31.11	For that would be a disgrace;
JOB.31.11	it would be an iniquity deserving punishment.
JOB.31.12	For it is a fire that consumes down to Abaddon;
JOB.31.12	it would destroy my entire harvest.
JOB.31.13	If I have dismissed the case of my male or female servants
JOB.31.13	when they made a complaint against me,
JOB.31.14	what could I do when God stands up to judge?
JOB.31.14	How should I answer him when he calls me to account?
JOB.31.15	Did not the one who made me in the womb also make them?
JOB.31.15	Did not the same God form us both in the womb?
JOB.31.16	If I have refused the wishes of the poor
JOB.31.16	or let the widow’s
JOB.31.17	if I have eaten my few crumbs alone
JOB.31.17	without letting the fatherless eat any of it —
JOB.31.18	for from my youth, I raised him as his father,
JOB.31.18	and since the day I was born
JOB.31.19	if I have seen anyone dying for lack of clothing
JOB.31.19	or a needy person without a cloak,
JOB.31.20	if he
JOB.31.20	while warming himself with the fleece from my sheep,
JOB.31.21	if I ever cast my vote
JOB.31.21	when I saw that I had support in the city gate,
JOB.31.22	then let my shoulder blade fall from my back,
JOB.31.22	and my arm be pulled from its socket.
JOB.31.23	For disaster from God terrifies me,
JOB.31.23	and because of his majesty I could not do these things.
JOB.31.24	If I placed my confidence in gold
JOB.31.24	or called fine gold my trust,
JOB.31.25	if I have rejoiced because my wealth is great
JOB.31.25	or because my own hand has acquired so much,
JOB.31.26	if I have gazed at the sun when it was shining
JOB.31.26	or at the moon moving in splendor,
JOB.31.27	so that my heart was secretly enticed
JOB.31.27	and I threw them a kiss,
JOB.31.28	this would also be an iniquity deserving punishment,
JOB.31.28	for I would have denied God above.
JOB.31.29	Have I rejoiced over my enemy’s distress,
JOB.31.29	or become excited when trouble came his way?
JOB.31.30	I have not allowed my mouth to sin
JOB.31.30	by asking for his life with a curse.
JOB.31.31	Haven’t the members of my household said,
JOB.31.31	“Who is there who has not had enough to eat at Job’s table?”
JOB.31.32	No stranger had to spend the night on the street,
JOB.31.32	for I opened my door to the traveler.
JOB.31.33	Have I covered my transgressions
JOB.31.33	by hiding my iniquity in my heart
JOB.31.34	because I greatly feared the crowds
JOB.31.34	and because the contempt of the clans terrified me,
JOB.31.34	so I grew silent and would not go outside?
JOB.31.35	If only I had someone to hear my case!
JOB.31.35	Here is my signature; let the Almighty answer me.
JOB.31.35	Let my Opponent compose his indictment.
JOB.31.36	I would surely carry it on my shoulder
JOB.31.36	and wear it like a crown.
JOB.31.37	I would give him an account of all my steps;
JOB.31.37	I would approach him like a prince.
JOB.31.38	If my land cries out against me
JOB.31.38	and its furrows join in weeping,
JOB.31.39	if I have consumed its produce without payment
JOB.31.39	or shown contempt for its tenants,
JOB.31.40	then let thorns
JOB.31.40	and stinkweed
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are concluded.
JOB.32.1	So these three men quit answering Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
JOB.32.2	Then Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite
JOB.32.3	He was also angry at Job’s three friends because they had failed to refute him and yet had condemned him.
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were all older than he. 
JOB.32.5	But when he saw that the three men could not answer Job, he became angry.
JOB.32.6	So Elihu son of Barachel the Buzite replied:
JOB.32.6	I am young in years,
JOB.32.6	while you are old;
JOB.32.6	therefore I was timid and afraid
JOB.32.6	to tell
JOB.32.7	I thought that age should speak
JOB.32.7	and maturity should teach wisdom.
JOB.32.8	But it is the spirit in a person—
JOB.32.8	the breath
JOB.32.8	that gives anyone understanding.
JOB.32.9	It is not only the old who are wise
JOB.32.9	or the elderly who understand how to judge.
JOB.32.10	Therefore I say, “Listen to me.
JOB.32.10	I too will declare what I know.”
JOB.32.11	Look, I waited for your conclusions;
JOB.32.11	I listened to your insights
JOB.32.11	as you sought for words.
JOB.32.12	I paid close attention to you.
JOB.32.12	Yet no one proved Job wrong;
JOB.32.12	not one of you refuted his arguments.
JOB.32.13	So do not claim, “We have found wisdom;
JOB.32.13	let God deal with him, not man.”
JOB.32.14	But Job has not directed his argument to me,
JOB.32.14	and I will not respond to him with your arguments.
JOB.32.15	Job’s friends are dismayed and can no longer answer;
JOB.32.15	words have left them.
JOB.32.16	Should I continue to wait now that they are silent,
JOB.32.16	now that they stand there and no longer answer?
JOB.32.17	I too will answer;
JOB.32.17	yes, I will tell what I know.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words,
JOB.32.18	and my spirit
JOB.32.19	My heart
JOB.32.19	it is about to burst like new wineskins.
JOB.32.20	I must speak so that I can find relief;
JOB.32.20	I must open my lips and respond.
JOB.32.21	I will be partial to no one,
JOB.32.21	and I will not give anyone an undeserved title.
JOB.32.22	For I do not know how to give such titles;
JOB.32.22	otherwise, my Maker would remove me in an instant.
JOB.33.1	But now, Job, pay attention to my speech,
JOB.33.1	and listen to all my words.
JOB.33.2	I am going to open my mouth;
JOB.33.2	my tongue will form words on my palate.
JOB.33.3	My words come from my upright
JOB.33.3	and my lips speak with sincerity what they know.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God has made me,
JOB.33.4	and the breath of the Almighty
JOB.33.5	Refute me if you can.
JOB.33.5	Prepare
JOB.33.6	I am just like you before God;
JOB.33.6	I was also pinched off from a piece of clay.
JOB.33.7	Fear
JOB.33.7	no pressure from me should weigh you down.
JOB.33.8	Surely you have spoken in my hearing,
JOB.33.8	and I have heard these very
JOB.33.9	“I am pure, without transgression;
JOB.33.9	I am clean and have no iniquity.
JOB.33.10	But he finds reasons to oppose me;
JOB.33.10	he regards me as his enemy.
JOB.33.11	He puts my feet in the stocks;
JOB.33.11	he stands watch
JOB.33.12	But I tell you that you are wrong in this matter,
JOB.33.12	since God is greater than man.
JOB.33.13	Why do you take
JOB.33.13	for not answering anything a person asks?
JOB.33.14	For God speaks time and again,
JOB.33.14	but a person may not notice it.
JOB.33.15	In a dream, a vision
JOB.33.15	when deep sleep comes over people
JOB.33.15	as they slumber on their beds,
JOB.33.16	he uncovers their ears
JOB.33.16	and terrifies them
JOB.33.17	in order to turn a person from his actions
JOB.33.17	and suppress the pride of a person.
JOB.33.18	God spares his soul from the Pit,
JOB.33.18	his life from crossing the river of death.
JOB.33.19	A person may be disciplined on his bed
JOB.33.19	and constant distress in his bones,
JOB.33.20	so that he detests bread,
JOB.33.20	and his soul despises his favorite food.
JOB.33.21	His flesh wastes away to nothing,
JOB.33.21	and his unseen bones stick out.
JOB.33.22	He draws near to the Pit,
JOB.33.22	and his life to the executioners.
JOB.33.23	If there is an angel
JOB.33.23	one mediator out of a thousand,
JOB.33.23	to tell a person what is right for him
JOB.33.24	and to be gracious to him and say,
JOB.33.24	“Spare him from going down to the Pit;
JOB.33.24	I have found a ransom,”
JOB.33.25	then his flesh will be healthier
JOB.33.25	and he will return to the days of his youthful vigor.
JOB.33.26	He will pray to God, and God will delight in him.
JOB.33.26	That person will see his face
JOB.33.26	and God will restore his righteousness to him.
JOB.33.27	He will look at men and say,
JOB.33.27	“I have sinned and perverted what was right;
JOB.33.27	yet I did not get what I deserved.
JOB.33.28	He redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit,
JOB.33.28	and I will continue to see the light.”
JOB.33.29	God certainly does all these things
JOB.33.29	two or three times to a person
JOB.33.30	in order to turn him back from the Pit,
JOB.33.30	so he may shine with the light of life.
JOB.33.31	Pay attention, Job, and listen to me.
JOB.33.31	Be quiet, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	But if you have something to say,
JOB.33.32	speak, for I would like to justify you.
JOB.33.33	If not, then listen to me;
JOB.33.33	be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.
JOB.34.1	Then Elihu continued,
JOB.34.2	Hear my words, you wise ones,
JOB.34.2	and listen to me, you knowledgeable ones.
JOB.34.3	Doesn’t the ear test words
JOB.34.3	as the palate tastes food?
JOB.34.4	Let us judge for ourselves what is right;
JOB.34.4	let us decide together what is good.
JOB.34.5	For Job has declared, “I am righteous,
JOB.34.5	yet God has deprived me of justice.
JOB.34.6	Would I lie about my case?
JOB.34.6	My wound
JOB.34.6	though I am without transgression.”
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job?
JOB.34.7	He drinks derision
JOB.34.8	He keeps company with evildoers
JOB.34.8	and walks with wicked men.
JOB.34.9	For he has said, “A man gains nothing
JOB.34.9	when he becomes God’s friend.”
JOB.34.10	Therefore listen to me, you men of understanding.
JOB.34.10	It is impossible for God to do wrong,
JOB.34.10	and for the Almighty to act unjustly.
JOB.34.11	For he repays
JOB.34.11	and he gives him what his conduct deserves.
JOB.34.12	Indeed, it is true that God does not act wickedly
JOB.34.12	and the Almighty does not pervert justice.
JOB.34.13	Who gave him authority over the earth?
JOB.34.13	Who put him in charge of the entire world?
JOB.34.14	If he put his mind to it
JOB.34.14	and withdrew the spirit
JOB.34.15	every living thing would perish together
JOB.34.15	and mankind would return to the dust.
JOB.34.16	If you have understanding, hear this;
JOB.34.16	listen to what I have to say.
JOB.34.17	Could one who hates justice govern the world?
JOB.34.17	Will you condemn the mighty Righteous One,
JOB.34.18	who says to a king, “Worthless man!”
JOB.34.18	and to nobles, “Wicked men!”?
JOB.34.19	God is not partial
JOB.34.19	and does not favor the rich over the poor,
JOB.34.19	for they are all the work of his hands.
JOB.34.20	They die suddenly in the middle of the night;
JOB.34.20	people shudder, then pass away.
JOB.34.20	Even the mighty are removed without effort.
JOB.34.21	For his eyes watch over a man’s ways,
JOB.34.21	and he observes all his steps.
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness, no deep darkness,
JOB.34.22	where evildoers can hide.
JOB.34.23	God does not need to examine a person further,
JOB.34.23	that one should
JOB.34.24	He shatters the mighty without an investigation
JOB.34.24	and sets others in their place.
JOB.34.25	Therefore, he recognizes their deeds
JOB.34.25	and overthrows them by night, and they are crushed.
JOB.34.26	In full view of the public,
JOB.34.26	he strikes them for their wickedness,
JOB.34.27	because they turned aside from following him
JOB.34.27	and did not understand any of his ways
JOB.34.28	but caused the poor to cry out to him,
JOB.34.28	and he heard the outcry of the needy.
JOB.34.29	But when God is silent, who can declare him guilty?
JOB.34.29	When he hides his face, who can see him?
JOB.34.29	Yet he watches over both individuals and nations,
JOB.34.30	so that godless men should not rule
JOB.34.30	or ensnare the people.
JOB.34.31	Suppose someone says to God,
JOB.34.31	“I have endured my punishment;
JOB.34.31	I will no longer act wickedly.
JOB.34.32	Teach me what I cannot see;
JOB.34.32	if I have done wrong, I won’t do it again.”
JOB.34.33	Should God repay you on your terms
JOB.34.33	when you have rejected his?
JOB.34.33	You must choose, not I!
JOB.34.33	So declare what you know.
JOB.34.34	Reasonable men will say to me,
JOB.34.34	along with the wise men who hear me,
JOB.34.35	“Job speaks without knowledge;
JOB.34.35	his words are without insight.”
JOB.34.36	If only Job were tested to the limit,
JOB.34.36	because his answers are like those of wicked men.
JOB.34.37	For he adds rebellion to his sin;
JOB.34.37	he scornfully claps
JOB.34.37	while multiplying
JOB.35.1	Then Elihu continued, saying:
JOB.35.2	Do you think it is just when you say,
JOB.35.2	“I am righteous before God”?
JOB.35.3	For you ask, “What does it profit you,
JOB.35.3	and what benefit comes to me, if I do not sin?” 
JOB.35.4	I will answer you
JOB.35.4	and your friends with you.
JOB.35.5	Look at the heavens and see;
JOB.35.5	gaze at the clouds high above you.
JOB.35.6	If you sin, how does it affect God?
JOB.35.6	If you multiply your transgressions, what does it do to him?
JOB.35.7	If you are righteous, what do you give him,
JOB.35.7	or what does he receive from your hand?
JOB.35.8	Your wickedness affects a person like yourself,
JOB.35.8	and your righteousness, a son of man.
JOB.35.9	People cry out because of severe oppression;
JOB.35.9	they shout for help because of the power of the mighty.
JOB.35.10	But no one asks, “Where is God my Maker,
JOB.35.10	who provides us with songs in the night,
JOB.35.11	who gives us more understanding than the animals of the earth
JOB.35.11	and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky?” 
JOB.35.12	There they cry out, but he does not answer,
JOB.35.12	because of the pride of evil people.
JOB.35.13	Indeed, God does not listen to empty cries,
JOB.35.13	and the Almighty does not take note of it —
JOB.35.14	how much less when
JOB.35.14	that you do not see him,
JOB.35.14	that your case
JOB.35.14	and you are waiting
JOB.35.15	But now, because God’s anger does not punish
JOB.35.15	and he does not pay attention to transgression,
JOB.35.16	Job opens his mouth in vain
JOB.35.16	and multiplies words without knowledge.
JOB.36.1	Then Elihu continued, saying:
JOB.36.2	Be patient with me a little longer, and I will inform you,
JOB.36.2	for there is still more to be said on God’s behalf.
JOB.36.3	I will get my knowledge from a distant place
JOB.36.3	and ascribe justice to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	Indeed, my words are not false;
JOB.36.4	one who has complete knowledge is with you.
JOB.36.5	Yes, God is mighty, but he despises no one;
JOB.36.5	he understands all things.
JOB.36.6	He does not keep the wicked alive,
JOB.36.6	but he gives justice to the oppressed.
JOB.36.7	He does not withdraw his gaze from the righteous,
JOB.36.7	but he seats them forever with enthroned kings,
JOB.36.7	and they are exalted.
JOB.36.8	If people are bound with chains
JOB.36.8	and trapped by the cords of affliction,
JOB.36.9	God tells them what they have done
JOB.36.9	and how arrogantly they have transgressed.
JOB.36.10	He opens their ears
JOB.36.10	and tells them to repent from iniquity.
JOB.36.11	If they listen and serve him,
JOB.36.11	they will end their days in prosperity
JOB.36.11	and their years in happiness.
JOB.36.12	But if they do not listen,
JOB.36.12	they will cross the river of death
JOB.36.12	and die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	Those who have a godless heart harbor anger;
JOB.36.13	even when God binds them, they do not cry for help.
JOB.36.14	They die in their youth;
JOB.36.14	their life ends among male cult prostitutes.
JOB.36.15	God rescues the afflicted by their affliction;
JOB.36.15	he instructs them by their torment.
JOB.36.16	Indeed, he lured you from the jaws
JOB.36.16	to a spacious and unconfined place.
JOB.36.16	Your table was spread with choice food.
JOB.36.17	Yet now you are obsessed with the judgment due the wicked;
JOB.36.17	judgment and justice have seized you.
JOB.36.18	Be careful that no one lures you with riches;
JOB.36.18	do not let a large ransom
JOB.36.19	Can your wealth
JOB.36.19	keep you from distress?
JOB.36.20	Do not long for the night
JOB.36.20	when nations will disappear from their places.
JOB.36.21	Be careful that you do not turn to iniquity,
JOB.36.21	for that is why you have been tested by
JOB.36.22	Look, God shows himself exalted by his power.
JOB.36.22	Who is a teacher like him?
JOB.36.23	Who has appointed his way for him,
JOB.36.23	and who has declared, “You have done wrong”?
JOB.36.24	Remember that you should praise his work,
JOB.36.24	which people have sung about.
JOB.36.25	All mankind has seen it;
JOB.36.25	people have looked at it from a distance.
JOB.36.26	Yes, God is exalted beyond our knowledge;
JOB.36.26	the number of his years cannot be counted.
JOB.36.27	For he makes waterdrops evaporate;
JOB.36.27	they distill the rain into its
JOB.36.28	which the clouds pour out
JOB.36.28	and shower abundantly on mankind.
JOB.36.29	Can anyone understand how the clouds spread out
JOB.36.29	or how the thunder roars from God’s pavilion?
JOB.36.30	See how he spreads his lightning
JOB.36.30	and covers the depths of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For he judges the nations with these;
JOB.36.31	he gives food in abundance.
JOB.36.32	He covers his hands with lightning
JOB.36.32	and commands it to hit its mark.
JOB.36.33	The
JOB.36.33	the cattle also, the approaching storm.
JOB.37.1	My heart
JOB.37.1	and leaps from my chest.
JOB.37.2	Just listen to his thunderous voice
JOB.37.2	and the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
JOB.37.3	He lets it loose beneath the entire sky;
JOB.37.3	his lightning to the ends
JOB.37.4	Then there comes a roaring sound;
JOB.37.4	God thunders
JOB.37.4	He does not restrain the lightning
JOB.37.4	when his rumbling voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God thunders wondrously with his voice;
JOB.37.5	he does great things that we cannot comprehend.
JOB.37.6	For he says to the snow,
JOB.37.6	and the torrential rains, his mighty torrential rains,
JOB.37.7	serve as his sign to all mankind,
JOB.37.7	so that all men may know his work.
JOB.37.8	The wild animals enter their lairs
JOB.37.8	and stay in their dens.
JOB.37.9	The windstorm comes from its chamber,
JOB.37.9	and the cold from the driving north winds.
JOB.37.10	Ice is formed by the breath of God,
JOB.37.10	and watery expanses are frozen.
JOB.37.11	He saturates clouds with moisture;
JOB.37.11	he scatters his lightning through them.
JOB.37.12	They swirl about,
JOB.37.12	turning round and round at his direction,
JOB.37.12	accomplishing everything he commands them
JOB.37.12	over the surface of the inhabited world.
JOB.37.13	He causes this to happen for punishment,
JOB.37.13	for his land, or for his faithful love.
JOB.37.14	Listen to this, Job.
JOB.37.14	Stop and consider God’s wonders.
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God directs his clouds
JOB.37.15	or makes their lightning flash?
JOB.37.16	Do you understand how the clouds float,
JOB.37.16	those wonderful works of him who has perfect knowledge?
JOB.37.17	You whose clothes get hot
JOB.37.17	when the south wind brings calm to the land,
JOB.37.18	can you help God spread out the skies
JOB.37.18	as hard as a cast metal mirror?
JOB.37.19	Teach us what we should say to him;
JOB.37.19	we cannot prepare our case because of our darkness.
JOB.37.20	Should he be told that I want to speak?
JOB.37.20	Can a man speak when he is confused?
JOB.37.21	Now no one can even look at the sun
JOB.37.21	when it is in the skies,
JOB.37.21	after a wind has swept through and cleared the clouds away.
JOB.37.22	Yet out of the north he comes, shrouded in a golden glow;
JOB.37.22	awesome
JOB.37.23	The Almighty — we cannot reach him —
JOB.37.23	he is exalted in power!
JOB.37.23	He will not violate justice and abundant righteousness,
JOB.37.24	therefore, men fear him.
JOB.37.24	He does not look favorably on any who are wise
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	Who is this who obscures my counsel
JOB.38.2	with ignorant words?
JOB.38.3	Get ready to answer me like a man;
JOB.38.3	when I question
JOB.38.4	Where were you when I established
JOB.38.4	Tell me, if you have
JOB.38.5	Who fixed its dimensions? Certainly you know!
JOB.38.5	Who stretched a measuring line across it?
JOB.38.6	What supports its foundations?
JOB.38.6	Or who laid its cornerstone
JOB.38.7	while the morning stars sang together
JOB.38.7	and all the sons of God
JOB.38.8	Who enclosed the sea behind doors
JOB.38.8	when it burst from the womb,
JOB.38.9	when I made the clouds its garment
JOB.38.9	and total darkness its blanket,
JOB.38.10	when I determined its boundaries
JOB.38.10	and put its bars and doors in place,
JOB.38.11	when I declared: “You may come this far, but no farther;
JOB.38.11	your proud waves stop here”?
JOB.38.12	Have you ever in your life commanded the morning
JOB.38.12	or assigned the dawn its place,
JOB.38.13	so it may seize the edges of the earth
JOB.38.13	and shake the wicked out of it?
JOB.38.14	The earth is changed as clay is by a seal;
JOB.38.14	its hills stand out like the folds of a garment.
JOB.38.15	Light
JOB.38.15	and the arm raised in violence is broken.
JOB.38.16	Have you traveled to the sources of the sea
JOB.38.16	or walked in the depths of the oceans?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates
JOB.38.17	Have you seen the gates of deep darkness?
JOB.38.18	Have you comprehended the extent of the earth?
JOB.38.18	Tell me, if you know all this.
JOB.38.19	Where is the road to the home of light?
JOB.38.19	Do you know where darkness lives,
JOB.38.20	so you can lead it back to its border?
JOB.38.20	Are you familiar with the paths to its home?
JOB.38.21	Don’t you know? You were already born;
JOB.38.21	you have lived so long!
JOB.38.22	Have you entered the place where the snow is stored?
JOB.38.22	Or have you seen the storehouses of hail,
JOB.38.23	which I hold in reserve for times of trouble,
JOB.38.23	for the day of warfare and battle?
JOB.38.24	What road leads to the place where light is dispersed?
JOB.38.24	Where is the source of the east wind that spreads across the earth?
JOB.38.25	Who cuts a channel for the flooding rain
JOB.38.25	or clears the way for lightning,
JOB.38.26	to bring rain on an uninhabited land,
JOB.38.26	on a desert with no human life,
JOB.38.27	to satisfy the parched wasteland
JOB.38.27	and cause the grass to sprout?
JOB.38.28	Does the rain have a father?
JOB.38.28	Who fathered the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	Whose womb did the ice come from?
JOB.38.29	Who gave birth to the frost of heaven
JOB.38.30	when water becomes as hard as stone,
JOB.38.30	and the surface of the watery depths is frozen?
JOB.38.31	Can you fasten the chains of the Pleiades
JOB.38.31	or loosen the belt of Orion?
JOB.38.32	Can you bring out the constellations
JOB.38.32	and lead the Bear
JOB.38.33	Do you know the laws
JOB.38.33	Can you impose its
JOB.38.34	Can you command
JOB.38.34	so that a flood of water covers you?
JOB.38.35	Can you send out lightning
JOB.38.35	Do they report to you: “Here we are”?
JOB.38.36	Who put wisdom
JOB.38.36	or gave the mind understanding?
JOB.38.37	Who has the wisdom to number the clouds?
JOB.38.37	Or who can tilt the water jars of heaven
JOB.38.38	when the dust hardens like cast metal
JOB.38.38	and the clods of dirt stick together?
JOB.38.39	Can you hunt prey for a lioness
JOB.38.39	or satisfy the appetite of young lions
JOB.38.40	when they crouch in their dens
JOB.38.40	and lie in wait within their lairs?
JOB.38.41	Who provides the raven’s food
JOB.38.41	when its young cry out to God
JOB.38.41	and wander about for lack of food?
JOB.39.1	Do you know when mountain goats give birth?
JOB.39.1	Have you watched the deer in labor?
JOB.39.2	Can you count the months they are pregnant
JOB.39.2	so you can know the time they give birth?
JOB.39.3	They crouch down to give birth to their young;
JOB.39.3	they deliver their newborn.
JOB.39.4	Their offspring are healthy and grow up in the open field.
JOB.39.4	They leave and do not return.
JOB.39.5	Who set the wild donkey free?
JOB.39.5	Who released the swift donkey from its harness?
JOB.39.6	I made the desert
JOB.39.6	and the salty
JOB.39.7	It scoffs at the noise of the village
JOB.39.7	and never hears the shouts of a driver.
JOB.39.8	It roams the mountains for its pastureland,
JOB.39.8	searching for anything green.
JOB.39.9	Would the wild ox be willing to serve you?
JOB.39.9	Would it spend the night by your feeding trough?
JOB.39.10	Can you hold the wild ox
JOB.39.10	Will it plow the valleys behind you?
JOB.39.11	Can you depend on it because its strength is great?
JOB.39.11	Would you leave it to do your hard work?
JOB.39.12	Can you trust the wild ox to harvest your grain
JOB.39.12	and bring it to your threshing floor?
JOB.39.13	The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully,
JOB.39.13	but are her feathers and plumage like the stork’s?
JOB.39.14	She abandons her eggs on the ground
JOB.39.14	and lets them be warmed in the sand.
JOB.39.15	She forgets that a foot may crush them
JOB.39.15	or that some wild animal may trample them.
JOB.39.16	She treats her young harshly, as if they were not her own,
JOB.39.16	with no fear that her labor may have been in vain.
JOB.39.17	For God has deprived her of wisdom;
JOB.39.17	he has not endowed her with understanding.
JOB.39.18	When she proudly
JOB.39.18	she laughs at the horse and its rider.
JOB.39.19	Do you give strength to the horse?
JOB.39.19	Do you adorn his neck with a mane?
JOB.39.20	Do you make him leap like a locust?
JOB.39.20	His proud snorting fills one with terror.
JOB.39.21	He paws
JOB.39.21	he charges into battle.
JOB.39.22	He laughs at fear, since he is afraid of nothing;
JOB.39.22	he does not run from the sword.
JOB.39.23	A quiver rattles at his side,
JOB.39.23	along with a flashing spear and a javelin.
JOB.39.24	He charges ahead
JOB.39.24	he cannot stand still at the trumpet’s sound.
JOB.39.25	When the trumpet blasts, he snorts defiantly.
JOB.39.25	He smells the battle from a distance;
JOB.39.25	he hears the officers’ shouts and the battle cry.
JOB.39.26	Does the hawk take flight by your understanding
JOB.39.26	and spread its wings to the south?
JOB.39.27	Does the eagle soar at your command
JOB.39.27	and make its nest
JOB.39.28	It lives on a cliff where it spends the night;
JOB.39.28	its stronghold is on a rocky crag.
JOB.39.29	From there it searches for prey;
JOB.39.29	its eyes penetrate the distance.
JOB.39.30	Its brood gulps down blood,
JOB.39.30	and where the slain are, it is there.
JOB.40.1	The 
JOB.40.2	Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him?
JOB.40.2	Let him who argues with God give an answer.
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	I am so insignificant. How can I answer you?
JOB.40.4	I place my hand over my mouth.
JOB.40.5	I have spoken once, and I will not reply;
JOB.40.5	twice, but now I can add nothing.
JOB.40.6	Then the 
JOB.40.7	Get ready to answer me like a man;
JOB.40.7	When I question
JOB.40.8	Would you really challenge my justice?
JOB.40.8	Would you declare me guilty
JOB.40.9	Do you have an arm like God’s?
JOB.40.9	Can you thunder with a voice like his?
JOB.40.10	Adorn yourself with majesty
JOB.40.10	and clothe yourself with honor and glory.
JOB.40.11	Pour out your raging anger;
JOB.40.11	look on every proud person and humiliate him.
JOB.40.12	Look on every proud person and humble him;
JOB.40.12	trample the wicked where they stand.
JOB.40.13	Hide them together in the dust;
JOB.40.13	imprison them in the grave.
JOB.40.14	Then I will confess to you
JOB.40.14	that your own right hand
JOB.40.15	Look at Behemoth,
JOB.40.15	which I made along with you.
JOB.40.15	He eats grass like cattle.
JOB.40.16	Look at the strength of his back
JOB.40.16	and the power in the muscles of his belly.
JOB.40.17	He stiffens his tail like a cedar tree;
JOB.40.17	the tendons of his thighs are woven firmly together.
JOB.40.18	His bones are bronze tubes;
JOB.40.18	his limbs are like iron rods.
JOB.40.19	He is the foremost of God’s works;
JOB.40.19	only his Maker can draw the sword against him.
JOB.40.20	The hills yield food for him,
JOB.40.20	while all sorts of wild animals play there.
JOB.40.21	He lies under the lotus plants,
JOB.40.21	hiding in the protection
JOB.40.22	Lotus plants cover him with their shade;
JOB.40.22	the willows by the brook surround him.
JOB.40.23	Though the river rages, Behemoth is unafraid;
JOB.40.23	he remains confident, even if the Jordan surges up to his mouth.
JOB.40.24	Can anyone capture him while he looks on,
JOB.40.24	or pierce his nose with snares?
JOB.41.1	Can you pull in Leviathan
JOB.41.1	or tie his tongue down with a rope?
JOB.41.2	Can you put a cord
JOB.41.2	or pierce his jaw with a hook?
JOB.41.3	Will he beg you for mercy
JOB.41.3	or speak softly to you?
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant with you
JOB.41.4	so that you can take him as a slave forever?
JOB.41.5	Can you play with him like a bird
JOB.41.5	or put him on a leash
JOB.41.6	Will traders bargain for him
JOB.41.6	or divide him among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Can you fill his hide with harpoons
JOB.41.7	or his head with fishing spears?
JOB.41.8	Lay a
JOB.41.8	You will remember the battle
JOB.41.8	and never repeat it!
JOB.41.9	Any hope of capturing him proves false.
JOB.41.9	Does a person not collapse at the very sight of him?
JOB.41.10	No one is ferocious enough to rouse Leviathan;
JOB.41.10	who then can stand against me?
JOB.41.11	Who confronted me, that I should repay him?
JOB.41.11	Everything under heaven belongs to me.
JOB.41.12	I cannot be silent about his limbs,
JOB.41.12	his power, and his graceful proportions.
JOB.41.13	Who can strip off his outer covering?
JOB.41.13	Who can penetrate his double layer of armor?
JOB.41.14	Who can open his jaws,
JOB.41.14	surrounded by those terrifying teeth?
JOB.41.15	His pride is in his rows of scales,
JOB.41.15	closely sealed together.
JOB.41.16	One scale is so close to another
JOB.41.16	that no air can pass between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined to one another,
JOB.41.17	so closely connected
JOB.41.18	His snorting
JOB.41.18	while his eyes are like the rays
JOB.41.19	Flaming torches shoot from his mouth;
JOB.41.19	fiery sparks fly out!
JOB.41.20	Smoke billows from his nostrils
JOB.41.20	as from a boiling pot or burning reeds.
JOB.41.21	His breath sets coals ablaze,
JOB.41.21	and flames pour out of his mouth.
JOB.41.22	Strength resides in his neck,
JOB.41.22	and dismay dances before him.
JOB.41.23	The folds of his flesh are joined together,
JOB.41.23	solid as metal
JOB.41.24	His heart is as hard as a rock,
JOB.41.24	as hard as a lower millstone!
JOB.41.25	When Leviathan rises, the mighty
JOB.41.25	they withdraw because of his thrashing.
JOB.41.26	The sword that reaches him will have no effect,
JOB.41.26	nor will a spear, dart, or arrow.
JOB.41.27	He regards iron as straw,
JOB.41.27	and bronze as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	No arrow can make him flee;
JOB.41.28	slingstones become like stubble to him.
JOB.41.29	A club is regarded as stubble,
JOB.41.29	and he laughs
JOB.41.30	His undersides are jagged potsherds,
JOB.41.30	spreading the mud like a threshing sledge.
JOB.41.31	He makes the depths seethe like a cauldron;
JOB.41.31	he makes the sea like an ointment jar.
JOB.41.32	He leaves a shining wake behind him;
JOB.41.32	one would think the deep had gray hair!
JOB.41.33	He has no equal on earth —
JOB.41.33	a creature devoid of fear!
JOB.41.34	He surveys everything that is haughty;
JOB.41.34	he is king over all the proud beasts.
JOB.42.1	Then Job replied to the 
JOB.42.2	I
JOB.42.2	and no plan of yours can be thwarted.
JOB.42.3	You asked, “Who is this who conceals my counsel with ignorance?” 
JOB.42.3	Surely I spoke about things I did not understand,
JOB.42.3	things too wondrous for me to
JOB.42.4	You said, “Listen now, and I will speak.
JOB.42.4	When I question
JOB.42.5	I had heard reports about you,
JOB.42.5	but now my eyes
JOB.42.6	Therefore, I reject my words and am sorry for them;
JOB.42.6	I am dust and ashes.
JOB.42.7	After the 
JOB.42.8	Now take seven bulls and seven rams, go to my servant Job, and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. Then my servant Job will pray for you.
JOB.42.9	Then Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite went and did as the 
JOB.42.10	After Job had prayed for his friends, the 
JOB.42.11	All his brothers, sisters, and former acquaintances
JOB.42.12	So the 
JOB.42.13	He also had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	He named his first daughter Jemimah, his second Keziah, and his third Keren-happuch.
JOB.42.15	No women as beautiful as Job’s daughters could be found in all the land, and their father granted them an inheritance with their brothers.
JOB.42.16	Job lived 140 years after this and saw his children and their children to the fourth generation. 
JOB.42.17	Then Job died, old and full of days.
PSA.1.1	How happy is the one who does not
PSA.1.1	walk in the advice of the wicked
PSA.1.1	or stand in the pathway with sinners
PSA.1.1	or sit in the company of mockers!
PSA.1.2	Instead, his delight is in the 
PSA.1.2	and he meditates on it day and night.
PSA.1.3	He is like a tree planted beside flowing streams
PSA.1.3	that bears its fruit in its season
PSA.1.3	and whose leaf does not wither.
PSA.1.3	Whatever he does prospers.
PSA.1.4	The wicked are not like this;
PSA.1.4	instead, they are like chaff that the wind blows away.
PSA.1.5	Therefore the wicked will not stand up in the judgment,
PSA.1.5	nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.
PSA.1.6	For the 
PSA.1.6	but the way of the wicked leads to ruin.
PSA.2.1	Why
PSA.2.1	and the peoples plot in vain?
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth take their stand,
PSA.2.2	and the rulers conspire together
PSA.2.2	against the 
PSA.2.3	“Let’s tear off their chains
PSA.2.3	and throw their ropes off of us.”
PSA.2.4	The one enthroned
PSA.2.4	the Lord ridicules them.
PSA.2.5	Then he speaks to them in his anger
PSA.2.5	and terrifies them in his wrath:
PSA.2.6	“I have installed my king
PSA.2.6	on Zion, my holy mountain.”
PSA.2.7	I will declare the 
PSA.2.7	He said to me, “You are my Son;
PSA.2.7	today I have become your Father.
PSA.2.8	Ask of me,
PSA.2.8	and I will make the nations your inheritance
PSA.2.8	and the ends of the earth your possession.
PSA.2.9	You will break them with an iron scepter;
PSA.2.9	you will shatter them like pottery.”
PSA.2.10	So now, kings, be wise;
PSA.2.10	receive instruction, you judges of the earth.
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.11	and rejoice with trembling.
PSA.2.12	Pay homage to
PSA.2.12	and you will perish in your rebellion,
PSA.2.12	for his anger may ignite at any moment.
PSA.2.12	All who take refuge in him are happy.
PSA.3.1	There are many who attack me.
PSA.3.2	Many say about me,
PSA.3.2	“There is no help for him in God.”
PSA.3.3	But you, 
PSA.3.3	my glory,
PSA.3.4	I cry aloud to the 
PSA.3.4	and he answers me from his holy mountain.
PSA.3.5	I lie down and sleep;
PSA.3.5	I wake again because the 
PSA.3.6	I will not be afraid of thousands of people
PSA.3.6	who have taken their stand against me on every side.
PSA.3.7	Rise up, 
PSA.3.7	Save me, my God!
PSA.3.7	You strike all my enemies on the cheek;
PSA.3.7	you break the teeth of the wicked.
PSA.3.8	Salvation belongs to the 
PSA.3.8	may your blessing be on your people.
PSA.4.1	Answer me when I call,
PSA.4.1	God, who vindicates me.
PSA.4.1	You freed me from affliction;
PSA.4.1	be gracious to me and hear my prayer.
PSA.4.2	How long, exalted ones,
PSA.4.2	How long will you love what is worthless
PSA.4.2	and pursue a lie? 
PSA.4.3	Know that the 
PSA.4.3	the faithful for himself;
PSA.4.3	the 
PSA.4.4	Be angry
PSA.4.4	on your bed, reflect in your heart and be still.
PSA.4.5	Offer sacrifices in righteousness
PSA.4.5	and trust in the 
PSA.4.6	Many are asking, “Who can show us anything good?”
PSA.4.6	Let the light of your face shine on us, 
PSA.4.7	You have put more joy in my heart
PSA.4.7	than they have when their grain and new wine abound.
PSA.4.8	I will both lie down and sleep in peace,
PSA.4.8	for you alone, 
PSA.5.1	Listen to my words, 
PSA.5.1	consider my sighing.
PSA.5.2	Pay attention to the sound of my cry,
PSA.5.2	my King and my God,
PSA.5.2	for I pray to you.
PSA.5.3	In the morning,
PSA.5.3	in the morning I plead my case to you
PSA.5.4	For you are not a God who delights in wickedness;
PSA.5.4	evil cannot dwell with you.
PSA.5.5	The boastful cannot stand in your sight;
PSA.5.5	you hate all evildoers.
PSA.5.6	You destroy those who tell lies;
PSA.5.6	the 
PSA.5.7	But I enter your house
PSA.5.7	by the abundance of your faithful love;
PSA.5.7	I bow down toward your holy temple
PSA.5.7	in reverential awe of you.
PSA.5.8	because of my adversaries;
PSA.5.8	make your way straight before me.
PSA.5.9	For there is nothing reliable in what they say;
PSA.5.9	destruction is within them;
PSA.5.9	their throat is an open grave;
PSA.5.9	they flatter with their tongues.
PSA.5.10	Punish them, God;
PSA.5.10	let them fall by their own schemes.
PSA.5.10	Drive them out
PSA.5.10	for they rebel against you.
PSA.5.11	But let all who take refuge in you rejoice;
PSA.5.11	let them shout for joy forever.
PSA.5.11	May you shelter them,
PSA.5.11	and may those who love your name boast about you.
PSA.5.12	For you, 
PSA.5.12	you surround him with favor like a shield.
PSA.6.1	do not discipline me in your wrath.
PSA.6.2	Be gracious to me, 
PSA.6.2	heal me,
PSA.6.3	my whole being is shaken with terror.
PSA.6.3	And you, 
PSA.6.4	Turn, 
PSA.6.4	save me because of your faithful love.
PSA.6.5	For there is no remembrance of you in death;
PSA.6.5	who can thank you in Sheol?
PSA.6.6	I am weary from my groaning;
PSA.6.6	with my tears I dampen my bed
PSA.6.6	and drench my couch every night.
PSA.6.7	My eyes are swollen from grief;
PSA.6.7	they grow old because of all my enemies.
PSA.6.8	Depart from me, all evildoers,
PSA.6.8	for the 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.9	the 
PSA.6.10	All my enemies will be ashamed and shake with terror;
PSA.6.10	they will turn back
PSA.7.1	save me from all my pursuers and rescue me
PSA.7.2	or they
PSA.7.2	ripping me apart with no one to rescue me.
PSA.7.3	if there is injustice on my hands,
PSA.7.4	if I have done harm to one at peace with me
PSA.7.4	or have plundered
PSA.7.5	may an enemy pursue and overtake me;
PSA.7.5	may he trample me to the ground
PSA.7.5	and leave my honor in the dust.
PSA.7.6	Rise up, 
PSA.7.6	lift yourself up against the fury of my adversaries;
PSA.7.6	awake for me;
PSA.7.6	you have ordained a judgment.
PSA.7.7	Let the assembly of peoples gather around you;
PSA.7.7	take your seat on high over it.
PSA.7.8	The 
PSA.7.8	vindicate me, 
PSA.7.8	according to my righteousness and my integrity.
PSA.7.9	Let the evil of the wicked come to an end,
PSA.7.9	but establish the righteous.
PSA.7.9	The one who examines the thoughts and emotions
PSA.7.9	is a righteous God.
PSA.7.10	My shield is with God,
PSA.7.10	who saves the upright in heart.
PSA.7.11	God is a righteous judge
PSA.7.11	and a God who shows his wrath every day.
PSA.7.12	If anyone does not repent,
PSA.7.12	he will sharpen his sword;
PSA.7.12	he has strung his bow and made it ready.
PSA.7.13	He has prepared his deadly weapons;
PSA.7.13	he tips his arrows with fire.
PSA.7.14	See, the wicked one is pregnant with evil,
PSA.7.14	conceives trouble, and gives birth to deceit.
PSA.7.15	He dug a pit and hollowed it out
PSA.7.15	but fell into the hole he had made.
PSA.7.16	His trouble comes back on his own head;
PSA.7.16	his own violence comes down on top of his head.
PSA.7.17	I will thank the 
PSA.7.17	I will sing about the name of the 
PSA.8.1	how magnificent is your name throughout the earth!
PSA.8.1	You have covered the heavens with your majesty.
PSA.8.2	From the mouths of infants and nursing babies,
PSA.8.2	you have established a stronghold
PSA.8.2	on account of your adversaries
PSA.8.2	in order to silence the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.8.3	When I observe your heavens,
PSA.8.3	the work of your fingers,
PSA.8.3	the moon and the stars,
PSA.8.3	which you set in place,
PSA.8.4	what is a human being that you remember him,
PSA.8.4	a son of man
PSA.8.5	You made him little less than God
PSA.8.5	and crowned him with glory and honor.
PSA.8.6	You made him ruler over the works of your hands;
PSA.8.6	you put everything under his feet:
PSA.8.7	all the sheep and oxen,
PSA.8.7	as well as the animals in the wild,
PSA.8.8	the birds of the sky,
PSA.8.8	and the fish of the sea
PSA.8.8	that pass through the currents of the seas.
PSA.8.9	how magnificent is your name throughout the earth!
PSA.9.1	I will thank the 
PSA.9.1	I will declare all your wondrous works.
PSA.9.2	I will rejoice and boast about you;
PSA.9.2	I will sing about your name, Most High.
PSA.9.3	When my enemies retreat,
PSA.9.3	they stumble and perish before you.
PSA.9.4	For you have upheld my just cause;
PSA.9.4	you are seated on your throne as a righteous judge.
PSA.9.5	You have rebuked the nations:
PSA.9.5	You have destroyed the wicked;
PSA.9.5	you have erased their name forever and ever.
PSA.9.6	The enemy has come to eternal ruin.
PSA.9.6	You have uprooted the cities,
PSA.9.6	and the very memory of them has perished.
PSA.9.7	But the 
PSA.9.7	he has established his throne for judgment.
PSA.9.8	And he judges the world with righteousness;
PSA.9.8	he executes judgment on the nations with fairness.
PSA.9.9	The 
PSA.9.9	a refuge in times of trouble.
PSA.9.10	Those who know your name trust in you
PSA.9.10	because you have not abandoned
PSA.9.10	those who seek you, 
PSA.9.11	Sing to the 
PSA.9.11	proclaim his deeds among the nations.
PSA.9.12	For the one who seeks an accounting
PSA.9.12	for bloodshed remembers them;
PSA.9.12	he does not forget the cry of the oppressed.
PSA.9.13	Be gracious to me, 
PSA.9.13	consider my affliction at the hands of those who hate me.
PSA.9.13	Lift me up from the gates of death,
PSA.9.14	so that I may declare all your praises.
PSA.9.14	I will rejoice in your salvation
PSA.9.14	within the gates of Daughter Zion.
PSA.9.15	The nations have fallen into the pit they made;
PSA.9.15	their foot is caught in the net they have concealed.
PSA.9.16	The 
PSA.9.16	he has executed justice,
PSA.9.16	snaring the wicked
PSA.9.16	by the work of their hands.
PSA.9.17	The wicked will return to Sheol
PSA.9.17	all the nations that forget God.
PSA.9.18	For the needy will not always be forgotten;
PSA.9.18	the hope of the oppressed
PSA.9.19	Rise up, 
PSA.9.19	let the nations be judged in your presence.
PSA.9.20	Put terror in them, 
PSA.9.20	let the nations know they are only humans.
PSA.10.1	Why do you hide in times of trouble?
PSA.10.2	In arrogance the wicked relentlessly pursue their victims;
PSA.10.2	let them be caught in the schemes they have devised.
PSA.10.3	For the wicked one boasts about his own cravings;
PSA.10.3	the one who is greedy curses
PSA.10.4	In all his scheming,
PSA.10.4	the wicked person arrogantly thinks,
PSA.10.4	“There’s no accountability,
PSA.10.4	since there’s no God.”
PSA.10.5	His ways are always secure;
PSA.10.5	your lofty judgments have no effect on him;
PSA.10.5	he scoffs at all his adversaries.
PSA.10.6	He says to himself, “I will never be moved —
PSA.10.6	from generation to generation without calamity.”
PSA.10.7	Cursing, deceit, and violence fill his mouth;
PSA.10.7	trouble and malice are under his tongue.
PSA.10.8	He waits in ambush near settlements;
PSA.10.8	he kills the innocent in secret places.
PSA.10.8	His eyes are on the lookout for the helpless;
PSA.10.9	he lurks in secret like a lion in a thicket.
PSA.10.9	He lurks in order to seize a victim;
PSA.10.9	he seizes a victim and drags him in his net.
PSA.10.10	So he is oppressed and beaten down;
PSA.10.10	helpless people fall because of the wicked one’s strength.
PSA.10.11	He says to himself, “God has forgotten;
PSA.10.11	he hides his face and will never see.”
PSA.10.12	Rise up, 
PSA.10.12	Do not forget the oppressed.
PSA.10.13	Why has the wicked person despised God?
PSA.10.13	He says to himself, “You will not demand an account.”
PSA.10.14	But you yourself have seen trouble and grief,
PSA.10.14	observing it in order to take the matter into your hands.
PSA.10.14	The helpless one entrusts himself to you;
PSA.10.14	you are a helper of the fatherless.
PSA.10.15	Break the arm of the wicked, evil person,
PSA.10.15	until you look for his wickedness,
PSA.10.15	but it can’t be found.
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.16	the nations will perish from his land.
PSA.10.17	you will strengthen their hearts.
PSA.10.17	You will listen carefully,
PSA.10.18	doing justice for the fatherless and the oppressed
PSA.10.18	so that mere humans from the earth may terrify them no more.
PSA.11.1	I have taken refuge in the 
PSA.11.1	How can you say to me,
PSA.11.1	“Escape to the mountains
PSA.11.2	For look, the wicked string bows;
PSA.11.2	they put their arrows on bowstrings
PSA.11.2	to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart.
PSA.11.3	When the foundations are destroyed,
PSA.11.3	what can the righteous do?” 
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.4	the 
PSA.11.4	His eyes watch;
PSA.11.4	his gaze
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.5	but he hates the wicked
PSA.11.5	and
PSA.11.6	Let him rain burning coals
PSA.11.6	let a scorching wind be the portion in their cup.
PSA.11.7	For the 
PSA.11.7	The upright will see his face.
PSA.12.1	Help, 
PSA.12.1	the loyal have disappeared from the human race.
PSA.12.2	They lie to one another;
PSA.12.2	they speak with flattering lips and deceptive hearts.
PSA.12.3	May the 
PSA.12.3	and the tongue that speaks boastfully.
PSA.12.4	They say, “Through our tongues we have power;
PSA.12.4	our lips are our own — who can be our master?” 
PSA.12.5	“Because of the devastation of the needy
PSA.12.5	and the groaning of the poor,
PSA.12.5	I will now rise up,” says the 
PSA.12.5	“I will provide safety for the one who longs for it.”
PSA.12.6	The words of the 
PSA.12.6	like silver refined in an earthen furnace,
PSA.12.6	purified seven times.
PSA.12.7	You, 
PSA.12.7	you will protect us
PSA.12.8	The wicked prowl
PSA.12.8	and what is worthless is exalted by the human race.
PSA.13.1	How long, 
PSA.13.1	How long will you hide your face from me?
PSA.13.2	How long will I store up anxious concerns
PSA.13.2	agony in my mind every day?
PSA.13.2	How long will my enemy dominate me?
PSA.13.3	Consider me and answer, 
PSA.13.3	Restore brightness to my eyes;
PSA.13.3	otherwise, I will sleep in death.
PSA.13.4	My enemy will say, “I have triumphed over him,”
PSA.13.4	and my foes will rejoice because I am shaken.
PSA.13.5	But I have trusted in your faithful love;
PSA.13.5	my heart will rejoice in your deliverance.
PSA.13.6	I will sing to the 
PSA.13.6	because he has treated me generously.
PSA.14.1	The fool says in his heart, “There’s no God.”
PSA.14.1	They are corrupt; they do vile deeds.
PSA.14.1	There is no one who does good.
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.2	to see if there is one who is wise,
PSA.14.2	one who seeks God.
PSA.14.3	All have turned away;
PSA.14.3	all alike have become corrupt.
PSA.14.3	There is no one who does good,
PSA.14.3	not even one.
PSA.14.4	Will evildoers never understand?
PSA.14.4	They consume my people as they consume bread;
PSA.14.4	they do not call on the 
PSA.14.5	Then
PSA.14.5	for God is with those who are
PSA.14.6	You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed,
PSA.14.6	but the 
PSA.14.7	Oh, that Israel’s deliverance would come from Zion!
PSA.14.7	When the 
PSA.14.7	let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
PSA.15.1	Who can live on your holy mountain?
PSA.15.2	The one who lives blamelessly, practices righteousness,
PSA.15.2	and acknowledges the truth in his heart
PSA.15.3	who does not slander with his tongue,
PSA.15.3	who does not harm his friend
PSA.15.3	or discredit his neighbor,
PSA.15.4	who despises the one rejected by the 
PSA.15.4	but honors those who fear the 
PSA.15.4	who keeps his word whatever the cost,
PSA.15.5	who does not lend his silver at interest
PSA.15.5	or take a bribe against the innocent
PSA.15.5	the one who does these things will never be shaken.
PSA.16.1	Protect me, God, for I take refuge in you.
PSA.16.2	I
PSA.16.2	I have nothing good besides you.”
PSA.16.3	As for the holy people who are in the land,
PSA.16.3	they are the noble ones.
PSA.16.3	All my delight is in them.
PSA.16.4	The sorrows of those who take another god
PSA.16.4	for themselves will multiply;
PSA.16.4	I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood,
PSA.16.4	and I will not speak their names with my lips.
PSA.16.5	and my cup of blessing;
PSA.16.5	you hold my future.
PSA.16.6	The boundary lines have fallen for me
PSA.16.6	in pleasant places;
PSA.16.6	indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance.
PSA.16.7	I will bless the 
PSA.16.7	even at night when my thoughts trouble me.
PSA.16.8	I always let the 
PSA.16.8	Because he is at my right hand,
PSA.16.8	I will not be shaken.
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad
PSA.16.9	and my whole being rejoices;
PSA.16.9	my body also rests securely.
PSA.16.10	For you will not abandon me to Sheol;
PSA.16.10	you will not allow your faithful one to see decay.
PSA.16.11	You reveal the path of life to me;
PSA.16.11	in your presence is abundant joy;
PSA.16.11	at your right hand are eternal pleasures.
PSA.17.1	pay attention to my cry;
PSA.17.1	listen to my prayer —
PSA.17.1	from lips free of deceit.
PSA.17.2	Let my vindication come from you,
PSA.17.2	for you see what is right.
PSA.17.3	You have tested my heart;
PSA.17.3	you have examined me at night.
PSA.17.3	You have tried me and found nothing evil;
PSA.17.3	I have determined that my mouth will not sin.
PSA.17.4	Concerning what people do:
PSA.17.4	by the words from your lips
PSA.17.4	I have avoided the ways of the violent.
PSA.17.5	My steps are on your paths;
PSA.17.5	my feet have not slipped.
PSA.17.6	I call on you, God,
PSA.17.6	because you will answer me;
PSA.17.6	listen closely to me; hear what I say.
PSA.17.7	Display the wonders of your faithful love,
PSA.17.7	Savior of all who seek refuge
PSA.17.7	from those who rebel against your right hand.
PSA.17.8	Protect me as the pupil of your eye;
PSA.17.8	hide me in the shadow of your wings
PSA.17.9	from
PSA.17.9	my deadly enemies who surround me.
PSA.17.10	They are uncaring;
PSA.17.10	their mouths speak arrogantly.
PSA.17.11	They advance against me;
PSA.17.11	They are determined
PSA.17.11	to throw me to the ground.
PSA.17.12	They are
PSA.17.12	like a young lion lurking in ambush.
PSA.17.13	Rise up, 
PSA.17.13	Confront him; bring him down.
PSA.17.13	With your sword, save me from the wicked.
PSA.17.14	With your hand, 
PSA.17.14	from men of the world
PSA.17.14	whose portion is in this life:
PSA.17.14	You fill their bellies with what you have in store;
PSA.17.14	their sons are satisfied,
PSA.17.14	and they leave their surplus to their children.
PSA.17.15	But I will see your face in righteousness;
PSA.17.15	when I awake, I will be satisfied with your presence.
PSA.18.1	I love you, 
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.2	my fortress, and my deliverer,
PSA.18.2	my God, my rock where I seek refuge,
PSA.18.2	my shield
PSA.18.2	my stronghold.
PSA.18.3	I called to the 
PSA.18.3	and I was saved from my enemies.
PSA.18.4	The ropes of death were wrapped around me;
PSA.18.4	the torrents of destruction terrified me.
PSA.18.5	The ropes of Sheol entangled me;
PSA.18.5	the snares of death confronted me.
PSA.18.6	I called to the 
PSA.18.6	and I cried to my God for help.
PSA.18.6	From his temple he heard my voice,
PSA.18.6	and my cry to him reached his ears.
PSA.18.7	Then the earth shook and quaked;
PSA.18.7	the foundations of the mountains trembled;
PSA.18.7	they shook because he burned with anger.
PSA.18.8	Smoke rose from his nostrils,
PSA.18.8	and consuming fire came from his mouth;
PSA.18.8	coals were set ablaze by it.
PSA.18.9	He bent the heavens and came down,
PSA.18.9	total darkness beneath his feet.
PSA.18.10	He rode on a cherub and flew,
PSA.18.10	soaring on the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his hiding place,
PSA.18.11	dark storm clouds his canopy around him.
PSA.18.12	From the radiance of his presence,
PSA.18.12	his clouds swept onward with hail and blazing coals.
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.13	the Most High made his voice heard.
PSA.18.14	He shot his arrows and scattered them;

PSA.18.21	For I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.21	and have not turned from my God to wickedness.
PSA.18.22	Indeed, I let all his ordinances guide me
PSA.18.22	and have not disregarded his statutes.

PSA.22.2	by night, yet I have no rest.
PSA.22.3	But you are holy,
PSA.22.3	enthroned on the praises of Israel.
PSA.22.4	Our fathers trusted in you;

PSA.22.8	let the 
PSA.22.8	since he takes pleasure in him.”
PSA.22.9	It was you who brought me out of the womb,

PSA.30.9	Will the dust praise you?
PSA.30.9	Will it proclaim your truth?
PSA.30.11	You turned my lament into dancing;
PSA.30.11	you removed my sackcloth
PSA.30.11	and clothed me with gladness,
PSA.30.12	so that I can sing to you and not be silent.
PSA.31.1	let me never be disgraced.
PSA.31.1	Save me by your righteousness.
PSA.31.2	Listen closely to me; rescue me quickly.
PSA.31.2	Be a rock of refuge for me,
PSA.31.2	a mountain fortress to save me.
PSA.31.3	For you are my rock and my fortress;
PSA.31.3	you lead and guide me
PSA.31.3	for your name’s sake.
PSA.31.4	You will free me from the net
PSA.31.4	that is secretly set for me,
PSA.31.4	for you are my refuge.
PSA.31.5	Into your hand I entrust my spirit;
PSA.31.5	you have redeemed me,
PSA.31.6	I
PSA.31.6	but I trust in the 
PSA.31.7	I will rejoice and be glad in your faithful love
PSA.31.7	because you have seen my affliction.
PSA.31.7	You know the troubles of my soul
PSA.31.8	and have not handed me over to the enemy.
PSA.31.8	You have set my feet in a spacious place.
PSA.31.9	Be gracious to me, 
PSA.31.9	because I am in distress;
PSA.31.9	my eyes are worn out from frustration —
PSA.31.9	my whole being
PSA.31.10	Indeed, my life is consumed with grief
PSA.31.10	and my years with groaning;
PSA.31.10	my strength has failed
PSA.31.10	because of my iniquity,
PSA.31.10	and my bones waste away.
PSA.31.11	I am ridiculed by all my adversaries
PSA.31.11	and even by my neighbors.
PSA.31.11	I am dreaded by my acquaintances;
PSA.31.11	those who see me in the street run from me.
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten: gone from memory
PSA.31.12	like a dead person — like broken pottery.
PSA.31.13	I have heard the gossip of many;
PSA.31.13	terror is on every side.
PSA.31.13	When they conspired against me,
PSA.31.13	they plotted to take my life.
PSA.31.14	But I trust in you, 
PSA.31.14	I say, “You are my God.”
PSA.31.15	The course of my life is in your power;
PSA.31.15	rescue me from the power of my enemies
PSA.31.15	and from my persecutors.
PSA.31.16	Make your face shine on your servant;
PSA.31.16	save me by your faithful love.
PSA.31.17	Let the wicked be disgraced;
PSA.31.17	let them be quiet
PSA.31.18	Let lying lips
PSA.31.18	that arrogantly speak against the righteous
PSA.31.18	in proud contempt be silenced.
PSA.31.19	How great is your goodness
PSA.31.19	that you have stored up for those who fear you
PSA.31.19	and accomplished in the sight of everyone
PSA.31.19	for those who take refuge in you.
PSA.31.20	You hide them in the protection of your presence;
PSA.31.20	you conceal them in a shelter
PSA.31.20	from human schemes,
PSA.31.20	from quarrelsome tongues.
PSA.31.21	Blessed be the 
PSA.31.21	for he has wondrously shown his faithful love to me
PSA.31.21	in a city under siege.
PSA.31.22	In my alarm I said,
PSA.31.22	“I am cut off from your sight.”
PSA.31.22	But you heard the sound of my pleading
PSA.31.22	when I cried to you for help.
PSA.31.23	Love the 
PSA.31.23	The 
PSA.31.23	but fully repays the arrogant.
PSA.31.24	Be strong, and let your heart be courageous,
PSA.31.24	all you who put your hope in the 
PSA.32.1	How joyful is the one
PSA.32.1	whose transgression is forgiven,
PSA.32.1	whose sin is covered!
PSA.32.2	How joyful is a person whom
PSA.32.2	the 
PSA.32.2	and in whose spirit is no deceit!
PSA.32.3	When I kept silent, my bones became brittle
PSA.32.3	from my groaning all day long.
PSA.32.4	For day and night your hand was heavy on me;
PSA.32.4	my strength was drained
PSA.32.4	as in the summer’s heat.
PSA.32.5	Then I acknowledged my sin to you
PSA.32.5	and did not conceal my iniquity.
PSA.32.5	I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the 
PSA.32.5	and you forgave the guilt of my sin.
PSA.32.6	Therefore let everyone who is faithful pray to you immediately.
PSA.32.6	When great floodwaters come,
PSA.32.6	they will not reach him.
PSA.32.7	You are my hiding place;
PSA.32.7	you protect me from trouble.
PSA.32.7	You surround me with joyful shouts of deliverance.
PSA.32.8	I will instruct you and show you the way to go;
PSA.32.8	with my eye on you, I will give counsel.
PSA.32.9	Do not be like a horse or mule,
PSA.32.9	without understanding,
PSA.32.9	that must be controlled with bit and bridle
PSA.32.9	or else it will not come near you.
PSA.32.10	Many pains come to the wicked,
PSA.32.10	but the one who trusts in the 
PSA.32.10	will have faithful love surrounding him.
PSA.32.11	Be glad in the 
PSA.32.11	you righteous ones;
PSA.32.11	shout for joy,
PSA.32.11	all you upright in heart.
PSA.33.1	Rejoice in the 
PSA.33.1	praise from the upright is beautiful.
PSA.33.2	Praise the 
PSA.33.2	make music to him with a ten-stringed harp.
PSA.33.3	Sing a new song to him;
PSA.33.3	play skillfully on the strings, with a joyful shout.
PSA.33.4	For the word of the 
PSA.33.4	and all his work is trustworthy.
PSA.33.5	He loves righteousness and justice;
PSA.33.5	the earth is full of the 
PSA.33.6	The heavens were made by the word of the 
PSA.33.6	and all the stars, by the breath of his mouth.
PSA.33.7	He gathers the water of the sea into a heap;
PSA.33.7	he puts the depths into storehouses.
PSA.33.8	Let the whole earth fear the 
PSA.33.8	let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
PSA.33.9	For he spoke, and it came into being;
PSA.33.9	he commanded, and it came into existence.
PSA.33.10	The 
PSA.33.10	he thwarts the plans of the peoples.
PSA.33.11	The counsel of the 
PSA.33.11	the plans of his heart from generation to generation.
PSA.33.12	Happy is the nation whose God is the 
PSA.33.12	the people he has chosen to be his own possession!
PSA.33.13	The 
PSA.33.13	he observes everyone.
PSA.33.14	He gazes on all the inhabitants of the earth
PSA.33.14	from his dwelling place.
PSA.33.15	He forms the hearts of them all;
PSA.33.15	he considers all their works.
PSA.33.16	A king is not saved by a large army;
PSA.33.16	a warrior will not be rescued by great strength.
PSA.33.17	The horse is a false hope for safety;
PSA.33.17	it provides no escape by its great power.
PSA.33.18	But look, the 
PSA.33.18	those who depend on his faithful love
PSA.33.19	to rescue them from death
PSA.33.19	and to keep them alive in famine.
PSA.33.20	We wait for the 
PSA.33.20	he is our help and shield.
PSA.33.21	For our hearts rejoice in him
PSA.33.21	because we trust in his holy name.
PSA.33.22	May your faithful love rest on us, 
PSA.33.22	for we put our hope in you.
PSA.34.1	I will bless the 
PSA.34.1	his praise will always be on my lips.
PSA.34.2	I will boast in the 
PSA.34.2	the humble will hear and be glad.
PSA.34.3	Proclaim the 
PSA.34.3	let us exalt his name together.
PSA.34.4	I sought the 
PSA.34.4	and rescued me from all my fears.
PSA.34.5	Those who look to him are
PSA.34.5	their faces will never be ashamed.
PSA.34.6	This poor man cried, and the 
PSA.34.6	and saved him from all his troubles.
PSA.34.7	The angel of the 
PSA.34.7	around those who fear him, and rescues them.
PSA.34.8	Taste and see that the 
PSA.34.8	How happy is the person who takes refuge in him!
PSA.34.9	You who are his holy ones, fear the 
PSA.34.9	for those who fear him lack nothing.
PSA.34.10	Young lions
PSA.34.10	but those who seek the 
PSA.34.10	will not lack any good thing.
PSA.34.11	Come, children, listen to me;
PSA.34.11	I will teach you the fear of the 
PSA.34.12	Who is someone who desires life,
PSA.34.12	loving a long life to enjoy what is good?
PSA.34.13	Keep your tongue from evil
PSA.34.13	and your lips from deceitful speech.
PSA.34.14	Turn away from evil and do what is good;
PSA.34.14	seek peace and pursue it.
PSA.34.15	The eyes of the 
PSA.34.15	and his ears are open to their cry for help.
PSA.34.16	The face of the 
PSA.34.16	against those who do what is evil,
PSA.34.16	to remove
PSA.34.17	The righteous
PSA.34.17	and rescues them from all their troubles.
PSA.34.18	The 
PSA.34.18	he saves those crushed in spirit.
PSA.34.19	One who is righteous has many adversities,
PSA.34.19	but the 
PSA.34.20	He protects all his bones;
PSA.34.20	not one of them is broken.
PSA.34.21	Evil brings death to the wicked,
PSA.34.21	and those who hate the righteous will be punished.
PSA.34.22	The 
PSA.34.22	and all who take refuge in him will not be punished.
PSA.35.1	Oppose my opponents, 
PSA.35.1	fight those who fight me.
PSA.35.2	Take your shields — large and small —
PSA.35.2	and come to my aid.
PSA.35.3	Draw the spear and javelin against my pursuers,
PSA.35.3	and assure me: “I am your deliverance.”
PSA.35.4	Let those who intend to take my life
PSA.35.4	be disgraced and humiliated;
PSA.35.4	let those who plan to harm me
PSA.35.4	be turned back and ashamed.
PSA.35.5	Let them be like chaff in the wind,
PSA.35.5	with the angel of the 
PSA.35.6	Let their way be dark and slippery,
PSA.35.6	with the angel of the 
PSA.35.7	They hid their net for me without cause;
PSA.35.7	they dug a pit for me without cause.
PSA.35.8	Let ruin come on him unexpectedly,
PSA.35.8	and let the net that he hid ensnare him;
PSA.35.8	let him fall into it — to his ruin.
PSA.35.9	Then I will rejoice in the 
PSA.35.9	I will delight in his deliverance.
PSA.35.10	All my bones will say,
PSA.35.10	“
PSA.35.10	rescuing the poor from one too strong for him,
PSA.35.10	the poor or the needy from one who robs him?” 
PSA.35.11	Malicious witnesses come forward;
PSA.35.11	they question me about things I do not know.
PSA.35.12	They repay me evil for good,
PSA.35.12	making me desolate.
PSA.35.13	Yet when they were sick,
PSA.35.13	my clothing was sackcloth;
PSA.35.13	I humbled myself with fasting,
PSA.35.13	and my prayer was genuine.
PSA.35.14	I went about mourning as if for my friend or brother;
PSA.35.14	I was bowed down with grief,
PSA.35.14	like one mourning for a mother.
PSA.35.15	But when I stumbled, they gathered in glee;
PSA.35.15	they gathered against me.
PSA.35.15	Assailants I did not know
PSA.35.15	tore at me and did not stop.
PSA.35.16	With godless mockery
PSA.35.16	they gnashed their teeth at me.
PSA.35.17	Lord, how long will you look on?
PSA.35.17	Rescue me from their ravages;
PSA.35.17	rescue my precious life from the young lions.
PSA.35.18	I will praise you in the great assembly;
PSA.35.18	I will exalt you among many people.
PSA.35.19	Do not let my deceitful enemies rejoice over me;
PSA.35.19	do not let those who hate me without cause
PSA.35.19	wink at me maliciously.
PSA.35.20	For they do not speak in friendly ways,
PSA.35.20	but contrive fraudulent schemes
PSA.35.20	against those who live peacefully in the land.
PSA.35.21	They open their mouths wide against me and say,
PSA.35.21	“Aha, aha! We saw it!” 
PSA.35.22	You saw it, 
PSA.35.22	Lord, do not be far from me.
PSA.35.23	Wake up and rise to my defense,
PSA.35.23	to my cause, my God and my Lord!
PSA.35.24	Vindicate me, 
PSA.35.24	in keeping with your righteousness,
PSA.35.24	and do not let them rejoice over me.
PSA.35.25	Do not let them say in their hearts,
PSA.35.25	“Aha! Just what we wanted.”
PSA.35.25	Do not let them say,
PSA.35.25	“We have swallowed him up!” 
PSA.35.26	Let those who rejoice at my misfortune
PSA.35.26	be disgraced and humiliated;
PSA.35.26	let those who exalt themselves over me
PSA.35.26	be clothed with shame and reproach.
PSA.35.27	Let those who want my vindication
PSA.35.27	shout for joy and be glad;
PSA.35.27	let them continually say,
PSA.35.27	“The 
PSA.35.27	He takes pleasure in his servant’s well-being.”
PSA.35.28	And my tongue will proclaim your righteousness,
PSA.35.28	your praise all day long.
PSA.36.1	An oracle within my heart
PSA.36.1	concerning the transgression of the wicked person:
PSA.36.1	Dread of God has no effect on him.
PSA.36.2	For with his flattering opinion of himself,
PSA.36.2	he does not discover and hate his iniquity.
PSA.36.3	The words from his mouth are malicious and deceptive;
PSA.36.3	he has stopped acting wisely and doing good.
PSA.36.4	Even on his bed he makes malicious plans.
PSA.36.4	He sets himself on a path that is not good,
PSA.36.4	and he does not reject evil.
PSA.36.5	your faithfulness to the clouds.
PSA.36.6	Your righteousness is like the highest mountains,
PSA.36.6	your judgments like the deepest sea.
PSA.36.7	How priceless your faithful love is, God!
PSA.36.7	People take refuge in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.36.8	They are filled from the abundance of your house.
PSA.36.8	You let them drink from your refreshing stream.
PSA.36.9	For the wellspring of life is with you.
PSA.36.9	By means of your light we see light.
PSA.36.10	Spread your faithful love over those who know you,
PSA.36.10	and your righteousness over the upright in heart.
PSA.36.11	Do not let the foot of the arrogant come near me
PSA.36.11	or the hand of the wicked drive me away.
PSA.36.12	There! The evildoers have fallen.
PSA.36.12	They have been thrown down and cannot rise.
PSA.37.1	Do not be agitated by evildoers;
PSA.37.1	do not envy those who do wrong.
PSA.37.2	For they wither quickly like grass
PSA.37.2	and wilt like tender green plants.
PSA.37.3	Trust in the 
PSA.37.3	dwell in the land and live securely.
PSA.37.4	Take delight in the 
PSA.37.4	and he will give you your heart’s desires.
PSA.37.5	Commit your way to the 
PSA.37.5	trust in him, and he will act,
PSA.37.6	making your righteousness shine like the dawn,
PSA.37.6	your justice like the noonday.
PSA.37.7	Be silent before the 
PSA.37.7	do not be agitated by one who prospers in his way,
PSA.37.7	by the person who carries out evil plans.
PSA.37.8	Refrain from anger and give up your rage;
PSA.37.8	do not be agitated — it can only bring harm.
PSA.37.9	For evildoers will be destroyed,
PSA.37.9	but those who put their hope in the 
PSA.37.9	will inherit the land.
PSA.37.10	A little while, and the wicked person will be no more;
PSA.37.10	though you look for him, he will not be there.
PSA.37.11	But the humble will inherit the land
PSA.37.11	and will enjoy abundant prosperity.
PSA.37.12	The wicked person schemes against the righteous
PSA.37.12	and gnashes his teeth at him.
PSA.37.13	The Lord laughs at him
PSA.37.13	because he sees that his day is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked have drawn the sword and strung the
PSA.37.14	to bring down the poor and needy
PSA.37.14	and to slaughter those whose way is upright.
PSA.37.15	Their swords will enter their own hearts,
PSA.37.15	and their bows will be broken.
PSA.37.16	The little that the righteous person has is better
PSA.37.16	than the abundance of many wicked people.
PSA.37.17	For the arms of the wicked will be broken,
PSA.37.17	but the 
PSA.37.18	The 
PSA.37.18	and their inheritance will last forever.
PSA.37.19	They will not be disgraced in times of adversity;
PSA.37.19	they will be satisfied in days of hunger.
PSA.37.20	But the wicked will perish;
PSA.37.20	the 
PSA.37.20	will fade away —
PSA.37.20	they will fade away like smoke.
PSA.37.21	The wicked person borrows and does not repay,
PSA.37.21	but the righteous one is gracious and giving.
PSA.37.22	Those who are blessed by the 
PSA.37.22	but those cursed by him will be destroyed.
PSA.37.23	A person’s steps are established by the 
PSA.37.23	and he takes pleasure in his way.
PSA.37.24	Though he falls, he will not be overwhelmed,
PSA.37.24	because the 
PSA.37.25	I have been young and now I am old,
PSA.37.25	yet I have not seen the righteous abandoned
PSA.37.25	or his children begging for bread.
PSA.37.26	He is always generous, always lending,
PSA.37.26	and his children are a blessing.
PSA.37.27	Turn away from evil, do what is good,
PSA.37.27	and settle permanently.
PSA.37.28	For the 
PSA.37.28	and will not abandon his faithful ones.
PSA.37.28	They are kept safe forever,
PSA.37.28	but the children of the wicked will be destroyed.
PSA.37.29	The righteous will inherit the land
PSA.37.29	and dwell in it permanently.
PSA.37.30	The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom;
PSA.37.30	his tongue speaks what is just.
PSA.37.31	The instruction of his God is in his heart;
PSA.37.31	his steps do not falter.
PSA.37.32	The wicked one lies in wait for the righteous
PSA.37.32	and intends to kill him;
PSA.37.33	the 
PSA.37.33	in the power of the wicked one
PSA.37.33	or allow him to be condemned when he is judged.
PSA.37.34	Wait for the 
PSA.37.34	and he will exalt you to inherit the land.
PSA.37.34	You will watch when the wicked are destroyed.
PSA.37.35	I have seen a wicked, violent person
PSA.37.35	well-rooted,
PSA.37.36	Then I
PSA.37.36	I searched for him, but he could not be found.
PSA.37.37	Watch the blameless and observe the upright,
PSA.37.37	for the person of peace will have a future.
PSA.37.38	But transgressors will all be eliminated;
PSA.37.38	the future of the wicked will be destroyed.
PSA.37.39	The salvation of the righteous is from the 
PSA.37.39	their refuge in a time of distress.
PSA.37.40	The 
PSA.37.40	he will deliver them from the wicked and will save them
PSA.37.40	because they take refuge in him.
PSA.38.1	or discipline me in your wrath.
PSA.38.2	For your arrows have sunk into me,
PSA.38.2	and your hand has pressed down on me.
PSA.38.3	There is no soundness in my body
PSA.38.3	because of your indignation;
PSA.38.3	there is no health
PSA.38.3	because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	For my iniquities have flooded over my head;
PSA.38.4	they are a burden too heavy for me to bear.
PSA.38.5	My wounds are foul and festering
PSA.38.5	because of my foolishness.
PSA.38.6	I am bent over and brought very low;
PSA.38.6	all day long I go around in mourning.
PSA.38.7	For my insides are full of burning pain,
PSA.38.7	and there is no soundness in my body.
PSA.38.8	I am faint and severely crushed;
PSA.38.8	I groan because of the anguish of my heart.
PSA.38.9	Lord, my every desire is in front of you;
PSA.38.9	my sighing is not hidden from you.
PSA.38.10	My heart races, my strength leaves me,
PSA.38.10	and even the light of my eyes has faded.
PSA.38.11	My loved ones and friends stand back from my affliction,
PSA.38.11	and my relatives stand at a distance.
PSA.38.12	Those who intend to kill me set traps,
PSA.38.12	and those who want to harm me threaten to destroy me;
PSA.38.12	they plot treachery all day long.
PSA.38.13	I am like a deaf person; I do not hear.
PSA.38.13	I am like a speechless person
PSA.38.13	who does not open his mouth.
PSA.38.14	I am like a man who does not hear
PSA.38.14	and has no arguments in his mouth.
PSA.38.15	For I put my hope in you, 
PSA.38.15	you will answer me, my Lord, my God.
PSA.38.16	For I said, “Don’t let them rejoice over me —
PSA.38.16	those who are arrogant toward me when I stumble.”
PSA.38.17	For I am about to fall,
PSA.38.17	and my pain is constantly with me.
PSA.38.18	So I confess my iniquity;
PSA.38.18	I am anxious because of my sin.
PSA.38.19	But my enemies are vigorous and powerful;
PSA.38.19	many hate me for no reason.
PSA.38.20	Those who repay evil for good
PSA.38.20	attack me for pursuing good.
PSA.38.21	my God, do not be far from me.
PSA.38.22	Hurry to help me,
PSA.38.22	my Lord, my salvation.
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will guard my ways
PSA.39.1	so that I may not sin with my tongue;
PSA.39.1	I will guard my mouth with a muzzle
PSA.39.1	as long as the wicked are in my presence.”
PSA.39.2	I was speechless and quiet;
PSA.39.2	I kept silent, even from speaking good,
PSA.39.2	and my pain intensified.
PSA.39.3	My heart grew hot within me;
PSA.39.3	as I mused, a fire burned.
PSA.39.3	I spoke with my tongue:
PSA.39.4	“
PSA.39.4	and the number of my days
PSA.39.4	so that I will know how short-lived I am.
PSA.39.5	In fact, you have made my days just inches long,
PSA.39.5	and my life span is as nothing to you.
PSA.39.5	Yes, every human being stands as only a vapor.
PSA.39.6	Yes, a person goes about like a mere shadow.
PSA.39.6	Indeed, they rush around in vain,
PSA.39.6	gathering possessions
PSA.39.6	without knowing who will get them.
PSA.39.7	“Now, Lord, what do I wait for?
PSA.39.7	My hope is in you.
PSA.39.8	Rescue me from all my transgressions;
PSA.39.8	do not make me the taunt of fools.
PSA.39.9	I am speechless; I do not open my mouth
PSA.39.9	because of what you have done.
PSA.39.10	Remove your torment from me.
PSA.39.10	Because of the force of your hand I am finished.
PSA.39.11	You discipline a person with punishment for iniquity,
PSA.39.11	consuming like a moth what is precious to him;
PSA.39.11	yes, every human being is only a vapor.
PSA.39.12	“Hear my prayer, 
PSA.39.12	and listen to my cry for help;
PSA.39.12	do not be silent at my tears.
PSA.39.12	For I am here with you as an alien,
PSA.39.12	a temporary resident like all my ancestors.
PSA.39.13	Turn your angry gaze from me
PSA.39.13	so that I may be cheered up
PSA.39.13	before I die and am gone.”
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the 
PSA.40.1	and he turned to me and heard my cry for help.
PSA.40.2	He brought me up from a desolate
PSA.40.2	out of the muddy clay,
PSA.40.2	and set my feet on a rock,
PSA.40.2	making my steps secure.
PSA.40.3	He put a new song in my mouth,
PSA.40.3	a hymn of praise to our God.
PSA.40.3	Many will see and fear,
PSA.40.3	and they will trust in the 
PSA.40.4	How happy is anyone
PSA.40.4	who has put his trust in the 
PSA.40.4	and has not turned to the proud
PSA.40.4	or to those who run after lies!
PSA.40.5	your wondrous works and your plans for us;
PSA.40.5	none can compare with you.
PSA.40.5	If I were to report and speak of them,
PSA.40.5	they are more than can be told.
PSA.40.6	You do not delight in sacrifice and offering;
PSA.40.6	you open my ears to listen.
PSA.40.6	You do not ask for a whole burnt offering or a sin offering.
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “See, I have come;
PSA.40.7	in the scroll it is written about me.
PSA.40.8	I delight to do your will, my God,
PSA.40.8	and your instruction is deep within me.”
PSA.40.9	I proclaim righteousness in the great assembly;
PSA.40.9	see, I do not keep my mouth closed
PSA.40.9	as you know, 
PSA.40.10	I did not hide your righteousness in my heart;
PSA.40.10	I spoke about your faithfulness and salvation;
PSA.40.10	I did not conceal your constant love and truth
PSA.40.10	from the great assembly.
PSA.40.11	Your constant love and truth will always guard me.
PSA.40.12	For troubles without number have surrounded me;
PSA.40.12	my iniquities have overtaken me; I am unable to see.
PSA.40.12	They are more than the hairs of my head,
PSA.40.12	and my courage leaves me.
PSA.40.13	hurry to help me, 
PSA.40.14	Let those who intend to take my life
PSA.40.14	be disgraced and confounded.
PSA.40.14	Let those who wish me harm
PSA.40.14	be turned back and humiliated.
PSA.40.15	Let those who say to me, “Aha, aha!”
PSA.40.15	be appalled because of their shame.
PSA.40.16	Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;
PSA.40.16	let those who love your salvation continually say,
PSA.40.16	“The 
PSA.40.17	I am oppressed and needy;
PSA.40.17	may the Lord think of me.
PSA.40.17	You are my helper and my deliverer;
PSA.40.17	my God, do not delay.
PSA.41.1	Happy is one who is considerate of the poor;
PSA.41.1	the 
PSA.41.2	The 
PSA.41.2	he will be blessed in the land.
PSA.41.2	You will not give him over to the desire of his enemies.
PSA.41.3	The 
PSA.41.3	you will heal him on the bed where he lies.
PSA.41.4	I said, “
PSA.41.4	heal me, for I have sinned against you.”
PSA.41.5	My enemies speak maliciously about me:
PSA.41.5	“When will he die and be forgotten?” 
PSA.41.6	When one of them comes to visit, he speaks deceitfully;
PSA.41.6	he stores up evil in his heart;
PSA.41.6	he goes out and talks.
PSA.41.7	All who hate me whisper together about me;
PSA.41.7	they plan to harm me.
PSA.41.8	“Something awful has overwhelmed him,
PSA.41.8	and he won’t rise again from where he lies!” 
PSA.41.9	Even my friend
PSA.41.9	one who ate my bread,
PSA.41.9	has raised his heel against me.
PSA.41.10	But you, 
PSA.41.10	then I will repay them.
PSA.41.11	By this I know that you delight in me:
PSA.41.11	my enemy does not shout in triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	You supported me because of my integrity
PSA.41.12	and set me in your presence forever.
PSA.41.13	Blessed be the 
PSA.41.13	from everlasting to everlasting.
PSA.41.13	Amen and amen.
PSA.42.1	As a deer longs for flowing streams,
PSA.42.1	so I long for you, God.
PSA.42.2	I thirst for God, the living God.
PSA.42.2	When can I come and appear before God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my food day and night,
PSA.42.3	while all day long people say to me,
PSA.42.3	“Where is your God?” 
PSA.42.4	I remember this as I pour out my heart:
PSA.42.4	how I walked with many,
PSA.42.4	leading the festive procession to the house of God,
PSA.42.4	with joyful and thankful shouts.
PSA.42.5	Why, my soul, are you so dejected?
PSA.42.5	Why are you in such turmoil?
PSA.42.5	Put your hope in God, for I will still praise him,
PSA.42.5	my Savior and my God.
PSA.42.6	I
PSA.42.6	therefore I remember you from the land of Jordan
PSA.42.6	and the peaks of Hermon, from Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls;
PSA.42.7	all your breakers and your billows have swept over me.
PSA.42.8	The 
PSA.42.8	his song will be with me in the night —
PSA.42.8	a prayer to the God of my life.
PSA.42.9	I will say to God, my rock,
PSA.42.9	“Why have you forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why must I go about in sorrow
PSA.42.9	because of the enemy’s oppression?” 
PSA.42.10	My adversaries taunt me,
PSA.42.10	as if crushing my bones,
PSA.42.10	while all day long they say to me,
PSA.42.10	“Where is your God?” 
PSA.42.11	Why, my soul, are you so dejected?
PSA.42.11	Why are you in such turmoil?
PSA.42.11	Put your hope in God, for I will still praise him,
PSA.42.11	my Savior and my God.
PSA.43.1	Vindicate me, God, and champion my cause
PSA.43.1	against an unfaithful nation;
PSA.43.1	rescue me from the deceitful and unjust person.
PSA.43.2	For you are the God of my refuge.
PSA.43.2	Why have you rejected me?
PSA.43.2	Why must I go about in sorrow
PSA.43.2	because of the enemy’s oppression?
PSA.43.3	Send your light and your truth; let them lead me.
PSA.43.3	Let them bring me to your holy mountain,
PSA.43.3	to your dwelling place.
PSA.43.4	Then I will come to the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	to God, my greatest joy.
PSA.43.4	I will praise you with the lyre,
PSA.43.4	God, my God.
PSA.43.5	Why, my soul, are you so dejected?
PSA.43.5	Why are you in such turmoil?
PSA.43.5	Put your hope in God, for I will still praise him,
PSA.43.5	my Savior and my God.
PSA.44.1	God, we have heard with our ears —
PSA.44.1	our ancestors have told us —
PSA.44.1	the work you accomplished in their days,
PSA.44.1	in days long ago:
PSA.44.2	In order to plant them,
PSA.44.2	you displaced the nations by your hand;
PSA.44.2	in order to settle them,
PSA.44.2	you brought disaster on the peoples.
PSA.44.3	For they did not take the land by their sword —
PSA.44.3	their arm did not bring them victory —
PSA.44.3	but by your right hand, your arm,
PSA.44.3	and the light of your face,
PSA.44.3	because you were favorable toward them.
PSA.44.4	You are my King, my God,
PSA.44.4	who ordains
PSA.44.5	Through you we drive back our foes;
PSA.44.5	through your name we trample our enemies.
PSA.44.6	For I do not trust in my bow,
PSA.44.6	and my sword does not bring me victory.
PSA.44.7	But you give us victory over our foes
PSA.44.7	and let those who hate us be disgraced.
PSA.44.8	We boast in God all day long;
PSA.44.8	we will praise your name forever.
PSA.44.9	But you have rejected and humiliated us;
PSA.44.9	you do not march out with our armies.
PSA.44.10	You make us retreat from the foe,
PSA.44.10	and those who hate us
PSA.44.10	have taken plunder for themselves.
PSA.44.11	You hand us over to be eaten like sheep
PSA.44.11	and scatter us among the nations.
PSA.44.12	You sell your people for nothing;
PSA.44.12	you make no profit from selling them.
PSA.44.13	You make us an object of reproach to our neighbors,
PSA.44.13	a source of mockery and ridicule to those around us.
PSA.44.14	You make us a joke among the nations,
PSA.44.14	a laughingstock
PSA.44.15	My disgrace is before me all day long,
PSA.44.15	and shame has covered my face,
PSA.44.16	because of the taunts
PSA.44.16	because of the enemy and avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this has happened to us,
PSA.44.17	but we have not forgotten you
PSA.44.17	or betrayed your covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our hearts have not turned back;
PSA.44.18	our steps have not strayed from your path.
PSA.44.19	But you have crushed us in a haunt of jackals
PSA.44.19	and have covered us with deepest darkness.
PSA.44.20	If we had forgotten the name of our God
PSA.44.20	and spread out our hands to a foreign god,
PSA.44.21	wouldn’t God have found this out,
PSA.44.21	since he knows the secrets of the heart?
PSA.44.22	Because of you we are being put to death all day long;
PSA.44.22	we are counted as sheep to be slaughtered.
PSA.44.23	Wake up, 
PSA.44.23	Get up! Don’t reject us forever!
PSA.44.24	Why do you hide
PSA.44.24	and forget our affliction and oppression?
PSA.44.25	For we have sunk down to the dust;
PSA.44.25	our bodies cling to the ground.
PSA.44.26	Rise up! Help us!
PSA.44.26	Redeem us because of your faithful love.
PSA.45.1	My heart is moved by a noble theme
PSA.45.1	as I recite my verses to the king;
PSA.45.1	my tongue is the pen of a skillful writer.
PSA.45.2	You are the most handsome of men;
PSA.45.2	grace flows from your lips.
PSA.45.2	Therefore God has blessed you forever.
PSA.45.3	Mighty warrior, strap your sword at your side.
PSA.45.3	In your majesty and splendor
PSA.45.4	in your splendor ride triumphantly
PSA.45.4	in the cause of truth, humility, and justice.
PSA.45.4	May your right hand show your awe-inspiring acts.
PSA.45.5	Your sharpened arrows pierce the hearts of the king’s enemies;
PSA.45.5	the peoples fall under you.
PSA.45.6	Your throne,
PSA.45.6	the scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of justice.
PSA.45.7	You love righteousness and hate wickedness;
PSA.45.7	therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy
PSA.45.7	more than your companions.
PSA.45.8	Myrrh, aloes, and cassia perfume all your garments;
PSA.45.8	from ivory palaces harps bring you joy.
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters are among your honored women;
PSA.45.9	the queen, adorned with gold from Ophir,
PSA.45.9	stands at your right hand.
PSA.45.10	Listen, daughter, pay attention and consider:
PSA.45.10	forget your people and your father’s house,
PSA.45.11	and the king will desire your beauty.
PSA.45.11	Bow down to him, for he is your lord.
PSA.45.12	The daughter of Tyre, the wealthy people,
PSA.45.12	will seek your favor with gifts.
PSA.45.13	In her chamber, the royal daughter is all glorious,
PSA.45.13	her clothing embroidered with gold.
PSA.45.14	In colorful garments she is led to the king;
PSA.45.14	after her, the virgins, her companions, are brought to you.
PSA.45.15	They are led in with gladness and rejoicing;
PSA.45.15	they enter the king’s palace.
PSA.45.16	Your sons will succeed your ancestors;
PSA.45.16	you will make them princes throughout the land.
PSA.45.17	I will cause your name to be remembered for all generations;
PSA.45.17	therefore the peoples will praise you forever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength,
PSA.46.1	a helper who is always found
PSA.46.1	in times of trouble.
PSA.46.2	Therefore we will not be afraid,
PSA.46.2	though the earth trembles
PSA.46.2	and the mountains topple
PSA.46.2	into the depths of the seas,
PSA.46.3	though its water roars and foams
PSA.46.3	and the mountains quake with its turmoil.
PSA.46.4	There is a river —
PSA.46.4	its streams delight the city of God,
PSA.46.4	the holy dwelling place of the Most High.
PSA.46.5	God is within her; she will not be toppled.
PSA.46.5	God will help her when the morning dawns.
PSA.46.6	Nations rage, kingdoms topple;
PSA.46.6	the earth melts when he lifts his voice.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.7	the God of Jacob is our stronghold.
PSA.46.8	Come, see the works of the 
PSA.46.8	who brings devastation on the earth.
PSA.46.9	He makes wars cease throughout the earth.
PSA.46.9	He shatters bows and cuts spears to pieces;
PSA.46.9	he sets wagons ablaze.
PSA.46.10	“Stop your fighting, and know that I am God,
PSA.46.10	exalted among the nations, exalted on the earth.”
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.46.11	the God of Jacob is our stronghold.
PSA.47.1	Clap your hands, all you peoples;
PSA.47.1	shout to God with a jubilant cry.
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.2	a great King over the whole earth.
PSA.47.3	He subdues peoples under us
PSA.47.3	and nations under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He chooses for us our inheritance —
PSA.47.4	the pride of Jacob, whom he loves.
PSA.47.5	God ascends among shouts of joy,
PSA.47.5	the 
PSA.47.6	Sing praise to God, sing praise;
PSA.47.6	sing praise to our King, sing praise!
PSA.47.7	Sing a song of wisdom,
PSA.47.7	for God is King of the whole earth.
PSA.47.8	God reigns over the nations;
PSA.47.8	God is seated on his holy throne.
PSA.47.9	The nobles of the peoples have assembled
PSA.47.9	with the people of the God of Abraham.
PSA.47.9	For the leaders
PSA.47.9	he is greatly exalted.
PSA.48.1	The 
PSA.48.1	in the city of our God.
PSA.48.1	His holy mountain, 
PSA.48.2	rising splendidly,
PSA.48.2	is the joy of the whole earth.
PSA.48.2	Mount Zion — the summit of Zaphon —  
PSA.48.2	is the city of the great King.
PSA.48.3	God is known as a stronghold
PSA.48.3	in its citadels.
PSA.48.4	Look! The kings assembled;
PSA.48.4	they advanced together.
PSA.48.5	They looked and froze with fear;
PSA.48.5	they fled in terror.
PSA.48.6	Trembling seized them there,
PSA.48.6	agony like that of a woman in labor,
PSA.48.7	as you wrecked the ships of Tarshish
PSA.48.7	with the east wind.
PSA.48.8	Just as we heard, so we have seen
PSA.48.8	in the city of the 
PSA.48.8	in the city of our God;
PSA.48.8	God will establish it forever.
PSA.48.9	God, within your temple,
PSA.48.9	we contemplate your faithful love.
PSA.48.10	Like your name, God, so your praise
PSA.48.10	reaches to the ends of the earth;
PSA.48.10	your right hand is filled with justice.
PSA.48.11	Mount Zion is glad.
PSA.48.11	Judah’s villages
PSA.48.11	because of your judgments.
PSA.48.12	Go around Zion, encircle it;
PSA.48.12	count its towers,
PSA.48.13	note its ramparts; tour its citadels
PSA.48.13	so that you can tell a future generation:
PSA.48.14	“This God, our God forever and ever —
PSA.48.14	he will always lead us.”
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all you peoples;
PSA.49.1	listen, all who inhabit the world,
PSA.49.2	both low and high,
PSA.49.2	rich and poor together.
PSA.49.3	My mouth speaks wisdom;
PSA.49.3	my heart’s meditation brings understanding.
PSA.49.4	I turn my ear to a proverb;
PSA.49.4	I explain my riddle with a lyre.
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear in times of trouble?
PSA.49.5	The iniquity of my foes surrounds me.
PSA.49.6	They trust in their wealth
PSA.49.6	and boast of their abundant riches.
PSA.49.7	Yet these cannot redeem a person
PSA.49.7	or pay his ransom to God
PSA.49.8	since the price of redeeming him is too costly,
PSA.49.8	one should forever stop trying
PSA.49.9	so that he may live forever
PSA.49.9	and not see the Pit.
PSA.49.10	For one can see that the wise die;
PSA.49.10	the foolish and stupid also pass away.
PSA.49.10	Then they leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their graves are their permanent homes,
PSA.49.11	their dwellings from generation to generation,
PSA.49.11	though they have named estates after themselves.
PSA.49.12	But despite his assets,
PSA.49.12	he is like the animals that perish.
PSA.49.13	This is the way of those who are arrogant,
PSA.49.13	and of their followers,
PSA.49.13	who approve of their words.
PSA.49.14	Like sheep they are headed for Sheol;
PSA.49.14	Death will shepherd them.
PSA.49.14	The upright will rule over them in the morning,
PSA.49.14	and their form will waste away in Sheol,
PSA.49.14	far from their lofty abode.
PSA.49.15	But God will redeem me
PSA.49.15	from the power of Sheol,
PSA.49.15	for he will take me.
PSA.49.16	Do not be afraid when a person gets rich,
PSA.49.16	when the wealth
PSA.49.17	For when he dies, he will take nothing at all;
PSA.49.17	his wealth will not follow him down.
PSA.49.18	Though he blesses himself during his lifetime —
PSA.49.18	and you are acclaimed when you do well for yourself
PSA.49.19	he will go to the generation of his fathers;
PSA.49.19	they will never see the light.
PSA.49.20	Mankind, with his assets
PSA.49.20	but without understanding,
PSA.49.20	is like the animals that perish.
PSA.50.1	The Mighty One, God,
PSA.50.1	he summons the earth
PSA.50.1	from the rising of the sun to its setting.
PSA.50.2	From Zion, the perfection of beauty,
PSA.50.2	God appears in radiance.
PSA.50.3	Our God is coming; he will not be silent!
PSA.50.3	Devouring fire precedes him,
PSA.50.3	and a storm rages around him.
PSA.50.4	On high, he summons heaven and earth
PSA.50.4	in order to judge his people:
PSA.50.5	“Gather my faithful ones to me,
PSA.50.5	those who made a covenant with me by sacrifice.”
PSA.50.6	The heavens proclaim his righteousness,
PSA.50.6	for God is the Judge.
PSA.50.7	“Listen, my people, and I will speak;
PSA.50.7	I will testify against you, Israel.
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God.
PSA.50.8	I do not rebuke you for your sacrifices
PSA.50.8	or for your burnt offerings,
PSA.50.8	which are continually before me.
PSA.50.9	I will not take a bull from your household
PSA.50.9	or male goats from your pens,
PSA.50.10	for every animal of the forest is mine,
PSA.50.10	the cattle on a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know every bird of the mountains,
PSA.50.11	and the creatures of the field are mine.
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
PSA.50.12	for the world and everything in it is mine.
PSA.50.13	Do I eat the flesh of bulls
PSA.50.13	or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Sacrifice a thank offering to God,
PSA.50.14	and pay your vows to the Most High.
PSA.50.15	Call on me in a day of trouble;
PSA.50.15	I will rescue you, and you will honor me.”
PSA.50.16	But God says to the wicked:
PSA.50.16	“What right do you have to recite my statutes
PSA.50.16	and to take my covenant on your lips?
PSA.50.17	You hate instruction
PSA.50.17	and fling my words behind you.
PSA.50.18	When you see a thief,
PSA.50.18	you make friends with him,
PSA.50.18	and you associate with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	You unleash your mouth for evil
PSA.50.19	and harness your tongue for deceit.
PSA.50.20	You sit, maligning your brother,
PSA.50.20	slandering your mother’s son.
PSA.50.21	You have done these things, and I kept silent;
PSA.50.21	you thought I was just like you.
PSA.50.21	But I will rebuke you
PSA.50.21	and lay out the case before you.
PSA.50.22	“Understand this, you who forget God,
PSA.50.22	or I will tear you apart,
PSA.50.22	and there will be no one to rescue you.
PSA.50.23	Whoever sacrifices a thank offering honors me,
PSA.50.23	and whoever orders his conduct,
PSA.50.23	I will show him the salvation of God.”
PSA.51.1	Be gracious to me, God,
PSA.51.1	according to your faithful love;
PSA.51.1	according to your abundant compassion,
PSA.51.1	blot out my rebellion.
PSA.51.2	Completely wash away my guilt
PSA.51.2	and cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I am conscious of my rebellion,
PSA.51.3	and my sin is always before me.
PSA.51.4	Against you — you alone — I have sinned
PSA.51.4	and done this evil in your sight.
PSA.51.4	So you are right when you pass sentence;
PSA.51.4	you are blameless when you judge.
PSA.51.5	Indeed, I was guilty when I was born;
PSA.51.5	I was sinful when my mother conceived me.
PSA.51.6	Surely you desire integrity in the inner self,
PSA.51.6	and you teach me wisdom deep within.
PSA.51.7	Purify me with hyssop, and I will be clean;
PSA.51.7	wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Let me hear joy and gladness;
PSA.51.8	let the bones you have crushed rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Turn your face away
PSA.51.9	and blot out all my guilt.
PSA.51.10	God, create a clean heart for me
PSA.51.10	and renew a steadfast
PSA.51.11	Do not banish me from your presence
PSA.51.11	or take your Holy Spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore the joy of your salvation to me,
PSA.51.12	and sustain me by giving me a willing spirit.
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach the rebellious your ways,
PSA.51.13	and sinners will return to you.
PSA.51.14	Save me from the guilt of bloodshed, God
PSA.51.14	God of my salvation —
PSA.51.14	and my tongue will sing of your righteousness.
PSA.51.15	Lord, open my lips,
PSA.51.15	and my mouth will declare your praise.
PSA.51.16	You do not want a sacrifice, or I would give it;
PSA.51.16	you are not pleased with a burnt offering.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifice pleasing to God is
PSA.51.17	You will not despise a broken and humbled heart, God.
PSA.51.18	In your good pleasure, cause Zion to prosper;
PSA.51.18	build the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then you will delight in righteous sacrifices,
PSA.51.19	whole burnt offerings;
PSA.51.19	then bulls will be offered on your altar.
PSA.52.1	Why boast about evil, you hero!
PSA.52.1	God’s faithful love is constant.
PSA.52.2	Like a sharpened razor,
PSA.52.2	your tongue devises destruction,
PSA.52.2	working treachery.
PSA.52.3	You love evil instead of good,
PSA.52.3	lying instead of speaking truthfully.
PSA.52.4	You love any words that destroy,
PSA.52.4	you treacherous tongue!
PSA.52.5	This is why God will bring you down forever.
PSA.52.5	He will take you, ripping you out of your tent;
PSA.52.5	he will uproot you from the land of the living.
PSA.52.6	The righteous will see and fear,
PSA.52.6	and they will derisively say about that hero,
PSA.52.7	“Here is the man
PSA.52.7	who would not make God his refuge,
PSA.52.7	but trusted in the abundance of his riches,
PSA.52.7	taking refuge in his destructive behavior.”
PSA.52.8	But I am like a flourishing olive tree
PSA.52.8	in the house of God;
PSA.52.8	I trust in God’s faithful love forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	I will praise you forever for what you have done.
PSA.52.9	In the presence of your faithful people,
PSA.52.9	I will put my hope in your name, for it is good.
PSA.53.1	The fool says in his heart, “There’s no God.”
PSA.53.1	They are corrupt, and they do vile deeds.
PSA.53.1	There is no one who does good.
PSA.53.2	God looks down from heaven on the human race
PSA.53.2	to see if there is one who is wise,
PSA.53.2	one who seeks God.
PSA.53.3	All have turned away;
PSA.53.3	all alike have become corrupt.
PSA.53.3	There is no one who does good,
PSA.53.3	not even one.
PSA.53.4	Will evildoers never understand?
PSA.53.4	They consume my people as they consume bread;
PSA.53.4	they do not call on God.
PSA.53.5	Then they will be filled with dread —
PSA.53.5	dread like no other
PSA.53.5	because God will scatter
PSA.53.5	the bones of those who besiege you.
PSA.53.5	You will put them to shame,
PSA.53.5	for God has rejected them.
PSA.53.6	Oh, that Israel’s deliverance would come from Zion!
PSA.53.6	When God restores the fortunes of his people,
PSA.53.6	let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
PSA.54.1	God, save me by your name,
PSA.54.1	and vindicate me by your might!
PSA.54.2	God, hear my prayer;
PSA.54.2	listen to the words from my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For strangers rise up against me,
PSA.54.3	and violent men intend to kill me.
PSA.54.3	They do not let God guide them.
PSA.54.4	God is my helper;
PSA.54.4	the Lord is the sustainer of my life.
PSA.54.5	He will repay my adversaries for their evil.
PSA.54.5	Because of your faithfulness, annihilate them.
PSA.54.6	I will sacrifice a freewill offering to you.
PSA.54.6	I will praise your name, 
PSA.54.6	because it is good.
PSA.54.7	For he has rescued me from every trouble,
PSA.54.7	and my eye has looked down on my enemies.
PSA.55.1	God, listen to my prayer
PSA.55.1	and do not hide from my plea for help.
PSA.55.2	Pay attention to me and answer me.
PSA.55.2	I am restless and in turmoil with my complaint,
PSA.55.3	because of the enemy’s words,
PSA.55.3	because of the pressure
PSA.55.3	For they bring down disaster on me
PSA.55.3	and harass me in anger.
PSA.55.4	My heart shudders within me;
PSA.55.4	terrors of death sweep over me.
PSA.55.5	Fear and trembling grip me;
PSA.55.5	horror has overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	I said, “If only I had wings like a dove!
PSA.55.6	I would fly away and find rest.
PSA.55.7	How far away I would flee;
PSA.55.7	I would stay in the wilderness.
PSA.55.8	I would hurry to my shelter
PSA.55.8	from the raging wind and the storm.”
PSA.55.9	Lord, confuse
PSA.55.9	for I see violence and strife in the city;
PSA.55.10	day and night they make the rounds on its walls.
PSA.55.10	Crime and trouble are within it;
PSA.55.11	destruction is inside it;
PSA.55.11	oppression and deceit never leave its marketplace.
PSA.55.12	Now it is not an enemy who insults me —
PSA.55.12	otherwise I could bear it;
PSA.55.12	it is not a foe who rises up against me —
PSA.55.12	otherwise I could hide from him.
PSA.55.13	But it is you, a man who is my peer,
PSA.55.13	my companion and good friend!
PSA.55.14	We used to have close fellowship;
PSA.55.14	we walked with the crowd into the house of God.
PSA.55.15	Let death take them by surprise;
PSA.55.15	let them go down to Sheol alive,
PSA.55.15	because evil is in their homes and within them.
PSA.55.16	But I call to God,
PSA.55.16	and the 
PSA.55.17	I complain and groan morning, noon, and night,
PSA.55.17	and he hears my voice.
PSA.55.18	Though many are against me,
PSA.55.18	he will redeem me from my battle unharmed.
PSA.55.19	God, the one enthroned from long ago,
PSA.55.19	will hear and will humiliate them
PSA.55.19	because they do not change
PSA.55.19	and do not fear God.
PSA.55.20	My friend
PSA.55.20	against those at peace with him;
PSA.55.20	he violates his covenant.
PSA.55.21	His buttery words are smooth,
PSA.55.21	but war is in his heart.
PSA.55.21	His words are softer than oil,
PSA.55.21	but they are drawn swords.
PSA.55.22	Cast your burden on the 
PSA.55.22	and he will sustain you;
PSA.55.22	he will never allow the righteous to be shaken.
PSA.55.23	God, you will bring them down
PSA.55.23	to the Pit of destruction;
PSA.55.23	men of bloodshed and treachery
PSA.55.23	will not live out half their days.
PSA.55.23	But I will trust in you.
PSA.56.1	Be gracious to me, God, for a man is trampling me;
PSA.56.1	he fights and oppresses me all day long.
PSA.56.2	My adversaries trample me all day,
PSA.56.2	for many arrogantly fight against me.
PSA.56.3	When I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I will trust in you.
PSA.56.4	In God, whose word I praise,
PSA.56.4	in God I trust; I will not be afraid.
PSA.56.4	What can mere mortals do to me?
PSA.56.5	They twist my words all day long;
PSA.56.5	all their thoughts against me are evil.
PSA.56.6	They stir up strife,
PSA.56.6	they watch my steps
PSA.56.6	while they wait to take my life.
PSA.56.7	Will they escape in spite of such sin?
PSA.56.7	God, bring down the nations in wrath.
PSA.56.8	You yourself have recorded my wanderings.
PSA.56.8	Put my tears in your bottle.
PSA.56.8	Are they not in your book?
PSA.56.9	Then my enemies will retreat on the day when I call.
PSA.56.9	This I know: God is for me.
PSA.56.10	In God, whose word I praise,
PSA.56.10	in the 
PSA.56.11	in God I trust; I will not be afraid.
PSA.56.11	What can mere humans do to me?
PSA.56.12	I am obligated by vows
PSA.56.12	I will make my thank offerings to you.
PSA.56.13	For you rescued me from death,
PSA.56.13	even my feet from stumbling,
PSA.56.13	to walk before God in the light of life.
PSA.57.1	Be gracious to me, God, be gracious to me,
PSA.57.1	for I take refuge in you.
PSA.57.1	I will seek refuge in the shadow of your wings
PSA.57.1	until danger passes.
PSA.57.2	I call to God Most High,
PSA.57.2	to God who fulfills his purpose for me.
PSA.57.3	He reaches down from heaven and saves me,
PSA.57.3	challenging the one who tramples me.
PSA.57.3	God sends his faithful love and truth.
PSA.57.4	I am surrounded by lions;
PSA.57.4	I lie down among devouring lions —
PSA.57.4	people whose teeth are spears and arrows,
PSA.57.4	whose tongues are sharp swords.
PSA.57.5	God, be exalted above the heavens;
PSA.57.5	let your glory be over the whole earth.
PSA.57.6	They prepared a net for my steps;
PSA.57.6	I was despondent.
PSA.57.6	They dug a pit ahead of me,
PSA.57.6	but they fell into it!
PSA.57.7	My heart is confident, God, my heart is confident.
PSA.57.7	I will sing; I will sing praises.
PSA.57.8	Wake up, my soul!
PSA.57.8	Wake up, harp and lyre!
PSA.57.8	I will wake up the dawn.
PSA.57.9	I will praise you, Lord, among the peoples;
PSA.57.9	I will sing praises to you among the nations.
PSA.57.10	For your faithful love is as high as the heavens;
PSA.57.10	your faithfulness reaches the clouds.
PSA.57.11	God, be exalted above the heavens;
PSA.57.11	let your glory be over the whole earth.
PSA.58.1	Do you really speak righteously, you mighty ones?
PSA.58.1	Do you judge people fairly?
PSA.58.2	No, you practice injustice in your hearts;
PSA.58.2	with your hands you weigh out violence in the land.
PSA.58.3	The wicked go astray from the womb;
PSA.58.3	liars wander about from birth.
PSA.58.4	They have venom like the venom of a snake,
PSA.58.4	like the deaf cobra that stops up its ears,
PSA.58.5	that does not listen to the sound of the charmers
PSA.58.5	who skillfully weave spells.
PSA.58.6	God, knock the teeth out of their mouths;
PSA.58.7	May they vanish like water that flows by;
PSA.58.7	may they aim their blunted arrows.
PSA.58.8	Like a slug that moves along in slime,
PSA.58.8	like a woman’s miscarried child,
PSA.58.8	may they not see the sun.
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns —
PSA.58.9	whether green or burning —
PSA.58.9	he will sweep them away.
PSA.58.10	The righteous one will rejoice
PSA.58.10	when he sees the retribution;
PSA.58.10	he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	Then people will say,
PSA.58.11	“Yes, there is a reward for the righteous!
PSA.58.11	There is a God who judges on earth!” 
PSA.59.1	Rescue me from my enemies, my God;
PSA.59.1	protect me from those who rise up against me.
PSA.59.2	Rescue me from those who practice sin,
PSA.59.2	and save me from men of bloodshed.
PSA.59.3	Because look, 
PSA.59.3	Powerful men attack me,
PSA.59.3	but not because of any sin or rebellion of mine.
PSA.59.4	For no fault of mine,
PSA.59.4	they run and take up a position.
PSA.59.4	Awake to help me, and take notice.
PSA.59.5	Rise up to punish all the nations;
PSA.59.5	do not show favor to any wicked traitors.
PSA.59.6	They return at evening, snarling like dogs
PSA.59.6	and prowling around the city.
PSA.59.7	Look, they spew from their mouths —
PSA.59.7	sharp words from
PSA.59.7	“For who,” they say, “will hear?” 
PSA.59.8	But you laugh at them, 
PSA.59.8	you ridicule all the nations.
PSA.59.9	I will keep watch for you, my
PSA.59.9	because God is my stronghold.
PSA.59.10	My faithful God
PSA.59.10	God will let me look down on my adversaries.
PSA.59.11	Do not kill them; otherwise, my people will forget.
PSA.59.11	By your power, make them homeless wanderers
PSA.59.11	and bring them down,
PSA.59.11	Lord, our shield.
PSA.59.12	For the sin of their mouths and the words of their lips,
PSA.59.12	let them be caught in their pride.
PSA.59.12	They utter curses and lies.
PSA.59.13	Consume them in rage;
PSA.59.13	consume them until they are gone.
PSA.59.13	Then people will know throughout
PSA.59.13	that God rules over Jacob.
PSA.59.14	And they return at evening, snarling like dogs
PSA.59.14	and prowling around the city.
PSA.59.15	They scavenge for food;
PSA.59.15	they growl if they are not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of your strength
PSA.59.16	and will joyfully proclaim
PSA.59.16	your faithful love in the morning.
PSA.59.16	For you have been a stronghold for me,
PSA.59.16	a refuge in my day of trouble.
PSA.59.17	To you, my strength, I sing praises,
PSA.59.17	because God is my stronghold —
PSA.59.17	my faithful God.
PSA.60.1	God, you have rejected us;
PSA.60.1	you have broken us down;
PSA.60.1	you have been angry. Restore us!
PSA.60.2	You have shaken the land and split it open.
PSA.60.2	Heal its fissures, for it shudders.
PSA.60.3	You have made your people suffer hardship;
PSA.60.3	you have given us wine to drink
PSA.60.3	that made us stagger.
PSA.60.4	You have given a signal flag to those who fear you,
PSA.60.4	so that they can flee before the archers.
PSA.60.5	Save with your right hand, and answer me,
PSA.60.5	so that those you love may be rescued.
PSA.60.6	God has spoken in his sanctuary:
PSA.60.6	“I will celebrate!
PSA.60.6	I will divide up Shechem.
PSA.60.6	I will apportion the Valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine,
PSA.60.7	and Ephraim is my helmet;
PSA.60.7	Judah is my scepter.
PSA.60.8	Moab is my washbasin.
PSA.60.8	I throw my sandal on Edom;
PSA.60.8	I shout in triumph over Philistia.”
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me to the fortified city?
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	God, haven’t you rejected us?
PSA.60.10	God, you do not march out with our armies.
PSA.60.11	Give us aid against the foe,
PSA.60.11	for human help is worthless.
PSA.60.12	With God we will perform valiantly;
PSA.60.12	he will trample our foes.
PSA.61.1	God, hear my cry;
PSA.61.1	pay attention to my prayer.
PSA.61.2	I call to you from the ends of the earth
PSA.61.2	when my heart is without strength.
PSA.61.2	Lead me to a rock that is high above me,
PSA.61.3	for you have been a refuge for me,
PSA.61.3	a strong tower
PSA.61.4	I will dwell in your tent forever
PSA.61.4	and take refuge under the shelter of your wings.
PSA.61.5	God, you have heard my vows;
PSA.61.5	you have given a heritage
PSA.61.5	to those who fear your name.
PSA.61.6	Add days to the king’s life;
PSA.61.6	may his years span many generations.
PSA.61.7	May he sit enthroned before God forever.
PSA.61.7	Appoint faithful love and truth to guard him.
PSA.61.8	Then I will continually sing of your name,
PSA.61.8	fulfilling my vows day by day.
PSA.62.1	I am at rest in God alone;
PSA.62.1	my salvation comes from him.
PSA.62.2	He alone is my rock and my salvation,
PSA.62.2	my stronghold; I will never be shaken.
PSA.62.3	How long will you threaten a man?
PSA.62.3	Will all of you attack
PSA.62.3	as if he were a leaning wall
PSA.62.3	or a tottering fence?
PSA.62.4	They only plan to bring him down
PSA.62.4	from his high position.
PSA.62.4	They take pleasure in lying;
PSA.62.4	they bless with their mouths,
PSA.62.4	but they curse inwardly.
PSA.62.5	Rest in God alone, my soul,
PSA.62.5	for my hope comes from him.
PSA.62.6	He alone is my rock and my salvation,
PSA.62.6	my stronghold; I will not be shaken.
PSA.62.7	My salvation and glory depend on God, my strong rock.
PSA.62.7	My refuge is in God.
PSA.62.8	Trust in him at all times, you people;
PSA.62.8	pour out your hearts before him.
PSA.62.8	God is our refuge.
PSA.62.9	Common people are only a vapor;
PSA.62.9	important people, an illusion.
PSA.62.9	Together on a scale,
PSA.62.9	they weigh less than
PSA.62.10	Place no trust in oppression,
PSA.62.10	or false hope in robbery.
PSA.62.10	If wealth increases,
PSA.62.10	don’t set your heart on it.
PSA.62.11	God has spoken once;
PSA.62.11	I have heard this twice:
PSA.62.11	strength belongs to God,
PSA.62.12	and faithful love belongs to you, Lord.
PSA.62.12	For you repay each according to his works.
PSA.63.1	God, you are my God; I eagerly seek you.
PSA.63.1	I thirst for you;
PSA.63.1	my body faints for you
PSA.63.1	in a land that is dry, desolate, and without water.
PSA.63.2	So I gaze on you in the sanctuary
PSA.63.2	to see your strength and your glory.
PSA.63.3	My lips will glorify you
PSA.63.3	because your faithful love is better than life.
PSA.63.4	So I will bless you as long as I live;
PSA.63.4	at your name, I will lift up my hands.
PSA.63.5	You satisfy me as with rich food;
PSA.63.5	my mouth will praise you with joyful lips.
PSA.63.6	When I think of you as I lie on my bed,
PSA.63.6	I meditate on you during the night watches
PSA.63.7	because you are my helper;
PSA.63.7	I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings.
PSA.63.8	I follow close to you;
PSA.63.8	your right hand holds on to me.
PSA.63.9	But those who intend to destroy my life
PSA.63.9	will go into the depths of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They will be given over to the power of the sword;
PSA.63.10	they will become a meal for jackals.
PSA.63.11	But the king will rejoice in God;
PSA.63.11	all who swear by him will boast,
PSA.63.11	for the mouths of liars will be shut.
PSA.64.1	God, hear my voice when I am in anguish.
PSA.64.1	Protect my life from the terror of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the scheming of wicked people,
PSA.64.2	from the mob of evildoers,
PSA.64.3	who sharpen their tongues like swords
PSA.64.3	and aim bitter words like arrows,
PSA.64.4	shooting from concealed places at the blameless.
PSA.64.4	They shoot at him suddenly and are not afraid.
PSA.64.5	They adopt
PSA.64.5	they talk about hiding traps and say,
PSA.64.5	“Who will see them?” 
PSA.64.6	They devise crimes and say,
PSA.64.6	“We have perfected a secret plan.”
PSA.64.6	The inner man and the heart are mysterious.
PSA.64.7	But God will shoot them with arrows;
PSA.64.7	suddenly, they will be wounded.
PSA.64.8	They will be made to stumble;
PSA.64.8	their own tongues work against them.
PSA.64.8	All who see them will shake their heads.
PSA.64.9	Then everyone will fear
PSA.64.9	and will tell about God’s work,
PSA.64.9	for they will understand what he has done.
PSA.64.10	The righteous one rejoices in the 
PSA.64.10	and takes refuge in him;
PSA.64.10	all those who are upright in heart
PSA.64.10	will offer praise.
PSA.65.1	Praise is rightfully yours,
PSA.65.1	God, in Zion;
PSA.65.1	vows to you will be fulfilled.
PSA.65.2	All humanity will come to you,
PSA.65.2	the one who hears prayer.
PSA.65.3	Iniquities overwhelm me;
PSA.65.3	only you can atone for our rebellions.
PSA.65.4	How happy is the one you choose
PSA.65.4	and bring near to live in your courts!
PSA.65.4	We will be satisfied with the goodness of your house,
PSA.65.4	the holiness of your temple.
PSA.65.5	You answer us in righteousness,
PSA.65.5	with awe-inspiring works,
PSA.65.5	God of our salvation,
PSA.65.5	the hope of all the ends of the earth
PSA.65.5	and of the distant seas.
PSA.65.6	You establish the mountains by your power;
PSA.65.6	you are robed with strength.
PSA.65.7	You silence the roar of the seas,
PSA.65.7	the roar of their waves,
PSA.65.7	and the tumult of the nations.
PSA.65.8	Those who live far away are awed by your signs;
PSA.65.8	you make east and west shout for joy.
PSA.65.9	You visit the earth and water it abundantly,
PSA.65.9	enriching it greatly.
PSA.65.9	God’s stream is filled with water,
PSA.65.9	for you prepare the earth in this way,
PSA.65.9	providing people with grain.
PSA.65.10	You soften it with showers and bless its growth,
PSA.65.10	soaking its furrows and leveling its ridges.
PSA.65.11	You crown the year with your goodness;
PSA.65.11	your carts overflow with plenty.
PSA.65.12	The wilderness pastures overflow,
PSA.65.12	and the hills are robed with joy.
PSA.65.13	The pastures are clothed with flocks
PSA.65.13	and the valleys covered with grain.
PSA.65.13	They shout in triumph; indeed, they sing.
PSA.66.1	Let the whole earth shout joyfully to God!
PSA.66.2	Sing about the glory of his name;
PSA.66.2	make his praise glorious.
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “How awe-inspiring are your works!
PSA.66.3	Your enemies will cringe before you
PSA.66.3	because of your great strength.
PSA.66.4	The whole earth will worship you
PSA.66.4	and sing praise to you.
PSA.66.4	They will sing praise to your name.”
PSA.66.5	Come and see the wonders of God;
PSA.66.5	his acts for humanity
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land,
PSA.66.6	and they crossed the river on foot.
PSA.66.6	There we rejoiced in him.
PSA.66.7	He rules forever by his might;
PSA.66.7	he keeps his eye on the nations.
PSA.66.7	The rebellious should not exalt themselves.
PSA.66.8	Bless our God, you peoples;
PSA.66.8	let the sound of his praise be heard.
PSA.66.9	He keeps us alive
PSA.66.9	and does not allow our feet to slip.
PSA.66.10	For you, God, tested us;
PSA.66.10	you refined us as silver is refined.
PSA.66.11	You lured us into a trap;
PSA.66.11	you placed burdens on our backs.
PSA.66.12	You let men ride over our heads;
PSA.66.12	we went through fire and water,
PSA.66.12	but you brought us out to abundance.
PSA.66.13	I will enter your house with burnt offerings;
PSA.66.13	I will pay you my vows
PSA.66.14	that my lips promised
PSA.66.14	and my mouth spoke during my distress.
PSA.66.15	I will offer you fattened sheep as burnt offerings,
PSA.66.15	with the fragrant smoke of rams;
PSA.66.15	I will sacrifice bulls with goats.
PSA.66.16	Come and listen, all who fear God,
PSA.66.16	and I will tell what he has done for me.
PSA.66.17	I cried out to him with my mouth,
PSA.66.17	and praise was on my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I had been aware of malice in my heart,
PSA.66.18	the Lord would not have listened.
PSA.66.19	However, God has listened;
PSA.66.19	he has paid attention to the sound of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God!
PSA.66.20	He has not turned away my prayer
PSA.66.20	or turned his faithful love from me.
PSA.67.1	May God be gracious to us and bless us;
PSA.67.1	may he make his face shine upon us
PSA.67.2	so that your way may be known on earth,
PSA.67.2	your salvation among all nations.
PSA.67.3	Let the peoples praise you, God;
PSA.67.3	let all the peoples praise you.
PSA.67.4	Let the nations rejoice and shout for joy,
PSA.67.4	for you judge the peoples with fairness
PSA.67.4	and lead the nations on earth.
PSA.67.5	Let the peoples praise you, God,
PSA.67.5	let all the peoples praise you.
PSA.67.6	The earth has produced its harvest;
PSA.67.6	God, our God, blesses us.
PSA.67.7	God will bless us,
PSA.67.7	and all the ends of the earth will fear him.
PSA.68.1	God arises. His enemies scatter,
PSA.68.1	and those who hate him flee from his presence.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is blown away,
PSA.68.2	so you blow them away.
PSA.68.2	As wax melts before the fire,
PSA.68.2	so the wicked are destroyed before God.
PSA.68.3	But the righteous are glad;
PSA.68.3	they rejoice before God and celebrate with joy.
PSA.68.4	Sing to God! Sing praises to his name.
PSA.68.4	Exalt him who rides on the clouds
PSA.68.4	his name is the 
PSA.68.5	God in his holy dwelling is
PSA.68.5	a father of the fatherless
PSA.68.5	and a champion of widows.
PSA.68.6	God provides homes for those who are deserted.
PSA.68.6	He leads out the prisoners to prosperity,
PSA.68.6	but the rebellious live in a scorched land.
PSA.68.7	God, when you went out before your people,
PSA.68.7	when you marched through the desert,
PSA.68.8	the earth trembled and the skies poured rain
PSA.68.8	before God, the God of Sinai,
PSA.68.8	before God, the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	You, God, showered abundant rain;
PSA.68.9	you revived your inheritance when it languished.
PSA.68.10	Your people settled in it;
PSA.68.10	God, you provided for the poor by your goodness.
PSA.68.11	The Lord gave the command;
PSA.68.11	a great company of women brought the good news:
PSA.68.12	“The kings of the armies flee — they flee!”
PSA.68.12	She who stays at home divides the spoil.
PSA.68.13	While
PSA.68.13	the wings of a dove are covered with silver,
PSA.68.13	and its feathers with glistening gold.
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered kings in the land,
PSA.68.14	it snowed on Zalmon.
PSA.68.15	Mount Bashan is God’s towering mountain;
PSA.68.15	Mount Bashan is a mountain of many peaks.
PSA.68.16	Why gaze with envy, you mountain peaks,
PSA.68.16	at the mountain God desired for his abode?
PSA.68.16	The 
PSA.68.17	God’s chariots are tens of thousands,
PSA.68.17	thousands and thousands;
PSA.68.17	the Lord is among them in the sanctuary
PSA.68.17	as he was at Sinai.
PSA.68.18	You ascended to the heights, taking away captives;
PSA.68.18	you received gifts from
PSA.68.18	even from the rebellious,
PSA.68.18	so that the 
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord!
PSA.68.19	Day after day he bears our burdens;
PSA.68.19	God is our salvation.
PSA.68.20	Our God is a God of salvation,
PSA.68.20	and escape from death belongs to the 
PSA.68.21	Surely God crushes the heads of his enemies,
PSA.68.21	the hairy brow of one who goes on in his guilty acts.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, “I will bring them back from Bashan;
PSA.68.22	I will bring them back from the depths of the sea
PSA.68.23	so that your foot may wade
PSA.68.23	and your dogs’ tongues may have their share
PSA.68.23	from the enemies.”
PSA.68.24	People have seen your procession, God,
PSA.68.24	the procession of my God,
PSA.68.24	my King, in the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	Singers lead the way,
PSA.68.25	with musicians following;
PSA.68.25	among them are young women
PSA.68.25	playing tambourines.
PSA.68.26	Bless God in the assemblies;
PSA.68.26	bless the 
PSA.68.27	There is Benjamin, the youngest, leading them,
PSA.68.27	the rulers of Judah in their assembly,
PSA.68.27	the rulers of Zebulun, the rulers of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Your God has decreed your strength.
PSA.68.28	Show your strength, God,
PSA.68.28	you who have acted on our behalf.
PSA.68.29	Because of your temple at Jerusalem,
PSA.68.29	kings will bring tribute to you.
PSA.68.30	Rebuke the beast in the reeds,
PSA.68.30	the herd of bulls with the calves of the peoples.
PSA.68.30	Trample underfoot those with bars of silver.
PSA.68.30	Scatter the peoples who take pleasure in war.
PSA.68.31	Ambassadors will come
PSA.68.31	Cush will stretch out its hands to God.
PSA.68.32	Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth;
PSA.68.32	sing praise to the Lord,
PSA.68.33	to him who rides in the ancient, highest heavens.
PSA.68.33	Look, he thunders with his powerful voice!
PSA.68.34	Ascribe power to God.
PSA.68.34	His majesty is over Israel,
PSA.68.34	his power is among the clouds.
PSA.68.35	God, you are awe-inspiring in your sanctuaries.
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel gives power and strength to his people.
PSA.68.35	Blessed be God!
PSA.69.1	Save me, God,
PSA.69.1	for the water has risen to my neck.
PSA.69.2	I have sunk in deep mud, and there is no footing;
PSA.69.2	I have come into deep water,
PSA.69.2	and a flood sweeps over me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary from my crying;
PSA.69.3	my throat is parched.
PSA.69.3	My eyes fail, looking for my God.
PSA.69.4	Those who hate me without cause
PSA.69.4	are more numerous than the hairs of my head;
PSA.69.4	my deceitful enemies, who would destroy me,
PSA.69.4	are powerful.
PSA.69.4	Though I did not steal, I must repay.
PSA.69.5	God, you know my foolishness,
PSA.69.5	and my guilty acts are not hidden from you.
PSA.69.6	Do not let those who put their hope in you
PSA.69.6	be disgraced because of me,
PSA.69.6	Lord 
PSA.69.6	do not let those who seek you
PSA.69.6	be humiliated because of me,
PSA.69.6	God of Israel.
PSA.69.7	For I have endured insults because of you,
PSA.69.7	and shame has covered my face.
PSA.69.8	I have become a stranger to my brothers
PSA.69.8	and a foreigner to my mother’s sons
PSA.69.9	because zeal for your house has consumed me,
PSA.69.9	and the insults of those who insult you
PSA.69.9	have fallen on me.
PSA.69.10	I mourned and fasted,
PSA.69.10	but it brought me insults.
PSA.69.11	I wore sackcloth as my clothing,
PSA.69.11	and I was a joke to them.
PSA.69.12	Those who sit at the city gate talk about me,
PSA.69.12	and drunkards make up songs about me.
PSA.69.13	But as for me, 
PSA.69.13	my prayer to you is for a time of favor.
PSA.69.13	In your abundant, faithful love, God,
PSA.69.13	answer me with your sure salvation.
PSA.69.14	Rescue me from the miry mud; don’t let me sink.
PSA.69.14	Let me be rescued from those who hate me
PSA.69.14	and from the deep water.
PSA.69.15	Don’t let the floodwaters sweep over me
PSA.69.15	or the deep swallow me up;
PSA.69.15	don’t let the Pit close its mouth over me.
PSA.69.16	Answer me, 
PSA.69.16	for your faithful love is good.
PSA.69.16	In keeping with your abundant compassion,
PSA.69.16	turn to me.
PSA.69.17	Don’t hide your face from your servant,
PSA.69.17	for I am in distress.
PSA.69.17	Answer me quickly!
PSA.69.18	Come near to me and redeem me;
PSA.69.18	ransom me because of my enemies.
PSA.69.19	You know the insults I endure —
PSA.69.19	my shame and disgrace.
PSA.69.19	You are aware of all my adversaries.
PSA.69.20	Insults have broken my heart,
PSA.69.20	and I am in despair.
PSA.69.20	I waited for sympathy,
PSA.69.20	but there was none;
PSA.69.20	for comforters, but found no one.
PSA.69.21	Instead, they gave me gall for my food,
PSA.69.21	and for my thirst
PSA.69.21	they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	Let their table set before them be a snare,
PSA.69.22	and let it be a trap for their allies.
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes grow too dim to see,
PSA.69.23	and let their hips continually quake.
PSA.69.24	Pour out your rage on them,
PSA.69.24	and let your burning anger overtake them.
PSA.69.25	Make their fortification desolate;
PSA.69.25	may no one live in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they persecute the one you struck
PSA.69.26	and talk about the pain of those you wounded.
PSA.69.27	Charge them with crime on top of crime;
PSA.69.27	do not let them share in your righteousness.
PSA.69.28	Let them be erased from the book of life
PSA.69.28	and not be recorded with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But as for me — poor and in pain —
PSA.69.29	let your salvation protect me, God.
PSA.69.30	I will praise God’s name with song
PSA.69.30	and exalt him with thanksgiving.
PSA.69.31	That will please the 
PSA.69.31	more than a bull with horns and hooves.
PSA.69.32	The humble will see it and rejoice.
PSA.69.32	You who seek God, take heart!
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.33	and does not despise
PSA.69.33	his own who are prisoners.
PSA.69.34	Let heaven and earth praise him,
PSA.69.34	the seas and everything that moves in them,
PSA.69.35	for God will save Zion
PSA.69.35	and build up
PSA.69.35	They will live there and possess it.
PSA.69.36	The descendants of his servants will inherit it,
PSA.69.36	and those who love his name will live in it.
PSA.70.1	God, hurry to rescue me.
PSA.70.2	Let those who seek to kill me
PSA.70.2	be disgraced and confounded;
PSA.70.2	let those who wish me harm
PSA.70.2	be turned back and humiliated.
PSA.70.3	Let those who say, “Aha, aha!”
PSA.70.3	retreat because of their shame.
PSA.70.4	Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;
PSA.70.4	let those who love your salvation
PSA.70.4	continually say, “God is great!” 
PSA.70.5	I am oppressed and needy;
PSA.70.5	hurry to me, God.
PSA.70.5	You are my help and my deliverer;
PSA.71.1	let me never be disgraced.
PSA.71.2	In your justice, rescue and deliver me;
PSA.71.2	listen closely to me and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be a rock of refuge for me,
PSA.71.3	where I can always go.
PSA.71.3	Give the command to save me,
PSA.71.3	for you are my rock and fortress.
PSA.71.4	Deliver me, my God, from the power of the wicked,
PSA.71.4	from the grasp of the unjust and oppressive.
PSA.71.5	For you are my hope, Lord 
PSA.71.5	my confidence from my youth.
PSA.71.6	I have leaned on you from birth;
PSA.71.6	you took me from my mother’s womb.
PSA.71.6	My praise is always about you.
PSA.71.7	I am like a miraculous sign to many,
PSA.71.7	and you are my strong refuge.
PSA.71.8	My mouth is full of praise
PSA.71.8	and honor to you all day long.
PSA.71.9	Don’t discard me in my old age.
PSA.71.9	As my strength fails, do not abandon me.
PSA.71.10	For my enemies talk about me,
PSA.71.10	and those who spy on me plot together,
PSA.71.11	saying, “God has abandoned him;
PSA.71.11	chase him and catch him,
PSA.71.11	for there is no one to rescue him.”
PSA.71.12	God, do not be far from me;
PSA.71.12	my God, hurry to help me.
PSA.71.13	May my adversaries be disgraced and destroyed;
PSA.71.13	may those who intend to harm me
PSA.71.13	be covered with disgrace and humiliation.
PSA.71.14	But I will hope continually
PSA.71.14	and will praise you more and more.
PSA.71.15	My mouth will tell about your righteousness
PSA.71.15	and your salvation all day long,
PSA.71.15	though I cannot sum them up.
PSA.71.16	I come because of the mighty acts of the Lord 
PSA.71.16	I will proclaim your righteousness, yours alone.
PSA.71.17	God, you have taught me from my youth,
PSA.71.17	and I still proclaim your wondrous works.
PSA.71.18	Even while I am old and gray,
PSA.71.18	God, do not abandon me,
PSA.71.18	while I proclaim your power
PSA.71.18	to another generation,
PSA.71.18	your strength to all who are to come.
PSA.71.19	Your righteousness reaches the heights, God,
PSA.71.19	you who have done great things;
PSA.71.19	God, who is like you?
PSA.71.20	You caused me to experience
PSA.71.20	many troubles and misfortunes,
PSA.71.20	but you will revive me again.
PSA.71.20	You will bring me up again,
PSA.71.20	even from the depths of the earth.
PSA.71.21	You will increase my honor
PSA.71.21	and comfort me once again.
PSA.71.22	Therefore, I will praise you with a harp
PSA.71.22	for your faithfulness, my God;
PSA.71.22	I will sing to you with a lyre,
PSA.71.22	Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips will shout for joy
PSA.71.23	when I sing praise to you
PSA.71.23	because you have redeemed me.
PSA.71.24	Therefore, my tongue will proclaim
PSA.71.24	your righteousness all day long,
PSA.71.24	for those who intend to harm me
PSA.71.24	will be disgraced and confounded.
PSA.72.1	God, give your justice to the king
PSA.72.1	and your righteousness to the king’s son.
PSA.72.2	He will judge your people with righteousness
PSA.72.2	and your afflicted ones with justice.
PSA.72.3	May the mountains bring well-being
PSA.72.3	and the hills, righteousness.
PSA.72.4	May he vindicate the afflicted among the people,
PSA.72.4	help the poor,
PSA.72.4	and crush the oppressor.
PSA.72.5	May they fear you
PSA.72.5	and as long as the moon, throughout all generations.
PSA.72.6	May the king be like rain that falls on the cut grass,
PSA.72.6	like spring showers that water the earth.
PSA.72.7	May the righteous
PSA.72.7	and well-being abound
PSA.72.7	until the moon is no more.
PSA.72.8	May he rule from sea to sea
PSA.72.8	and from the Euphrates
PSA.72.8	to the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	May desert tribes kneel before him
PSA.72.9	and his enemies lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	May the kings of Tarshish
PSA.72.10	and the coasts and islands bring tribute,
PSA.72.10	the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts.
PSA.72.11	Let all kings bow in homage to him,
PSA.72.11	all nations serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he will rescue the poor who cry out
PSA.72.12	and the afflicted who have no helper.
PSA.72.13	He will have pity on the poor and helpless
PSA.72.13	and save the lives of the poor.
PSA.72.14	He will redeem them from oppression and violence,
PSA.72.14	for their lives are
PSA.72.15	May he live long!
PSA.72.15	May gold from Sheba be given to him.
PSA.72.15	May prayer be offered for him continually,
PSA.72.15	and may he be blessed all day long.
PSA.72.16	May there be plenty of grain in the land;
PSA.72.16	may it wave on the tops of the mountains.
PSA.72.16	May its crops be like Lebanon.
PSA.72.16	May people flourish in the cities
PSA.72.16	like the grass of the field.
PSA.72.17	May his name endure forever;
PSA.72.17	as long as the sun shines,
PSA.72.17	may his fame increase.
PSA.72.17	May all nations be blessed by him
PSA.72.17	and call him blessed.
PSA.72.18	Blessed be the 
PSA.72.18	who alone does wonders.
PSA.72.19	Blessed be his glorious name forever;
PSA.72.19	the whole earth is filled with his glory.
PSA.72.19	Amen and amen.
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David son of Jesse are concluded.
PSA.73.1	God is indeed good to Israel,
PSA.73.1	to the pure in heart.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet almost slipped;
PSA.73.2	my steps nearly went astray.
PSA.73.3	For I envied the arrogant;
PSA.73.3	I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
PSA.73.4	They have an easy time until they die,
PSA.73.4	and their bodies are well fed.
PSA.73.5	They are not in trouble like others;
PSA.73.5	they are not afflicted like most people.
PSA.73.6	Therefore, pride is their necklace,
PSA.73.6	and violence covers them like a garment.
PSA.73.7	Their eyes bulge out from fatness;
PSA.73.7	the imaginations of their hearts run wild.
PSA.73.8	They mock, and they speak maliciously;
PSA.73.8	they arrogantly threaten oppression.
PSA.73.9	They set their mouths against heaven,
PSA.73.9	and their tongues strut across the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people turn to them
PSA.73.10	and drink in their overflowing words.
PSA.73.11	The wicked say, “How can God know?
PSA.73.11	Does the Most High know everything?” 
PSA.73.12	Look at them — the wicked!
PSA.73.12	They are always at ease,
PSA.73.12	and they increase their wealth.
PSA.73.13	Did I purify my heart
PSA.73.13	and wash my hands in innocence for nothing?
PSA.73.14	For I am afflicted all day long
PSA.73.14	and punished every morning.
PSA.73.15	If I had decided to say these things aloud,
PSA.73.15	I would have betrayed your people.
PSA.73.16	When I tried to understand all this,
PSA.73.16	it seemed hopeless
PSA.73.17	until I entered God’s sanctuary.
PSA.73.17	Then I understood their destiny.
PSA.73.18	Indeed, you put them in slippery places;
PSA.73.18	you make them fall into ruin.
PSA.73.19	How suddenly they become a desolation!
PSA.73.19	They come to an end, swept away by terrors.
PSA.73.20	Like one waking from a dream,
PSA.73.20	Lord, when arising, you will despise their image.
PSA.73.21	When I became embittered
PSA.73.21	and my innermost being
PSA.73.22	I was stupid and didn’t understand;
PSA.73.22	I was an unthinking animal toward you.
PSA.73.23	Yet I am always with you;
PSA.73.23	you hold my right hand.
PSA.73.24	You guide me with your counsel,
PSA.73.24	and afterward you will take me up in glory.
PSA.73.25	Who do I have in heaven but you?
PSA.73.25	And I desire nothing on earth but you.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart may fail,
PSA.73.26	but God is the strength
PSA.73.26	my portion forever.
PSA.73.27	Those far from you will certainly perish;
PSA.73.27	you destroy all who are unfaithful to you.
PSA.73.28	But as for me, God’s presence is my good.
PSA.73.28	I have made the Lord 
PSA.73.28	so I can tell about all you do.
PSA.74.1	Why have you rejected us forever, God?
PSA.74.1	Why does your anger burn
PSA.74.1	against the sheep of your pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember your congregation,
PSA.74.2	which you purchased long ago
PSA.74.2	and redeemed as the tribe for your own possession.
PSA.74.2	Remember Mount Zion where you dwell.
PSA.74.3	Make your way
PSA.74.3	to all that the enemy has destroyed in the sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	Your adversaries roared in the meeting place
PSA.74.4	where you met with us.
PSA.74.4	They set up their emblems as signs.
PSA.74.5	It was like men in a thicket of trees,
PSA.74.5	wielding axes,
PSA.74.6	then smashing all the carvings
PSA.74.6	with hatchets and picks.
PSA.74.7	They set your sanctuary on fire;
PSA.74.7	they utterly
PSA.74.7	the dwelling place of your name.
PSA.74.8	They said in their hearts,
PSA.74.8	“Let us oppress them relentlessly.”
PSA.74.8	They burned every place throughout the land
PSA.74.8	where God met with us.
PSA.74.9	There are no signs for us to see.
PSA.74.9	There is no longer a prophet.
PSA.74.9	And none of us knows how long this will last.
PSA.74.10	God, how long will the enemy mock?
PSA.74.10	Will the foe insult your name forever?
PSA.74.11	Why do you hold back your hand?
PSA.74.11	Stretch out
PSA.74.12	God my King is from ancient times,
PSA.74.12	performing saving acts on the earth.
PSA.74.13	You divided the sea with your strength;
PSA.74.13	you smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the water;
PSA.74.14	you crushed the heads of Leviathan;
PSA.74.14	you fed him to the creatures of the desert.
PSA.74.15	You opened up springs and streams;
PSA.74.15	you dried up ever-flowing rivers.
PSA.74.16	The day is yours, also the night;
PSA.74.16	you established the moon and the sun.
PSA.74.17	You set all the boundaries of the earth;
PSA.74.17	you made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this: the enemy has mocked the 
PSA.74.18	and a foolish people has insulted your name.
PSA.74.19	Do not give to beasts the life of your dove;
PSA.74.19	do not forget the lives of your poor people forever.
PSA.74.20	Consider the covenant,
PSA.74.20	for the dark places of the land are full of violence.
PSA.74.21	Do not let the oppressed turn away in shame;
PSA.74.21	let the poor and needy praise your name.
PSA.74.22	Rise up, God, champion your cause!
PSA.74.22	Remember the insults
PSA.74.22	that fools bring against you all day long.
PSA.74.23	Do not forget the clamor of your adversaries,
PSA.74.23	the tumult of your opponents that goes up constantly.
PSA.75.1	We give thanks to you, God;
PSA.75.1	we give thanks to you, for your name is near.
PSA.75.1	People tell about your wondrous works.
PSA.75.2	“When I choose a time,
PSA.75.2	I will judge fairly.
PSA.75.3	When the earth and all its inhabitants shake,
PSA.75.3	I am the one who steadies its pillars.
PSA.75.4	I say to the boastful, ‘Do not boast,’
PSA.75.4	and to the wicked, ‘Do not lift up your horn.
PSA.75.5	Do not lift up your horn against heaven
PSA.75.5	or speak arrogantly.’”
PSA.75.6	Exaltation does not come
PSA.75.6	from the east, the west, or the desert,
PSA.75.7	for God is the Judge:
PSA.75.7	He brings down one and exalts another.
PSA.75.8	For there is a cup in the 
PSA.75.8	full of wine blended with spices, and he pours from it.
PSA.75.8	All the wicked of the earth will drink,
PSA.75.8	draining it to the dregs.
PSA.75.9	As for me, I will tell about him forever;
PSA.75.9	I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	“I will cut off all the horns of the wicked,
PSA.75.10	but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.”
PSA.76.1	God is known in Judah;
PSA.76.1	his name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	His tent is in Salem,
PSA.76.2	his dwelling place in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There he shatters the bow’s flaming arrows,
PSA.76.3	the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war.
PSA.76.4	You are resplendent and majestic
PSA.76.4	coming down from the mountains of prey.
PSA.76.5	The brave-hearted have been plundered;
PSA.76.5	they have slipped into their final sleep.
PSA.76.5	None of the warriors was able to lift a hand.
PSA.76.6	At your rebuke, God of Jacob,
PSA.76.6	both chariot and horse lay still.
PSA.76.7	And you — you are to be feared.
PSA.76.7	When you are angry,
PSA.76.7	who can stand before you?
PSA.76.8	From heaven you pronounced judgment.
PSA.76.8	The earth feared and grew quiet
PSA.76.9	when God rose up to judge
PSA.76.9	and to save all the lowly of the earth.
PSA.76.10	Even human wrath will praise you;
PSA.76.10	you will clothe yourself
PSA.76.10	with the wrath that remains.
PSA.76.11	Make and keep your vows
PSA.76.11	to the 
PSA.76.11	let all who are around him bring tribute
PSA.76.11	to the awe-inspiring one.
PSA.76.12	He humbles the spirit of leaders;
PSA.76.12	he is feared by the kings of the earth.
PSA.77.1	I cry aloud to God,
PSA.77.1	aloud to God, and he will hear me.
PSA.77.2	I sought the Lord in my day of trouble.
PSA.77.2	My hands were continually lifted up
PSA.77.2	all night long;
PSA.77.2	I refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I think of God; I groan;
PSA.77.3	I meditate; my spirit becomes weak.
PSA.77.4	You have kept me from closing my eyes;
PSA.77.4	I am troubled and cannot speak.
PSA.77.5	I consider days of old,
PSA.77.5	years long past.
PSA.77.6	At night I remember my music;
PSA.77.6	I meditate in my heart, and my spirit ponders.
PSA.77.7	“Will the Lord reject forever
PSA.77.7	and never again show favor?
PSA.77.8	Has his faithful love ceased forever?
PSA.77.8	Is his promise at an end for all generations?
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to be gracious?
PSA.77.9	Has he in anger withheld his compassion?” 
PSA.77.10	So I say, “I am grieved
PSA.77.10	that the right hand of the Most High has changed.”
PSA.77.11	I will remember the 
PSA.77.11	yes, I will remember your ancient wonders.
PSA.77.12	I will reflect on all you have done
PSA.77.12	and meditate on your actions.
PSA.77.13	God, your way is holy.
PSA.77.13	What god is great like God?
PSA.77.14	You are the God who works wonders;
PSA.77.14	you revealed your strength among the peoples.
PSA.77.15	With power you redeemed your people,
PSA.77.15	the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
PSA.77.16	The water saw you, God.
PSA.77.16	The water saw you; it trembled.
PSA.77.16	Even the depths shook.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured down water.
PSA.77.17	The storm clouds thundered;
PSA.77.17	your arrows flashed back and forth.
PSA.77.18	The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind;
PSA.77.18	lightning lit up the world.
PSA.77.18	The earth shook and quaked.
PSA.77.19	Your way went through the sea
PSA.77.19	and your path through the vast water,
PSA.77.19	but your footprints were unseen.
PSA.77.20	You led your people like a flock
PSA.77.20	by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	My people, hear my instruction;
PSA.78.1	listen to the words from my mouth.
PSA.78.2	I will declare wise sayings;
PSA.78.2	I will speak mysteries from the past
PSA.78.3	things we have heard and known
PSA.78.3	and that our fathers have passed down to us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their children,
PSA.78.4	but will tell a future generation
PSA.78.4	the praiseworthy acts of the 
PSA.78.4	his might, and the wondrous works
PSA.78.4	he has performed.
PSA.78.5	He established a testimony in Jacob
PSA.78.5	and set up a law in Israel,
PSA.78.5	which he commanded our fathers
PSA.78.5	to teach to their children
PSA.78.6	so that a future generation —
PSA.78.6	children yet to be born — might know.
PSA.78.6	They were to rise and tell their children
PSA.78.7	so that they might put their confidence in God
PSA.78.7	and not forget God’s works,
PSA.78.7	but keep his commands.
PSA.78.8	Then they would not be like their fathers,
PSA.78.8	a stubborn and rebellious generation,
PSA.78.8	a generation whose heart was not loyal
PSA.78.8	and whose spirit was not faithful to God.
PSA.78.9	The Ephraimite archers turned back
PSA.78.9	on the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They did not keep God’s covenant
PSA.78.10	and refused to live by his law.
PSA.78.11	They forgot what he had done,
PSA.78.11	the wondrous works he had shown them.
PSA.78.12	He worked wonders in the sight of their fathers
PSA.78.12	in the land of Egypt, the territory of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	He split the sea and brought them across;
PSA.78.13	the water stood firm like a wall.
PSA.78.14	He led them with a cloud by day
PSA.78.14	and with a fiery light throughout the night.
PSA.78.15	He split rocks in the wilderness
PSA.78.15	and gave them drink as abundant as the depths.
PSA.78.16	He brought streams out of the stone
PSA.78.16	and made water flow down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	But they continued to sin against him,
PSA.78.17	rebelling in the desert against the Most High.
PSA.78.18	They deliberately
PSA.78.18	demanding the food they craved.
PSA.78.19	They spoke against God, saying,
PSA.78.19	“Is God able to provide food in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	Look! He struck the rock and water gushed out;
PSA.78.20	torrents overflowed.
PSA.78.20	But can he also provide bread
PSA.78.20	or furnish meat for his people?” 
PSA.78.21	Therefore, the 
PSA.78.21	then fire broke out against Jacob,
PSA.78.21	and anger flared up against Israel
PSA.78.22	because they did not believe God
PSA.78.22	or rely on his salvation.
PSA.78.23	He gave a command to the clouds above
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors of heaven.
PSA.78.24	He rained manna for them to eat;
PSA.78.24	he gave them grain from heaven.
PSA.78.25	People
PSA.78.25	He sent them an abundant supply of food.
PSA.78.26	He made the east wind blow in the skies
PSA.78.26	and drove the south wind by his might.
PSA.78.27	He rained meat on them like dust,
PSA.78.27	and winged birds like the sand of the seas.
PSA.78.28	He made them fall in the camp,
PSA.78.28	all around the tents.
PSA.78.29	The people ate and were completely satisfied,
PSA.78.29	for he gave them what they craved.
PSA.78.30	Before they had turned from what they craved,
PSA.78.30	while the food was still in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	God’s anger flared up against them,
PSA.78.31	and he killed some of their best men.
PSA.78.31	He struck down Israel’s fit young men.
PSA.78.32	Despite all this, they kept sinning
PSA.78.32	and did not believe his wondrous works.
PSA.78.33	He made their days end in futility,
PSA.78.33	their years in sudden disaster.
PSA.78.34	When he killed some of them,
PSA.78.34	the rest began to seek him;
PSA.78.34	they repented and searched for God.
PSA.78.35	They remembered that God was their rock,
PSA.78.35	the Most High God, their Redeemer.
PSA.78.36	But they deceived him with their mouths,
PSA.78.36	they lied to him with their tongues,
PSA.78.37	their hearts were insincere toward him,
PSA.78.37	and they were unfaithful to his covenant.
PSA.78.38	Yet he was compassionate;
PSA.78.38	he atoned for their iniquity
PSA.78.38	and did not destroy them.
PSA.78.38	He often turned his anger aside
PSA.78.38	and did not unleash
PSA.78.39	He remembered that they were only flesh,
PSA.78.39	a wind that passes and does not return.
PSA.78.40	How often they rebelled against him
PSA.78.40	in the wilderness
PSA.78.40	and grieved him in the desert.
PSA.78.41	They constantly tested God
PSA.78.41	and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They did not remember his power shown
PSA.78.42	on the day he redeemed them from the foe,
PSA.78.43	when he performed his miraculous signs in Egypt
PSA.78.43	and his wonders in the territory of Zoan.
PSA.78.44	He turned their rivers into blood,
PSA.78.44	and they could not drink from their streams.
PSA.78.45	He sent among them swarms of flies,
PSA.78.45	which fed on them,
PSA.78.45	and frogs, which devastated them.
PSA.78.46	He gave their crops to the caterpillar
PSA.78.46	and the fruit of their labor to the locust.
PSA.78.47	He killed their vines with hail
PSA.78.47	and their sycamore fig trees with a flood.
PSA.78.48	He handed over their livestock to hail
PSA.78.48	and their cattle to lightning bolts.
PSA.78.49	He sent his burning anger against them:
PSA.78.49	fury, indignation, and calamity —
PSA.78.49	a band of deadly messengers.
PSA.78.50	He cleared a path for his anger.
PSA.78.50	He did not spare them from death
PSA.78.50	but delivered their lives to the plague.
PSA.78.51	He struck all the firstborn
PSA.78.51	the first progeny of the tents of Ham.
PSA.78.52	He led his people out like sheep
PSA.78.52	and guided them like a flock in the wilderness.
PSA.78.53	He led them safely, and they were not afraid;
PSA.78.53	but the sea covered their enemies.
PSA.78.54	He brought them to his holy territory,
PSA.78.54	to the mountain his right hand acquired.
PSA.78.55	He drove out nations before them.
PSA.78.55	He apportioned their inheritance by lot
PSA.78.55	and settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.
PSA.78.56	But they rebelliously tested the Most High God,
PSA.78.56	for they did not keep his decrees.
PSA.78.57	They treacherously turned away like their fathers;
PSA.78.57	they became warped like a faulty bow.
PSA.78.58	They enraged him with their high places
PSA.78.58	and provoked his jealousy with their carved images.
PSA.78.59	God heard and became furious;
PSA.78.59	he completely rejected Israel.
PSA.78.60	He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	the tent where he resided among mankind.
PSA.78.61	He gave up his strength to captivity
PSA.78.61	and his splendor to the hand of a foe.
PSA.78.62	He surrendered his people to the sword
PSA.78.62	because he was enraged with his heritage.
PSA.78.63	Fire consumed his chosen young men,
PSA.78.63	and his young women had no wedding songs.
PSA.78.64	His priests fell by the sword,
PSA.78.64	and the widows could not lament.
PSA.78.65	The Lord awoke as if from sleep,
PSA.78.65	like a warrior from the effects of wine.
PSA.78.66	He beat back his foes;
PSA.78.66	he gave them lasting disgrace.
PSA.78.67	He rejected the tent of Joseph
PSA.78.67	and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
PSA.78.68	He chose instead the tribe of Judah,
PSA.78.68	Mount Zion, which he loved.
PSA.78.69	He built his sanctuary like the heights,
PSA.78.69	like the earth that he established forever.
PSA.78.70	He chose David his servant
PSA.78.70	and took him from the sheep pens;
PSA.78.71	he brought him from tending ewes
PSA.78.71	to be shepherd over his people Jacob —
PSA.78.71	over Israel, his inheritance.
PSA.78.72	He shepherded them with a pure heart
PSA.78.72	and guided them with his skillful hands.
PSA.79.1	God, the nations have invaded your inheritance,
PSA.79.1	desecrated your holy temple,
PSA.79.1	and turned Jerusalem into ruins.
PSA.79.2	They gave the corpses of your servants
PSA.79.2	to the birds of the sky for food,
PSA.79.2	the flesh of your faithful ones
PSA.79.2	to the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	They poured out their blood
PSA.79.3	like water all around Jerusalem,
PSA.79.3	and there was no one to bury them.
PSA.79.4	We have become an object of reproach
PSA.79.4	to our neighbors,
PSA.79.4	a source of mockery and ridicule
PSA.79.4	to those around us.
PSA.79.5	How long, 
PSA.79.5	Will your jealousy keep burning like fire?
PSA.79.6	Pour out your wrath on the nations
PSA.79.6	that don’t acknowledge you,
PSA.79.6	on the kingdoms that don’t call on your name,
PSA.79.7	for they have devoured Jacob
PSA.79.7	and devastated his homeland.
PSA.79.8	Do not hold past iniquities
PSA.79.8	let your compassion come to us quickly,
PSA.79.8	for we have become very weak.
PSA.79.9	God of our salvation, help us
PSA.79.9	for the glory of your name.
PSA.79.9	Rescue us and atone for our sins,
PSA.79.9	for your name’s sake.
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations ask,
PSA.79.10	“Where is their God?” 
PSA.79.10	Before our eyes,
PSA.79.10	let vengeance for the shed blood of your servants
PSA.79.10	be known among the nations.
PSA.79.11	Let the groans of the prisoners reach you;
PSA.79.11	according to your great power,
PSA.79.11	preserve those condemned to die.
PSA.79.12	Pay back sevenfold to our neighbors
PSA.79.12	the reproach they have hurled at you, Lord.
PSA.79.13	Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture,
PSA.79.13	will thank you forever;
PSA.79.13	we will declare your praise
PSA.79.13	to generation after generation.
PSA.80.1	Listen, Shepherd of Israel,
PSA.80.1	who leads Joseph like a flock;
PSA.80.1	you who sit enthroned between the cherubim,
PSA.80.1	shine
PSA.80.2	on Ephraim,
PSA.80.2	Benjamin, and Manasseh.
PSA.80.2	Rally your power and come to save us.
PSA.80.3	Restore us, God;
PSA.80.3	make your face shine on us,
PSA.80.3	so that we may be saved.
PSA.80.4	how long will you be angry
PSA.80.4	with your people’s prayers?
PSA.80.5	You fed them the bread of tears
PSA.80.5	and gave them a full measure
PSA.80.5	of tears to drink.
PSA.80.6	You put us at odds with our neighbors;
PSA.80.6	our enemies mock us.
PSA.80.7	Restore us, God of Armies;
PSA.80.7	make your face shine on us, so that we may be saved.
PSA.80.8	You dug up a vine from Egypt;
PSA.80.8	you drove out the nations and planted it.
PSA.80.9	You cleared a place for it;
PSA.80.9	it took root and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	The mountains were covered by its shade,
PSA.80.10	and the mighty cedars
PSA.80.11	It sent out sprouts toward the Sea
PSA.80.11	and shoots toward the River.
PSA.80.12	Why have you broken down its walls
PSA.80.12	so that all who pass by pick its fruit?
PSA.80.13	Boars from the forest tear at it
PSA.80.13	and creatures of the field feed on it.
PSA.80.14	Return, God of Armies.
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven and see;
PSA.80.14	take care of this vine,
PSA.80.15	the root
PSA.80.15	the son
PSA.80.16	It was cut down and burned;
PSA.80.16	they
PSA.80.17	Let your hand be with the man at your right hand,
PSA.80.17	with the son of man
PSA.80.17	you have made strong for yourself.
PSA.80.18	Then we will not turn away from you;
PSA.80.18	revive us, and we will call on your name.
PSA.80.19	Restore us, 
PSA.80.19	make your face shine on us, so that we may be saved.
PSA.81.1	Sing for joy to God our strength;
PSA.81.1	shout in triumph to the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	Lift up a song — play the tambourine,
PSA.81.2	the melodious lyre, and the harp.
PSA.81.3	Blow the horn on the day of our feasts
PSA.81.3	during the new moon
PSA.81.3	and during the full moon.
PSA.81.4	For this is a statute for Israel,
PSA.81.4	an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	He set it up as a decree for Joseph
PSA.81.5	when he went throughout
PSA.81.5	I heard an unfamiliar language:
PSA.81.6	“I relieved his shoulder from the burden;
PSA.81.6	his hands were freed from carrying the basket.
PSA.81.7	You called out in distress, and I rescued you;
PSA.81.7	I answered you from the thundercloud.
PSA.81.7	I tested you at the Waters of Meribah.
PSA.81.8	Listen, my people, and I will admonish you.
PSA.81.8	Israel, if you would only listen to me!
PSA.81.9	There must not be a strange god among you;
PSA.81.9	you must not bow down to a foreign god.
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.10	who brought you up from the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.10	Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
PSA.81.11	“But my people did not listen to my voice;
PSA.81.11	Israel did not obey me.
PSA.81.12	So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts
PSA.81.12	to follow their own plans.
PSA.81.13	If only my people would listen to me
PSA.81.13	and Israel would follow my ways,
PSA.81.14	I would quickly subdue their enemies
PSA.81.14	and turn my hand against their foes.”
PSA.81.15	Those who hate the 
PSA.81.15	would cower to him;
PSA.81.15	their doom would last forever.
PSA.81.16	But he would feed Israel
PSA.81.16	“I would satisfy you with honey from the rock.”
PSA.82.1	God stands in the divine assembly;
PSA.82.1	he pronounces judgment among the gods:
PSA.82.2	“How long will you judge unjustly
PSA.82.2	and show partiality to the wicked?
PSA.82.3	Provide justice for the needy and the fatherless;
PSA.82.3	uphold the rights of the oppressed and the destitute.
PSA.82.4	Rescue the poor and needy;
PSA.82.4	save them from the power of the wicked.”
PSA.82.5	They do not know or understand;
PSA.82.5	they wander in darkness.
PSA.82.5	All the foundations of the earth are shaken.
PSA.82.6	I said, “You are gods;
PSA.82.6	you are all sons of the Most High.
PSA.82.7	However, you will die like humans
PSA.82.7	and fall like any other ruler.”
PSA.82.8	Rise up, God, judge the earth,
PSA.82.8	for all the nations belong to you.
PSA.83.1	God, do not keep silent.
PSA.83.1	Do not be deaf, God; do not be quiet.
PSA.83.2	See how your enemies make an uproar;
PSA.83.2	those who hate you have acted arrogantly.
PSA.83.3	They devise clever schemes against your people;
PSA.83.3	they conspire against your treasured ones.
PSA.83.4	They say, “Come, let us wipe them out as a nation
PSA.83.4	so that Israel’s name will no longer be remembered.”
PSA.83.5	For they have conspired with one mind;
PSA.83.5	they form an alliance
PSA.83.6	the tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites,
PSA.83.6	Moab and the Hagrites,
PSA.83.7	Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek,
PSA.83.7	Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre.
PSA.83.8	Even Assyria has joined them;
PSA.83.8	they lend support
PSA.83.9	Deal with them as you did with Midian,
PSA.83.9	as you did with Sisera
PSA.83.9	and Jabin at the Kishon River.
PSA.83.10	They were destroyed at En-dor;
PSA.83.10	they became manure for the ground.
PSA.83.11	Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb,
PSA.83.11	and all their tribal leaders like Zebah and Zalmunna,
PSA.83.12	who said, “Let us seize God’s pastures for ourselves.”
PSA.83.13	Make them like tumbleweed, my God,
PSA.83.13	like straw before the wind.
PSA.83.14	As fire burns a forest,
PSA.83.14	as a flame blazes through mountains,
PSA.83.15	so pursue them with your tempest
PSA.83.15	and terrify them with your storm.
PSA.83.16	Cover their faces with shame
PSA.83.16	so that they will seek your name, 
PSA.83.17	Let them be put to shame and terrified forever;
PSA.83.17	let them perish in disgrace.
PSA.83.18	May they know that you alone —
PSA.83.18	whose name is the 
PSA.83.18	are the Most High over the whole earth.
PSA.84.1	How lovely is your dwelling place,
PSA.84.2	I long and yearn
PSA.84.2	for the courts of the 
PSA.84.2	my heart and flesh cry out for
PSA.84.3	Even a sparrow finds a home,
PSA.84.3	and a swallow, a nest for herself
PSA.84.3	where she places her young —
PSA.84.3	near your altars, 
PSA.84.3	my King and my God.
PSA.84.4	How happy are those who reside in your house,
PSA.84.4	who praise you continually.
PSA.84.5	Happy are the people whose strength is in you,
PSA.84.5	whose hearts are set on pilgrimage.
PSA.84.6	As they pass through the Valley of Baca,
PSA.84.6	they make it a source of spring water;
PSA.84.6	even the autumn rain will cover it with blessings.
PSA.84.7	They go from strength to strength;
PSA.84.7	each appears before God in Zion.
PSA.84.8	listen, God of Jacob.
PSA.84.9	Consider our shield,
PSA.84.9	look on the face of your anointed one.
PSA.84.10	Better a day in your courts
PSA.84.10	than a thousand anywhere else.
PSA.84.10	I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God
PSA.84.10	than live in the tents of wicked people.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.11	The 
PSA.84.11	he does not withhold the good
PSA.84.11	from those who live with integrity.
PSA.84.12	Happy is the person who trusts in you,
PSA.85.1	you restored the fortunes of Jacob.
PSA.85.2	You forgave your people’s guilt;
PSA.85.2	you covered all their sin.
PSA.85.3	You withdrew all your fury;
PSA.85.3	you turned from your burning anger.
PSA.85.4	Return to us, God of our salvation,
PSA.85.4	and abandon your displeasure with us.
PSA.85.5	Will you be angry with us forever?
PSA.85.5	Will you prolong your anger for all generations?
PSA.85.6	Will you not revive us again
PSA.85.6	so that your people may rejoice in you?
PSA.85.7	Show us your faithful love, 
PSA.85.7	and give us your salvation.
PSA.85.8	I will listen to what God will say;
PSA.85.8	surely the 
PSA.85.8	to his people, his faithful ones,
PSA.85.8	and not let them go back to foolish ways.
PSA.85.9	His salvation is very near those who fear him,
PSA.85.9	so that glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Faithful love and truth will join together;
PSA.85.10	righteousness and peace will embrace.
PSA.85.11	Truth will spring up from the earth,
PSA.85.11	and righteousness will look down from heaven.
PSA.85.12	Also, the 
PSA.85.12	and our land will yield its crops.
PSA.85.13	Righteousness will go before him
PSA.85.13	to prepare the way for his steps.
PSA.86.1	Listen, 
PSA.86.1	for I am poor and needy.
PSA.86.2	Protect my life, for I am faithful.
PSA.86.2	You are my God; save your servant who trusts in you.
PSA.86.3	Be gracious to me, Lord,
PSA.86.3	for I call to you all day long.
PSA.86.4	Bring joy to your servant’s life,
PSA.86.4	because I appeal to you, Lord.
PSA.86.5	For you, Lord, are kind and ready to forgive,
PSA.86.5	abounding in faithful love to all who call on you.
PSA.86.6	listen to my plea for mercy.
PSA.86.7	I call on you in the day of my distress,
PSA.86.7	for you will answer me.
PSA.86.8	Lord, there is no one like you among the gods,
PSA.86.8	and there are no works like yours.
PSA.86.9	All the nations you have made
PSA.86.9	will come and bow down before you, Lord,
PSA.86.9	and will honor your name.
PSA.86.10	For you are great and perform wonders;
PSA.86.10	you alone are God.
PSA.86.11	Teach me your way, 
PSA.86.11	and I will live by your truth.
PSA.86.11	Give me an undivided mind to fear your name.
PSA.86.12	I will praise you with all my heart, Lord my God,
PSA.86.12	and will honor your name forever.
PSA.86.13	For your faithful love for me is great,
PSA.86.13	and you rescue my life from the depths of Sheol.
PSA.86.14	God, arrogant people have attacked me;
PSA.86.14	a gang of ruthless men intends to kill me.
PSA.86.14	They do not let you guide them.
PSA.86.15	But you, Lord, are a compassionate and gracious God,
PSA.86.15	slow to anger and abounding in faithful love and truth.
PSA.86.16	Turn to me and be gracious to me.
PSA.86.16	Give your strength to your servant;
PSA.86.16	save the son of your female servant.
PSA.86.17	Show me a sign of your goodness;
PSA.86.17	my enemies will see and be put to shame
PSA.86.17	because you, 
PSA.87.1	The city he founded
PSA.87.2	The 
PSA.87.2	more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are said about you,
PSA.87.3	city of God.
PSA.87.4	“I will make a record of those who know me:
PSA.87.4	Rahab, Babylon, Philistia, Tyre, and Cush —
PSA.87.4	each one was born there.”
PSA.87.5	And it will be said of Zion,
PSA.87.5	“This one and that one were born in her.”
PSA.87.5	The Most High himself will establish her.
PSA.87.6	When he registers the peoples,
PSA.87.6	the 
PSA.87.6	“This one was born there.”
PSA.87.7	Singers and dancers
PSA.87.7	“My whole source of joy is
PSA.88.1	I cry out before you day and night.
PSA.88.2	May my prayer reach your presence;
PSA.88.2	listen to my cry.
PSA.88.3	For I have had enough troubles,
PSA.88.3	and my life is near Sheol.
PSA.88.4	I am counted among those going down to the Pit.
PSA.88.4	I am like a man without strength,
PSA.88.5	abandoned
PSA.88.5	I am like the slain lying in the grave,
PSA.88.5	whom you no longer remember,
PSA.88.5	and who are cut off from your care.
PSA.88.6	You have put me in the lowest part of the Pit,
PSA.88.6	in the darkest places, in the depths.
PSA.88.7	Your wrath weighs heavily on me;
PSA.88.7	you have overwhelmed me with all your waves.
PSA.88.8	You have distanced my friends from me;
PSA.88.8	you have made me repulsive to them.
PSA.88.8	I am shut in and cannot go out.
PSA.88.9	My eyes are worn out from crying.
PSA.88.9	I spread out my hands to you.
PSA.88.10	Do you work wonders for the dead?
PSA.88.10	Do departed spirits rise up to praise you?
PSA.88.11	Will your faithful love be declared in the grave,
PSA.88.11	your faithfulness in Abaddon?
PSA.88.12	Will your wonders be known in the darkness
PSA.88.12	or your righteousness in the land of oblivion?
PSA.88.13	But I call to you for help, 
PSA.88.13	in the morning my prayer meets you.
PSA.88.14	Why do you hide your face from me?
PSA.88.15	From my youth,
PSA.88.15	I have been suffering and near death.
PSA.88.15	I suffer your horrors; I am desperate.
PSA.88.16	Your wrath sweeps over me;
PSA.88.16	your terrors destroy me.
PSA.88.17	They surround me like water all day long;
PSA.88.17	they close in on me from every side.
PSA.88.18	You have distanced loved one and neighbor from me;
PSA.88.18	darkness is my only friend.
PSA.89.1	I will sing about the 
PSA.89.1	I will proclaim your faithfulness to all generations
PSA.89.1	with my mouth.
PSA.89.2	For I will declare,
PSA.89.2	“Faithful love is built up forever;
PSA.89.2	you establish your faithfulness in the heavens.”
PSA.89.3	The 
PSA.89.3	“I have made a covenant with my chosen one;
PSA.89.3	I have sworn an oath to David my servant:
PSA.89.4	‘I will establish your offspring forever
PSA.89.4	and build up your throne for all generations.’”
PSA.89.5	your faithfulness also —
PSA.89.5	in the assembly of the holy ones.
PSA.89.6	For who in the skies can compare with the 
PSA.89.6	Who among the heavenly beings
PSA.89.7	God is greatly feared in the council of the holy ones,
PSA.89.7	more awe-inspiring than
PSA.89.8	who is strong like you, 
PSA.89.8	Your faithfulness surrounds you.
PSA.89.9	You rule the raging sea;
PSA.89.9	when its waves surge, you still them.
PSA.89.10	You crushed Rahab like one who is slain;
PSA.89.10	you scattered your enemies with your powerful arm.
PSA.89.11	The heavens are yours; the earth also is yours.
PSA.89.11	The world and everything in it — you founded them.
PSA.89.12	North and south — you created them.
PSA.89.12	Tabor and Hermon shout for joy at your name.
PSA.89.13	You have a mighty arm;
PSA.89.13	your hand is powerful;
PSA.89.13	your right hand is lifted high.
PSA.89.14	Righteousness and justice are the foundation
PSA.89.14	of your throne;
PSA.89.14	faithful love and truth go before you.
PSA.89.15	Happy are the people who know the joyful shout;
PSA.89.16	They rejoice in your name all day long,
PSA.89.16	and they are exalted by your righteousness.
PSA.89.17	For you are their magnificent strength;
PSA.89.17	by your favor our horn is exalted.
PSA.89.18	Surely our shield
PSA.89.18	our king to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.89.19	You once spoke in a vision to your faithful ones
PSA.89.19	and said: “I have granted help to a warrior;
PSA.89.19	I have exalted one chosen
PSA.89.20	I have found David my servant;
PSA.89.20	I have anointed him with my sacred oil.
PSA.89.21	My hand will always be with him,
PSA.89.21	and my arm will strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy will not oppress
PSA.89.22	the wicked will not afflict him.
PSA.89.23	I will crush his foes before him
PSA.89.23	and strike those who hate him.
PSA.89.24	My faithfulness and love will be with him,
PSA.89.24	and through my name
PSA.89.24	his horn will be exalted.
PSA.89.25	I will extend his power to the sea
PSA.89.25	and his right hand to the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He will call to me, ‘You are my Father,
PSA.89.26	my God, the rock of my salvation.’
PSA.89.27	I will also make him my firstborn,
PSA.89.27	greatest of the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	I will always preserve my faithful love for him,
PSA.89.28	and my covenant with him will endure.
PSA.89.29	I will establish his line forever,
PSA.89.29	his throne as long as heaven lasts.
PSA.89.30	If his sons abandon my instruction
PSA.89.30	and do not live by my ordinances,
PSA.89.31	if they dishonor my statutes
PSA.89.31	and do not keep my commands,
PSA.89.32	then I will call their rebellion
PSA.89.32	to account with the rod,
PSA.89.32	their iniquity with blows.
PSA.89.33	But I will not withdraw
PSA.89.33	my faithful love from him
PSA.89.33	or betray my faithfulness.
PSA.89.34	I will not violate my covenant
PSA.89.34	or change what my lips have said.
PSA.89.35	Once and for all
PSA.89.35	I have sworn an oath by my holiness;
PSA.89.35	I will not lie to David.
PSA.89.36	His offspring will continue forever,
PSA.89.36	his throne like the sun before me,
PSA.89.37	like the moon, established forever,
PSA.89.37	a faithful witness in the sky.”
PSA.89.38	But you have spurned and rejected him;
PSA.89.38	you have become enraged with your anointed.
PSA.89.39	You have repudiated the covenant with your servant;
PSA.89.39	you have completely dishonored his crown.
PSA.89.40	You have broken down all his walls;
PSA.89.40	you have reduced his fortified cities to ruins.
PSA.89.41	All who pass by plunder him;
PSA.89.41	he has become an object of ridicule
PSA.89.41	to his neighbors.
PSA.89.42	You have lifted high the right hand of his foes;
PSA.89.42	you have made all his enemies rejoice.
PSA.89.43	You have also turned back his sharp sword
PSA.89.43	and have not let him stand in battle.
PSA.89.44	You have made his splendor
PSA.89.44	and have overturned his throne.
PSA.89.45	You have shortened the days of his youth;
PSA.89.45	you have covered him with shame.
PSA.89.46	How long, 
PSA.89.46	Will your anger keep burning like fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember how short my life is.
PSA.89.47	Have you created everyone for nothing?
PSA.89.48	What courageous person can live and never see death?
PSA.89.48	Who can save himself from the power of Sheol?
PSA.89.49	Lord, where are the former acts of your faithful love
PSA.89.49	that you swore to David in your faithfulness?
PSA.89.50	Remember, Lord, the ridicule against your servants —
PSA.89.50	in my heart I carry abuse from all the peoples —
PSA.89.51	how your enemies have ridiculed, 
PSA.89.51	how they have ridiculed every step of your anointed.
PSA.89.52	Blessed be the 
PSA.89.52	Amen and amen.
PSA.90.1	Lord, you have been our refuge
PSA.90.1	in every generation.
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were born,
PSA.90.2	before you gave birth to the earth and the world,
PSA.90.2	from eternity to eternity, you are God.
PSA.90.3	You return mankind to the dust,
PSA.90.3	saying, “Return, descendants of Adam.”
PSA.90.4	For in your sight a thousand years
PSA.90.4	are like yesterday that passes by,
PSA.90.4	like a few hours of the night.
PSA.90.5	You end their lives;
PSA.90.5	They are like grass that grows in the morning —
PSA.90.6	in the morning it sprouts and grows;
PSA.90.6	by evening it withers and dries up.
PSA.90.7	For we are consumed by your anger;
PSA.90.7	we are terrified by your wrath.
PSA.90.8	You have set our iniquities before you,
PSA.90.8	our secret sins in the light of your presence.
PSA.90.9	For all our days ebb away under your wrath;
PSA.90.9	we end our years like a sigh.
PSA.90.10	Our lives last
PSA.90.10	or, if we are strong, eighty years.
PSA.90.10	Even the best of them are
PSA.90.10	indeed, they pass quickly and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who understands the power of your anger?
PSA.90.11	Your wrath matches the fear that is due you.
PSA.90.12	Teach us to number our days carefully
PSA.90.12	so that we may develop wisdom in our hearts.
PSA.90.13	Turn and have compassion on your servants.
PSA.90.14	Satisfy us in the morning with your faithful love
PSA.90.14	so that we may shout with joy and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us rejoice for as many days as you have humbled us,
PSA.90.15	for as many years as we have seen adversity.
PSA.90.16	Let your work be seen by your servants,
PSA.90.16	and your splendor by their children.
PSA.90.17	Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us;
PSA.90.17	establish for us the work of our hands —
PSA.90.17	establish the work of our hands!
PSA.91.1	The one who lives under the protection of the Most High
PSA.91.1	dwells in the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	I will say
PSA.91.2	my God in whom I trust:
PSA.91.3	He himself will rescue you from the bird trap,
PSA.91.3	from the destructive plague.
PSA.91.4	He will cover you with his feathers;
PSA.91.4	you will take refuge under his wings.
PSA.91.4	His faithfulness will be a protective shield.
PSA.91.5	You will not fear the terror of the night,
PSA.91.5	the arrow that flies by day,
PSA.91.6	the plague that stalks in darkness,
PSA.91.6	or the pestilence that ravages at noon.
PSA.91.7	Though a thousand fall at your side
PSA.91.7	and ten thousand at your right hand,
PSA.91.7	the pestilence will not reach you.
PSA.91.8	You will only see it with your eyes
PSA.91.8	and witness the punishment of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	Because you have made the 
PSA.91.9	the Most High — your dwelling place,
PSA.91.10	no harm will come to you;
PSA.91.10	no plague will come near your tent.
PSA.91.11	For he will give his angels orders concerning you,
PSA.91.11	to protect you in all your ways.
PSA.91.12	They will support you with their hands
PSA.91.12	so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.
PSA.91.13	You will tread on the lion and the cobra;
PSA.91.13	you will trample the young lion and the serpent.
PSA.91.14	Because he has his heart set on me,
PSA.91.14	I will deliver him;
PSA.91.14	I will protect him because he knows my name.
PSA.91.15	When he calls out to me, I will answer him;
PSA.91.15	I will be with him in trouble.
PSA.91.15	I will rescue him and give him honor.
PSA.91.16	I will satisfy him with a long life
PSA.91.16	and show him my salvation.
PSA.92.1	It is good to give thanks to the 
PSA.92.1	to sing praise to your name, Most High,
PSA.92.2	to declare your faithful love in the morning
PSA.92.2	and your faithfulness at night,
PSA.92.3	with a ten-stringed harp
PSA.92.3	and the music of a lyre.
PSA.92.4	For you have made me rejoice, 
PSA.92.4	by what you have done;
PSA.92.4	I will shout for joy
PSA.92.4	because of the works of your hands.
PSA.92.5	How magnificent are your works, 
PSA.92.5	how profound your thoughts!
PSA.92.6	A stupid person does not know,
PSA.92.6	a fool does not understand this:
PSA.92.7	though the wicked sprout like grass
PSA.92.7	and all evildoers flourish,
PSA.92.7	they will be eternally destroyed.
PSA.92.8	But you, 
PSA.92.9	For indeed, 
PSA.92.9	indeed, your enemies will perish;
PSA.92.9	all evildoers will be scattered.
PSA.92.10	You have lifted up my horn
PSA.92.10	like that of a wild ox;
PSA.92.10	I have been anointed
PSA.92.11	My eyes look at my enemies;
PSA.92.11	when evildoers rise against me,
PSA.92.11	my ears hear them.
PSA.92.12	The righteous thrive like a palm tree
PSA.92.12	and grow like a cedar tree in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	Planted in the house of the 
PSA.92.13	they thrive in the courts of our God.
PSA.92.14	They will still bear fruit in old age,
PSA.92.14	healthy and green,
PSA.92.15	to declare: “The 
PSA.92.15	he is my rock,
PSA.92.15	and there is no unrighteousness in him.”
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.1	the 
PSA.93.1	The world is firmly established;
PSA.93.1	it cannot be shaken.
PSA.93.2	Your throne has been established
PSA.93.2	from the beginning;
PSA.93.2	you are from eternity.
PSA.93.3	The floods have lifted up, 
PSA.93.3	the floods have lifted up their voice;
PSA.93.3	the floods lift up their pounding waves.
PSA.93.4	Greater than the roar of a huge torrent —
PSA.93.4	the mighty breakers of the sea —
PSA.93.4	the 
PSA.93.5	holiness adorns your house
PSA.93.5	for all the days to come.
PSA.94.1	God of vengeance, shine!
PSA.94.2	Rise up, Judge of the earth;
PSA.94.2	repay the proud what they deserve.
PSA.94.3	how long will the wicked celebrate?
PSA.94.4	They pour out arrogant words;
PSA.94.4	all the evildoers boast.
PSA.94.5	they oppress your heritage.
PSA.94.6	They kill the widow and the resident alien
PSA.94.6	and murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	They say, “The 
PSA.94.7	The God of Jacob doesn’t pay attention.”
PSA.94.8	Pay attention, you stupid people!
PSA.94.8	Fools, when will you be wise?
PSA.94.9	Can the one who shaped the ear not hear,
PSA.94.9	the one who formed the eye not see?
PSA.94.10	The one who instructs nations,
PSA.94.10	the one who teaches mankind knowledge —
PSA.94.10	does he not discipline?
PSA.94.11	The 
PSA.94.11	they are futile.
PSA.94.12	and teach from your law
PSA.94.13	to give him relief from troubled times
PSA.94.13	until a pit is dug for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	The 
PSA.94.14	or abandon his heritage,
PSA.94.15	for the administration of justice will again be righteous,
PSA.94.15	and all the upright in heart will follow
PSA.94.16	Who stands up for me against the wicked?
PSA.94.16	Who takes a stand for me against evildoers?
PSA.94.17	If the 
PSA.94.17	I would soon rest in the silence of death.
PSA.94.18	If I say, “My foot is slipping,”
PSA.94.18	your faithful love will support me, 
PSA.94.19	When I am filled with cares,
PSA.94.19	your comfort brings me joy.
PSA.94.20	Can a corrupt throne be your ally,
PSA.94.20	a throne that makes evil laws?
PSA.94.21	They band together against the life of the righteous
PSA.94.21	and condemn the innocent to death.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.22	my God is the rock of my protection.
PSA.94.23	He will pay them back for their sins
PSA.94.23	and destroy them for their evil.
PSA.94.23	The 
PSA.95.1	Come, let us shout joyfully to the 
PSA.95.1	shout triumphantly to the rock of our salvation!
PSA.95.2	Let us enter his presence with thanksgiving;
PSA.95.2	let us shout triumphantly to him in song.
PSA.95.3	For the 
PSA.95.3	a great King above all gods.
PSA.95.4	The depths of the earth are in his hand,
PSA.95.4	and the mountain peaks are his.
PSA.95.5	The sea is his; he made it.
PSA.95.5	His hands formed the dry land.
PSA.95.6	Come, let us worship and bow down;
PSA.95.6	let us kneel before the 
PSA.95.7	For he is our God,
PSA.95.7	and we are the people of his pasture,
PSA.95.7	the sheep under his care.
PSA.95.7	Today, if you hear his voice:
PSA.95.8	Do not harden your hearts as at Meribah,
PSA.95.8	as on that day at Massah in the wilderness
PSA.95.9	where your fathers tested me;
PSA.95.9	they tried me, though they had seen what I did.
PSA.95.10	For forty years I was disgusted with that generation;
PSA.95.10	I said, “They are a people whose hearts go astray;
PSA.95.10	they do not know my ways.”
PSA.95.11	So I swore in my anger,
PSA.95.11	“They will not enter my rest.”
PSA.96.1	Sing a new song to the 
PSA.96.1	let the whole earth sing to the 
PSA.96.2	Sing to the 
PSA.96.2	proclaim his salvation from day to day.

PSA.96.3	his wondrous works among all peoples.
PSA.96.4	For the 
PSA.96.4	he is feared above all gods.
PSA.96.5	For all the gods of the peoples are idols,
PSA.96.5	but the 
PSA.96.6	Splendor and majesty are before him;
PSA.96.6	strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.

PSA.96.10	The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken.
PSA.96.10	He judges the peoples fairly.”
PSA.96.11	Let the heavens be glad and the earth rejoice;
PSA.96.11	let the sea and all that fills it resound.
PSA.96.12	Let the fields and everything in them celebrate.
PSA.96.12	Then all the trees of the forest will shout for joy
PSA.96.13	before the 
PSA.96.13	for he is coming to judge the earth.
PSA.96.13	He will judge the world with righteousness
PSA.96.13	and the peoples with his faithfulness.
PSA.97.1	The

PSA.97.3	Fire goes before him
PSA.97.3	and burns up his foes on every side.
PSA.97.4	His lightning lights up the world;

PSA.97.7	those who boast in idols, will be put to shame.
PSA.97.7	All the gods
PSA.97.8	Zion hears and is glad,
PSA.97.8	Judah’s villages
PSA.97.8	because of your judgments, 
PSA.97.9	For you, 
PSA.97.9	are the Most High over the whole earth;
PSA.97.9	you are exalted above all the gods.
PSA.97.10	You who love the

PSA.99.6	They called to the 
PSA.99.7	He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud;
PSA.99.7	they kept his decrees and the statutes he gave them.
PSA.99.8	You were a forgiving God to them,
PSA.99.8	but an avenger of their sinful actions.
PSA.99.9	Exalt the 
PSA.99.9	bow in worship at his holy mountain,

PSA.100.5	For the 
PSA.100.5	his faithfulness, through all generations.
PSA.101.1	I will sing of faithful love and justice;
PSA.101.1	I will sing praise to you, 
PSA.101.2	I will pay attention to the way of integrity.
PSA.101.2	When will you come to me?
PSA.101.2	I will live with a heart of integrity in my house.
PSA.101.3	I will not let anything worthless guide me.
PSA.101.3	I hate the practice of transgression;
PSA.101.3	it will not cling to me.
PSA.101.4	A devious heart will be far from me;
PSA.101.4	I will not be involved with
PSA.101.5	I will destroy anyone
PSA.101.5	who secretly slanders his neighbor;
PSA.101.5	I cannot tolerate anyone
PSA.101.5	with haughty eyes or an arrogant heart.
PSA.101.6	My eyes favor the faithful of the land
PSA.101.6	so that they may sit down with me.
PSA.101.6	The one who follows the way of integrity
PSA.101.6	may serve me.
PSA.101.7	No one who acts deceitfully
PSA.101.7	will live in my palace;
PSA.101.7	the one who tells lies
PSA.101.7	will not be retained here to guide me.
PSA.101.8	Every morning I will destroy
PSA.101.8	all the wicked of the land,
PSA.101.8	wiping out all evildoers from the 
PSA.102.1	let my cry for help come before you.
PSA.102.2	Do not hide your face from me in my day of trouble.
PSA.102.2	Listen closely to me;
PSA.102.2	answer me quickly when I call.
PSA.102.3	For my days vanish like smoke,
PSA.102.3	and my bones burn like a furnace.
PSA.102.4	My heart is suffering, withered like grass;
PSA.102.4	I even forget to eat my food.
PSA.102.5	Because of the sound of my groaning,
PSA.102.5	my flesh sticks to my bones.
PSA.102.6	I am like an eagle owl,
PSA.102.6	like a little owl among the ruins.
PSA.102.7	I stay awake;
PSA.102.7	I am like a solitary bird on a roof.
PSA.102.8	My enemies taunt me all day long;
PSA.102.8	they ridicule and use my name as a curse.
PSA.102.9	I eat ashes like bread
PSA.102.9	and mingle my drinks with tears
PSA.102.10	because of your indignation and wrath;
PSA.102.10	for you have picked me up and thrown me aside.
PSA.102.11	My days are like a lengthening shadow,
PSA.102.11	and I wither away like grass.
PSA.102.12	But you, 
PSA.102.12	your fame endures to all generations.
PSA.102.13	You will rise up and have compassion on Zion,
PSA.102.13	for it is time to show favor to her —
PSA.102.13	the appointed time has come.
PSA.102.14	For your servants take delight in its stones
PSA.102.14	and favor its dust.

PSA.102.16	he will appear in his glory.
PSA.102.17	He will pay attention to the prayer of the destitute
PSA.102.17	and will not despise their prayer.
PSA.102.18	This will be written for a later generation,
PSA.102.18	and a people who have not yet been created will praise the 
PSA.102.19	He looked down from his holy heights —
PSA.102.19	the 
PSA.102.20	to hear a prisoner’s groaning,
PSA.102.20	to set free those condemned to die,
PSA.102.21	so that they might declare
PSA.102.21	the name of the 
PSA.102.21	and his praise in Jerusalem,
PSA.102.22	when peoples and kingdoms are assembled
PSA.102.22	to serve the 
PSA.102.23	He has broken my
PSA.102.23	he has shortened my days.
PSA.102.24	I say: “My God, do not take me
PSA.102.24	in the middle of my life!
PSA.102.24	Your years continue through all generations.
PSA.102.25	Long ago you established the earth,
PSA.102.25	and the heavens are the work of your hands.
PSA.102.26	They will perish, but you will endure;
PSA.102.26	all of them will wear out like clothing.
PSA.102.26	You will change them like a garment,
PSA.102.26	and they will pass away.
PSA.102.27	But you are the same,
PSA.102.27	and your years will never end.
PSA.102.28	Your servants’ children will dwell securely,
PSA.102.28	and their offspring will be established before you.”
PSA.103.1	My soul, bless the 
PSA.103.1	and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
PSA.103.2	My soul, bless the 
PSA.103.2	and do not forget all his benefits.
PSA.103.3	He forgives all your iniquity;
PSA.103.3	he heals all your diseases.
PSA.103.4	He redeems your life from the Pit;

PSA.103.5	your youth is renewed like the eagle.
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.6	and justice for all the oppressed.
PSA.103.7	He revealed his ways to Moses,
PSA.103.7	his deeds to the people of Israel.
PSA.103.8	The 
PSA.103.8	slow to anger and abounding in faithful love.
PSA.103.9	He will not always accuse us
PSA.103.9	or be angry forever.
PSA.103.10	He has not dealt with us as our sins deserve
PSA.103.10	or repaid us according to our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
PSA.103.11	so great is his faithful love
PSA.103.11	toward those who fear him.
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west,
PSA.103.12	so far has he removed
PSA.103.12	our transgressions from us.
PSA.103.13	As a father has compassion on his children,
PSA.103.13	so the 
PSA.103.14	For he knows what we are made of,
PSA.103.14	remembering that we are dust.
PSA.103.15	As for man, his days are like grass —
PSA.103.15	he blooms like a flower of the field;
PSA.103.16	when the wind passes over it, it vanishes,
PSA.103.16	and its place is no longer known.
PSA.103.17	But from eternity to eternity
PSA.103.17	the 
PSA.103.17	and his righteousness toward the grandchildren
PSA.103.18	of those who keep his covenant,
PSA.103.18	who remember to observe his precepts.
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.19	and his kingdom rules over all.
PSA.103.20	Bless the 
PSA.103.20	all his angels of great strength,
PSA.103.20	who do his word,
PSA.103.20	obedient to his command.
PSA.103.21	Bless the 
PSA.103.21	his servants who do his will.
PSA.103.22	Bless the 
PSA.103.22	in all the places where he rules.
PSA.103.22	My soul, bless the 
PSA.104.1	My soul, bless the 
PSA.104.1	you are clothed with majesty and splendor.
PSA.104.2	He wraps himself in light as if it were a robe,
PSA.104.2	spreading out the sky like a canopy,
PSA.104.3	laying the beams of his palace
PSA.104.3	on the waters above,
PSA.104.3	making the clouds his chariot,
PSA.104.3	walking on the wings of the wind,
PSA.104.4	and making the winds his messengers,
PSA.104.4	flames of fire his servants.
PSA.104.5	He established the earth on its foundations;
PSA.104.5	it will never be shaken.
PSA.104.6	You covered it with the deep
PSA.104.6	as if it were a garment;
PSA.104.6	the water stood above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At your rebuke the water fled;
PSA.104.7	at the sound of your thunder they hurried away
PSA.104.8	mountains rose and valleys sank
PSA.104.8	to the place you established for them.
PSA.104.9	You set a boundary they cannot cross;
PSA.104.9	they will never cover the earth again.
PSA.104.10	He causes the springs to gush into the valleys;
PSA.104.10	they flow between the mountains.
PSA.104.11	They supply water for every wild beast;
PSA.104.11	the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	The birds of the sky live beside the springs;
PSA.104.12	they make their voices heard among the foliage.
PSA.104.13	He waters the mountains from his palace;
PSA.104.13	the earth is satisfied by the fruit of your labor.
PSA.104.14	He causes grass to grow for the livestock
PSA.104.14	and provides crops for man to cultivate,
PSA.104.14	producing food from the earth,
PSA.104.15	wine that makes human hearts glad —
PSA.104.15	making his face shine with oil —
PSA.104.15	and bread that sustains human hearts.
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.16	the cedars of Lebanon that he planted.
PSA.104.17	There the birds make their nests;
PSA.104.17	storks make their homes in the pine trees.
PSA.104.18	The high mountains are for the wild goats;
PSA.104.18	the cliffs are a refuge for hyraxes.
PSA.104.19	He made the moon to mark the
PSA.104.19	the sun knows when to set.
PSA.104.20	You bring darkness, and it becomes night,
PSA.104.20	when all the forest animals stir.
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar for their prey
PSA.104.21	and seek their food from God.
PSA.104.22	The sun rises; they go back
PSA.104.22	and lie down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goes out to his work
PSA.104.23	and to his labor until evening.
PSA.104.24	How countless are your works, 
PSA.104.24	In wisdom you have made them all;
PSA.104.24	the earth is full of your creatures.
PSA.104.25	Here is the sea, vast and wide,
PSA.104.25	teeming with creatures beyond number —
PSA.104.25	living things both large and small.
PSA.104.26	There the ships move about,
PSA.104.26	and Leviathan, which you formed to play there.
PSA.104.27	All of them wait for you
PSA.104.27	to give them their food at the right time.
PSA.104.28	When you give it to them,
PSA.104.28	they gather it;
PSA.104.28	when you open your hand,
PSA.104.28	they are satisfied with good things.
PSA.104.29	When you hide your face,
PSA.104.29	they are terrified;
PSA.104.29	when you take away their breath,
PSA.104.29	they die and return to the dust.
PSA.104.30	When you send your breath,
PSA.104.30	they are created,
PSA.104.30	and you renew the surface of the ground.
PSA.104.31	May the glory of the 
PSA.104.31	may the 
PSA.104.32	He looks at the earth, and it trembles;
PSA.104.32	he touches the mountains,
PSA.104.32	and they pour out smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing to the 
PSA.104.33	I will sing praise to my God while I live.
PSA.104.34	May my meditation be pleasing to him;
PSA.104.34	I will rejoice in the 
PSA.104.35	May sinners vanish from the earth
PSA.104.35	and wicked people be no more.
PSA.104.35	My soul, bless the 
PSA.104.35	Hallelujah!
PSA.105.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.105.1	proclaim his deeds among the peoples.
PSA.105.2	Sing to him, sing praise to him;
PSA.105.2	tell about all his wondrous works!
PSA.105.3	Honor his holy name;
PSA.105.3	let the hearts of those who seek the 
PSA.105.4	Seek the 
PSA.105.4	seek his face always.
PSA.105.5	Remember the wondrous works he has done,
PSA.105.5	his wonders, and the judgments he has pronounced,
PSA.105.6	you offspring of Abraham his servant,
PSA.105.6	Jacob’s descendants — his chosen ones.
PSA.105.7	He is the 
PSA.105.7	his judgments govern the whole earth.
PSA.105.8	He remembers his covenant forever,
PSA.105.8	the promise he ordained
PSA.105.8	for a thousand generations
PSA.105.9	the covenant he made with Abraham,
PSA.105.9	swore
PSA.105.10	and confirmed to Jacob as a decree
PSA.105.10	and to Israel as a permanent covenant:
PSA.105.11	“I will give the land of Canaan to you
PSA.105.11	as your inherited portion.”
PSA.105.12	When they were few in number,
PSA.105.12	very few indeed,
PSA.105.12	and resident aliens in Canaan,
PSA.105.13	wandering from nation to nation
PSA.105.13	and from one kingdom to another,
PSA.105.14	he allowed no one to oppress them;
PSA.105.14	he rebuked kings on their behalf:
PSA.105.15	“Do not touch my anointed ones,
PSA.105.15	or harm my prophets.”
PSA.105.16	He called down famine against the land
PSA.105.16	and destroyed the entire food supply.
PSA.105.17	He had sent a man ahead of them —
PSA.105.17	Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
PSA.105.18	They hurt his feet with shackles;
PSA.105.18	his neck was put in an iron collar.
PSA.105.19	Until the time his prediction came true,
PSA.105.19	the word of the 
PSA.105.20	The king sent for him and released him;
PSA.105.20	the ruler of peoples set him free.
PSA.105.21	He made him master of his household,
PSA.105.21	ruler over all his possessions
PSA.105.22	binding
PSA.105.22	and instructing his elders.
PSA.105.23	Then Israel went to Egypt;
PSA.105.23	Jacob lived as an alien in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	The 
PSA.105.24	he made them more numerous than their foes,
PSA.105.25	whose hearts he turned to hate his people
PSA.105.25	and to deal deceptively with his servants.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses his servant,
PSA.105.26	and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
PSA.105.27	They performed his miraculous signs among them,
PSA.105.27	and wonders in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness, and it became dark —
PSA.105.28	for did they not defy his commands?
PSA.105.29	He turned their water into blood
PSA.105.29	and caused their fish to die.
PSA.105.30	Their land was overrun with frogs,
PSA.105.30	even in their royal chambers.
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and insects came
PSA.105.31	gnats throughout their country.
PSA.105.32	He gave them hail for rain,
PSA.105.32	and lightning throughout their land.
PSA.105.33	He struck their vines and fig trees
PSA.105.33	and shattered the trees of their territory.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and locusts came —
PSA.105.34	young locusts without number.
PSA.105.35	They devoured all the vegetation in their land
PSA.105.35	and consumed the produce of their land.
PSA.105.36	He struck all the firstborn in their land,
PSA.105.36	all their first progeny.
PSA.105.37	Then he brought Israel out with silver and gold,
PSA.105.37	and no one among his tribes stumbled.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they left,
PSA.105.38	for the dread of Israel
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud as a covering
PSA.105.39	and gave a fire to light up the night.
PSA.105.40	They asked, and he brought quail
PSA.105.40	and satisfied them with bread from heaven.
PSA.105.41	He opened a rock, and water gushed out;
PSA.105.41	it flowed like a stream in the desert.
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy promise
PSA.105.42	to Abraham his servant.
PSA.105.43	He brought his people out with rejoicing,
PSA.105.43	his chosen ones with shouts of joy.
PSA.105.44	He gave them the lands of the nations,
PSA.105.44	and they inherited
PSA.105.44	what other peoples had worked for.
PSA.105.45	All this happened
PSA.105.45	so that they might keep his statutes
PSA.105.45	and obey his instructions.
PSA.105.45	Hallelujah!
PSA.106.1	Hallelujah!
PSA.106.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.106.1	his faithful love endures forever.
PSA.106.2	Who can declare the 
PSA.106.2	or proclaim all the praise due him?
PSA.106.3	How happy are those who uphold justice,
PSA.106.3	who practice righteousness at all times.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, 
PSA.106.4	when you show favor to your people.
PSA.106.4	Come to me with your salvation
PSA.106.5	so that I may enjoy the prosperity
PSA.106.5	of your chosen ones,
PSA.106.5	rejoice in the joy of your nation,
PSA.106.5	and boast about your heritage.
PSA.106.6	Both we and our fathers have sinned;
PSA.106.6	we have done wrong and have acted wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers in Egypt did not grasp
PSA.106.7	the significance of your wondrous works
PSA.106.7	or remember your many acts of faithful love;
PSA.106.7	instead, they rebelled by the sea — the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	Yet he saved them for his name’s sake,
PSA.106.8	to make his power known.
PSA.106.9	He rebuked the Red Sea, and it dried up;
PSA.106.9	he led them through the depths as through a desert.
PSA.106.10	He saved them from the power of the adversary;
PSA.106.10	he redeemed them from the power of the enemy.
PSA.106.11	Water covered their foes;
PSA.106.11	not one of them remained.
PSA.106.12	Then they believed his promises
PSA.106.12	and sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	They soon forgot his works
PSA.106.13	and would not wait for his counsel.
PSA.106.14	They were seized with craving in the wilderness
PSA.106.14	and tested God in the desert.
PSA.106.15	He gave them what they asked for,
PSA.106.15	but sent a wasting disease among them.
PSA.106.16	In the camp they were envious of Moses
PSA.106.16	and of Aaron, the 
PSA.106.17	The earth opened up and swallowed Dathan;
PSA.106.17	it covered the assembly of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	Fire blazed throughout their assembly;
PSA.106.18	flames consumed the wicked.
PSA.106.19	At Horeb they made a calf
PSA.106.19	and worshiped the cast metal image.
PSA.106.20	They exchanged their glory
PSA.106.20	for the image of a grass-eating ox.
PSA.106.21	They forgot God their Savior,
PSA.106.21	who did great things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	wondrous works in the land of Ham,
PSA.106.22	awe-inspiring acts at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	So he said he would have destroyed them —
PSA.106.23	if Moses his chosen one
PSA.106.23	had not stood before him in the breach
PSA.106.23	to turn his wrath away from destroying them.
PSA.106.24	They despised the pleasant land
PSA.106.24	and did not believe his promise.
PSA.106.25	They grumbled in their tents
PSA.106.25	and did not listen to the 
PSA.106.26	So he raised his hand against them with an oath
PSA.106.26	that he would make them fall in the desert
PSA.106.27	and would disperse their descendants
PSA.106.27	among the nations,
PSA.106.27	scattering them throughout the lands.
PSA.106.28	They aligned themselves with Baal of Peor
PSA.106.28	and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods.
PSA.106.29	They angered the 
PSA.106.29	and a plague broke out against them.
PSA.106.30	But Phinehas stood up and intervened,
PSA.106.30	and the plague was stopped.
PSA.106.31	It was credited to him as righteousness
PSA.106.31	throughout all generations to come.
PSA.106.32	They angered the 
PSA.106.32	and Moses suffered
PSA.106.33	for they embittered his spirit,
PSA.106.33	and he spoke rashly with his lips.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the peoples
PSA.106.34	as the 
PSA.106.35	but mingled with the nations
PSA.106.35	and adopted their ways.
PSA.106.36	They served their idols,
PSA.106.36	which became a snare to them.
PSA.106.37	They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons.
PSA.106.38	They shed innocent blood —
PSA.106.38	the blood of their sons and daughters
PSA.106.38	whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan;
PSA.106.38	so the land became polluted with blood.
PSA.106.39	They defiled themselves by their actions
PSA.106.39	and prostituted themselves by their deeds.
PSA.106.40	Therefore the 
PSA.106.40	and he abhorred his own inheritance.
PSA.106.41	He handed them over to the nations;
PSA.106.41	those who hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies oppressed them,
PSA.106.42	and they were subdued under their power.
PSA.106.43	He rescued them many times,
PSA.106.43	but they continued to rebel deliberately
PSA.106.43	and were beaten down by their iniquity.
PSA.106.44	When he heard their cry,
PSA.106.44	he took note of their distress,
PSA.106.45	remembered his covenant with them,
PSA.106.45	and relented according to the abundance
PSA.106.45	of his faithful love.
PSA.106.46	He caused them to be pitied
PSA.106.46	before all their captors.
PSA.106.47	Save us, 
PSA.106.47	and gather us from the nations,
PSA.106.47	so that we may give thanks to your holy name
PSA.106.47	and rejoice in your praise.
PSA.106.48	Blessed be the 
PSA.106.48	from everlasting to everlasting.
PSA.106.48	Let all the people say, “Amen!”
PSA.106.48	Hallelujah!
PSA.107.1	Give thanks to the 
PSA.107.1	his faithful love endures forever.
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the 
PSA.107.2	that he has redeemed them from the power of the foe
PSA.107.3	and has gathered them from the lands —
PSA.107.3	from the east and the west,
PSA.107.3	from the north and the south.
PSA.107.4	Some
PSA.107.4	finding no way to a city where they could live.
PSA.107.5	They were hungry and thirsty;
PSA.107.5	their spirits failed
PSA.107.6	Then they cried out to the 
PSA.107.6	he rescued them from their distress.
PSA.107.7	He led them by the right path
PSA.107.7	to go to a city where they could live.
PSA.107.8	Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.8	for his faithful love
PSA.107.8	and his wondrous works for all humanity.
PSA.107.9	For he has satisfied the thirsty
PSA.107.9	and filled the hungry with good things.
PSA.107.10	Others sat in darkness and gloom
PSA.107.10	prisoners in cruel chains
PSA.107.11	because they rebelled against God’s commands
PSA.107.11	and despised the counsel of the Most High.
PSA.107.12	He broke their spirits
PSA.107.12	they stumbled, and there was no one to help.
PSA.107.13	Then they cried out to the 
PSA.107.13	he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and gloom
PSA.107.14	and broke their chains apart.
PSA.107.15	Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.15	for his faithful love
PSA.107.15	and his wondrous works for all humanity.
PSA.107.16	For he has broken down the bronze gates
PSA.107.16	and cut through the iron bars.
PSA.107.17	Fools suffered affliction
PSA.107.17	because of their rebellious ways and their iniquities.
PSA.107.18	They loathed all food
PSA.107.18	and came near the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cried out to the 
PSA.107.19	he saved them from their distress.
PSA.107.20	He sent his word and healed them;
PSA.107.20	he rescued them from the Pit.
PSA.107.21	Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.21	for his faithful love
PSA.107.21	and his wondrous works for all humanity.
PSA.107.22	Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving
PSA.107.22	and announce his works with shouts of joy.
PSA.107.23	Others went to sea in ships,
PSA.107.23	conducting trade on the vast water.
PSA.107.24	They saw the 
PSA.107.24	his wondrous works in the deep.
PSA.107.25	He spoke and raised a stormy wind
PSA.107.25	that stirred up the waves of the sea.
PSA.107.26	Rising up to the sky, sinking down to the depths,
PSA.107.26	their courage
PSA.107.27	they reeled and staggered like a drunkard,
PSA.107.27	and all their skill was useless.
PSA.107.28	Then they cried out to the 
PSA.107.28	and he brought them out of their distress.
PSA.107.29	He stilled the storm to a whisper,
PSA.107.29	and the waves of the sea
PSA.107.30	They rejoiced when the waves
PSA.107.30	Then he guided them to the harbor they longed for.
PSA.107.31	Let them give thanks to the 
PSA.107.31	for his faithful love
PSA.107.31	and his wondrous works for all humanity.
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people
PSA.107.32	and praise him in the council of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turns rivers into desert,
PSA.107.33	springs into thirsty ground,
PSA.107.34	and fruitful land into salty wasteland,
PSA.107.34	because of the wickedness of its inhabitants.
PSA.107.35	He turns a desert into a pool,
PSA.107.35	dry land into springs.
PSA.107.36	He causes the hungry to settle there,
PSA.107.36	and they establish a city where they can live.
PSA.107.37	They sow fields and plant vineyards
PSA.107.37	that yield a fruitful harvest.
PSA.107.38	He blesses them, and they multiply greatly;
PSA.107.38	he does not let their livestock decrease.
PSA.107.39	When they are diminished and are humbled
PSA.107.39	by cruel oppression and sorrow,
PSA.107.40	he pours contempt on nobles
PSA.107.40	and makes them wander in a trackless wasteland.
PSA.107.41	But he lifts the needy out of their suffering
PSA.107.41	and makes their families multiply like flocks.
PSA.107.42	The upright see it and rejoice,
PSA.107.42	and all injustice shuts its mouth.
PSA.107.43	Let whoever is wise pay attention to these things
PSA.107.43	and consider the 
PSA.108.1	My heart is confident, God;
PSA.108.1	I will sing; I will sing praises
PSA.108.1	with the whole of my being.
PSA.108.2	Wake up, harp and lyre!
PSA.108.2	I will wake up the dawn.
PSA.108.3	I will praise you, 
PSA.108.3	I will sing praises to you among the nations.
PSA.108.4	For your faithful love is higher than the heavens,
PSA.108.4	and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
PSA.108.5	God, be exalted above the heavens,
PSA.108.5	and let your glory be over the whole earth.
PSA.108.6	Save with your right hand and answer me
PSA.108.6	so that those you love may be rescued.
PSA.108.7	God has spoken in his sanctuary:
PSA.108.7	“I will celebrate!
PSA.108.7	I will divide up Shechem.
PSA.108.7	I will apportion the Valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine,
PSA.108.8	and Ephraim is my helmet;
PSA.108.8	Judah is my scepter.
PSA.108.9	Moab is my washbasin;
PSA.108.9	I throw my sandal on Edom.
PSA.108.9	I shout in triumph over Philistia.”
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me to the fortified city?
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	God, haven’t you rejected us?
PSA.108.11	God, you do not march out with our armies.
PSA.108.12	Give us aid against the foe,
PSA.108.12	for human help is worthless.
PSA.108.13	With God we will perform valiantly;
PSA.108.13	he will trample our foes.
PSA.109.1	God of my praise, do not be silent.
PSA.109.2	For wicked and deceitful mouths open against me;
PSA.109.2	they speak against me with lying tongues.
PSA.109.3	They surround me with hateful words
PSA.109.3	and attack me without cause.
PSA.109.4	In return for my love they accuse me,
PSA.109.4	but I continue to pray.
PSA.109.5	They repay me evil for good,
PSA.109.5	and hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Set a wicked person over him;
PSA.109.6	let an accuser
PSA.109.7	When he is judged, let him be found guilty,
PSA.109.7	and let his prayer be counted as sin.
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few;
PSA.109.8	let another take over his position.
PSA.109.9	Let his children be fatherless
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Let his children wander as beggars,
PSA.109.10	searching for food far
PSA.109.11	Let a creditor seize all he has;
PSA.109.11	let strangers plunder what he has worked for.
PSA.109.12	Let no one show him kindness,
PSA.109.12	and let no one be gracious to his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let the line of his descendants be cut off;
PSA.109.13	let their name be blotted out in the next generation.
PSA.109.14	Let the iniquity of his fathers
PSA.109.14	be remembered before the 
PSA.109.14	and do not let his mother’s sin be blotted out.
PSA.109.15	Let their sins
PSA.109.15	and let him remove
PSA.109.16	For he did not think to show kindness,
PSA.109.16	but pursued the suffering, needy, and brokenhearted
PSA.109.16	in order to put them to death.
PSA.109.17	He loved cursing — let it fall on him;
PSA.109.17	he took no delight in blessing — let it be far from him.
PSA.109.18	He wore cursing like his coat —
PSA.109.18	let it enter his body like water
PSA.109.18	and go into his bones like oil.
PSA.109.19	Let it be like a robe he wraps around himself,
PSA.109.19	like a belt he always wears.
PSA.109.20	Let this be the 
PSA.109.20	to those who speak evil against me.
PSA.109.21	But you, 
PSA.109.21	deal kindly with me for your name’s sake;
PSA.109.21	because your faithful love is good, rescue me.
PSA.109.22	For I am suffering and needy;
PSA.109.22	my heart is wounded within me.
PSA.109.23	I fade away like a lengthening shadow;
PSA.109.23	I am shaken off like a locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak from fasting,
PSA.109.24	and my body is emaciated.
PSA.109.25	I have become an object of ridicule to my accusers;
PSA.109.25	when they see me, they shake their heads in scorn.
PSA.109.26	Help me, 
PSA.109.26	save me according to your faithful love
PSA.109.27	so they may know that this is your hand
PSA.109.27	and that you, 
PSA.109.28	Though they curse, you will bless.
PSA.109.28	When they rise up, they will be put to shame,
PSA.109.28	but your servant will rejoice.
PSA.109.29	My accusers will be clothed with disgrace;
PSA.109.29	they will wear their shame like a cloak.
PSA.109.30	I will fervently thank the 
PSA.109.30	I will praise him in the presence of many.
PSA.109.31	For he stands at the right hand of the needy
PSA.109.31	to save him from those who would condemn him.
PSA.110.1	This is the declaration of the 
PSA.110.1	to my Lord:
PSA.110.1	“Sit at my right hand
PSA.110.1	until I make your enemies your footstool.”
PSA.110.2	The 
PSA.110.2	Rule
PSA.110.3	Your people will volunteer
PSA.110.3	on your day of battle.
PSA.110.3	In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn,
PSA.110.3	the dew of your youth belongs to you.
PSA.110.4	The 
PSA.110.4	“You are a priest forever
PSA.110.4	according to the pattern of Melchizedek.”
PSA.110.5	The Lord is at your right hand;
PSA.110.5	he will crush kings on the day of his anger.
PSA.110.6	He will judge the nations, heaping up corpses;
PSA.110.6	he will crush leaders over the entire world.
PSA.110.7	He will drink from the brook by the road;
PSA.110.7	therefore, he will lift up his head.
PSA.111.1	Hallelujah!
PSA.111.1	I will praise the 
PSA.111.1	in the assembly of the upright and in the congregation.
PSA.111.2	The 
PSA.111.2	studied by all who delight in them.
PSA.111.3	All that he does is splendid and majestic;

PSA.111.8	enacted in truth and in uprightness.
PSA.111.9	He has sent redemption to his people.
PSA.111.9	He has ordained his covenant forever.
PSA.111.9	His name is holy and awe-inspiring.
PSA.111.10	The fear of the 
PSA.111.10	all who follow his instructions
PSA.111.10	His praise endures forever.
PSA.112.1	Hallelujah!
PSA.112.1	Happy is the person who fears the 
PSA.112.1	taking great delight in his commands.
PSA.112.2	His descendants will be powerful in the land;
PSA.112.2	the generation of the upright will be blessed.
PSA.112.3	Wealth and riches are in his house,
PSA.112.3	and his righteousness endures forever.
PSA.112.4	Light shines in the darkness for the upright.
PSA.112.4	He is gracious, compassionate, and righteous.
PSA.112.5	Good will come to the one who lends generously
PSA.112.5	and conducts his business fairly.
PSA.112.6	He will never be shaken.
PSA.112.6	The righteous one will be remembered forever.
PSA.112.7	He will not fear bad news;
PSA.112.7	his heart is confident, trusting in the 
PSA.112.8	His heart is assured; he will not fear.
PSA.112.8	In the end he will look in triumph on his foes.
PSA.112.9	He distributes freely to the poor;

PSA.113.5	Who is like the 
PSA.113.5	the one enthroned on high,
PSA.113.6	who stoops down to look
PSA.113.6	on the heavens and the earth?
PSA.113.7	He raises the poor from the dust
PSA.113.7	and lifts the needy from the trash heap
PSA.113.8	in order to seat them with nobles —
PSA.113.8	with the nobles of his people.
PSA.113.9	He gives the childless woman a household,

PSA.114.1	When Israel came out of Egypt —
PSA.114.1	the house of Jacob from a people
PSA.114.1	who spoke a foreign language
PSA.114.2	Judah became his sanctuary,
PSA.114.2	Israel, his dominion.
PSA.114.3	The sea looked and fled;
PSA.114.3	the Jordan turned back.
PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams,
PSA.114.4	the hills, like lambs.
PSA.114.5	Why was it, sea, that you fled?
PSA.114.5	Jordan, that you turned back?
PSA.114.6	Mountains, that you skipped like rams?
PSA.114.6	Hills, like lambs?
PSA.114.7	Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord,
PSA.114.7	at the presence of the God of Jacob,
PSA.114.8	who turned the rock into a pool,
PSA.114.8	the flint into a spring.
PSA.115.1	Not to us, 
PSA.115.1	but to your name give glory
PSA.115.1	because of your faithful love, because of your truth.
PSA.115.2	Why should the nations say,
PSA.115.2	“Where is their God?” 
PSA.115.3	Our God is in heaven
PSA.115.3	and does whatever he pleases.
PSA.115.4	Their idols are silver and gold,
PSA.115.4	made by human hands.
PSA.115.5	They have mouths but cannot speak,
PSA.115.5	eyes, but cannot see.
PSA.115.6	They have ears but cannot hear,
PSA.115.6	noses, but cannot smell.
PSA.115.7	They have hands but cannot feel,
PSA.115.7	feet, but cannot walk.
PSA.115.7	They cannot make a sound with their throats.
PSA.115.8	Those who make them are
PSA.115.8	as are all who trust in them.
PSA.115.9	Israel,
PSA.115.9	He is their help and shield.
PSA.115.10	House of Aaron, trust in the 
PSA.115.10	He is their help and shield.
PSA.115.11	You who fear the 
PSA.115.11	He is their help and shield.
PSA.115.12	The 
PSA.115.12	He will bless the house of Israel;
PSA.115.12	he will bless the house of Aaron;
PSA.115.13	he will bless those who fear the 
PSA.115.13	small and great alike.
PSA.115.14	May the 
PSA.115.14	both yours and your children’s.
PSA.115.15	May you be blessed by the 
PSA.115.15	the Maker of heaven and earth.
PSA.115.16	The heavens are the 
PSA.115.16	but the earth he has given to the human race.
PSA.115.17	It is not the dead who praise the 
PSA.115.17	nor any of those descending into the silence of death.
PSA.115.18	But we will bless the 
PSA.115.18	both now and forever.
PSA.115.18	Hallelujah!
PSA.116.1	I love the 
PSA.116.1	my appeal for mercy.
PSA.116.2	Because he has turned his ear to me,
PSA.116.2	I will call out to him as long as I live.
PSA.116.3	The ropes of death were wrapped around me,
PSA.116.3	and the torments of Sheol overcame me;
PSA.116.3	I encountered trouble and sorrow.
PSA.116.4	Then I called on the name of the 
PSA.116.4	“
PSA.116.5	The 
PSA.116.5	our God is compassionate.
PSA.116.6	The 
PSA.116.6	I was helpless, and he saved me.

PSA.116.7	for the

PSA.116.8	my eyes from tears,
PSA.116.8	my feet from stumbling.
PSA.116.9	I will walk before the 
PSA.116.9	in the land of the living.
PSA.116.10	I believed, even when I said,
PSA.116.10	“I am severely oppressed.”
PSA.116.11	In my alarm I said,
PSA.116.11	“Everyone is a liar.”
PSA.116.12	How can I repay the 
PSA.116.12	for all the good he has done for me?
PSA.116.13	I will take the cup of salvation
PSA.116.13	and call on the name of the 
PSA.116.14	I will fulfill my vows to the 
PSA.116.14	in the presence of all his people.
PSA.116.15	The death of his faithful ones
PSA.116.15	is valuable in the 
PSA.116.16	I am your servant, the son of your female servant.
PSA.116.16	You have loosened my bonds.
PSA.116.17	I will offer you a sacrifice of thanksgiving
PSA.116.17	and call on the name of the 
PSA.116.18	I will fulfill my vows to the 
PSA.116.18	in the presence of all his people,

PSA.118.3	Let the house of Aaron say,
PSA.118.3	“His faithful love endures forever.”
PSA.118.4	Let those who fear the 
PSA.118.4	“His faithful love endures forever.”
PSA.118.5	I called to the 
PSA.118.5	the 
PSA.118.5	and put me in a spacious place.
PSA.118.6	The 
PSA.118.6	What can a mere mortal do to me?
PSA.118.7	The 
PSA.118.7	Therefore, I will look in triumph on those who hate me.
PSA.118.8	It is better to take refuge in the 
PSA.118.8	than to trust in humanity.
PSA.118.9	It is better to take refuge in the 
PSA.118.9	than to trust in nobles.
PSA.118.10	All the nations surrounded me;
PSA.118.10	in the name of the 
PSA.118.11	They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me;
PSA.118.11	in the name of the

PSA.119.21	who wander from your commands.
PSA.119.22	Take insult and contempt away from me,
PSA.119.22	for I have kept your decrees.
PSA.119.23	Though princes sit together speaking against me,
PSA.119.23	your servant will think about your statutes;
PSA.119.24	your decrees are my delight
PSA.119.24	and my counselors.
PSA.119.25	My life is down in the dust;
PSA.119.25	give me life
PSA.119.26	I told you about my life,
PSA.119.26	and you answered me;
PSA.119.26	teach me your statutes.
PSA.119.27	Help me understand
PSA.119.27	the meaning of your precepts
PSA.119.27	so that I can meditate on your wonders.
PSA.119.28	I am weary
PSA.119.28	strengthen me through your word.
PSA.119.29	Keep me from the way of deceit
PSA.119.29	and graciously give me your instruction.
PSA.119.30	I have chosen the way of truth;
PSA.119.30	I have set your ordinances before me.
PSA.119.31	I cling to your decrees;
PSA.119.32	I pursue the way of your commands,
PSA.119.32	for you broaden my understanding.
PSA.119.33	Teach me, 
PSA.119.33	and I will always keep them.
PSA.119.34	Help me understand your instruction,
PSA.119.34	and I will obey it
PSA.119.34	and follow it with all my heart.
PSA.119.35	Help me stay on the path of your commands,
PSA.119.35	for I take pleasure in it.
PSA.119.36	Turn my heart to your decrees
PSA.119.36	and not to dishonest profit.
PSA.119.37	Turn my eyes
PSA.119.37	from looking at what is worthless;
PSA.119.37	give me life in your ways.
PSA.119.38	Confirm what you said to your servant,
PSA.119.38	for it produces reverence for you.
PSA.119.39	Turn away the disgrace I dread;
PSA.119.39	indeed, your judgments are good.
PSA.119.40	How I long for your precepts!
PSA.119.40	Give me life through your righteousness.
PSA.119.41	Let your faithful love come to me, 
PSA.119.41	your salvation, as you promised.
PSA.119.42	Then I can answer the one who taunts me,
PSA.119.42	for I trust in your word.
PSA.119.43	Never take the word of truth from my mouth,
PSA.119.43	for I hope in your judgments.
PSA.119.44	I will always obey your instruction,
PSA.119.44	forever and ever.
PSA.119.45	I will walk freely in an open place
PSA.119.45	because I study your precepts.
PSA.119.46	I will speak of your decrees before kings
PSA.119.46	and not be ashamed.
PSA.119.47	I delight in your commands,
PSA.119.47	which I love.
PSA.119.48	I will lift up my hands
PSA.119.48	which I love,
PSA.119.48	and will meditate on your statutes.
PSA.119.49	Remember your word to your servant;
PSA.119.49	you have given me hope through it.
PSA.119.50	This is my comfort in my affliction:
PSA.119.50	Your promise has given me life.
PSA.119.51	The arrogant constantly ridicule me,
PSA.119.51	but I do not turn away from your instruction.
PSA.119.52	and find comfort.
PSA.119.53	Rage seizes me
PSA.119.53	who reject your instruction.
PSA.119.54	Your statutes are the theme of my song
PSA.119.54	during my earthly life.
PSA.119.55	and I obey your instruction.
PSA.119.56	This is my practice:
PSA.119.56	I obey your precepts.
PSA.119.57	The 
PSA.119.57	I have promised to keep your words.
PSA.119.58	I have sought your favor
PSA.119.58	be gracious to me
PSA.119.59	I thought about my ways
PSA.119.59	and turned my steps back to your decrees.
PSA.119.60	I hurried, not hesitating
PSA.119.60	to keep your commands.
PSA.119.61	Though the ropes of the wicked
PSA.119.61	were wrapped around me,
PSA.119.61	I did not forget your instruction.
PSA.119.62	I rise at midnight to thank you
PSA.119.62	for your righteous judgments.
PSA.119.63	I am a friend to all who fear you,
PSA.119.63	to those who keep your precepts.
PSA.119.64	teach me your statutes.
PSA.119.65	just as you promised.
PSA.119.66	Teach me good judgment and discernment,
PSA.119.66	for I rely on your commands.
PSA.119.67	Before I was afflicted I went astray,
PSA.119.67	but now I keep your word.
PSA.119.68	You are good,
PSA.119.68	teach me your statutes.
PSA.119.69	The arrogant have smeared me with lies,
PSA.119.69	but I obey your precepts with all my heart.
PSA.119.70	Their hearts are hard and insensitive,
PSA.119.70	but I delight in your instruction.
PSA.119.71	It was good for me to be afflicted
PSA.119.71	so that I could learn your statutes.
PSA.119.72	Instruction from your lips
PSA.119.72	than thousands of gold and silver pieces.
PSA.119.73	Your hands made me and formed me;
PSA.119.73	give me understanding
PSA.119.73	so that I can learn your commands.
PSA.119.74	Those who fear you will see me and rejoice,
PSA.119.74	for I put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.75	I know, 
PSA.119.75	and that you have afflicted me fairly.
PSA.119.76	May your faithful love comfort me
PSA.119.76	as you promised your servant.
PSA.119.77	May your compassion come to me
PSA.119.77	so that I may live,
PSA.119.77	for your instruction is my delight.
PSA.119.78	Let the arrogant be put to shame
PSA.119.78	for slandering me with lies;
PSA.119.78	I will meditate on your precepts.
PSA.119.79	Let those who fear you,
PSA.119.79	those who know your decrees, turn to me.
PSA.119.80	May my heart be blameless regarding your statutes
PSA.119.80	so that I will not be put to shame.
PSA.119.81	I long for your salvation;
PSA.119.81	I put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.82	My eyes grow weary
PSA.119.82	looking for what you have promised;
PSA.119.82	I ask, “When will you comfort me?”
PSA.119.83	Though I have become like a wineskin dried by smoke,
PSA.119.83	I do not forget your statutes.
PSA.119.84	How many days must your servant wait?
PSA.119.84	When will you execute judgment on my persecutors?
PSA.119.85	The arrogant have dug pits for me;
PSA.119.85	they violate your instruction.
PSA.119.86	All your commands are true;
PSA.119.86	people persecute me with lies — help me!
PSA.119.87	They almost ended my life on earth,
PSA.119.87	but I did not abandon your precepts.
PSA.119.88	Give me life in accordance with your faithful love,
PSA.119.88	and I will obey the decree you have spoken.
PSA.119.89	it is firmly fixed in heaven.
PSA.119.90	Your faithfulness is for all generations;
PSA.119.90	you established the earth, and it stands firm.
PSA.119.91	Your judgments stand firm today,
PSA.119.91	for all things are your servants.
PSA.119.92	If your instruction had not been my delight,
PSA.119.92	I would have died in my affliction.
PSA.119.93	I will never forget your precepts,
PSA.119.93	for you have given me life through them.
PSA.119.94	I am yours; save me,
PSA.119.94	for I have studied your precepts.
PSA.119.95	The wicked hope to destroy me,
PSA.119.95	but I contemplate your decrees.
PSA.119.96	I have seen a limit to all perfection,
PSA.119.96	but your command is without limit.
PSA.119.97	How I love your instruction!
PSA.119.97	It is my meditation all day long.
PSA.119.98	Your commands make me wiser than my enemies,
PSA.119.98	for they are always with me.
PSA.119.99	I have more insight than all my teachers
PSA.119.99	because your decrees are my meditation.
PSA.119.100	I understand more than the elders
PSA.119.100	because I obey your precepts.
PSA.119.101	I have kept my feet from every evil path
PSA.119.101	to follow your word.
PSA.119.102	I have not turned from your judgments,
PSA.119.102	for you yourself have instructed me.
PSA.119.103	How sweet your word is
PSA.119.103	sweeter than honey in my mouth.
PSA.119.104	I gain understanding from your precepts;
PSA.119.104	therefore I hate every false way.
PSA.119.105	Your word is a lamp for my feet
PSA.119.105	and a light on my path.
PSA.119.106	I have solemnly sworn
PSA.119.106	to keep your righteous judgments.
PSA.119.107	I am severely afflicted;
PSA.119.108	and teach me your judgments.
PSA.119.109	My life is constantly in danger,
PSA.119.109	yet I do not forget your instruction.
PSA.119.110	The wicked have set a trap for me,
PSA.119.110	but I have not wandered from your precepts.
PSA.119.111	I have your decrees as a heritage forever;
PSA.119.111	indeed, they are the joy of my heart.
PSA.119.112	I am resolved to obey your statutes
PSA.119.112	to the very end.
PSA.119.113	I hate those who are double-minded,
PSA.119.113	but I love your instruction.
PSA.119.114	You are my shelter and my shield;
PSA.119.114	I put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.115	Depart from me,
PSA.119.115	so that I may obey my God’s commands.
PSA.119.116	Sustain me as you promised,
PSA.119.116	do not let me be ashamed of my hope.
PSA.119.117	Sustain me so that I can be safe
PSA.119.117	and always be concerned about your statutes.
PSA.119.118	You reject all who stray from your statutes,
PSA.119.118	for their deceit is a lie.
PSA.119.119	You remove all the wicked on earth
PSA.119.119	as if they were
PSA.119.119	therefore, I love your decrees.
PSA.119.120	I tremble
PSA.119.120	I fear your judgments.
PSA.119.121	I have done what is just and right;
PSA.119.121	do not leave me to my oppressors.
PSA.119.122	Guarantee your servant’s well-being;
PSA.119.122	do not let the arrogant oppress me.
PSA.119.123	My eyes grow weary
PSA.119.123	and for your righteous promise.
PSA.119.124	Deal with your servant based on your faithful love;
PSA.119.124	teach me your statutes.
PSA.119.125	I am your servant;
PSA.119.125	so that I may know your decrees.
PSA.119.126	It is time for the 
PSA.119.126	for they have violated your instruction.
PSA.119.127	Since I love your commands
PSA.119.127	more than gold, even the purest gold,
PSA.119.128	I carefully follow all your precepts
PSA.119.128	and hate every false way.
PSA.119.129	Your decrees are wondrous;
PSA.119.129	therefore I obey them.
PSA.119.130	The revelation of your words
PSA.119.130	and gives understanding to the inexperienced.
PSA.119.131	I open my mouth and pant
PSA.119.131	because I long for your commands.
PSA.119.132	Turn to me and be gracious to me,
PSA.119.132	as is your practice toward those who love your name.
PSA.119.133	Make my steps steady through your promise;
PSA.119.133	don’t let any sin dominate me.
PSA.119.134	Redeem me from human oppression,
PSA.119.134	and I will keep your precepts.
PSA.119.135	Make your face shine on your servant,
PSA.119.135	and teach me your statutes.
PSA.119.136	My eyes pour out streams of tears
PSA.119.136	because people do not follow your instruction.
PSA.119.137	You are righteous, 
PSA.119.137	and your judgments are just.
PSA.119.138	The decrees you issue are righteous
PSA.119.138	and altogether trustworthy.
PSA.119.139	My anger overwhelms me
PSA.119.139	because my foes forget your words.
PSA.119.140	Your word is completely pure,
PSA.119.140	and your servant loves it.
PSA.119.141	I am insignificant and despised,
PSA.119.141	but I do not forget your precepts.
PSA.119.142	Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness,
PSA.119.142	and your instruction is true.
PSA.119.143	Trouble and distress have overtaken me,
PSA.119.143	but your commands are my delight.
PSA.119.144	Your decrees are righteous forever.

PSA.119.145	I will obey your statutes.
PSA.119.146	I call to you; save me,
PSA.119.146	and I will keep your decrees.
PSA.119.147	I rise before dawn and cry out for help;
PSA.119.147	I put my hope in your word.
PSA.119.148	I am awake through each watch of the night
PSA.119.148	to meditate on your promise.
PSA.119.149	In keeping with your faithful love, hear my voice.
PSA.119.150	Those who pursue evil plans
PSA.119.150	they are far from your instruction.
PSA.119.151	You are near, 
PSA.119.151	and all your commands are true.
PSA.119.152	Long ago I learned from your decrees
PSA.119.152	that you have established them forever.
PSA.119.153	Consider my affliction and rescue me,
PSA.119.153	for I have not forgotten your instruction.
PSA.119.154	Champion my cause and redeem me;
PSA.119.154	give me life as you promised.
PSA.119.155	Salvation is far from the wicked
PSA.119.155	because they do not study your statutes.
PSA.119.156	Your compassions are many, 
PSA.119.156	give me life according to your judgments.
PSA.119.157	My persecutors and foes are many.
PSA.119.157	I have not turned from your decrees.
PSA.119.158	I have seen the disloyal
PSA.119.158	because they do not keep your word.
PSA.119.159	Consider how I love your precepts;
PSA.119.160	The entirety of your word is truth,
PSA.119.160	each of your righteous judgments endures forever.
PSA.119.161	Princes have persecuted me without cause,
PSA.119.161	but my heart fears only your word.
PSA.119.162	I rejoice over your promise
PSA.119.162	like one who finds vast treasure.
PSA.119.163	I hate and abhor falsehood,
PSA.119.163	but I love your instruction.
PSA.119.164	I praise you seven times a day
PSA.119.164	for your righteous judgments.
PSA.119.165	Abundant peace belongs to those
PSA.119.165	who love your instruction;
PSA.119.165	nothing makes them stumble.
PSA.119.166	and carry out your commands.
PSA.119.167	I obey your decrees
PSA.119.167	and love them greatly.
PSA.119.168	I obey your precepts and decrees,
PSA.119.168	for all my ways are before you.
PSA.119.169	Let my cry reach you, 
PSA.119.169	give me understanding according to your word.
PSA.119.170	Let my plea reach you;
PSA.119.170	rescue me according to your promise.
PSA.119.171	My lips pour out praise,
PSA.119.171	for you teach me your statutes.
PSA.119.172	My tongue sings about your promise,
PSA.119.172	for all your commands are righteous.
PSA.119.173	May your hand be ready to help me,
PSA.119.173	for I have chosen your precepts.
PSA.119.174	I long for your salvation, 
PSA.119.174	and your instruction is my delight.
PSA.119.175	Let me live, and I will praise you;
PSA.119.175	may your judgments help me.
PSA.119.176	I wander like a lost sheep;
PSA.119.176	seek your servant,
PSA.119.176	for I do not forget your commands.
PSA.120.1	In my distress I called to the 
PSA.120.1	and he answered me.
PSA.120.2	“
PSA.120.2	and a deceitful tongue.”
PSA.120.3	What will he give you,
PSA.120.3	and what will he do to you,
PSA.120.3	you deceitful tongue?
PSA.120.4	A warrior’s sharp arrows
PSA.120.4	with burning charcoal!
PSA.120.5	What misery that I have stayed in Meshech,
PSA.120.5	that I have lived among the tents of Kedar!
PSA.120.6	I have dwelt too long
PSA.120.6	with those who hate peace.
PSA.120.7	I am for peace; but when I speak,
PSA.120.7	they are for war.
PSA.121.1	I lift my eyes toward the mountains.
PSA.121.1	Where will my help come from?
PSA.121.2	My help comes from the 
PSA.121.2	the Maker of heaven and earth.
PSA.121.3	He will not allow your foot to slip;
PSA.121.3	your Protector will not slumber.
PSA.121.4	Indeed, the Protector of Israel
PSA.121.4	does not slumber or sleep.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.5	the 
PSA.121.6	The sun will not strike you by day
PSA.121.6	or the moon by night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.7	he will protect your life.
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.121.8	both now and forever.
PSA.122.1	I rejoiced with those who said to me,
PSA.122.1	“Let us go to the house of the 
PSA.122.2	Our feet were standing
PSA.122.2	within your gates, Jerusalem
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem, built as a city should be,
PSA.122.3	solidly united,
PSA.122.4	where the tribes, the 
PSA.122.4	to give thanks to the name of the 
PSA.122.4	(This is an ordinance for Israel.
PSA.122.5	There, thrones for judgment are placed,
PSA.122.5	thrones of the house of David.
PSA.122.6	Pray for the well-being
PSA.122.6	“May those who love you be secure;
PSA.122.7	may there be peace within your walls,
PSA.122.7	security within your fortresses.”
PSA.122.8	Because of my brothers and friends,
PSA.122.8	I will say, “May peace be in you.”
PSA.122.9	Because of the house of the 
PSA.122.9	I will pursue your prosperity.
PSA.123.1	I lift my eyes to you,
PSA.123.1	the one enthroned in heaven.
PSA.123.2	Like a servant’s eyes on his master’s hand,
PSA.123.2	like a servant girl’s eyes on her mistress’s hand,
PSA.123.2	so our eyes are on the 
PSA.123.2	until he shows us favor.
PSA.123.3	Show us favor, 
PSA.123.3	for we’ve had more than enough contempt.
PSA.123.4	We’ve had more than enough
PSA.123.4	scorn from the arrogant
PSA.123.4	and contempt from the proud.
PSA.124.1	If the 
PSA.124.1	let Israel say —
PSA.124.2	If the 
PSA.124.2	when people attacked us,
PSA.124.3	then they would have swallowed us alive
PSA.124.3	in their burning anger against us.
PSA.124.4	Then the water would have engulfed us;
PSA.124.4	the torrent would have swept over us;
PSA.124.5	the raging water would have swept over us.
PSA.124.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.124.6	who has not let us be ripped apart by their teeth.
PSA.124.7	We have escaped like a bird from the hunter’s net;
PSA.124.7	the net is torn, and we have escaped.
PSA.124.8	Our help is in the name of the 
PSA.124.8	the Maker of heaven and earth.
PSA.125.1	Those who trust in the 
PSA.125.1	It cannot be shaken; it remains forever.
PSA.125.2	The mountains surround Jerusalem
PSA.125.2	and the 
PSA.125.2	both now and forever.
PSA.125.3	The scepter of the wicked will not remain
PSA.125.3	over the land allotted to the righteous,
PSA.125.3	so that the righteous will not apply their hands to injustice.
PSA.125.4	Do what is good, 
PSA.125.4	to those whose hearts are upright.
PSA.125.5	But as for those who turn aside to crooked ways,
PSA.125.5	the 
PSA.125.5	Peace be with Israel.
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.1	we were like those who dream.
PSA.126.2	Our mouths were filled with laughter then,
PSA.126.2	and our tongues with shouts of joy.
PSA.126.2	Then they said among the nations,
PSA.126.2	“The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.3	we were joyful.
PSA.126.4	Restore our fortunes,
PSA.126.4	like watercourses in the Negev.

PSA.126.5	will reap with shouts of joy.
PSA.126.6	Though one goes along weeping,
PSA.126.6	carrying the bag of seed,
PSA.126.6	he will surely come back with shouts of joy,
PSA.126.6	carrying his sheaves.

PSA.127.1	unless the 
PSA.127.1	the watchman stays alert in vain.
PSA.127.2	In vain you get up early and stay up late,
PSA.127.2	working hard to have enough food —  
PSA.127.2	yes, he gives sleep to the one he loves.
PSA.127.3	Sons are indeed a heritage from the 
PSA.127.3	offspring, a reward.
PSA.127.4	Like arrows in the hand of a warrior
PSA.127.4	are the sons born in one’s youth.
PSA.127.5	Happy is the man who has filled his quiver with them.
PSA.127.5	They will never be put to shame
PSA.127.5	when they speak with their enemies at the city gate.
PSA.128.1	How happy is everyone who fears the 
PSA.128.1	who walks in his ways!
PSA.128.2	You will surely eat
PSA.128.2	what your hands have worked for.
PSA.128.2	You will be happy,
PSA.128.2	and it will go well for you.
PSA.128.3	Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
PSA.128.3	within your house,
PSA.128.3	your children, like young olive trees
PSA.128.3	around your table.
PSA.128.4	In this very way
PSA.128.4	the man who fears the 
PSA.128.4	will be blessed.
PSA.128.5	May the 
PSA.128.5	so that you will see the prosperity of Jerusalem
PSA.128.5	all the days of your life
PSA.128.6	and will see your children’s children!
PSA.128.6	Peace be with Israel.
PSA.129.1	Since my youth they have often attacked me —
PSA.129.1	let Israel say —
PSA.129.2	Since my youth they have often attacked me,
PSA.129.2	but they have not prevailed against me.
PSA.129.3	Plowmen plowed over my back;
PSA.129.3	they made their furrows long.
PSA.129.4	The 
PSA.129.4	he has cut the ropes of the wicked.
PSA.129.5	Let all who hate Zion
PSA.129.5	be driven back in disgrace.
PSA.129.6	Let them be like grass on the rooftops,
PSA.129.6	which withers before it grows up
PSA.129.7	and can’t even fill the hands of the reaper
PSA.129.7	or the arms of the one who binds sheaves.
PSA.129.8	Then none who pass by will say,
PSA.129.8	“May the 
PSA.129.8	We bless you in the name of the 
PSA.130.1	Out of the depths I call to you, 
PSA.130.2	Lord, listen to my voice;
PSA.130.2	let your ears be attentive
PSA.130.2	to my cry for help.
PSA.130.3	Lord, who could stand?
PSA.130.4	But with you there is forgiveness,
PSA.130.4	so that you may be revered.
PSA.130.5	I wait for the 
PSA.130.5	and put my hope in his word.
PSA.130.6	I wait for the Lord
PSA.130.6	more than watchmen for the morning —
PSA.130.6	more than watchmen for the morning.
PSA.130.7	Israel, put your hope in the 
PSA.130.7	For there is faithful love with the 
PSA.130.7	and with him is redemption in abundance.
PSA.130.8	And he will redeem Israel
PSA.130.8	from all its iniquities.
PSA.131.1	my eyes are not haughty.
PSA.131.1	I do not get involved with things
PSA.131.1	too great or too wondrous for me.
PSA.131.2	Instead, I have calmed and quieted my soul
PSA.131.2	like a weaned child with its mother;
PSA.131.2	my soul is like a weaned child.
PSA.131.3	Israel, put your hope in the 
PSA.131.3	both now and forever.
PSA.132.1	and all the hardships he endured,
PSA.132.2	and how he swore an oath to the 
PSA.132.2	making a vow to the Mighty One of Jacob:
PSA.132.3	“I will not enter my house
PSA.132.3	or get into my bed,
PSA.132.4	I will not allow my eyes to sleep
PSA.132.4	or my eyelids to slumber
PSA.132.5	until I find a place for the 
PSA.132.5	a dwelling for the Mighty One of Jacob.”
PSA.132.6	We heard of the ark in Ephrathah;
PSA.132.6	we found it in the fields of Jaar.
PSA.132.7	Let us go to his dwelling place;
PSA.132.7	let us worship at his footstool.
PSA.132.8	Rise up, 
PSA.132.8	you and your powerful ark.
PSA.132.9	May your priests be clothed with righteousness,
PSA.132.9	and may your faithful people shout for joy.
PSA.132.10	For the sake of your servant David,
PSA.132.10	do not reject your anointed one.
PSA.132.11	The 
PSA.132.11	a promise he will not abandon:
PSA.132.11	“I will set one of your offspring
PSA.132.11	on your throne.
PSA.132.12	If your sons keep my covenant
PSA.132.12	and my decrees that I will teach them,
PSA.132.12	their sons will also sit on your throne forever.”
PSA.132.13	For the 
PSA.132.13	he has desired it for his home:
PSA.132.14	“This is my resting place forever;
PSA.132.14	I will make my home here
PSA.132.14	because I have desired it.
PSA.132.15	I will abundantly bless its food;
PSA.132.15	I will satisfy its needy with bread.
PSA.132.16	I will clothe its priests with salvation,
PSA.132.16	and its faithful people will shout for joy.
PSA.132.17	There I will make a horn grow for David;
PSA.132.17	I have prepared a lamp for my anointed one.
PSA.132.18	I will clothe his enemies with shame,
PSA.132.18	but the crown he wears
PSA.133.1	How good and pleasant it is
PSA.133.1	when brothers live together in harmony!
PSA.133.2	It is like fine oil on the head,
PSA.133.2	running down on the beard,
PSA.133.2	running down Aaron’s beard
PSA.133.2	onto his robes.
PSA.133.3	It is like the dew of Hermon
PSA.133.3	falling on the mountains of Zion.
PSA.133.3	For there the 
PSA.133.3	life forevermore.
PSA.134.1	Now bless the

PSA.135.15	made by human hands.
PSA.135.16	They have mouths but cannot speak,
PSA.135.16	eyes, but cannot see.
PSA.135.17	They have ears but cannot hear;
PSA.135.17	indeed, there is no breath in their mouths.
PSA.135.18	Those who make them are just like them,
PSA.135.18	as are all who trust in them.
PSA.135.19	House of Israel, bless the

PSA.136.11	and brought Israel out from among them
PSA.136.12	with a strong hand and outstretched arm.
PSA.136.13	He divided the Red Sea
PSA.136.14	and led Israel through,
PSA.136.15	but hurled Pharaoh and his army into the Red Sea.

PSA.136.26	Give thanks to the God of heaven!
PSA.137.1	By the rivers of Babylon —
PSA.137.1	there we sat down and wept
PSA.137.1	when we remembered Zion.
PSA.137.2	There we hung up our lyres
PSA.137.2	on the poplar trees,
PSA.137.3	for our captors there asked us for songs,
PSA.137.3	and our tormentors, for rejoicing:
PSA.137.3	“Sing us one of the songs of Zion.”
PSA.137.4	How can we sing the 
PSA.137.4	on foreign soil?
PSA.137.5	If I forget you, Jerusalem,
PSA.137.5	may my right hand forget its skill.
PSA.137.6	May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth
PSA.137.6	if I do not remember you,
PSA.137.6	if I do not exalt Jerusalem as my greatest joy!
PSA.137.7	Remember, 
PSA.137.7	that day
PSA.137.7	“Destroy it! Destroy it
PSA.137.7	down to its foundations!” 
PSA.137.8	Daughter Babylon, doomed to destruction,
PSA.137.8	happy is the one who pays you back
PSA.137.8	what you have done to us.
PSA.137.9	Happy is he who takes your little ones
PSA.137.9	and dashes them against the rocks.
PSA.138.1	I will give you thanks with all my heart;
PSA.138.1	I will sing your praise before the heavenly beings.
PSA.138.2	I will bow down toward your holy temple
PSA.138.2	and give thanks to your name
PSA.138.2	for your constant love and truth.
PSA.138.2	You have exalted your name
PSA.138.2	and your promise above everything else.
PSA.138.3	On the day I called, you answered me;
PSA.138.3	you increased strength within me.
PSA.138.4	All the kings on earth will give you thanks, 
PSA.138.4	when they hear what you have promised.
PSA.138.5	They will sing of the 
PSA.138.5	for the 
PSA.138.6	Though the 
PSA.138.6	he takes note of the humble;
PSA.138.6	but he knows the haughty from a distance.
PSA.138.7	If I walk into the thick of danger,
PSA.138.7	you will preserve my life
PSA.138.7	from the anger of my enemies.
PSA.138.7	You will extend your hand;
PSA.138.7	your right hand will save me.
PSA.138.8	The 
PSA.138.8	do not abandon the work of your hands.
PSA.139.2	You know when I sit down and when I stand up;
PSA.139.2	you understand my thoughts from far away.
PSA.139.3	You observe my travels and my rest;
PSA.139.3	you are aware of all my ways.
PSA.139.4	Before a word is on my tongue,
PSA.139.4	you know all about it, 
PSA.139.5	You have encircled me;
PSA.139.5	you have placed your hand on me.
PSA.139.6	This wondrous knowledge is beyond me.
PSA.139.6	It is lofty; I am unable to reach it.
PSA.139.7	Where can I go to escape your Spirit?
PSA.139.7	Where can I flee from your presence?
PSA.139.8	If I go up to heaven, you are there;
PSA.139.8	if I make my bed in Sheol, you are there.
PSA.139.9	If I live at the eastern horizon
PSA.139.9	or settle at the western limits,
PSA.139.10	even there your hand will lead me;
PSA.139.10	your right hand will hold on to me.
PSA.139.11	If I say, “Surely the darkness will hide me,
PSA.139.11	and the light around me will be night”
PSA.139.12	even the darkness is not dark to you.
PSA.139.12	The night shines like the day;
PSA.139.12	darkness and light are alike to you.
PSA.139.13	For it was you who created my inward parts;
PSA.139.13	you knit me together in my mother’s womb.
PSA.139.14	I will praise you
PSA.139.14	because I have been remarkably and wondrously made.
PSA.139.14	Your works are wondrous,
PSA.139.14	and I know this very well.
PSA.139.15	My bones were not hidden from you
PSA.139.15	when I was made in secret,
PSA.139.15	when I was formed in the depths of the earth.
PSA.139.16	Your eyes saw me when I was formless;
PSA.139.16	all my days were written in your book and planned
PSA.139.16	before a single one of them began.
PSA.139.17	God, how precious
PSA.139.17	how vast their sum is!
PSA.139.18	If I counted them,
PSA.139.18	they would outnumber the grains of sand;
PSA.139.18	when I wake up,
PSA.139.19	God, if only you would kill the wicked —
PSA.139.19	you bloodthirsty men, stay away from me
PSA.139.20	who invoke you deceitfully.
PSA.139.20	Your enemies swear by you falsely.
PSA.139.21	and detest those who rebel against you?
PSA.139.22	I hate them with extreme hatred;
PSA.139.22	I consider them my enemies.
PSA.139.23	Search me, God, and know my heart;
PSA.139.23	test me and know my concerns.
PSA.139.24	See if there is any offensive
PSA.139.24	lead me in the everlasting way.
PSA.140.1	Rescue me, 
PSA.140.1	Keep me safe from violent men
PSA.140.2	who plan evil in their hearts.
PSA.140.2	They stir up wars all day long.
PSA.140.3	They make their tongues
PSA.140.3	as sharp as a snake’s bite;
PSA.140.3	viper’s venom is under their lips.
PSA.140.4	Protect me, 
PSA.140.4	from the power of the wicked.
PSA.140.4	Keep me safe from violent men
PSA.140.4	who plan to make me stumble.
PSA.140.5	The proud hide a trap with ropes for me;
PSA.140.5	they spread a net along the path
PSA.140.5	and set snares for me.
PSA.140.6	I say to the 
PSA.140.6	Listen, 
PSA.140.7	you shield my head on the day of battle.
PSA.140.8	do not let them achieve their goals.
PSA.140.8	Otherwise, they will become proud.
PSA.140.9	When those who surround me rise up,
PSA.140.9	may the trouble their lips cause overwhelm them.
PSA.140.10	Let hot coals fall on them.
PSA.140.10	Let them be thrown into the fire,
PSA.140.10	into the abyss, never again to rise.
PSA.140.11	Do not let a slanderer stay in the land.
PSA.140.11	Let evil relentlessly
PSA.140.12	I
PSA.140.12	the just cause of the poor,
PSA.140.12	justice for the needy.
PSA.140.13	Surely the righteous will praise your name;
PSA.140.13	the upright will live in your presence.
PSA.141.1	Listen to my voice when I call on you.
PSA.141.2	May my prayer be set before you as incense,
PSA.141.2	the raising of my hands as the evening offering.
PSA.141.3	keep watch at the door of my lips.
PSA.141.4	Do not let my heart turn to any evil thing
PSA.141.4	or perform wicked acts
PSA.141.4	with men who commit sin.
PSA.141.4	Do not let me feast on their delicacies.
PSA.141.5	Let the righteous one strike me —
PSA.141.5	it is an act of faithful love;
PSA.141.5	let him rebuke me —
PSA.141.5	it is oil for my head;
PSA.141.5	let me
PSA.141.5	Even now my prayer is against
PSA.141.5	the evil acts of the wicked.
PSA.141.6	When their rulers
PSA.141.6	the sides of a cliff,
PSA.141.6	the people
PSA.141.6	for they are pleasing.
PSA.141.7	As when one plows and breaks up the soil,
PSA.141.7	turning up rocks,
PSA.141.7	so our
PSA.141.7	at the mouth of Sheol.
PSA.141.8	But my eyes look to you, 
PSA.141.8	I seek refuge in you; do not let me die.
PSA.141.9	Protect me from the trap they have set for me,
PSA.141.9	and from the snares of evildoers.
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
PSA.141.10	while I pass by safely.
PSA.142.1	I cry aloud to the 
PSA.142.1	I plead aloud to the 
PSA.142.2	I pour out my complaint before him;
PSA.142.2	I reveal my trouble to him.
PSA.142.3	Although my spirit is weak within me,
PSA.142.3	you know my way.
PSA.142.3	Along this path I travel
PSA.142.3	they have hidden a trap for me.
PSA.142.4	Look to the right and see:
PSA.142.4	no one stands up for me;
PSA.142.4	there is no refuge for me;
PSA.142.4	no one cares about me.
PSA.142.5	I cry to you, 
PSA.142.5	I say, “You are my shelter,
PSA.142.5	my portion in the land of the living.”
PSA.142.6	Listen to my cry,
PSA.142.6	for I am very weak.
PSA.142.6	Rescue me from those who pursue me,
PSA.142.6	for they are too strong for me.
PSA.142.7	Free me from prison
PSA.142.7	so that I can praise your name.
PSA.142.7	The righteous will gather around me
PSA.142.7	because you deal generously with me.
PSA.143.1	In your faithfulness listen to my plea,
PSA.143.1	and in your righteousness answer me.
PSA.143.2	Do not bring your servant into judgment,
PSA.143.2	for no one alive is righteous in your sight.
PSA.143.3	For the enemy has pursued me,
PSA.143.3	crushing me to the ground,
PSA.143.3	making me live in darkness
PSA.143.3	like those long dead.
PSA.143.4	My spirit is weak within me;
PSA.143.4	my heart is overcome with dismay.
PSA.143.5	I remember the days of old;
PSA.143.5	I meditate on all you have done;
PSA.143.5	I reflect on the work of your hands.
PSA.143.6	I spread out my hands to you;
PSA.143.6	I am like parched land before you.
PSA.143.7	Answer me quickly, 
PSA.143.7	my spirit fails.
PSA.143.7	Don’t hide your face from me,
PSA.143.7	or I will be like those
PSA.143.7	going down to the Pit.
PSA.143.8	Let me experience
PSA.143.8	your faithful love in the morning,
PSA.143.8	for I trust in you.
PSA.143.8	Reveal to me the way I should go
PSA.143.8	because I appeal to you.
PSA.143.9	Rescue me from my enemies, 
PSA.143.9	I come to you for protection.
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do your will,
PSA.143.10	for you are my God.
PSA.143.10	May your gracious Spirit
PSA.143.10	lead me on level ground.
PSA.143.11	For your name’s sake, 
PSA.143.11	let me live.

PSA.143.12	and in your faithful love destroy my enemies.
PSA.143.12	Wipe out all those who attack me,
PSA.143.12	for I am your servant.
PSA.144.1	Blessed be the 
PSA.144.1	who trains my hands for battle
PSA.144.1	and my fingers for warfare.
PSA.144.2	He is my faithful love and my fortress,
PSA.144.2	my stronghold and my deliverer.
PSA.144.2	He is my shield,
PSA.144.2	he subdues my people
PSA.144.3	a son of man
PSA.144.4	A human is like a breath;
PSA.144.4	his days are like a passing shadow.
PSA.144.5	Touch the mountains, and they will smoke.
PSA.144.6	Flash your lightning and scatter the foe;
PSA.144.6	shoot your arrows and rout them.
PSA.144.7	Reach down
PSA.144.7	rescue me from deep water, and set me free
PSA.144.7	from the grasp of foreigners
PSA.144.8	whose mouths speak lies,
PSA.144.8	whose right hands are deceptive.
PSA.144.9	God, I will sing a new song to you;
PSA.144.9	I will play on a ten-stringed harp for you
PSA.144.10	the one who gives victory to kings,
PSA.144.10	who frees his servant David
PSA.144.10	from the deadly sword.
PSA.144.11	Set me free and rescue me
PSA.144.11	from foreigners
PSA.144.11	whose mouths speak lies,
PSA.144.11	whose right hands are deceptive.
PSA.144.12	Then our sons will be like plants
PSA.144.12	nurtured in their youth,
PSA.144.12	our daughters, like corner pillars
PSA.144.12	that are carved in the palace style.
PSA.144.13	Our storehouses will be full,
PSA.144.13	supplying all kinds of produce;

PSA.146.1	My soul, praise the 
PSA.146.2	I will praise the 
PSA.146.2	I will sing to my God as long as I live.
PSA.146.3	Do not trust in nobles,
PSA.146.3	in a son of man,
PSA.146.4	When his breath
PSA.146.4	he returns to the ground;
PSA.146.4	on that day his plans die.
PSA.146.5	Happy is the one whose help is the God of Jacob,
PSA.146.5	whose hope is in the 
PSA.146.6	the Maker of heaven and earth,
PSA.146.6	the sea and everything in them.
PSA.146.6	He remains faithful forever,
PSA.146.7	executing justice for the exploited
PSA.146.7	and giving food to the hungry.
PSA.146.7	The 
PSA.146.8	The 
PSA.146.8	The 
PSA.146.8	The 
PSA.146.9	The 
PSA.146.9	and helps the fatherless and the widow,
PSA.146.9	but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.
PSA.146.10	The 
PSA.146.10	Zion, your God reigns for all generations.
PSA.146.10	Hallelujah!
PSA.147.1	Hallelujah!
PSA.147.1	How good it is to sing to our God,
PSA.147.1	for praise is pleasant and lovely.
PSA.147.2	The 
PSA.147.2	he gathers Israel’s exiled people.
PSA.147.3	He heals the brokenhearted
PSA.147.3	and bandages their wounds.
PSA.147.4	He counts the number of the stars;
PSA.147.4	he gives names to all of them.
PSA.147.5	Our Lord is great, vast in power;
PSA.147.5	his understanding is infinite.
PSA.147.6	The 
PSA.147.6	but brings the wicked to the ground.
PSA.147.7	Sing to the 
PSA.147.7	play the lyre to our God,
PSA.147.8	who covers the sky with clouds,
PSA.147.8	prepares rain for the earth,
PSA.147.8	and causes grass to grow on the hills.
PSA.147.9	He provides the animals with their food,
PSA.147.9	and the young ravens, what they cry for.
PSA.147.10	He is not impressed by the strength of a horse;
PSA.147.10	he does not value the power of a warrior.
PSA.147.11	The 
PSA.147.11	those who put their hope in his faithful love.
PSA.147.12	Exalt the 
PSA.147.12	praise your God, Zion!
PSA.147.13	For he strengthens the bars of your city gates
PSA.147.13	and blesses your children within you.
PSA.147.14	He endows your territory with prosperity;
PSA.147.14	he satisfies you with the finest wheat.
PSA.147.15	He sends his command throughout the earth;
PSA.147.15	his word runs swiftly.
PSA.147.16	He spreads snow like wool;
PSA.147.16	he scatters frost like ashes;
PSA.147.17	he throws his hailstones like crumbs.
PSA.147.17	Who can withstand his cold?
PSA.147.18	He sends his word and melts them;
PSA.147.18	he unleashes his winds,
PSA.147.19	He declares his word to Jacob,
PSA.147.19	his statutes and judgments to Israel.
PSA.147.20	He has not done this for every nation;
PSA.147.20	they do not know his judgments.
PSA.147.20	Hallelujah!
PSA.148.1	Hallelujah!
PSA.148.1	Praise the

PSA.148.3	Praise him, sun and moon;
PSA.148.3	praise him, all you shining stars.
PSA.148.4	Praise him, highest heavens,
PSA.148.4	and you waters above the heavens.
PSA.148.5	Let them praise the name of the 
PSA.148.5	for he commanded, and they were created.
PSA.148.6	He set them in position forever and ever;
PSA.148.6	he gave an order that will never pass away.
PSA.148.7	Praise the 
PSA.148.7	all sea monsters and ocean depths,
PSA.148.8	lightning
PSA.148.8	stormy wind that executes his command,

PSA.148.9	fruit trees and all cedars,
PSA.148.10	wild animals and all cattle,
PSA.148.10	creatures that crawl and flying birds,

PSA.148.11	princes and all judges of the earth,
PSA.148.12	young men as well as young women,
PSA.148.12	old and young together.

PSA.148.13	for his name alone is exalted.
PSA.148.13	His majesty covers heaven and earth.
PSA.148.14	He has raised up a horn for his people,
PSA.148.14	resulting in praise to all his faithful ones,

PSA.148.14	Hallelujah!
PSA.149.1	Hallelujah!
PSA.149.1	Sing to the 
PSA.149.1	his praise in the assembly of the faithful.
PSA.149.2	Let Israel celebrate its Maker;

PSA.149.3	and make music to him with tambourine and lyre.
PSA.149.4	For the 
PSA.149.4	he adorns the humble with salvation.
PSA.149.5	Let the faithful celebrate in triumphal glory;
PSA.149.5	let them shout for joy on their beds.
PSA.149.6	Let the exaltation of God be in their mouths
PSA.149.6	and a double-edged sword in their hands,
PSA.149.7	inflicting vengeance on the nations
PSA.149.7	and punishment on the peoples,
PSA.149.8	binding their kings with chains
PSA.149.8	and their dignitaries with iron shackles,
PSA.149.9	carrying out the judgment decreed against them.
PSA.149.9	This honor is for all his faithful people.
PSA.149.9	Hallelujah!
PSA.150.1	Hallelujah!

PSA.150.6	Let everything that breathes praise the 
PSA.150.6	Hallelujah!
PRO.1.1	The proverbs of Solomon
PRO.1.2	For learning wisdom and discipline;
PRO.1.2	for understanding insightful sayings;
PRO.1.3	for receiving prudent instruction
PRO.1.3	in righteousness, justice, and integrity;
PRO.1.4	for teaching shrewdness to the inexperienced,
PRO.1.4	knowledge and discretion
PRO.1.5	let a wise person listen and increase learning,
PRO.1.5	and let a discerning person obtain guidance —
PRO.1.6	for understanding a proverb or a parable,
PRO.1.6	the words of the wise, and their riddles.
PRO.1.7	The fear of the 
PRO.1.7	is the beginning of knowledge;
PRO.1.7	fools despise wisdom and discipline.
PRO.1.8	Listen, my son, to your father’s instruction,
PRO.1.8	and don’t reject your mother’s teaching,
PRO.1.9	for they will be a garland
PRO.1.9	and pendants
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice you,
PRO.1.10	don’t be persuaded.
PRO.1.11	If they say — “Come with us!
PRO.1.11	Let’s set an ambush
PRO.1.11	Let’s attack some innocent person
PRO.1.12	Let’s swallow them alive,
PRO.1.12	whole, like those who go down to the Pit.
PRO.1.13	We’ll find all kinds of valuable property
PRO.1.13	and fill our houses with plunder.
PRO.1.14	Throw in your lot with us,
PRO.1.14	and we’ll all share the loot”
PRO.1.15	my son, don’t travel that road with them
PRO.1.15	or set foot on their path,
PRO.1.16	because their feet run toward evil
PRO.1.16	and they hurry to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	It is useless to spread a net
PRO.1.17	where any bird can see it,
PRO.1.18	but they set an ambush to kill themselves;
PRO.1.18	they attack their own lives.
PRO.1.19	Such are the paths of all who make profit dishonestly;
PRO.1.19	it takes the lives of those who receive it.
PRO.1.20	Wisdom calls out in the street;
PRO.1.20	she makes her voice heard in the public squares.
PRO.1.21	She cries out above
PRO.1.21	she speaks at the entrance of the city gates:
PRO.1.22	“How long, inexperienced ones, will you love ignorance?
PRO.1.22	How long will you mockers
PRO.1.22	and you fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	If you respond to my warning,
PRO.1.23	then I will pour out my spirit on you
PRO.1.23	and teach you my words.
PRO.1.24	Since I called out and you refused,
PRO.1.24	extended my hand and no one paid attention,
PRO.1.25	since you neglected all my counsel
PRO.1.25	and did not accept my correction,
PRO.1.26	I, in turn, will laugh at your calamity.
PRO.1.26	I will mock when terror strikes you,
PRO.1.27	when terror strikes you like a storm
PRO.1.27	and your calamity comes like a whirlwind,
PRO.1.27	when trouble and stress overcome you.
PRO.1.28	Then they will call me, but I won’t answer;
PRO.1.28	they will search for me, but won’t find me.
PRO.1.29	Because they hated knowledge,
PRO.1.29	didn’t choose to fear the 
PRO.1.30	were not interested in my counsel,
PRO.1.30	and rejected all my correction,
PRO.1.31	they will eat the fruit of their way
PRO.1.31	and be glutted with their own schemes.
PRO.1.32	For the apostasy of the inexperienced will kill them,
PRO.1.32	and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
PRO.1.33	But whoever listens to me will live securely
PRO.1.33	and be undisturbed by the dread of danger.”
PRO.2.1	My son, if you accept my words
PRO.2.1	and store up my commands within you,
PRO.2.2	listening closely
PRO.2.2	and directing your heart to understanding;
PRO.2.3	furthermore, if you call out to insight
PRO.2.3	and lift your voice to understanding,
PRO.2.4	if you seek it like silver
PRO.2.4	and search for it like hidden treasure,
PRO.2.5	then you will understand the fear of the 
PRO.2.5	and discover the knowledge of God.
PRO.2.6	For the 
PRO.2.6	from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
PRO.2.7	He stores up success
PRO.2.7	He is a shield for those who live with integrity
PRO.2.8	so that he may guard the paths of justice
PRO.2.8	and protect the way of his faithful followers.
PRO.2.9	Then you will understand righteousness, justice,
PRO.2.9	and integrity — every good path.
PRO.2.10	For wisdom will enter your heart,
PRO.2.10	and knowledge will delight you.
PRO.2.11	Discretion will watch over you,
PRO.2.11	and understanding will guard you.
PRO.2.12	It will rescue you from the way of evil —
PRO.2.12	from anyone who says perverse things,
PRO.2.13	from those who abandon the right paths
PRO.2.13	to walk in ways of darkness,
PRO.2.14	from those who enjoy doing evil
PRO.2.14	and celebrate perversion,
PRO.2.15	whose paths are crooked,
PRO.2.15	and whose ways are devious.
PRO.2.16	It will rescue you from a forbidden woman,
PRO.2.16	from a wayward woman with her flattering talk,
PRO.2.17	who abandons the companion of her youth
PRO.2.17	and forgets the covenant of her God;
PRO.2.18	for her house sinks down to death
PRO.2.18	and her ways to the land of the departed spirits.
PRO.2.19	None return who go to her;
PRO.2.19	none reach the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	So follow the way of the good,
PRO.2.20	and keep to the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright will inhabit the land,
PRO.2.21	and those of integrity will remain in it;
PRO.2.22	but the wicked will be cut off from the land,
PRO.2.22	and the treacherous ripped out of it.
PRO.3.1	My son, don’t forget my teaching,
PRO.3.1	but let your heart keep my commands;
PRO.3.2	for they will bring you
PRO.3.2	many days, a full life,
PRO.3.3	Never let loyalty and faithfulness leave you.
PRO.3.3	Tie them around your neck;
PRO.3.3	write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.3.4	Then you will find favor and high regard
PRO.3.4	with God and people.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.5	and do not rely on your own understanding;
PRO.3.6	in all your ways know him,
PRO.3.6	and he will make your paths straight.
PRO.3.7	Don’t be wise in your own eyes;
PRO.3.7	fear the 
PRO.3.8	This will be healing for your body
PRO.3.8	and strengthening for your bones.
PRO.3.9	Honor the 
PRO.3.9	and with the first produce of your entire harvest;
PRO.3.10	then your barns will be completely filled,
PRO.3.10	and your vats will overflow with new wine.
PRO.3.11	Do not despise the 
PRO.3.11	and do not loathe his discipline;
PRO.3.12	for the 
PRO.3.12	just as a father disciplines the son in whom he delights.
PRO.3.13	Happy is a man who finds wisdom
PRO.3.13	and who acquires understanding,
PRO.3.14	for she is more profitable than silver,
PRO.3.14	and her revenue is better than gold.
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than jewels;
PRO.3.15	nothing you desire can equal her.
PRO.3.16	Long life
PRO.3.16	in her left, riches and honor.
PRO.3.17	Her ways are pleasant,
PRO.3.17	and all her paths, peaceful.
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life
PRO.3.18	and those who hold on to her are happy.
PRO.3.19	The 
PRO.3.19	and established the heavens by understanding.
PRO.3.20	By his knowledge the watery depths broke open,
PRO.3.20	and the clouds dripped with dew.
PRO.3.21	Maintain sound wisdom and discretion.
PRO.3.21	My son, don’t lose sight of them.
PRO.3.22	They will be life for you
PRO.3.22	and adornment
PRO.3.23	Then you will go safely on your way;
PRO.3.23	your foot will not stumble.
PRO.3.24	When you lie
PRO.3.24	you will lie down, and your sleep will be pleasant.
PRO.3.25	Don’t fear sudden danger
PRO.3.25	or the ruin of the wicked when it comes,
PRO.3.26	for the 
PRO.3.26	and will keep your foot from a snare.
PRO.3.27	When it is in your power,
PRO.3.27	don’t withhold good
PRO.3.28	Don’t say to your neighbor, “Go away! Come back later.
PRO.3.28	I’ll give it tomorrow” — when it is there with you.
PRO.3.29	Don’t plan any harm against your neighbor,
PRO.3.29	for he trusts you and lives near you.
PRO.3.30	Don’t accuse anyone without cause,
PRO.3.30	when he has done you no harm.
PRO.3.31	Don’t envy a violent man
PRO.3.31	or choose any of his ways;
PRO.3.32	for the devious are detestable to the 
PRO.3.32	but he is a friend
PRO.3.33	The 
PRO.3.33	but he blesses the home of the righteous;
PRO.3.34	He mocks those who mock,
PRO.3.34	but gives grace to the humble.
PRO.3.35	The wise will inherit honor,
PRO.3.35	but he holds up fools to dishonor.
PRO.4.1	Listen, sons, to a father’s discipline,
PRO.4.1	and pay attention so that you may gain understanding,
PRO.4.2	for I am giving you good instruction.
PRO.4.2	Don’t abandon my teaching.
PRO.4.3	When I was a son with my father,
PRO.4.3	tender and precious to my mother,
PRO.4.4	he taught me and said:
PRO.4.4	“Your heart must hold on to my words.
PRO.4.4	Keep my commands and live.
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom, get understanding;
PRO.4.5	don’t forget or turn away from the words from my mouth.
PRO.4.6	Don’t abandon wisdom, and she will watch over you;
PRO.4.6	love her,
PRO.4.7	Wisdom is supreme — so get wisdom.
PRO.4.7	And whatever else you get, get understanding.
PRO.4.8	Cherish her, and she will exalt you;
PRO.4.8	if you embrace her, she will honor you.
PRO.4.9	She will place a garland of favor on your head;
PRO.4.9	she will give you a crown of beauty.”
PRO.4.10	Listen, my son. Accept my words,
PRO.4.10	and you will live many years.
PRO.4.11	I am teaching you the way of wisdom;
PRO.4.11	I am guiding you on straight paths.
PRO.4.12	When you walk, your steps will not be hindered;
PRO.4.12	when you run, you will not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Hold on to instruction; don’t let go.
PRO.4.13	Guard it, for it is your life.
PRO.4.14	Keep off the path of the wicked;
PRO.4.14	don’t proceed on the way of evil ones.
PRO.4.15	Avoid it; don’t travel on it.
PRO.4.15	Turn away from it, and pass it by.
PRO.4.16	For they can’t sleep
PRO.4.16	unless they have done what is evil;
PRO.4.16	they are robbed of sleep
PRO.4.16	unless they make someone stumble.
PRO.4.17	They eat the bread of wickedness
PRO.4.17	and drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn,
PRO.4.18	shining brighter and brighter until midday.
PRO.4.19	But the way of the wicked is like the darkest gloom;
PRO.4.19	they don’t know what makes them stumble.
PRO.4.20	My son, pay attention to my words;
PRO.4.20	listen closely to my sayings.
PRO.4.21	Don’t lose sight of them;
PRO.4.21	keep them within your heart.
PRO.4.22	For they are life to those who find them,
PRO.4.22	and health to one’s whole body.
PRO.4.23	Guard your heart above all else,
PRO.4.23	for it is the source of life.
PRO.4.24	Don’t let your mouth speak dishonestly,
PRO.4.24	and don’t let your lips talk deviously.
PRO.4.25	Let your eyes look forward;
PRO.4.25	fix your gaze
PRO.4.26	Carefully consider the path
PRO.4.26	and all your ways will be established.
PRO.4.27	Don’t turn to the right or to the left;
PRO.4.27	keep your feet away from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, pay attention to my wisdom;
PRO.5.1	listen closely
PRO.5.2	so that you may maintain discretion
PRO.5.2	and your lips safeguard knowledge.
PRO.5.3	Though the lips of the forbidden woman drip honey
PRO.5.3	and her words are
PRO.5.4	in the end she’s as bitter as wormwood
PRO.5.4	and as sharp as a double-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death;
PRO.5.5	her steps head straight for Sheol.
PRO.5.6	She doesn’t consider the path of life;
PRO.5.6	she doesn’t know that her ways are unstable.
PRO.5.7	So now, sons, listen to me,
PRO.5.7	and don’t turn away from the words from my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Keep your way far from her.
PRO.5.8	Don’t go near the door of her house.
PRO.5.9	Otherwise, you will give up your vitality to others
PRO.5.9	and your years to someone cruel;
PRO.5.10	strangers will drain your resources,
PRO.5.10	and your hard-earned pay will end up in a foreigner’s house.
PRO.5.11	At the end of your life, you will lament
PRO.5.11	when your physical body has been consumed,
PRO.5.12	and you will say, “How I hated discipline,
PRO.5.12	and how my heart despised correction.
PRO.5.13	I didn’t obey my teachers
PRO.5.13	or listen closely
PRO.5.14	I am on the verge of complete ruin
PRO.5.14	before the entire community.”
PRO.5.15	Drink water from your own cistern,
PRO.5.15	water flowing from your own well.
PRO.5.16	Should your springs flow in the streets,
PRO.5.16	streams in the public squares?
PRO.5.17	They should be for you alone
PRO.5.17	and not for you to share with strangers.
PRO.5.18	Let your fountain be blessed,
PRO.5.18	and take pleasure in the wife of your youth.
PRO.5.19	A loving deer, a graceful doe
PRO.5.19	let her breasts always satisfy you;
PRO.5.19	be lost in her love forever.
PRO.5.20	Why, my son, would you lose yourself
PRO.5.20	with a forbidden woman
PRO.5.20	or embrace a wayward woman?
PRO.5.21	For a man’s ways are before the 
PRO.5.21	and he considers all his paths.
PRO.5.22	A wicked man’s iniquities will trap him;
PRO.5.22	he will become tangled in the ropes of his own sin.
PRO.5.23	He will die because there is no discipline,
PRO.5.23	and be lost because of his great stupidity.
PRO.6.1	My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor
PRO.6.1	or entered into an agreement with
PRO.6.2	you have been snared by the words of your mouth
PRO.6.2	trapped by the words from your mouth.
PRO.6.3	Do this, then, my son, and free yourself,
PRO.6.3	for you have put yourself in your neighbor’s power:
PRO.6.3	Go, humble yourself, and plead with your neighbor.
PRO.6.4	Don’t give sleep to your eyes
PRO.6.4	or slumber to your eyelids.
PRO.6.5	Escape like a gazelle from a hunter,
PRO.6.5	like a bird from a hunter’s trap.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant,
PRO.6.6	Observe its ways and become wise.
PRO.6.7	Without leader, administrator, or ruler,
PRO.6.8	it prepares its provisions in summer;
PRO.6.8	it gathers its food during harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long will you stay in bed, you slacker?
PRO.6.9	When will you get up from your sleep?
PRO.6.10	A little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.6.10	a little folding of the arms to rest,
PRO.6.11	and your poverty will come like a robber,
PRO.6.11	your need, like a bandit.
PRO.6.12	A worthless person,
PRO.6.12	goes around speaking dishonestly,
PRO.6.13	winking
PRO.6.13	and gesturing with his fingers.
PRO.6.14	He always plots evil
PRO.6.14	he stirs up trouble.
PRO.6.15	Therefore calamity will strike him suddenly;
PRO.6.15	he will be shattered instantly, beyond recovery.
PRO.6.16	The 
PRO.6.16	in fact, seven are detestable to him:
PRO.6.17	arrogant eyes,
PRO.6.17	hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	a heart that plots wicked schemes,
PRO.6.18	feet eager to run to evil,
PRO.6.19	a lying witness who gives false testimony,
PRO.6.19	and one who stirs up trouble among brothers.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep your father’s command,
PRO.6.20	and don’t reject your mother’s teaching.
PRO.6.21	Always bind them to your heart;
PRO.6.21	tie them around your neck.
PRO.6.22	When you walk here and there, they will guide you;
PRO.6.22	when you lie down, they will watch over you;
PRO.6.22	when you wake up, they will talk to you.
PRO.6.23	For a command is a lamp, teaching is a light,
PRO.6.23	and corrective discipline is the way to life.
PRO.6.24	They will protect you from an evil woman,
PRO.6.24	from the flattering
PRO.6.25	Don’t lust in your heart for her beauty
PRO.6.25	or let her captivate you with her eyelashes.
PRO.6.26	For a prostitute’s fee is only a loaf of bread,
PRO.6.26	but the wife of another man
PRO.6.27	Can a man embrace fire
PRO.6.27	and his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Can a man walk on burning coals
PRO.6.28	without scorching his feet?
PRO.6.29	So it is with the one who sleeps with
PRO.6.29	another man’s wife;
PRO.6.29	no one who touches her will go unpunished.
PRO.6.30	People don’t despise the thief if he steals
PRO.6.30	to satisfy himself when he is hungry.
PRO.6.31	Still, if caught, he must pay seven times as much;
PRO.6.31	he must give up all the wealth in his house.
PRO.6.32	The one who commits adultery
PRO.6.32	whoever does so destroys himself.
PRO.6.33	He will get a beating
PRO.6.33	and his disgrace will never be removed.
PRO.6.34	For jealousy enrages a husband,
PRO.6.34	and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
PRO.6.35	He will not be appeased by anything
PRO.6.35	or be persuaded by lavish bribes.
PRO.7.1	My son, obey my words,
PRO.7.1	and treasure my commands.
PRO.7.2	Keep my commands and live,
PRO.7.2	and guard my instructions
PRO.7.2	as you would the pupil of your eye.
PRO.7.3	Tie them to your fingers;
PRO.7.3	write them on the tablet of your heart.
PRO.7.4	Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,”
PRO.7.4	and call understanding your relative.
PRO.7.5	She will keep you from a forbidden woman,
PRO.7.5	a wayward woman with her flattering talk.
PRO.7.6	At the window of my house
PRO.7.6	I looked through my lattice.
PRO.7.7	I saw among the inexperienced,
PRO.7.7	I noticed among the youths,
PRO.7.7	a young man lacking sense.
PRO.7.8	Crossing the street near her corner,
PRO.7.8	he strolled down the road to her house
PRO.7.9	at twilight, in the evening,
PRO.7.9	in the dark of the night.
PRO.7.10	A woman came to meet him
PRO.7.10	dressed like a prostitute,
PRO.7.10	having a hidden agenda.
PRO.7.11	She is loud and defiant;
PRO.7.11	her feet do not stay at home.
PRO.7.12	Now in the street, now in the squares,
PRO.7.12	she lurks at every corner.
PRO.7.13	She grabs him and kisses him;
PRO.7.13	she brazenly says
PRO.7.14	“I’ve made fellowship offerings;
PRO.7.14	today I’ve fulfilled my vows.
PRO.7.15	So I came out to meet you,
PRO.7.15	to search for you, and I’ve found you.
PRO.7.16	I’ve spread coverings on my bed
PRO.7.16	richly colored linen from Egypt.
PRO.7.17	I’ve perfumed my bed
PRO.7.17	with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let’s drink deeply of lovemaking until morning.
PRO.7.18	Let’s feast on each other’s love!
PRO.7.19	My husband isn’t home;
PRO.7.19	he went on a long journey.
PRO.7.20	He took a bag of silver with him
PRO.7.20	and will come home at the time of the full moon.”
PRO.7.21	She seduces him with her persistent pleading;
PRO.7.21	she lures with her flattering
PRO.7.22	He follows her impulsively
PRO.7.22	like an ox going to the slaughter,
PRO.7.22	like a deer bounding toward a trap
PRO.7.23	until an arrow pierces its
PRO.7.23	like a bird darting into a snare
PRO.7.23	he doesn’t know it will cost him his life.
PRO.7.24	Now, sons, listen to me,
PRO.7.24	and pay attention to the words from my mouth.
PRO.7.25	Don’t let your heart turn aside to her ways;
PRO.7.25	don’t stray onto her paths.
PRO.7.26	For she has brought many down to death;
PRO.7.26	her victims are countless.
PRO.7.27	Her house is the road to Sheol,
PRO.7.27	descending to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	Doesn’t wisdom
PRO.8.1	Doesn’t understanding make her voice heard?
PRO.8.2	At the heights overlooking the road,
PRO.8.2	at the crossroads, she takes her stand.
PRO.8.3	Beside the gates
PRO.8.3	at the main entrance, she cries out:
PRO.8.4	“People, I call out to you;
PRO.8.4	my cry is to the children of Adam.
PRO.8.5	Learn to be shrewd, you who are inexperienced;
PRO.8.5	develop common sense, you who are foolish.
PRO.8.6	Listen, for I speak of noble things,
PRO.8.6	and what my lips say is right.
PRO.8.7	For my mouth tells the truth,
PRO.8.7	and wickedness is detestable to my lips.
PRO.8.8	All the words from my mouth are righteous;
PRO.8.8	none of them are deceptive or perverse.
PRO.8.9	All of them are clear to the perceptive,
PRO.8.9	and right to those who discover knowledge.
PRO.8.10	Accept my instruction instead of silver,
PRO.8.10	and knowledge rather than pure gold.
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is better than jewels,
PRO.8.11	and nothing desirable can equal it.
PRO.8.12	I, wisdom, share a home with shrewdness
PRO.8.12	and have knowledge and discretion.
PRO.8.13	To fear the 
PRO.8.13	I hate arrogant pride, evil conduct,
PRO.8.13	and perverse speech.
PRO.8.14	I possess good advice and sound wisdom;
PRO.8.14	I have understanding and strength.
PRO.8.15	It is by me that kings reign
PRO.8.15	and rulers enact just law;
PRO.8.16	by me, princes lead,
PRO.8.16	as do nobles and all righteous judges.
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me,
PRO.8.17	and those who search for me find me.
PRO.8.18	With me are riches and honor,
PRO.8.18	lasting wealth and righteousness.
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than solid gold,
PRO.8.19	and my harvest than pure silver.
PRO.8.20	I walk in the ways of righteousness,
PRO.8.20	along the paths of justice,
PRO.8.21	giving wealth as an inheritance to those who love me,
PRO.8.21	and filling their treasuries.
PRO.8.22	“The 
PRO.8.22	at the beginning of his creation,
PRO.8.22	before his works of long ago.
PRO.8.23	I was formed
PRO.8.23	from the beginning, before the earth began.
PRO.8.24	I was born
PRO.8.24	when there were no watery depths
PRO.8.24	and no springs filled with water.
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were established,
PRO.8.25	prior to the hills,
PRO.8.26	before he made the land, the fields,
PRO.8.26	or the first soil on earth.
PRO.8.27	I was there when he established the heavens,
PRO.8.27	when he laid out the horizon on the surface of the ocean,
PRO.8.28	when he placed the skies above,
PRO.8.28	when the fountains of the ocean gushed out,
PRO.8.29	when he set a limit for the sea
PRO.8.29	so that the waters would not violate his command,
PRO.8.29	when he laid out the foundations of the earth.
PRO.8.30	I was a skilled craftsman
PRO.8.30	I was his
PRO.8.30	always rejoicing before him.
PRO.8.31	I was rejoicing in his inhabited world,
PRO.8.31	delighting in the children of Adam.
PRO.8.32	“And now, sons, listen to me;
PRO.8.32	those who keep my ways are happy.
PRO.8.33	Listen to instruction and be wise;
PRO.8.33	don’t ignore it.
PRO.8.34	Anyone who listens to me is happy,
PRO.8.34	watching at my doors every day,
PRO.8.34	waiting by the posts of my doorway.
PRO.8.35	For the one who finds me finds life
PRO.8.35	and obtains favor from the 
PRO.8.36	but the one who misses me
PRO.8.36	all who hate me love death.”
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house;
PRO.9.1	she has carved out her seven pillars.
PRO.9.2	She has prepared her meat;
PRO.9.2	she has also set her table.
PRO.9.3	She has sent out her female servants;
PRO.9.3	she calls out from the highest points of the city:
PRO.9.4	“Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!”
PRO.9.4	To the one who lacks sense,
PRO.9.5	“Come, eat my bread,
PRO.9.5	and drink the wine I have mixed.
PRO.9.6	Leave inexperience behind, and you will live;
PRO.9.6	pursue the way of understanding.
PRO.9.7	The one who corrects a mocker
PRO.9.7	will bring abuse on himself;
PRO.9.7	the one who rebukes the wicked will get hurt.
PRO.9.8	Don’t rebuke a mocker, or he will hate you;
PRO.9.8	rebuke the wise, and he will love you.
PRO.9.9	Instruct the wise, and he will be wiser still;
PRO.9.9	teach the righteous, and he will learn more.
PRO.9.10	“The fear of the 
PRO.9.10	and the knowledge of the Holy One

PRO.9.11	and years will be added to your life.
PRO.9.12	If you are wise, you are wise for your own benefit;
PRO.9.12	if you mock, you alone will bear the consequences.”
PRO.9.13	Folly is a rowdy woman;
PRO.9.13	she is gullible and knows nothing.
PRO.9.14	She sits by the doorway of her house,
PRO.9.14	on a seat at the highest point of the city,
PRO.9.15	calling to those who pass by,
PRO.9.15	who go straight ahead on their paths:
PRO.9.16	“Whoever is inexperienced, enter here!”
PRO.9.16	To the one who lacks sense, she says,
PRO.9.17	“Stolen water is sweet,
PRO.9.17	and bread eaten secretly is tasty!” 
PRO.9.18	But he doesn’t know that the departed spirits are there,
PRO.9.18	that her guests are in the depths of Sheol.

PRO.10.1	A wise son brings joy to his father,

PRO.10.2	Ill-gotten gains do not profit anyone,
PRO.10.2	but righteousness rescues from death.
PRO.10.3	The 
PRO.10.3	but he denies the wicked what they crave.
PRO.10.4	Idle hands make one poor,
PRO.10.4	but diligent hands bring riches.
PRO.10.5	The son who gathers during summer is prudent;
PRO.10.5	the son who sleeps during harvest is disgraceful.
PRO.10.6	Blessings are on the head of the righteous,
PRO.10.6	but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
PRO.10.7	The remembrance of the righteous is a blessing,
PRO.10.7	but the name of the wicked will rot.
PRO.10.8	A wise heart accepts commands,
PRO.10.8	but foolish lips will be destroyed.
PRO.10.9	The one who lives with integrity lives securely,
PRO.10.9	but whoever perverts his ways will be found out.
PRO.10.10	A sly wink of the eye
PRO.10.10	and foolish lips will be destroyed.
PRO.10.11	The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life,
PRO.10.11	but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence.
PRO.10.12	Hatred stirs up conflicts,
PRO.10.12	but love covers all offenses.
PRO.10.13	Wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning,
PRO.10.13	but a rod is for the back of the one who lacks sense.
PRO.10.14	The wise store up knowledge,
PRO.10.14	but the mouth of the fool hastens destruction.
PRO.10.15	The wealth of the rich is his fortified city;
PRO.10.15	the poverty of the poor is their destruction.
PRO.10.16	The reward of the righteous is life;
PRO.10.16	the wages of the wicked is punishment.
PRO.10.17	The one who follows instruction is on the path to life,
PRO.10.17	but the one who rejects correction goes astray.
PRO.10.18	The one who conceals hatred has lying lips,
PRO.10.18	and whoever spreads slander is a fool.
PRO.10.19	When there are many words, sin is unavoidable,
PRO.10.19	but the one who controls his lips is prudent.
PRO.10.20	The tongue of the righteous is pure silver;
PRO.10.20	the heart of the wicked is of little value.
PRO.10.21	The lips of the righteous feed many,
PRO.10.21	but fools die for lack of sense.
PRO.10.22	The

PRO.10.23	As shameful conduct is pleasure for a fool,
PRO.10.23	so wisdom is for a person of understanding.

PRO.10.24	but what the righteous desire will be given to them.
PRO.10.25	When the whirlwind passes,
PRO.10.25	the wicked are no more,
PRO.10.25	but the righteous are secure forever.
PRO.10.26	Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes,
PRO.10.26	so the slacker is to the one who sends him on an errand.
PRO.10.27	The fear of the 
PRO.10.27	but the years of the wicked are cut short.

PRO.10.29	but destruction awaits the malicious.
PRO.10.30	The righteous will never be shaken,
PRO.10.30	but the wicked will not remain on the earth.
PRO.10.31	The mouth of the righteous produces wisdom,
PRO.10.31	but a perverse tongue will be cut out.
PRO.10.32	The lips of the righteous know what is appropriate,
PRO.10.32	but the mouth of the wicked, only what is perverse.
PRO.11.1	Dishonest scales are detestable to the 
PRO.11.1	but an accurate weight is his delight.
PRO.11.2	When arrogance comes, disgrace follows,
PRO.11.2	but with humility comes wisdom.
PRO.11.3	The integrity of the upright guides them,
PRO.11.3	but the perversity of the treacherous destroys them.
PRO.11.4	Wealth is not profitable on a day of wrath,
PRO.11.4	but righteousness rescues from death.
PRO.11.5	The righteousness of the blameless clears his path,
PRO.11.5	but the wicked person will fall because of his wickedness.
PRO.11.6	The righteousness of the upright rescues them,
PRO.11.6	but the treacherous are trapped by their own desires.
PRO.11.7	When the wicked person dies,
PRO.11.7	his expectation comes to nothing,
PRO.11.7	and hope placed in wealth
PRO.11.8	The righteous one is rescued from trouble;
PRO.11.8	in his place, the wicked one goes in.
PRO.11.9	With his mouth the ungodly destroys his neighbor,
PRO.11.9	but through knowledge the righteous are rescued.
PRO.11.10	When the righteous thrive, a city rejoices;
PRO.11.10	when the wicked die, there is joyful shouting.
PRO.11.11	A city is built up by the blessing of the upright,
PRO.11.11	but it is torn down by the mouth of the wicked.
PRO.11.12	Whoever shows contempt for his neighbor lacks sense,
PRO.11.12	but a person with understanding keeps silent.
PRO.11.13	A gossip goes around revealing a secret,
PRO.11.13	but a trustworthy person keeps a confidence.
PRO.11.14	Without guidance, a people will fall,
PRO.11.14	but with many counselors there is deliverance.
PRO.11.15	If someone puts up security for a stranger,
PRO.11.15	he will suffer for it,
PRO.11.15	but the one who hates such agreements is protected.
PRO.11.16	A gracious woman gains honor,
PRO.11.16	but violent
PRO.11.17	A kind man benefits himself,
PRO.11.17	but a cruel person brings ruin on himself.
PRO.11.18	The wicked person earns an empty wage,
PRO.11.18	but the one who sows righteousness, a true reward.
PRO.11.19	Genuine righteousness leads to life,
PRO.11.19	but pursuing evil leads to death.
PRO.11.20	Those with twisted minds are detestable to the 
PRO.11.20	but those with blameless conduct are his delight.
PRO.11.21	Be assured
PRO.11.21	will not go unpunished,
PRO.11.21	but the offspring of the righteous will escape.
PRO.11.22	A beautiful woman who rejects good sense
PRO.11.22	is like a gold ring in a pig’s snout.
PRO.11.23	The desire of the righteous turns out well,
PRO.11.23	but the hope of the wicked leads to wrath.
PRO.11.24	One person gives freely,
PRO.11.24	yet gains more;
PRO.11.24	another withholds what is right,
PRO.11.24	only to become poor.
PRO.11.25	A generous person will be enriched,
PRO.11.25	and the one who gives a drink of water
PRO.11.25	will receive water.
PRO.11.26	People will curse
PRO.11.26	but a blessing will come to the one who sells it.
PRO.11.27	The one who searches for what is good
PRO.11.27	but if someone looks for trouble, it will come to him.
PRO.11.28	Anyone trusting in his riches will fall,
PRO.11.28	but the righteous will flourish like foliage.
PRO.11.29	The one who brings ruin on his household
PRO.11.29	will inherit the wind,
PRO.11.29	and a fool will be a slave
PRO.11.29	to someone whose heart is wise.
PRO.11.30	The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life,
PRO.11.30	and a wise person captivates people.  
PRO.11.31	If the righteous will be repaid on earth,
PRO.11.31	how much more the wicked and sinful.
PRO.12.1	Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge,
PRO.12.1	but one who hates correction is stupid.
PRO.12.2	One who is good obtains favor from the 
PRO.12.2	but he condemns a person who schemes.
PRO.12.3	No one can be made secure by wickedness,
PRO.12.3	but the root of the righteous is immovable.
PRO.12.4	A wife of noble character
PRO.12.4	but a wife who causes shame
PRO.12.4	is like rottenness in his bones.
PRO.12.5	The thoughts of the righteous are just,
PRO.12.5	but guidance from the wicked is deceitful.
PRO.12.6	The words of the wicked are a deadly ambush,
PRO.12.6	but the speech of the upright rescues them.
PRO.12.7	The wicked are overthrown and perish,
PRO.12.7	but the house of the righteous will stand.
PRO.12.8	A man is praised for his insight,
PRO.12.8	but a twisted mind is despised.
PRO.12.9	Better to be disregarded, yet have a servant,
PRO.12.9	than to act important but have no food.
PRO.12.10	The righteous cares about his animal’s health,
PRO.12.10	but even the merciful acts of the wicked are cruel.
PRO.12.11	The one who works his land will have plenty of food,
PRO.12.11	but whoever chases fantasies lacks sense.
PRO.12.12	The wicked desire what evil people have caught,
PRO.12.12	but the root of the righteous is productive.
PRO.12.13	By rebellious speech an evil person is trapped,
PRO.12.13	but a righteous person escapes from trouble.
PRO.12.14	A person will be satisfied with good
PRO.12.14	by the fruit of his mouth,
PRO.12.14	and the work of a person’s hands will reward him.
PRO.12.15	A fool’s way is right in his own eyes,
PRO.12.15	but whoever listens to counsel is wise.
PRO.12.16	A fool’s displeasure is known at once,
PRO.12.16	but whoever ignores an insult is sensible.
PRO.12.17	Whoever speaks the truth declares what is right,
PRO.12.17	but a false witness speaks deceit.
PRO.12.18	There is one who speaks rashly,
PRO.12.18	like a piercing sword;
PRO.12.18	but the tongue of the wise brings healing.
PRO.12.19	Truthful lips endure forever,
PRO.12.19	but a lying tongue, only a moment.

PRO.12.22	Lying lips are detestable to the 
PRO.12.22	but faithful people are his delight.
PRO.12.23	A shrewd person conceals knowledge,
PRO.12.23	but a foolish heart publicizes stupidity.
PRO.12.24	The diligent hand will rule,
PRO.12.24	but laziness will lead to forced labor.
PRO.12.25	Anxiety in a person’s heart weighs it down,
PRO.12.25	but a good word cheers it up.
PRO.12.26	A righteous person is careful in dealing with his neighbor,
PRO.12.26	but the ways of the wicked lead them astray.
PRO.12.27	A lazy hunter doesn’t roast his game,
PRO.12.27	but to a diligent person, his wealth is precious.
PRO.12.28	There is life in the path of righteousness,
PRO.12.28	and in its path there is no death.
PRO.13.1	A wise son responds to his father’s discipline,
PRO.13.1	but a mocker doesn’t listen to rebuke.
PRO.13.2	From the fruit of his mouth,
PRO.13.2	a person will enjoy good things,
PRO.13.2	but treacherous people have an appetite for violence.
PRO.13.3	The one who guards his mouth protects his life;
PRO.13.3	the one who opens his lips invites his own ruin.
PRO.13.4	The slacker craves, yet has nothing,
PRO.13.4	but the diligent is fully satisfied.
PRO.13.5	The righteous hate lying,
PRO.13.5	but the wicked bring disgust and shame.
PRO.13.6	Righteousness guards people of integrity,
PRO.13.6	but wickedness undermines the sinner.
PRO.13.7	One person pretends to be rich but has nothing;
PRO.13.7	another pretends to be poor but has abundant wealth.
PRO.13.8	Riches are a ransom for a person’s life,

PRO.13.9	The light of the righteous shines brightly,
PRO.13.9	but the lamp of the wicked is put out.
PRO.13.10	Arrogance leads to nothing but strife,
PRO.13.10	but wisdom is gained by those who take advice.
PRO.13.11	Wealth obtained by fraud will dwindle,
PRO.13.11	but whoever earns it through labor
PRO.13.12	Hope delayed makes the heart sick,
PRO.13.12	but desire fulfilled is a tree of life.
PRO.13.13	The one who has contempt for instruction will pay the penalty,
PRO.13.13	but the one who respects a command will be rewarded.
PRO.13.14	A wise person’s instruction is a fountain of life,
PRO.13.14	turning people away from the snares of death.
PRO.13.15	Good sense wins favor,
PRO.13.15	but the way of the treacherous never changes.
PRO.13.16	Every sensible person acts knowledgeably,
PRO.13.16	but a fool displays his stupidity.
PRO.13.17	A wicked envoy falls into trouble,
PRO.13.17	but a trustworthy courier brings healing.

PRO.13.19	but to turn from evil is detestable to fools.
PRO.13.20	The one who walks with the wise will become wise,
PRO.13.20	but a companion of fools will suffer harm.
PRO.13.21	Disaster pursues sinners,
PRO.13.21	but good rewards the righteous.
PRO.13.22	A good man leaves an inheritance to his

PRO.14.7	Stay away from a foolish person;
PRO.14.7	you will gain no knowledge from his speech.
PRO.14.8	The sensible person’s wisdom is to consider his way,
PRO.14.8	but the stupidity of fools deceives them.

PRO.14.11	but the tent of the upright will flourish.
PRO.14.12	There is a way that seems right to a person,
PRO.14.12	but its end is the way to death.
PRO.14.13	Even in laughter a heart may be sad,
PRO.14.13	and joy may end in grief.
PRO.14.14	The disloyal one will get what his conduct deserves,
PRO.14.14	and a good one, what his deeds deserve.
PRO.14.15	The inexperienced one believes anything,
PRO.14.15	but the sensible one watches
PRO.14.16	A wise person is cautious and turns from evil,
PRO.14.16	but a fool is easily angered and is careless.
PRO.14.17	A quick-tempered person acts foolishly,
PRO.14.17	and one who schemes is hated.
PRO.14.18	The inexperienced inherit foolishness,
PRO.14.18	but the sensible are crowned with knowledge.
PRO.14.19	The evil bow before those who are good,

PRO.15.10	Discipline is harsh for the one who leaves the path;
PRO.15.10	the one who hates correction will die.
PRO.15.11	Sheol and Abaddon lie open before the

PRO.16.7	he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him.
PRO.16.8	Better a little with righteousness
PRO.16.8	than great income with injustice.
PRO.16.9	A person’s heart plans his way,
PRO.16.9	but the 
PRO.16.10	God’s verdict is on the lips of a king;

PRO.16.20	and the one who trusts in the 
PRO.16.21	Anyone with a wise heart is called discerning,
PRO.16.21	and pleasant speech
PRO.16.22	Insight is a fountain of life
PRO.16.22	but the discipline of fools is folly.
PRO.16.23	The heart of a wise person instructs his mouth;

PRO.17.1	than a house full of feasting with strife.
PRO.17.2	A prudent servant will rule over a disgraceful son
PRO.17.2	and share an inheritance among brothers.
PRO.17.3	A crucible for silver, and a smelter for gold,
PRO.17.3	and the

PRO.17.4	a liar pays attention to a destructive tongue.
PRO.17.5	The one who mocks the poor insults his Maker,
PRO.17.5	and one who rejoices over calamity
PRO.17.5	will not go unpunished.
PRO.17.6	Grandchildren are the crown of the elderly,
PRO.17.6	and the pride of children is their fathers.

PRO.17.7	how much worse are lies for a ruler.
PRO.17.8	A bribe
PRO.17.8	wherever he turns, he succeeds.
PRO.17.9	Whoever conceals an offense promotes love,
PRO.17.9	but whoever gossips about it separates friends.
PRO.17.10	A rebuke cuts into a perceptive person
PRO.17.10	more than a hundred lashes into a fool.
PRO.17.11	An evil person desires only rebellion;
PRO.17.11	a cruel messenger
PRO.17.12	Better for a person to meet a bear robbed of her cubs
PRO.17.12	than a fool in his foolishness.
PRO.17.13	If anyone returns evil for good,
PRO.17.13	evil will never depart from his house.
PRO.17.14	To start a conflict is to release a flood;
PRO.17.14	stop the dispute before it breaks out.
PRO.17.15	Acquitting the guilty and condemning the just
PRO.17.15	both are detestable to the 
PRO.17.16	Why does a fool have money in his hand
PRO.17.16	with no intention of buying wisdom?
PRO.17.17	A friend loves at all times,
PRO.17.17	and a brother is born for a difficult time.
PRO.17.18	One without sense enters an agreement
PRO.17.18	and puts up security for his friend.
PRO.17.19	One who loves to offend loves strife;
PRO.17.19	one who builds a high threshold invites injury.
PRO.17.20	One with a twisted mind will not succeed,
PRO.17.20	and one with deceitful speech will fall into ruin.
PRO.17.21	A man fathers a fool to his own sorrow;
PRO.17.21	the father of a fool has no joy.
PRO.17.22	A joyful heart is good medicine,
PRO.17.22	but a broken spirit dries up the bones.
PRO.17.23	A wicked person secretly takes a bribe
PRO.17.23	to subvert the course of justice.
PRO.17.24	Wisdom is the focus of the perceptive,
PRO.17.24	but a fool’s eyes
PRO.17.25	A foolish son is grief to his father
PRO.17.25	and bitterness to the one who bore him.
PRO.17.26	It is certainly not good to fine an innocent person
PRO.17.26	or to beat a noble for his honesty.
PRO.17.27	The one who has knowledge restrains his words,
PRO.17.27	and one who keeps a cool head
PRO.17.27	is a person of understanding.
PRO.17.28	Even a fool is considered wise when he keeps silent —
PRO.17.28	discerning, when he seals his lips.
PRO.18.1	One who isolates himself pursues selfish desires;
PRO.18.1	he rebels against all sound wisdom.
PRO.18.2	A fool does not delight in understanding,
PRO.18.2	but only wants to show off his opinions.
PRO.18.3	When a wicked person comes, contempt also comes,
PRO.18.3	and along with dishonor, derision.
PRO.18.4	The words of a person’s mouth are deep waters,
PRO.18.4	a flowing river, a fountain of wisdom.
PRO.18.5	It is not good to show partiality to the guilty,
PRO.18.5	denying an innocent person justice.
PRO.18.6	A fool’s lips lead to strife,
PRO.18.6	and his mouth provokes a beating.
PRO.18.7	A fool’s mouth is his devastation,
PRO.18.7	and his lips are a trap for his life.
PRO.18.8	A gossip’s words are like choice food
PRO.18.8	that goes down to one’s innermost being.
PRO.18.9	The one who is lazy in his work
PRO.18.9	is brother to a vandal.

PRO.18.10	the righteous run to it and are protected.
PRO.18.11	The wealth of the rich is his fortified city;
PRO.18.11	in his imagination it is like a high wall.
PRO.18.12	Before his downfall a person’s heart is proud,
PRO.18.12	but humility comes before honor.
PRO.18.13	The one who gives an answer before he listens —
PRO.18.13	this is foolishness and disgrace for him.
PRO.18.14	A person’s spirit can endure sickness,
PRO.18.14	but who can survive a broken spirit?
PRO.18.15	The mind of the discerning acquires knowledge,
PRO.18.15	and the ear of the wise seeks it.
PRO.18.16	A person’s gift opens doors
PRO.18.16	and brings him before the great.

PRO.18.18	and separates powerful opponents.
PRO.18.19	An offended brother is harder to reach
PRO.18.19	than a fortified city,
PRO.18.19	and quarrels are like the bars of a fortress.
PRO.18.20	From the fruit of a person’s mouth his stomach is satisfied;
PRO.18.20	he is filled with the product of his lips.
PRO.18.21	Death and life are in the power of the tongue,
PRO.18.21	and those who love it will eat its fruit.
PRO.18.22	A man who finds a wife finds a good thing
PRO.18.22	and obtains favor from the 
PRO.18.23	The poor person pleads,
PRO.18.23	but the rich one answers roughly.
PRO.18.24	One with many friends may be harmed,
PRO.18.24	but there is a friend who stays closer than a brother.
PRO.19.1	Better a poor person who lives with integrity
PRO.19.1	than someone who has deceitful lips and is a fool.
PRO.19.2	Even zeal is not good without knowledge,
PRO.19.2	and the one who acts hastily
PRO.19.3	A person’s own foolishness leads him astray,
PRO.19.3	yet his heart rages against the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth attracts many friends,
PRO.19.4	but a poor person is separated from his friend.
PRO.19.5	A false witness will not go unpunished,
PRO.19.5	and one who utters lies will not escape.
PRO.19.6	Many seek a ruler’s favor,
PRO.19.6	and everyone is a friend of one who gives gifts.
PRO.19.7	All the brothers of a poor person hate him;
PRO.19.7	how much more do his friends
PRO.19.7	keep their distance from him!
PRO.19.7	He may pursue them with words,
PRO.19.7	but they are not there.
PRO.19.8	The one who acquires good sense
PRO.19.8	one who safeguards understanding finds success.
PRO.19.9	A false witness will not go unpunished,
PRO.19.9	and one who utters lies perishes.
PRO.19.10	Luxury is not appropriate for a fool
PRO.19.10	how much less for a slave to rule over princes!
PRO.19.11	A person’s insight gives him patience,
PRO.19.11	and his virtue is to overlook an offense.
PRO.19.12	A king’s rage is like the roaring of a lion,
PRO.19.12	but his favor is like dew on the grass.
PRO.19.13	A foolish son is his father’s ruin,
PRO.19.13	and a wife’s nagging is an endless dripping.
PRO.19.14	A house and wealth are inherited from fathers,
PRO.19.14	but a prudent wife is from the 
PRO.19.15	Laziness induces deep sleep,
PRO.19.15	and a lazy person will go hungry.
PRO.19.16	The one who keeps commands preserves himself;
PRO.19.16	one who disregards
PRO.19.17	Kindness to the poor is a loan to the 
PRO.19.17	and he will give a reward to the lender.
PRO.19.18	Discipline your son while there is hope;
PRO.19.18	don’t set your heart on being the cause of his death.
PRO.19.19	A person with intense anger bears the penalty;
PRO.19.19	if you rescue him, you’ll have to do it again.
PRO.19.20	Listen to counsel and receive instruction
PRO.19.20	so that you may be wise later in life.
PRO.19.21	Many plans are in a person’s heart,
PRO.19.21	but the 
PRO.19.22	What is desirable in a person is his fidelity;

PRO.19.24	he doesn’t even bring it back to his mouth!
PRO.19.25	Strike a mocker, and the inexperienced learn a lesson;
PRO.19.25	rebuke the discerning, and he gains knowledge.
PRO.19.26	The one who plunders his father and evicts his mother
PRO.19.26	is a disgraceful and shameful son.
PRO.19.27	If you stop listening to correction, my son,
PRO.19.27	you will stray from the words of knowledge.
PRO.19.28	A worthless witness mocks justice,
PRO.19.28	and a wicked mouth swallows iniquity.
PRO.19.29	Judgments are prepared for mockers,
PRO.19.29	and beatings for the backs of fools.
PRO.20.1	Wine is a mocker,
PRO.20.1	whoever goes astray
PRO.20.2	A king’s terrible wrath is like the roaring of a lion;
PRO.20.2	anyone who provokes him endangers himself.
PRO.20.3	Honor belongs to the person who ends a dispute,
PRO.20.3	but any fool can get himself into a quarrel.
PRO.20.4	The slacker does not plow during planting season;
PRO.20.4	at harvest time he looks,

PRO.20.6	Many a person proclaims his own loyalty,
PRO.20.6	but who can find a trustworthy person?
PRO.20.7	A righteous person acts with integrity;
PRO.20.7	his children who come after him will be happy.
PRO.20.8	A king sitting on a throne to judge
PRO.20.8	separates out all evil with his eyes.
PRO.20.9	Who can say, “I have kept my heart pure;
PRO.20.9	I am cleansed from my sin”?
PRO.20.10	Differing weights and varying measures
PRO.20.10	both are detestable to the 
PRO.20.11	Even a young man is known by his actions —
PRO.20.11	by whether his behavior is pure and upright.

PRO.20.17	Food gained by fraud is sweet to a person,
PRO.20.17	but afterward his mouth is full of gravel.
PRO.20.18	Finalize plans with counsel,
PRO.20.18	and wage war with sound guidance.
PRO.20.19	The one who reveals secrets is a constant gossip;
PRO.20.19	avoid someone with a big mouth.
PRO.20.20	Whoever curses his father or mother
PRO.20.20	his lamp will go out in deep darkness.
PRO.20.21	An inheritance gained prematurely
PRO.20.21	will not be blessed ultimately.
PRO.20.22	Don’t say, “I will avenge this evil!” 
PRO.20.22	Wait on the 
PRO.20.23	Differing weights
PRO.20.23	and dishonest scales
PRO.20.24	Even a courageous person’s steps are determined by the 
PRO.20.24	so how can anyone understand his own way?
PRO.20.25	It is a trap for anyone to dedicate something rashly
PRO.20.25	and later to reconsider his vows.
PRO.20.26	A wise king separates out the wicked
PRO.20.26	and drives the threshing wheel
PRO.20.27	The 
PRO.20.27	searching the innermost parts.
PRO.20.28	Loyalty and faithfulness guard a king;
PRO.20.28	through loyalty he maintains his throne.
PRO.20.29	The glory of young men is their strength,
PRO.20.29	and the splendor of old men is gray hair.
PRO.20.30	Lashes and wounds purge away evil,
PRO.20.30	and beatings cleanse the innermost parts.
PRO.21.1	A king’s heart is like channeled water in the 
PRO.21.1	He directs it wherever he chooses.
PRO.21.2	All a person’s ways seem right to him,
PRO.21.2	but the 
PRO.21.3	Doing what is righteous and just

PRO.21.6	is a vanishing mist,
PRO.21.7	The violence of the wicked sweeps them away
PRO.21.7	because they refuse to act justly.
PRO.21.8	A guilty one’s conduct is crooked,
PRO.21.8	but the behavior of the innocent is upright.
PRO.21.9	Better to live on the corner of a roof
PRO.21.9	than to share a house with a nagging wife.
PRO.21.10	A wicked person desires evil;
PRO.21.10	he has no consideration
PRO.21.11	When a mocker is punished,
PRO.21.11	the inexperienced become wiser;

PRO.21.20	but a fool consumes them.
PRO.21.21	The one who pursues righteousness and faithful love
PRO.21.21	will find life, righteousness, and honor.
PRO.21.22	A wise person went up against a city of warriors
PRO.21.22	and brought down its secure fortress.

PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of a wicked person is detestable —
PRO.21.27	how much more so
PRO.21.27	when he brings it with ulterior motives!
PRO.21.28	A lying witness will perish,
PRO.21.28	but the one who listens will speak successfully.
PRO.21.29	A wicked person puts on a bold face,
PRO.21.29	but the upright one considers his way.
PRO.21.30	No wisdom, no understanding, and no counsel
PRO.21.30	will prevail against the 
PRO.21.31	A horse is prepared for the day of battle,
PRO.21.31	but victory comes from the 
PRO.22.1	A good name is to be chosen over great wealth;
PRO.22.1	favor is better than silver and gold.
PRO.22.2	Rich and poor have this in common:
PRO.22.2	the 
PRO.22.3	A sensible person sees danger and takes cover,
PRO.22.3	but the inexperienced keep going and are punished.
PRO.22.4	Humility, the fear of the 
PRO.22.4	results in wealth, honor, and life.
PRO.22.5	There are thorns and snares on the way of the crooked;
PRO.22.5	the one who guards himself stays far from them.
PRO.22.6	Start a youth out on his way;
PRO.22.6	even when he grows old he will not depart from it.
PRO.22.7	The rich rule over the poor,
PRO.22.7	and the borrower is a slave to the lender.
PRO.22.8	The one who sows injustice will reap disaster,
PRO.22.8	and the rod of his fury will be destroyed.
PRO.22.9	A generous person
PRO.22.9	for he shares his food with the poor.
PRO.22.10	Drive out a mocker,
PRO.22.10	then quarreling and dishonor will cease.
PRO.22.11	The one who loves a pure heart
PRO.22.11	and gracious lips — the king is his friend.
PRO.22.12	The 
PRO.22.12	but he overthrows the words of the treacherous.
PRO.22.13	The slacker says, “There’s a lion outside!
PRO.22.13	I’ll be killed in the public square!” 
PRO.22.14	The mouth of the forbidden woman is a deep pit;
PRO.22.14	a man cursed by the 
PRO.22.15	Foolishness is bound to the heart of a youth;
PRO.22.15	a rod of discipline will separate it from him.
PRO.22.16	Oppressing the poor to enrich oneself,
PRO.22.16	and giving to the rich — both lead only to poverty.
PRO.22.17	Listen closely,
PRO.22.17	and apply your mind to my knowledge.
PRO.22.18	For it is pleasing if you keep them within you
PRO.22.18	and if they are
PRO.22.19	I have instructed you today — even you —
PRO.22.19	so that your confidence may be in the 
PRO.22.20	Haven’t I written for you thirty sayings
PRO.22.20	about counsel and knowledge,
PRO.22.21	in order to teach you true and reliable words,
PRO.22.21	so that you may give a dependable report
PRO.22.21	to those who sent you?
PRO.22.22	Don’t rob a poor person because he is poor,
PRO.22.22	and don’t crush the oppressed
PRO.22.23	for the 
PRO.22.23	and will plunder those who plunder them.
PRO.22.24	Don’t make friends with an angry person,
PRO.22.24	and don’t be a companion of a hot-tempered one,
PRO.22.25	or you will learn his ways
PRO.22.25	and entangle yourself in a snare.
PRO.22.26	Don’t be one of those who enter agreements,
PRO.22.26	who put up security for loans.
PRO.22.27	If you have nothing with which to pay,
PRO.22.27	even your bed will be taken from under you.
PRO.22.28	Don’t move an ancient boundary marker
PRO.22.28	that your fathers set up.
PRO.22.29	Do you see a person skilled in his work?
PRO.22.29	He will stand in the presence of kings.
PRO.22.29	He will not stand in the presence of the unknown.
PRO.23.1	When you sit down to dine with a ruler,
PRO.23.1	consider carefully what
PRO.23.2	and put a knife to your throat
PRO.23.2	if you have a big
PRO.23.3	don’t desire his choice food,
PRO.23.3	for that food is deceptive.
PRO.23.4	Don’t wear yourself out to get rich;
PRO.23.4	because you know better, stop!
PRO.23.5	As soon as your eyes fly to it, it disappears,
PRO.23.5	for it makes wings for itself
PRO.23.5	and flies like an eagle to the sky.
PRO.23.6	Don’t eat a stingy person’s bread,
PRO.23.6	and don’t desire his choice food,
PRO.23.7	for it’s like someone calculating inwardly.
PRO.23.7	“Eat and drink,” he says to you,
PRO.23.7	but his heart is not with you.
PRO.23.8	You will vomit the little you’ve eaten
PRO.23.8	and waste your pleasant words.
PRO.23.9	Don’t speak to
PRO.23.9	for he will despise the insight of your words.
PRO.23.10	Don’t move an ancient boundary marker,
PRO.23.10	and don’t encroach on the fields of the fatherless,
PRO.23.11	for their Redeemer is strong,
PRO.23.11	and he will champion their cause against you.
PRO.23.12	Apply yourself to discipline
PRO.23.12	and listen to words of knowledge.
PRO.23.13	Don’t withhold discipline from a youth;
PRO.23.13	if you punish him with a rod, he will not die.
PRO.23.14	Punish him with a rod,
PRO.23.14	and you will rescue his life from Sheol.
PRO.23.15	My son, if your heart is wise,
PRO.23.15	my heart will indeed rejoice.
PRO.23.16	My innermost being will celebrate
PRO.23.16	when your lips say what is right.
PRO.23.17	Don’t let your heart envy sinners;
PRO.23.17	instead, always fear the 
PRO.23.18	For then you will have a future,
PRO.23.18	and your hope will not be dashed.
PRO.23.19	Listen, my son, and be wise;
PRO.23.19	keep your mind on the right course.
PRO.23.20	Don’t associate with those who drink too much wine
PRO.23.20	or with those who gorge themselves on meat.
PRO.23.21	For the drunkard and the glutton will become poor,
PRO.23.21	and grogginess will clothe them in rags.
PRO.23.22	Listen to your father who gave you life,
PRO.23.22	and don’t despise your mother when
PRO.23.23	Buy — and do not sell — truth,
PRO.23.23	wisdom, instruction, and understanding.
PRO.23.24	The father of a righteous son will rejoice greatly,
PRO.23.24	and one who fathers a wise son will delight in him.
PRO.23.25	Let your father and mother have joy,
PRO.23.25	and let her who gave birth to you rejoice.
PRO.23.26	My son, give me your heart,
PRO.23.26	and let your eyes observe my ways.
PRO.23.27	For a prostitute is a deep pit,
PRO.23.27	and a wayward woman is a narrow well;
PRO.23.28	indeed, she sets an ambush like a robber
PRO.23.28	and increases the number of unfaithful people.
PRO.23.29	Who has woe? Who has sorrow?
PRO.23.29	Who has conflicts? Who has complaints?
PRO.23.29	Who has wounds for no reason?
PRO.23.29	Who has red eyes?
PRO.23.30	Those who linger over wine;
PRO.23.30	those who go looking for mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Don’t gaze at wine because it is red,
PRO.23.31	because it gleams in the cup
PRO.23.31	and goes down smoothly.
PRO.23.32	In the end it bites like a snake
PRO.23.32	and stings like a viper.
PRO.23.33	Your eyes will see strange things,
PRO.23.33	and you will say absurd things.
PRO.23.34	You’ll be like someone sleeping out at sea
PRO.23.34	or lying down on the top of a ship’s mast.
PRO.23.35	“They struck me, but
PRO.23.35	They beat me, but I didn’t know it!
PRO.23.35	When will I wake up?
PRO.23.35	I’ll look for another drink.”
PRO.24.1	Don’t envy the evil
PRO.24.1	or desire to be with them,
PRO.24.2	for their hearts plan violence,
PRO.24.2	and their words stir up trouble.
PRO.24.3	A house is built by wisdom,
PRO.24.3	and it is established by understanding;
PRO.24.4	by knowledge the rooms are filled
PRO.24.4	with every precious and beautiful treasure.
PRO.24.5	A wise warrior is better than a strong one,
PRO.24.5	and a man of knowledge than one of strength;
PRO.24.6	for you should wage war with sound guidance —
PRO.24.6	victory comes with many counselors.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom is inaccessible to
PRO.24.7	he does not open his mouth at the city gate.
PRO.24.8	The one who plots evil
PRO.24.8	will be called a schemer.
PRO.24.9	A foolish scheme is sin,
PRO.24.9	and a mocker is detestable to people.
PRO.24.10	If you do nothing in a difficult time,
PRO.24.10	your strength is limited.
PRO.24.11	Rescue those being taken off to death,
PRO.24.11	and save those stumbling toward slaughter.
PRO.24.12	If you say, “But we didn’t know about this,”
PRO.24.12	won’t he who weighs hearts
PRO.24.12	Won’t he who protects your life
PRO.24.12	Won’t he repay a person according to his work?
PRO.24.13	Eat honey,
PRO.24.13	and the honeycomb is sweet to your palate;
PRO.24.14	realize that wisdom is the same for you.
PRO.24.14	If you find it, you will have a future,
PRO.24.14	and your hope will never fade.
PRO.24.15	Don’t set an ambush, you wicked one,
PRO.24.15	at the camp of the righteous man;
PRO.24.15	don’t destroy his dwelling.
PRO.24.16	Though a righteous person falls seven times,
PRO.24.16	he will get up,
PRO.24.16	but the wicked will stumble into ruin.
PRO.24.17	Don’t gloat when your enemy falls,
PRO.24.17	and don’t let your heart rejoice when he stumbles,
PRO.24.18	or the 
PRO.24.18	and turn his wrath away from him.
PRO.24.19	Don’t be agitated by evildoers,
PRO.24.19	and don’t envy the wicked.
PRO.24.20	For the evil have no future;
PRO.24.20	the lamp of the wicked will be put out.
PRO.24.21	My son, fear the 
PRO.24.21	and don’t associate with rebels,
PRO.24.22	for destruction will come suddenly from them;
PRO.24.22	who knows what distress these two can bring?
PRO.24.23	These sayings also belong to the wise:
PRO.24.23	It is not good to show partiality in judgment.
PRO.24.24	Whoever says to the guilty, “You are innocent”
PRO.24.24	peoples will curse him,
PRO.24.25	but it will go well with those who convict the guilty,
PRO.24.25	and a generous blessing will come to them.
PRO.24.26	He who gives an honest answer
PRO.24.26	gives a kiss on the lips.
PRO.24.27	Complete your outdoor work, and prepare your field;
PRO.24.27	afterward, build your house.
PRO.24.28	Don’t testify against your neighbor without cause.
PRO.24.28	Don’t deceive with your lips.
PRO.24.29	Don’t say, “I’ll do to him what he did to me;
PRO.24.29	I’ll repay the man for what he has done.”
PRO.24.30	I went by the field of a slacker
PRO.24.30	and by the vineyard of one lacking sense.
PRO.24.31	Thistles had come up everywhere,
PRO.24.31	weeds covered the ground,
PRO.24.31	and the stone wall was ruined.
PRO.24.32	I saw, and took it to heart;
PRO.24.32	I looked, and received instruction:
PRO.24.33	a little sleep, a little slumber,
PRO.24.33	a little folding of the arms to rest,
PRO.24.34	and your poverty will come like a robber,
PRO.24.34	and your need, like a bandit.
PRO.25.1	These too are proverbs of Solomon,
PRO.25.1	which the men of King Hezekiah
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal a matter
PRO.25.2	and the glory of kings to investigate a matter.
PRO.25.3	As the heavens are high and the earth is deep,
PRO.25.3	so the hearts of kings cannot be investigated.
PRO.25.4	Remove impurities from silver,
PRO.25.4	and material will be produced
PRO.25.5	Remove the wicked from the king’s presence,
PRO.25.5	and his throne will be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Don’t boast about yourself before the king,
PRO.25.6	and don’t stand in the place of the great;
PRO.25.7	for it is better for him to say to you, “Come up here!”
PRO.25.7	than to demote you in plain view of a noble.
PRO.25.8	Don’t take a matter to court hastily.
PRO.25.8	Otherwise, what will you do afterward
PRO.25.8	if your opponent
PRO.25.9	Make your case with your opponent
PRO.25.9	without revealing another’s secret;
PRO.25.10	otherwise, the one who hears will disgrace you,
PRO.25.10	and you’ll never live it down.
PRO.25.11	A word spoken at the right time
PRO.25.11	is like gold apples in silver settings.
PRO.25.12	A wise correction to a receptive ear
PRO.25.12	is like a gold ring or an ornament of gold.
PRO.25.13	To those who send him, a trustworthy envoy
PRO.25.13	is like the coolness of snow on a harvest day;
PRO.25.13	he refreshes the life of his masters.
PRO.25.14	The one who boasts about a gift that does not exist
PRO.25.14	is like clouds and wind without rain.
PRO.25.15	A ruler can be persuaded through patience,
PRO.25.15	and a gentle tongue can break a bone.
PRO.25.16	If you find honey,
PRO.25.16	otherwise, you’ll get sick from it and vomit.
PRO.25.17	Seldom set foot in your neighbor’s house;
PRO.25.17	otherwise, he’ll get sick of you and hate you.
PRO.25.18	A person giving false testimony against his neighbor
PRO.25.18	is like a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.
PRO.25.19	Trusting an unreliable person in a difficult time
PRO.25.19	is like a rotten tooth or a faltering foot.
PRO.25.20	Singing songs to a troubled heart
PRO.25.20	is like taking off clothing on a cold day
PRO.25.20	or like pouring vinegar on soda.
PRO.25.21	If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat,
PRO.25.21	and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink;
PRO.25.22	for you will heap burning coals on his head,
PRO.25.22	and the 
PRO.25.23	The north wind produces rain,
PRO.25.23	and a backbiting tongue, angry looks.
PRO.25.24	Better to live on the corner of a roof
PRO.25.24	than to share a house with a nagging wife.
PRO.25.25	Good news from a distant land
PRO.25.25	is like cold water to a parched throat.
PRO.25.26	A righteous person who yields to the wicked
PRO.25.26	is like a muddied spring or a polluted well.
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat too much honey
PRO.25.27	or to seek glory after glory.
PRO.25.28	A person who does not control his temper
PRO.25.28	is like a city whose wall is broken down.
PRO.26.1	Like snow in summer and rain at harvest,
PRO.26.1	honor is inappropriate for a fool.
PRO.26.2	Like a flitting sparrow or a fluttering swallow,
PRO.26.2	an undeserved curse goes nowhere.
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey,
PRO.26.3	and a rod for the backs of fools.
PRO.26.4	Don’t answer a fool according to his foolishness
PRO.26.4	or you’ll be like him yourself.
PRO.26.5	Answer a fool according to his foolishness
PRO.26.5	or he’ll become wise in his own eyes.
PRO.26.6	The one who sends a message by a fool’s hand
PRO.26.6	cuts off his own feet and drinks violence.
PRO.26.7	A proverb in the mouth of a fool
PRO.26.7	is like lame legs that hang limp.
PRO.26.8	Giving honor to a fool
PRO.26.8	is like binding a stone in a sling.
PRO.26.9	A proverb in the mouth of a fool
PRO.26.9	is like a stick with thorns,
PRO.26.9	brandished by
PRO.26.10	The one who hires a fool or who hires those passing by
PRO.26.10	is like an archer who wounds everyone.
PRO.26.11	As a dog returns to its vomit,
PRO.26.11	so also a fool repeats his foolishness.
PRO.26.12	Do you see a person who is wise in his own eyes?
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.26.13	The slacker says, “There’s a lion in the road —
PRO.26.13	a lion in the public square!” 
PRO.26.14	A door turns on its hinges,
PRO.26.14	and a slacker, on his bed.
PRO.26.15	The slacker buries his hand in the bowl;
PRO.26.15	he is too weary to bring it to his mouth!
PRO.26.16	In his own eyes, a slacker is wiser
PRO.26.16	than seven who can answer sensibly.
PRO.26.17	A person who is passing by and meddles in a quarrel that’s not his
PRO.26.17	is like one who grabs a dog by the ears.
PRO.26.18	Like a madman who throws flaming darts and deadly arrows,
PRO.26.19	so is the person who deceives his neighbor
PRO.26.19	and says, “I was only joking!”
PRO.26.20	Without wood, fire goes out;
PRO.26.20	without a gossip, conflict dies down.
PRO.26.21	As charcoal for embers and wood for fire,
PRO.26.21	so is a quarrelsome person for kindling strife.
PRO.26.22	A gossip’s words are like choice food
PRO.26.22	that goes down to one’s innermost being.
PRO.26.23	Smooth
PRO.26.23	are like glaze on an earthen vessel.
PRO.26.24	A hateful person disguises himself with his speech
PRO.26.24	and harbors deceit within.
PRO.26.25	When he speaks graciously, don’t believe him,
PRO.26.25	for there are seven detestable things in his heart.
PRO.26.26	Though his hatred is concealed by deception,
PRO.26.26	his evil will be revealed in the assembly.
PRO.26.27	The one who digs a pit will fall into it,
PRO.26.27	and whoever rolls a stone —
PRO.26.27	it will come back on him.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates those it crushes,
PRO.26.28	and a flattering mouth causes ruin.
PRO.27.1	Don’t boast about tomorrow,
PRO.27.1	for you don’t know what a day might bring.
PRO.27.2	Let another praise you, and not your own mouth —
PRO.27.2	a stranger, and not your own lips.
PRO.27.3	A stone is heavy and sand, a burden,
PRO.27.3	but aggravation from a fool outweighs them both.
PRO.27.4	Fury is cruel, and anger a flood,
PRO.27.4	but who can withstand jealousy?
PRO.27.5	Better an open reprimand
PRO.27.5	than concealed love.
PRO.27.6	The wounds of a friend are trustworthy,
PRO.27.6	but the kisses of an enemy are excessive.
PRO.27.7	A person who is full tramples on a honeycomb,
PRO.27.7	but to a hungry person, any bitter thing is sweet.
PRO.27.8	Anyone wandering from his home
PRO.27.8	is like a bird wandering from its nest.
PRO.27.9	Oil
PRO.27.9	and the sweetness of a friend is better than self-counsel.
PRO.27.10	Don’t abandon your friend or your father’s friend,
PRO.27.10	and don’t go to your brother’s house
PRO.27.10	in your time of calamity;
PRO.27.10	better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away.
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my son, and bring my heart joy,
PRO.27.11	so that I can answer anyone who taunts me.
PRO.27.12	A sensible person sees danger and takes cover;
PRO.27.12	the inexperienced keep going and are punished.
PRO.27.13	Take his garment,
PRO.27.13	for he has put up security for a stranger;
PRO.27.13	get collateral if it is for foreigners.
PRO.27.14	If one blesses his neighbor
PRO.27.14	with a loud voice early in the morning,
PRO.27.14	it will be counted as a curse to him.
PRO.27.15	An endless dripping on a rainy day
PRO.27.15	and a nagging wife are alike;
PRO.27.16	the one who controls her controls the wind
PRO.27.16	and grasps oil with his right hand.
PRO.27.17	Iron sharpens iron,
PRO.27.17	and one person sharpens another.
PRO.27.18	Whoever tends a fig tree
PRO.27.18	and whoever looks after his master will be honored.
PRO.27.19	As water reflects the face,
PRO.27.19	so the heart reflects the person.
PRO.27.20	Sheol and Abaddon
PRO.27.20	and people’s eyes are never satisfied.
PRO.27.21	A crucible refines silver, a smelter refines gold,
PRO.27.21	and a person refines his praise.
PRO.27.22	Though you grind a fool
PRO.27.22	in a mortar with a pestle along with grain,
PRO.27.22	you will not separate his foolishness from him.
PRO.27.23	Know well the condition of your flock,
PRO.27.23	and pay attention to your herds,
PRO.27.24	for wealth is not forever;
PRO.27.24	not even a crown lasts for all time.
PRO.27.25	When hay is removed and new growth appears
PRO.27.25	and the grain from the hills is gathered in,
PRO.27.26	lambs will provide your clothing,
PRO.27.26	and goats, the price of a field;
PRO.27.27	there will be enough goat’s milk for your food —
PRO.27.27	food for your household
PRO.27.27	and nourishment for your female servants.
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no one is pursuing them,
PRO.28.1	but the righteous are as bold as a lion.
PRO.28.2	When a land is in rebellion, it has many rulers,
PRO.28.2	but with a discerning and knowledgeable person, it endures.
PRO.28.3	A destitute leader
PRO.28.3	is like a driving rain that leaves no food.
PRO.28.4	Those who reject the law praise the wicked,
PRO.28.4	but those who keep the law pit themselves against them.
PRO.28.5	The evil do not understand justice,
PRO.28.5	but those who seek the 
PRO.28.6	Better the poor person who lives with integrity
PRO.28.6	than the rich one who distorts right and wrong.
PRO.28.7	A discerning son keeps the law,
PRO.28.7	but a companion of gluttons humiliates his father.
PRO.28.8	Whoever increases his wealth through excessive interest
PRO.28.8	collects it for one who is kind to the poor.
PRO.28.9	Anyone who turns his ear away from hearing the law —
PRO.28.9	even his prayer is detestable.
PRO.28.10	The one who leads the upright into an evil way
PRO.28.10	will fall into his own pit,
PRO.28.10	but the blameless will inherit what is good.
PRO.28.11	A rich person is wise in his own eyes,
PRO.28.11	but a poor one who has discernment sees through him.
PRO.28.12	When the righteous triumph,
PRO.28.12	there is great rejoicing,
PRO.28.12	but when the wicked come to power,
PRO.28.12	people hide.
PRO.28.13	The one who conceals his sins
PRO.28.13	will not prosper,
PRO.28.13	but whoever confesses and renounces them
PRO.28.13	will find mercy.
PRO.28.14	Happy is the one who is always reverent,
PRO.28.14	but one who hardens his heart falls into trouble.
PRO.28.15	A wicked ruler over a helpless people
PRO.28.15	is like a roaring lion or a charging bear.
PRO.28.16	A leader who lacks understanding
PRO.28.16	is very oppressive,
PRO.28.16	but one who hates dishonest profit
PRO.28.16	prolongs his life.
PRO.28.17	Someone burdened by bloodguilt
PRO.28.17	will be a fugitive until death.
PRO.28.17	Let no one help him.
PRO.28.18	The one who lives with integrity will be helped,
PRO.28.18	but one who distorts right and wrong
PRO.28.18	will suddenly fall.
PRO.28.19	The one who works his land
PRO.28.19	will have plenty of food,
PRO.28.19	but whoever chases fantasies
PRO.28.19	will have his fill of poverty.
PRO.28.20	A faithful person will have many blessings,
PRO.28.20	but one in a hurry to get rich
PRO.28.20	will not go unpunished.
PRO.28.21	It is not good to show partiality
PRO.28.21	yet even a courageous person may sin for a piece of bread.
PRO.28.22	A greedy one
PRO.28.22	he doesn’t know that poverty will come to him.
PRO.28.23	One who rebukes a person will later find more favor
PRO.28.23	than one who flatters
PRO.28.24	The one who robs his father or mother
PRO.28.24	and says, “That’s no sin,”
PRO.28.24	is a companion to a person who destroys.

PRO.28.25	but whoever trusts in the 
PRO.28.26	The one who trusts in himself
PRO.28.26	but one who walks in wisdom will be safe.
PRO.28.27	The one who gives to the poor
PRO.28.27	will not be in need,
PRO.28.27	but one who turns his eyes away
PRO.28.27	will receive many curses.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked come to power,
PRO.28.28	people hide,
PRO.28.28	but when they are destroyed,
PRO.28.28	the righteous flourish.
PRO.29.1	One who becomes stiff-necked,
PRO.29.1	after many reprimands
PRO.29.1	will be shattered instantly —
PRO.29.1	beyond recovery.
PRO.29.2	When the righteous flourish, the people rejoice,
PRO.29.2	but when the wicked rule, people groan.
PRO.29.3	A man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father,
PRO.29.3	but one who consorts with prostitutes destroys his wealth.
PRO.29.4	By justice a king brings stability to a land,
PRO.29.4	but a person who demands “contributions”
PRO.29.4	demolishes it.
PRO.29.5	A person who flatters
PRO.29.5	spreads a net for his feet.
PRO.29.6	An evil person is caught by sin,
PRO.29.6	but the righteous one sings and rejoices.
PRO.29.7	The righteous person knows the rights
PRO.29.7	but the wicked one does not understand these concerns.
PRO.29.8	Mockers inflame a city,
PRO.29.8	but the wise turn away anger.
PRO.29.9	If a wise person goes to court with a fool,
PRO.29.9	there will be ranting and raving but no resolution.
PRO.29.10	Bloodthirsty men hate an honest person,
PRO.29.10	but the upright care about him.
PRO.29.11	A fool gives full vent to his anger,
PRO.29.11	but a wise person holds it in check.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler listens to lies,
PRO.29.12	all his officials will be wicked.
PRO.29.13	The poor and the oppressor have this in common:
PRO.29.13	the 
PRO.29.14	A king who judges the poor with fairness —

PRO.29.15	A rod of correction imparts wisdom,
PRO.29.15	but a youth left to himself
PRO.29.15	is a disgrace to his mother.

PRO.29.16	but the righteous will see their downfall.
PRO.29.17	Discipline your child,
PRO.29.17	and give you delight.

PRO.29.18	but one who follows divine instruction will be happy.

PRO.29.19	though he understands, he doesn’t respond.
PRO.29.20	Do you see someone who speaks too soon?
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a fool than for him.
PRO.29.21	A servant pampered from his youth
PRO.29.21	will become arrogant
PRO.29.22	An angry person stirs up conflict,
PRO.29.22	and a hot-tempered one

PRO.30.1	The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The pronouncement.
PRO.30.1	The man’s oration to Ithiel, to Ithiel and Ucal:
PRO.30.2	I am more stupid than any other person,
PRO.30.2	and I lack a human’s ability to understand.
PRO.30.3	I have not gained wisdom,
PRO.30.3	and I have no knowledge of the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who has gone up to heaven and come down?
PRO.30.4	Who has gathered the wind in his hands?
PRO.30.4	Who has bound up the waters in a cloak?
PRO.30.4	Who has established all the ends of the earth?
PRO.30.4	What is his name,
PRO.30.4	and what is the name of his son —
PRO.30.4	if you know?
PRO.30.5	Every word of God is pure;
PRO.30.5	he is a shield to those who take refuge in him.
PRO.30.6	Don’t add to his words,
PRO.30.6	or he will rebuke you, and you will be proved a liar.
PRO.30.7	Two things I ask of you;
PRO.30.7	don’t deny them to me before I die:
PRO.30.8	Keep falsehood and deceitful words far from me.
PRO.30.8	Give me neither poverty nor wealth;
PRO.30.8	feed me with the food I need.
PRO.30.9	Otherwise, I might have too much
PRO.30.9	and deny you,
PRO.30.9	or I might have nothing and steal,
PRO.30.9	profaning
PRO.30.10	Don’t slander a servant to his master
PRO.30.10	or he will curse you,
PRO.30.11	There is a generation that curses its father
PRO.30.11	and does not bless its mother.
PRO.30.12	There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes,
PRO.30.12	yet is not washed from its filth.
PRO.30.13	There is a generation — how haughty its eyes
PRO.30.13	and pretentious its looks.
PRO.30.14	There is a generation whose teeth are swords,
PRO.30.14	whose fangs are knives,
PRO.30.14	devouring the oppressed from the land
PRO.30.14	and the needy from among mankind.
PRO.30.15	The leech has two daughters: “Give, Give!”
PRO.30.15	Three things
PRO.30.15	four never say, “Enough!”:
PRO.30.16	Sheol;
PRO.30.16	earth, which is never satisfied with water;
PRO.30.16	and fire, which never says, “Enough!”
PRO.30.17	As for the eye that ridicules a father
PRO.30.17	and despises obedience to a mother,
PRO.30.17	may ravens of the valley pluck it out
PRO.30.17	and young vultures eat it.
PRO.30.18	Three things are too wondrous for me;
PRO.30.18	four I can’t understand:
PRO.30.19	the way of an eagle in the sky,
PRO.30.19	the way of a snake on a rock,
PRO.30.19	the way of a ship at sea,
PRO.30.19	and the way of a man with a young woman.
PRO.30.20	This is the way of an adulteress:
PRO.30.20	she eats and wipes her mouth
PRO.30.20	and says, “I’ve done nothing wrong.”
PRO.30.21	The earth trembles under three things;
PRO.30.21	it cannot bear up under four:
PRO.30.22	a servant when he becomes king,
PRO.30.22	a fool when he is stuffed with food,
PRO.30.23	an unloved woman when she marries,
PRO.30.23	and a servant girl when she ousts her queen.
PRO.30.24	Four things on earth are small,
PRO.30.24	yet they are extremely wise:
PRO.30.25	ants are not a strong people,
PRO.30.25	yet they store up their food in the summer;
PRO.30.26	hyraxes are not a mighty people,
PRO.30.26	yet they make their homes in the cliffs;
PRO.30.27	locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	yet all of them march in ranks;
PRO.30.28	a lizard
PRO.30.28	yet it lives in kings’ palaces.
PRO.30.29	Three things are stately in their stride;
PRO.30.29	four are stately in their walk:
PRO.30.30	a lion, which is mightiest among beasts
PRO.30.30	and doesn’t retreat before anything;
PRO.30.31	a strutting rooster;
PRO.30.31	and a king at the head of his army.
PRO.30.32	If you have been foolish by exalting yourself
PRO.30.32	or if you’ve been scheming,
PRO.30.32	put your hand over your mouth.
PRO.30.33	For the churning of milk produces butter,
PRO.30.33	and twisting a nose draws blood,
PRO.30.33	and stirring up anger produces strife.
PRO.31.1	The words of King Lemuel,
PRO.31.1	a pronouncement
PRO.31.2	What should I say, my son?
PRO.31.2	What, son of my womb?
PRO.31.2	What, son of my vows?
PRO.31.3	Don’t spend your energy
PRO.31.3	or your efforts on those who destroy kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, Lemuel,
PRO.31.4	it is not for kings
PRO.31.4	or for rulers to desire beer.
PRO.31.5	Otherwise, he will drink,
PRO.31.5	forget what is decreed,
PRO.31.5	and pervert justice for all the oppressed.
PRO.31.6	Give beer to one who is dying
PRO.31.6	and wine to one whose life is bitter.
PRO.31.7	Let him drink so that he can forget his poverty
PRO.31.7	and remember his trouble no more.
PRO.31.8	Speak up
PRO.31.8	for the justice of all who are dispossessed.
PRO.31.9	Speak up, judge righteously,
PRO.31.9	and defend the cause of the oppressed and needy.
PRO.31.10	Who can find a wife of noble character?
PRO.31.10	She is far more precious than jewels.
PRO.31.11	The heart of her husband trusts in her,
PRO.31.11	and he will not lack anything good.
PRO.31.12	She rewards him with good, not evil,
PRO.31.12	all the days of her life.
PRO.31.13	She selects wool and flax
PRO.31.13	and works with willing hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like the merchant ships,
PRO.31.14	bringing her food from far away.
PRO.31.15	She rises while it is still night
PRO.31.15	and provides food for her household
PRO.31.15	and portions
PRO.31.16	She evaluates a field and buys it;
PRO.31.16	she plants a vineyard with her earnings.
PRO.31.17	She draws on her strength
PRO.31.17	and reveals that her arms are strong.
PRO.31.18	She sees that her profits are good,
PRO.31.18	and her lamp never goes out at night.
PRO.31.19	She extends her hands to the spinning staff,
PRO.31.19	and her hands hold the spindle.
PRO.31.20	Her hands reach
PRO.31.20	and she extends her hands to the needy.
PRO.31.21	She is not afraid for her household when it snows,
PRO.31.21	for all in her household are doubly clothed.
PRO.31.22	She makes her own bed coverings;
PRO.31.22	her clothing is fine linen
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known at the city gates,
PRO.31.23	where he sits among the elders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She makes and sells linen garments;
PRO.31.24	she delivers belts
PRO.31.25	Strength
PRO.31.25	and she can laugh at the time to come.
PRO.31.26	Her mouth speaks wisdom,
PRO.31.26	and loving instruction
PRO.31.27	She watches over the activities of her household
PRO.31.27	and is never idle.
PRO.31.28	Her children rise up and call her blessed;
PRO.31.28	her husband also praises her:
PRO.31.29	“Many women
PRO.31.29	but you surpass them all!” 
PRO.31.30	Charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting,
PRO.31.30	but a woman who fears the 
PRO.31.31	Give her the reward of her labor,
PRO.31.31	and let her works praise her at the city gates.
ECC.1.1	The words of the Teacher,
ECC.1.2	“Absolute futility,” says the Teacher.
ECC.1.2	“Absolute futility. Everything is futile.”
ECC.1.3	What does a person gain for all his efforts
ECC.1.3	that he labors at under the sun?
ECC.1.4	A generation goes and a generation comes,
ECC.1.4	but the earth remains forever.
ECC.1.5	The sun rises and the sun sets;
ECC.1.5	panting, it returns to the place
ECC.1.5	where it rises.
ECC.1.6	Gusting to the south,
ECC.1.6	turning to the north,
ECC.1.6	turning, turning, goes the wind,
ECC.1.6	and the wind returns in its cycles.
ECC.1.7	All the streams flow to the sea,
ECC.1.7	yet the sea is never full;
ECC.1.7	to the place where the streams flow,
ECC.1.7	there they flow again.
ECC.1.8	All things
ECC.1.8	more than anyone can say.
ECC.1.8	The eye is not satisfied by seeing
ECC.1.8	or the ear filled with hearing.
ECC.1.9	What has been is what will be,
ECC.1.9	and what has been done is what will be done;
ECC.1.9	there is nothing new under the sun.
ECC.1.10	Can one say about anything,
ECC.1.10	“Look, this is new”?
ECC.1.10	It has already existed in the ages before us.
ECC.1.11	There is no remembrance of those who
ECC.1.11	and of those who will come after
ECC.1.11	there will also be no remembrance
ECC.1.11	by those who follow them.
ECC.1.12	I, the Teacher,
ECC.1.13	I applied my mind to examine
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the things that are done under the sun and have found everything to be futile, a pursuit of the wind.
ECC.1.15	What is crooked cannot be straightened;
ECC.1.15	what is lacking cannot be counted.
ECC.1.16	I said to myself, “See, I have amassed wisdom far beyond all those who were over Jerusalem before me,
ECC.1.17	I applied my mind to know wisdom and knowledge,
ECC.1.18	For with much wisdom is much sorrow;
ECC.1.18	as knowledge increases, grief increases.
ECC.2.1	I said to myself, “Go ahead, I will test you with pleasure;
ECC.2.2	I said about laughter,
ECC.2.3	I explored with my mind the pull of wine
ECC.2.4	I increased my achievements. I built houses
ECC.2.5	I made gardens
ECC.2.6	I constructed reservoirs for myself from which to irrigate a grove of flourishing trees.
ECC.2.7	I acquired male and female servants and had slaves who were born in my house.
ECC.2.8	I also amassed silver and gold for myself, and the treasure of kings and provinces.
ECC.2.9	So I became great and surpassed all who were before me in Jerusalem;
ECC.2.10	All that my eyes desired, I did not deny them.
ECC.2.11	When I considered all that I had accomplished
ECC.2.12	Then I turned to consider wisdom,
ECC.2.13	And I realized that there is an advantage to wisdom over folly, like the advantage of light over darkness.
ECC.2.14	The wise person has eyes in his head,
ECC.2.14	but the fool walks in darkness.
ECC.2.14	Yet I also knew that one fate comes to them both.
ECC.2.15	So I said to myself, “What happens to the fool will also happen to me. Why then have I been overly wise?” 
ECC.2.16	For, just like the fool, there is no lasting remembrance of the wise,
ECC.2.17	Therefore, I hated life because the work that was done under the sun was distressing to me. For everything is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
ECC.2.18	I hated all my work that I labored at under the sun
ECC.2.19	And who knows whether he will be wise or a fool?
ECC.2.20	So I began to give myself over
ECC.2.21	When there is a person whose work was done with wisdom, knowledge, and skill,
ECC.2.22	For what does a person get with all his work and all his efforts
ECC.2.23	For all his days are filled with grief, and his occupation is sorrowful;
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a person than to eat, drink, and enjoy
ECC.2.25	because who can eat and who can enjoy life
ECC.2.26	For to the person who is pleasing in his sight, he gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy;
ECC.3.1	There is an occasion for everything,
ECC.3.1	and a time for every activity under heaven:
ECC.3.2	a time to give birth and a time to die;
ECC.3.2	a time to plant and a time to uproot;
ECC.3.3	a time to kill and a time to heal;
ECC.3.3	a time to tear down and a time to build;
ECC.3.4	a time to weep and a time to laugh;
ECC.3.4	a time to mourn and a time to dance;
ECC.3.5	a time to throw stones and a time to gather stones;
ECC.3.5	a time to embrace and a time to avoid embracing;
ECC.3.6	a time to search and a time to count as lost;
ECC.3.6	a time to keep and a time to throw away;
ECC.3.7	a time to tear and a time to sew;
ECC.3.7	a time to be silent and a time to speak;
ECC.3.8	a time to love and a time to hate;
ECC.3.8	a time for war and a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	What does the worker gain from his struggles?
ECC.3.10	I have seen the task that God has given the children of Adam to keep them occupied.
ECC.3.11	He has made everything appropriate
ECC.3.12	I know that there is nothing better for them than to rejoice and enjoy the
ECC.3.13	It is also the gift of God whenever anyone eats, drinks, and enjoys all his efforts.
ECC.3.14	I know that everything God does will last forever; there is no adding to it or taking from it.
ECC.3.15	Whatever is, has already been,
ECC.3.16	I also observed under the sun: there is wickedness at the place of judgment and there is wickedness at the place of righteousness.
ECC.3.17	I said to myself, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked,
ECC.3.18	I said to myself, “This happens so that God may test the children of Adam and they may see for themselves that they are like animals.”
ECC.3.19	For the fate of the children of Adam and the fate of animals is the same.
ECC.3.20	All are going to the same place; all come from dust, and all return to dust.
ECC.3.21	Who knows if the spirits of the children of Adam go upward and the spirits of animals go downward to the earth? 
ECC.3.22	I have seen that there is nothing better than for a person to enjoy his activities
ECC.4.1	Again, I observed all the acts of oppression being done under the sun.
ECC.4.2	So I commended the dead,
ECC.4.3	But better than either of them is the one who has not yet existed,
ECC.4.4	I saw that all labor and all skillful work is due to one person’s jealousy of another.
ECC.4.5	The fool folds his arms
ECC.4.5	and consumes his own flesh.
ECC.4.6	Better one handful with rest
ECC.4.6	than two handfuls with effort and a pursuit of the wind.
ECC.4.7	Again, I saw futility under the sun: 
ECC.4.8	There is a person without a companion,
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one because they have a good reward for their efforts. 
ECC.4.10	For if either falls, his companion can lift him up; but pity the one who falls without another to lift him up. 
ECC.4.11	Also, if two lie down together, they can keep warm; but how can one person alone keep warm?
ECC.4.12	And if someone overpowers one person, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not easily broken.
ECC.4.13	Better is a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer pays attention to warnings.
ECC.4.14	For he came from prison to be king,
ECC.4.15	I saw all the living, who move about under the sun, follow
ECC.4.16	There is no limit to all the people who were before them, yet those who come later will not rejoice in him. This too is futile and a pursuit of the wind.
ECC.5.1	Guard your steps when you go to the house of God. Better to approach in obedience than to offer the sacrifice as fools do,
ECC.5.2	Do not be hasty to speak, and do not be impulsive to make a speech before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few.
ECC.5.3	Just as dreams accompany much labor, so also a fool’s voice comes with many words.
ECC.5.4	When you make a vow to God,
ECC.5.5	Better that you do not vow than that you vow and not fulfill it.
ECC.5.6	Do not let your mouth bring guilt on you,
ECC.5.7	For many dreams bring futility, so do many words.
ECC.5.8	If you see oppression of the poor
ECC.5.9	The profit from the land is taken by all; the king is served by the field.
ECC.5.10	The one who loves silver is never satisfied with silver, and whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with income. This too is futile. 
ECC.5.11	When good things increase, the ones who consume them multiply; what, then, is the profit to the owner, except to gaze at them with his eyes? 
ECC.5.12	The sleep of the worker is sweet, whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich permits him no sleep.
ECC.5.13	There is a sickening tragedy I have seen under the sun: wealth kept by its owner to his harm.
ECC.5.14	That wealth was lost in a bad venture, so when he fathered a son, he was empty-handed. 
ECC.5.15	As he came from his mother’s womb, so he will go again, naked as he came;
ECC.5.16	This too is a sickening tragedy: exactly as he comes, so he will go. What does the one gain
ECC.5.17	What is more, he eats in darkness all his days,
ECC.5.18	Here is what I have seen to be good:
ECC.5.19	Furthermore, everyone to whom God has given riches and wealth,
ECC.5.20	for he does not often consider the days of his life because God keeps him occupied with the joy of his heart.
ECC.6.1	Here is a tragedy I have observed under the sun,
ECC.6.2	God gives a person riches, wealth, and honor
ECC.6.3	A man may father a hundred children and live many years. No matter how long he lives,
ECC.6.4	For he comes in futility and he goes in darkness, and his name is shrouded in darkness. 
ECC.6.5	Though a stillborn child does not see the sun and is not conscious, it has more rest than he. 
ECC.6.6	And if a person lives a thousand years twice, but does not experience happiness, do not both go to the same place?
ECC.6.7	All of a person’s labor is for his stomach,
ECC.6.7	yet the appetite is never satisfied.
ECC.6.8	What advantage then does the wise person have over the fool?
ECC.6.9	Better what the eyes see than wandering desire.
ECC.6.10	Whatever exists was given its name long ago,
ECC.6.11	For when there are many words, they increase futility.
ECC.6.12	For who knows what is good for anyone in life, in the few days of his futile life that he spends like a shadow?
ECC.7.1	A good name is better than fine perfume,
ECC.7.1	and the day of one’s death is better than the day of one’s birth.
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to a house of mourning
ECC.7.2	than to go to a house of feasting,
ECC.7.2	since that is the end of all mankind,
ECC.7.2	and the living should take it to heart.
ECC.7.3	Grief is better than laughter,
ECC.7.3	for when a face is sad, a heart may be glad.
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in a house of mourning,
ECC.7.4	but the heart of fools is in a house of pleasure.
ECC.7.5	It is better to listen to rebuke from a wise person
ECC.7.5	than to listen to the song of fools,
ECC.7.6	for like the crackling of burning thorns under the pot,
ECC.7.6	so is the laughter of the fool.
ECC.7.6	This too is futile.
ECC.7.7	Surely, the practice of extortion turns a wise person into a fool,
ECC.7.7	and a bribe corrupts the mind.
ECC.7.8	The end of a matter is better than its beginning;
ECC.7.8	a patient spirit is better than a proud spirit.
ECC.7.9	Don’t let your spirit rush to be angry,
ECC.7.9	for anger abides in the heart of fools.
ECC.7.10	Don’t say, “Why were the former days better than these?” 
ECC.7.10	since it is not wise of you to ask this.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom is as good as an inheritance
ECC.7.11	and an advantage to those who see the sun,
ECC.7.12	because wisdom is protection as silver is protection;
ECC.7.12	but the advantage of knowledge
ECC.7.12	is that wisdom preserves the life of its owner.
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God,
ECC.7.13	for who can straighten out
ECC.7.13	what he has made crooked?
ECC.7.14	In the day of prosperity be joyful,
ECC.7.15	In my futile life
ECC.7.16	Don’t be excessively righteous, and don’t be overly wise.
ECC.7.17	Don’t be excessively wicked, and don’t be foolish. Why should you die before your time?
ECC.7.18	It is good that you grasp the one and do not let the other slip from your hand. For the one who fears God will end up with both of them.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom makes the wise person stronger
ECC.7.19	than ten rulers of a city.
ECC.7.20	There is certainly no one righteous on the earth
ECC.7.20	who does good and never sins.
ECC.7.21	Don’t pay attention
ECC.7.22	for in your heart you know that many times you yourself have cursed others.
ECC.7.23	I have tested all this by wisdom. I resolved, “I will be wise,” but it was beyond me. 
ECC.7.24	What exists is beyond reach and very deep.
ECC.7.25	I turned my thoughts to know, explore, and examine wisdom
ECC.7.26	And I find more bitter than death
ECC.7.27	“Look,” says the Teacher, “I have discovered this by adding one thing to another to find out the explanation, 
ECC.7.28	which my soul continually searches for but does not find: I found one person in a thousand, but none of those was a woman.
ECC.7.29	Only see this: I have discovered that God made people upright,
ECC.8.1	Who is like the wise person, and who knows the interpretation of a matter? A person’s wisdom brightens his face, and the sternness of his face is changed.
ECC.8.2	Keep
ECC.8.3	Do not be in a hurry; leave his presence,
ECC.8.4	For the king’s word is authoritative, and who can say to him, “What are you doing?” 
ECC.8.5	The one who keeps a command will not experience anything harmful,
ECC.8.6	For every activity there is a right time and procedure,
ECC.8.7	Yet no one knows what will happen
ECC.8.8	No one has authority over the wind
ECC.8.9	All this I have seen, applying my mind to all the work that is done under the sun, at a time when one person has authority over another to his harm.
ECC.8.10	In such circumstances, I saw the wicked buried. They came and went from the holy place,
ECC.8.11	Because the sentence against an evil act is not carried out quickly,
ECC.8.12	Although a sinner does evil a hundred times and prolongs his life,
ECC.8.13	However, it will not go well with the wicked,
ECC.8.14	There is a futility that is done on the earth: there are righteous people who get what the actions of the wicked deserve,
ECC.8.15	So I commended enjoyment because there is nothing better for a person under the sun than to eat, drink, and enjoy himself,
ECC.8.16	When I applied my mind to know wisdom
ECC.8.17	I observed all the work of God and concluded that a person is unable to discover the work that is done under the sun. Even though a person labors hard to explore it, he cannot find it;
ECC.9.1	Indeed, I took all this to heart and explained it all: The righteous, the wise, and their works are in God’s hands.
ECC.9.2	Everything is the same for everyone:
ECC.9.3	This is an evil in all that is done under the sun: there is one fate for everyone. In addition, the hearts of people are full of evil, and madness is in their hearts while they live;
ECC.9.4	But there is hope for whoever is joined
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they will die, but the dead don’t know anything. There is no longer a reward for them because the memory of them is forgotten.
ECC.9.6	Their love, their hate, and their envy have already disappeared, and there is no longer a portion for them in all that is done under the sun.
ECC.9.7	Go, eat your bread with pleasure, and drink your wine with a cheerful heart, for God has already accepted your works.
ECC.9.8	Let your clothes be white all the time, and never let oil be lacking on your head.
ECC.9.9	Enjoy life with the wife you love all the days of your fleeting
ECC.9.10	Whatever your hands find to do, do with all your strength,
ECC.9.11	Again I saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift,
ECC.9.12	For certainly no one knows his time:
ECC.9.13	I have observed that this also is wisdom under the sun, and it is significant to me: 
ECC.9.14	There was a small city with few men in it. A great king came against it, surrounded it, and built large siege works against it. 
ECC.9.15	Now a poor wise man was found in the city,
ECC.9.16	And I said, “Wisdom is better than strength,
ECC.9.17	The calm words of the wise are heeded
ECC.9.17	more than the shouts of a ruler over fools.
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
ECC.9.18	but one sinner can destroy much good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies make a perfumer’s oil ferment and stink;
ECC.10.1	so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor.
ECC.10.2	A wise person’s heart goes to the
ECC.10.2	but a fool’s heart to the left.
ECC.10.3	Even when the fool walks along the road, his heart lacks sense,
ECC.10.3	and he shows everyone he is a fool.
ECC.10.4	If the ruler’s anger rises against you, don’t leave your post,
ECC.10.4	for calmness puts great offenses to rest.
ECC.10.5	There is an evil I have seen under the sun, an error proceeding from the presence of the ruler:
ECC.10.6	The fool is appointed to great heights,
ECC.10.6	but the rich remain in lowly positions.
ECC.10.7	I have seen slaves on horses,
ECC.10.7	but princes walking on the ground like slaves.
ECC.10.8	The one who digs a pit may fall into it,
ECC.10.8	and the one who breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake.
ECC.10.9	The one who quarries stones may be hurt by them;
ECC.10.9	the one who splits logs may be endangered by them.
ECC.10.10	If the ax is dull, and one does not sharpen its edge,
ECC.10.10	then one must exert more strength;
ECC.10.10	however, the advantage of wisdom is that it brings success.
ECC.10.11	If the snake bites before it is charmed,
ECC.10.11	then there is no advantage for the charmer.
ECC.10.12	The words from the mouth of a wise person are gracious,
ECC.10.12	but the lips of a fool consume him.
ECC.10.13	The beginning of the words from his mouth is folly,
ECC.10.13	but the end of his speaking is evil madness;
ECC.10.14	yet the fool multiplies words.
ECC.10.14	No one knows what will happen,
ECC.10.14	and who can tell anyone what will happen after him?
ECC.10.15	The struggles of fools weary them,
ECC.10.15	for they don’t know how to go to the city.
ECC.10.16	Woe to you, land, when your king is a youth
ECC.10.16	and your princes feast in the morning.
ECC.10.17	Blessed are you, land, when your king is a son of nobles
ECC.10.17	and your princes feast at the proper time —
ECC.10.17	for strength and not for drunkenness.
ECC.10.18	Because of laziness the roof caves in,
ECC.10.18	and because of negligent hands the house leaks.
ECC.10.19	A feast is prepared for laughter,
ECC.10.19	and wine makes life happy,
ECC.10.19	and money
ECC.10.20	Do not curse the king even in your thoughts,
ECC.10.20	and do not curse a rich person even in your bedroom,
ECC.10.20	for a bird of the sky may carry the message,
ECC.10.20	and a winged creature may report the matter.
ECC.11.1	Send your bread on the surface of the water,
ECC.11.1	for after many days you may find it.
ECC.11.2	Give a portion to seven or even to eight,
ECC.11.2	for you don’t know what disaster may happen on earth.
ECC.11.3	If the clouds are full, they will pour out rain on the earth;
ECC.11.3	whether a tree falls to the south or the north,
ECC.11.3	the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.
ECC.11.4	One who watches the wind will not sow,
ECC.11.4	and the one who looks at the clouds will not reap.
ECC.11.5	Just as you don’t know the path of the wind,
ECC.11.5	or how bones develop in
ECC.11.5	so also you don’t know the work of God who makes everything.
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow your seed,
ECC.11.6	and at evening do not let your hand rest,
ECC.11.6	because you don’t know which will succeed,
ECC.11.6	whether one or the other,
ECC.11.6	or if both of them will be equally good.
ECC.11.7	Light is sweet,
ECC.11.7	and it is pleasing for the eyes to see the sun.
ECC.11.8	Indeed, if someone lives many years,
ECC.11.8	let him rejoice in them all,
ECC.11.8	and let him remember the days of darkness,
ECC.11.8	All that comes is futile.
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, young person, while you are young,
ECC.11.9	and let your heart be glad in the days of your youth.
ECC.11.9	And walk in the ways of your heart
ECC.11.9	and in the desire of your eyes;
ECC.11.9	but know that for all of these things God will bring you to judgment.
ECC.11.10	Remove sorrow from your heart,
ECC.11.10	and put away pain from your flesh,
ECC.11.10	because youth and the prime of life are fleeting.
ECC.12.1	So remember your Creator in the days of your youth:
ECC.12.1	Before the days of adversity come,
ECC.12.1	and the years approach when you will say,
ECC.12.1	“I have no delight in them”;
ECC.12.2	before the sun and the light are darkened,
ECC.12.2	and the moon and the stars,
ECC.12.2	and the clouds return after
ECC.12.3	on the day when the guardians of the house tremble,
ECC.12.3	and the strong men stoop,
ECC.12.3	the women who grind grain cease because they are few,
ECC.12.3	and the ones who watch through the windows see dimly,
ECC.12.4	the doors at the street are shut
ECC.12.4	while the sound of the mill fades;
ECC.12.4	when one rises at the sound of a bird,
ECC.12.4	and all the daughters of song grow faint.
ECC.12.5	Also, they are afraid of heights and dangers on the road;
ECC.12.5	the almond tree blossoms,
ECC.12.5	the grasshopper loses its spring,
ECC.12.5	and the caper berry has no effect;
ECC.12.5	for the mere mortal is headed to his eternal home,
ECC.12.5	and mourners will walk around in the street;
ECC.12.6	before the silver cord is snapped,
ECC.12.6	and the gold bowl is broken,
ECC.12.6	and the jar is shattered at the spring,
ECC.12.6	and the wheel is broken into the well;
ECC.12.7	and the dust returns to the earth as it once was,
ECC.12.7	and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
ECC.12.8	“Absolute futility,” says the Teacher. “Everything is futile.”
ECC.12.9	In addition to the Teacher being a wise man, he constantly taught the people knowledge; he weighed, explored, and arranged many proverbs.
ECC.12.10	The Teacher sought to find delightful sayings and write words of truth accurately. 
ECC.12.11	The sayings of the wise are like cattle prods,
ECC.12.12	But beyond these, my son, be warned: there is no end to the making of many books,
ECC.12.13	When all has been heard, the conclusion of the matter is this: fear God
ECC.12.14	For God will bring every act to judgment,
SNG.1.1	The Song of Songs, which is Solomon’s.
SNG.1.2	Oh, that he would kiss me with the kisses of his mouth!
SNG.1.2	For your caresses
SNG.1.3	The fragrance of your perfume is intoxicating;
SNG.1.3	your name is perfume poured out.
SNG.1.3	No wonder young women
SNG.1.4	Take me with you
SNG.1.4	Oh, that the king would bring
SNG.1.4	We will rejoice and be glad in you;
SNG.1.4	we will celebrate your caresses more than wine.
SNG.1.4	It is only right that they adore you.
SNG.1.5	Daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.1.5	I am dark like the tents of Kedar,
SNG.1.5	yet lovely
SNG.1.6	Do not stare at me because I am dark,
SNG.1.6	for the sun has gazed on me.
SNG.1.6	My mother’s sons were angry with me;
SNG.1.6	they made me take care of the vineyards.
SNG.1.6	I have not taken care of my own vineyard.
SNG.1.7	Tell me, you whom I love:
SNG.1.7	Where do you pasture your sheep?
SNG.1.7	Where do you let them rest at noon?
SNG.1.7	Why should I be like one who veils herself
SNG.1.7	beside the flocks of your companions?
SNG.1.8	most beautiful of women,
SNG.1.8	follow
SNG.1.8	and pasture your young goats
SNG.1.8	near the shepherds’ tents.
SNG.1.9	I compare you, my darling,
SNG.1.9	to a
SNG.1.10	Your cheeks are beautiful with jewelry,
SNG.1.10	your neck with its necklace.
SNG.1.11	We will make gold jewelry for you,
SNG.1.11	accented with silver.
SNG.1.12	While the king is on his couch,
SNG.1.12	my perfume
SNG.1.13	The one I love is a sachet of myrrh to me,
SNG.1.13	spending the night between my breasts.
SNG.1.14	The one I love is a cluster of henna blossoms to me,
SNG.1.14	in the vineyards of En-gedi.
SNG.1.15	How beautiful you are, my darling.
SNG.1.15	How very beautiful!
SNG.1.15	Your eyes are doves.
SNG.1.16	How handsome you are, my love.
SNG.1.16	How delightful!
SNG.1.16	Our bed is verdant;
SNG.1.17	the beams of our house are cedars,
SNG.1.17	and our rafters are cypresses.
SNG.2.1	I am a wildflower
SNG.2.1	a lily
SNG.2.2	Like a lily among thorns,
SNG.2.2	so is my darling among the young women.
SNG.2.3	Like an apricot
SNG.2.3	so is my love among the young men.
SNG.2.3	I delight to sit in his shade,
SNG.2.3	and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the banquet hall,
SNG.2.4	and he looked on me with love.
SNG.2.5	Sustain me with raisins;
SNG.2.5	refresh me with apricots,
SNG.2.5	for I am lovesick.
SNG.2.6	May his left hand be under my head,
SNG.2.6	and his right arm embrace me.
SNG.2.7	Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you
SNG.2.7	by the gazelles and the wild does of the field,
SNG.2.7	do not stir up or awaken love
SNG.2.7	until the appropriate time.
SNG.2.8	Listen! My love is approaching.
SNG.2.8	Look! Here he comes,
SNG.2.8	leaping over the mountains,
SNG.2.8	bounding over the hills.
SNG.2.9	My love is like a gazelle
SNG.2.9	or a young stag.
SNG.2.9	See, he is standing behind our wall,
SNG.2.9	gazing through the windows,
SNG.2.9	peering through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My love calls to me:
SNG.2.10	Arise,
SNG.2.10	Come away, my beautiful one.
SNG.2.11	For now the winter is past;
SNG.2.11	the rain has ended and gone away.
SNG.2.12	The blossoms appear in the countryside.
SNG.2.12	The time of singing
SNG.2.12	and the turtledove’s cooing is heard in our land.
SNG.2.13	The fig tree ripens its figs;
SNG.2.13	the blossoming vines give off their fragrance.
SNG.2.13	Arise, my darling.
SNG.2.13	Come away, my beautiful one.
SNG.2.14	My dove,
SNG.2.14	in the crevices of the cliff,
SNG.2.14	let me see your face,
SNG.2.14	let me hear your voice;
SNG.2.14	for your voice is sweet,
SNG.2.14	and your face is lovely.
SNG.2.15	the little foxes that ruin the vineyards —
SNG.2.15	for our vineyards are in bloom.
SNG.2.16	My love is mine and I am his;
SNG.2.16	he feeds among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	Until the day breaks
SNG.2.17	and the shadows flee,
SNG.2.17	turn around, my love, and be like a gazelle
SNG.2.17	or a young stag
SNG.3.1	In my bed at night
SNG.3.1	I sought the one I love;
SNG.3.1	I sought him, but did not find him.
SNG.3.2	I will arise now and go about the city,
SNG.3.2	through the streets and the plazas.
SNG.3.2	I will seek the one I love.
SNG.3.2	I sought him, but did not find him.
SNG.3.3	The guards who go about the city found me.
SNG.3.3	I asked them, “Have you seen the one I love?”
SNG.3.4	I had just passed them
SNG.3.4	when I found the one I love.
SNG.3.4	I held on to him and would not let him go
SNG.3.4	until I brought him to my mother’s house
SNG.3.4	to the chamber of the one who conceived me.
SNG.3.5	Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you
SNG.3.5	by the gazelles and the wild does of the field,
SNG.3.5	do not stir up or awaken love
SNG.3.5	until the appropriate time.
SNG.3.6	Who is this
SNG.3.6	like columns of smoke,
SNG.3.6	scented with myrrh and frankincense
SNG.3.6	from every fragrant powder of the merchant?
SNG.3.7	Look! Solomon’s bed
SNG.3.7	surrounded by sixty warriors
SNG.3.7	from the mighty men of Israel.
SNG.3.8	All of them are skilled with swords
SNG.3.8	and trained in warfare.
SNG.3.8	Each has his sword at his side
SNG.3.8	to guard against the terror of the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon made a carriage for himself
SNG.3.9	with wood from Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made its posts of silver,
SNG.3.10	its back
SNG.3.10	and its seat of purple.
SNG.3.10	Its interior is inlaid with love
SNG.3.10	by the young women of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Go out, young women of Zion,
SNG.3.11	and gaze at King Solomon,
SNG.3.11	wearing the crown his mother placed on him
SNG.3.11	on the day of his wedding
SNG.3.11	the day of his heart’s rejoicing.
SNG.4.1	How beautiful you are, my darling.
SNG.4.1	How very beautiful!
SNG.4.1	Behind your veil,
SNG.4.1	your eyes are doves.
SNG.4.1	Your hair is like a flock of goats
SNG.4.1	streaming down Mount Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are like a flock of newly shorn sheep
SNG.4.2	coming up from washing,
SNG.4.2	each one bearing twins,
SNG.4.2	and none has lost its young.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like a scarlet cord,
SNG.4.3	and your mouth
SNG.4.3	Behind your veil,
SNG.4.3	your brow
SNG.4.4	Your neck is like the tower of David,
SNG.4.4	constructed in layers.
SNG.4.4	A thousand shields are hung on it —
SNG.4.4	all of them shields of warriors.
SNG.4.5	Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.4.5	twins of a gazelle,
SNG.4.6	Until the day breaks
SNG.4.6	and the shadows flee,
SNG.4.6	I will make my way to the mountain of myrrh
SNG.4.6	and the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	You are absolutely beautiful,
SNG.4.7	there is no imperfection in you.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon,
SNG.4.8	come with me from Lebanon!
SNG.4.8	Descend from the peak of Amana,
SNG.4.8	from the summit of Senir and Hermon,
SNG.4.8	from the dens of the lions,
SNG.4.8	from the mountains of the leopards.
SNG.4.9	You have captured my heart,
SNG.4.9	You have captured my heart with one glance of your eyes,
SNG.4.9	with one jewel of your necklace.
SNG.4.10	How delightful your caresses are, my sister, my bride.
SNG.4.10	Your caresses are much better than wine,
SNG.4.10	and the fragrance of your perfume than any balsam.
SNG.4.11	Your lips drip sweetness like the honeycomb, my bride.
SNG.4.11	Honey and milk
SNG.4.11	The fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	My sister, my bride, you are a locked garden —
SNG.4.12	a locked garden
SNG.4.13	Your branches are a paradise
SNG.4.13	with choicest fruits;
SNG.4.13	henna with nard,
SNG.4.14	nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	with all the trees of frankincense,
SNG.4.14	myrrh and aloes,
SNG.4.14	with all the best spices.
SNG.4.15	You are a garden spring,
SNG.4.15	a well of flowing water
SNG.4.15	streaming from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awaken,
SNG.4.16	come, south wind.
SNG.4.16	Blow on my garden,
SNG.4.16	and spread the fragrance of its spices.
SNG.4.16	Let my love come to his garden
SNG.4.16	and eat its choicest fruits.
SNG.5.1	I have come to my garden — my sister, my bride.
SNG.5.1	I gather
SNG.5.1	I eat my honeycomb with my honey.
SNG.5.1	I drink my wine with my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, friends!
SNG.5.1	Drink, be intoxicated with caresses!
SNG.5.2	I was sleeping, but my heart was awake.
SNG.5.2	A sound! My love was knocking!
SNG.5.2	Open to me, my sister, my darling,
SNG.5.2	my dove, my perfect one.
SNG.5.2	For my head is drenched with dew,
SNG.5.2	my hair with droplets of the night.
SNG.5.3	I have taken off my clothing.
SNG.5.3	How can I put it back on?
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet.
SNG.5.3	How can I get them dirty?
SNG.5.4	My love thrust his hand through the opening,
SNG.5.4	and my feelings were stirred for him.
SNG.5.5	I rose to open for my love.
SNG.5.5	My hands dripped with myrrh,
SNG.5.5	my fingers with flowing myrrh
SNG.5.5	on the handles of the bolt.
SNG.5.6	I opened to my love,
SNG.5.6	but my love had turned and gone away.
SNG.5.6	My heart sank
SNG.5.6	I sought him, but did not find him.
SNG.5.6	I called him, but he did not answer.
SNG.5.7	The guards who go about the city found me.
SNG.5.7	They beat and wounded me;
SNG.5.7	they took my cloak
SNG.5.7	the guardians of the walls.
SNG.5.8	Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you,
SNG.5.8	if you find my love,
SNG.5.8	tell him that I am lovesick.
SNG.5.9	What makes the one you love better than another,
SNG.5.9	most beautiful of women?
SNG.5.9	What makes him better than another,
SNG.5.9	that you would give us this charge?
SNG.5.10	My love is fit and strong,
SNG.5.10	notable among ten thousand.
SNG.5.11	His head is purest gold.
SNG.5.11	His hair is wavy
SNG.5.11	and black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves
SNG.5.12	beside flowing streams,
SNG.5.12	washed in milk
SNG.5.12	and set like jewels.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks
SNG.5.13	mounds of
SNG.5.13	His lips are lilies,
SNG.5.13	dripping with flowing myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His arms
SNG.5.14	set
SNG.5.14	His body
SNG.5.14	covered with lapis lazuli.
SNG.5.15	His legs are alabaster pillars
SNG.5.15	set on pedestals of pure gold.
SNG.5.15	His presence is like Lebanon,
SNG.5.15	as majestic as the cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is sweetness.
SNG.5.16	He is absolutely desirable.
SNG.5.16	This is my love, and this is my friend,
SNG.5.16	young women of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	Where has your love gone,
SNG.6.1	most beautiful of women?
SNG.6.1	Which way has he
SNG.6.1	We will seek him with you.
SNG.6.2	My love has gone down to his garden,
SNG.6.2	to beds of spice,
SNG.6.2	to feed in the gardens
SNG.6.2	and gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my love’s and my love is mine;
SNG.6.3	he feeds among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	You are as beautiful as Tirzah, my darling,
SNG.6.4	lovely as Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	awe-inspiring as an army with banners.
SNG.6.5	Turn your eyes away from me,
SNG.6.5	for they captivate me.
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a flock of goats
SNG.6.5	streaming down from Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are like a flock of ewes
SNG.6.6	coming up from washing,
SNG.6.6	each one having a twin,
SNG.6.6	and not one missing.
SNG.6.7	Behind your veil,
SNG.6.7	your brow
SNG.6.8	There are sixty queens
SNG.6.8	and eighty concubines
SNG.6.8	and young women
SNG.6.9	But my dove,
SNG.6.9	she is the favorite of her mother,
SNG.6.9	perfect to the one who gave her birth.
SNG.6.9	Women see her and declare her fortunate;
SNG.6.9	queens and concubines also, and they sing her praises:
SNG.6.10	Who is this
SNG.6.10	as beautiful as the moon,
SNG.6.10	bright as the sun,
SNG.6.10	awe-inspiring as an army with banners?
SNG.6.11	I came down to the walnut grove
SNG.6.11	to see the blossoms of the valley,
SNG.6.11	to see if the vines were budding
SNG.6.11	and the pomegranates blooming.
SNG.6.12	I didn’t know what was happening to me.
SNG.6.12	I felt like I was
SNG.6.12	in a chariot with a nobleman.
SNG.6.13	Come back, come back, Shulammite!
SNG.6.13	Come back, come back, that we may look at you!
SNG.6.13	How you gaze at the Shulammite,
SNG.6.13	as you look at the dance
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are your sandaled feet, princess!
SNG.7.1	The curves of your thighs are like jewelry,
SNG.7.1	the handiwork of a master.
SNG.7.2	Your navel is a rounded bowl;
SNG.7.2	it never lacks mixed wine.
SNG.7.2	Your belly is a mound of wheat
SNG.7.2	surrounded by lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	twins of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like a tower of ivory,
SNG.7.4	your eyes like pools in Heshbon
SNG.7.4	by Bath-rabbim’s gate.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon
SNG.7.4	looking toward Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head crowns you
SNG.7.5	the hair of your head like purple cloth —
SNG.7.5	a king could be held captive
SNG.7.6	How beautiful you are and how pleasant,
SNG.7.6	my love, with such delights!
SNG.7.7	Your stature is like a palm tree;
SNG.7.7	your breasts are clusters of fruit.
SNG.7.8	I said, “I will climb the palm tree
SNG.7.8	and take hold of its fruit.”
SNG.7.8	May your breasts be like clusters of grapes,
SNG.7.8	and the fragrance of your breath like apricots.
SNG.7.9	Your mouth
SNG.7.9	flowing smoothly for my love,
SNG.7.9	gliding past my lips and teeth!
SNG.7.10	I am my love’s,
SNG.7.10	and his desire
SNG.7.11	Come, my love,
SNG.7.11	let’s go to the field;
SNG.7.11	let’s spend the night among the henna blossoms.
SNG.7.12	Let’s go early to the vineyards;
SNG.7.12	let’s see if the vine has budded,
SNG.7.12	if the blossom has opened,
SNG.7.12	if the pomegranates are in bloom.
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my caresses.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes
SNG.7.13	and at our doors is every delicacy,
SNG.7.13	both new and old.
SNG.7.13	I have treasured them up for you, my love.
SNG.8.1	If only I could treat you like my brother,
SNG.8.1	one who nursed at my mother’s breasts,
SNG.8.1	I would find you in public and kiss you,
SNG.8.1	and no one would scorn me.
SNG.8.2	I would lead you, I would take you,
SNG.8.2	to the house of my mother
SNG.8.2	I would give you spiced wine to drink
SNG.8.2	from the juice of my pomegranate.
SNG.8.3	May his left hand be under my head,
SNG.8.3	and his right arm embrace me.
SNG.8.4	Young women of Jerusalem, I charge you,
SNG.8.4	do not stir up or awaken love
SNG.8.4	until the appropriate time.
SNG.8.5	Who is this
SNG.8.5	leaning on the one she loves?
SNG.8.5	I awakened you under the apricot tree.
SNG.8.5	There your mother conceived you;
SNG.8.5	there she conceived and gave you birth.
SNG.8.6	Set me as a seal on your heart,
SNG.8.6	as a seal on your arm.
SNG.8.6	For love is as strong as death;
SNG.8.6	jealousy is as unrelenting as Sheol.
SNG.8.6	Love’s flames are fiery flames
SNG.8.6	an almighty flame!
SNG.8.7	A huge torrent cannot extinguish love;
SNG.8.7	rivers cannot sweep it away.
SNG.8.7	If a man were to give all his wealth
SNG.8.7	it would be utterly scorned.
SNG.8.8	Our sister is young;
SNG.8.8	she has no breasts.
SNG.8.8	What will we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	on the day she is spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall,
SNG.8.9	we will build a silver barricade on her.
SNG.8.9	If she is a door,
SNG.8.9	we will enclose her with cedar planks.
SNG.8.10	I am
SNG.8.10	and my breasts like towers.
SNG.8.10	So in his eyes I have become
SNG.8.10	like one who finds
SNG.8.11	Solomon owned a vineyard in Baal-hamon.
SNG.8.11	He leased the vineyard to tenants.
SNG.8.11	Each was to bring for his fruit
SNG.8.11	one thousand pieces of silver.
SNG.8.12	I have my own vineyard.
SNG.8.12	The one thousand are for you, Solomon,
SNG.8.12	but two hundred for those who take care of its fruits.
SNG.8.13	You
SNG.8.13	companions
SNG.8.13	let me hear you!
SNG.8.14	Run away with me,
SNG.8.14	and be like a gazelle
SNG.8.14	or a young stag
SNG.8.14	on the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	The vision
ISA.1.2	Listen, heavens, and pay attention, earth,
ISA.1.2	for the 
ISA.1.2	“I have raised children
ISA.1.2	but they have rebelled against me.
ISA.1.3	The ox knows its owner,
ISA.1.3	and the donkey its master’s feeding trough,
ISA.1.3	but Israel does not know;
ISA.1.3	my people do not understand.”
ISA.1.4	Oh sinful nation,
ISA.1.4	people weighed down with iniquity,
ISA.1.4	brood of evildoers,
ISA.1.4	depraved children!
ISA.1.4	They have abandoned
ISA.1.4	they have despised
ISA.1.4	they have turned their backs on him.
ISA.1.5	Why do you want more beatings?
ISA.1.5	Why do you keep on rebelling?
ISA.1.5	The whole head is hurt,
ISA.1.5	and the whole heart is sick.
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even to the head,
ISA.1.6	no spot is uninjured
ISA.1.6	wounds, welts, and festering sores
ISA.1.6	not cleansed, bandaged,
ISA.1.6	or soothed with oil.
ISA.1.7	Your land is desolate,
ISA.1.7	your cities burned down;
ISA.1.7	foreigners devour your fields
ISA.1.7	right in front of you —
ISA.1.7	a desolation, like a place demolished by foreigners.
ISA.1.8	Daughter Zion
ISA.1.8	like a shelter in a vineyard,
ISA.1.8	like a shack in a cucumber field,
ISA.1.8	like a besieged city.
ISA.1.9	If the 
ISA.1.9	had not left us a few survivors,
ISA.1.9	we would be like Sodom,
ISA.1.9	we would resemble Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the 
ISA.1.10	you rulers of Sodom!
ISA.1.10	Listen to the instruction of our God,
ISA.1.10	you people of Gomorrah!
ISA.1.11	“What are all your sacrifices to me?”
ISA.1.11	asks the 
ISA.1.11	“I have had enough of burnt offerings and rams
ISA.1.11	and the fat of well-fed cattle;
ISA.1.11	I have no desire for the blood of bulls,
ISA.1.11	lambs, or male goats.
ISA.1.12	When you come to appear before me,
ISA.1.12	who requires this from you —
ISA.1.12	this trampling of my courts?
ISA.1.13	Stop bringing useless offerings.
ISA.1.13	Your incense is detestable to me.
ISA.1.13	New Moons and Sabbaths,
ISA.1.13	and the calling of solemn assemblies
ISA.1.13	I cannot stand iniquity
ISA.1.14	I hate your New Moons and prescribed festivals.
ISA.1.14	They have become a burden to me;
ISA.1.14	I am tired of putting up with them.
ISA.1.15	When you spread out your hands in prayer,
ISA.1.15	I will refuse to look at you;
ISA.1.15	even if you offer countless prayers,
ISA.1.15	I will not listen.
ISA.1.15	Your hands are covered with blood.
ISA.1.16	“Wash yourselves. Cleanse yourselves.
ISA.1.16	Remove your evil deeds from my sight.
ISA.1.16	Stop doing evil.
ISA.1.17	Learn to do what is good.
ISA.1.17	Pursue justice.
ISA.1.17	Correct the oppressor.
ISA.1.17	Defend the rights of the fatherless.
ISA.1.17	Plead the widow’s cause.
ISA.1.18	“Come, let us settle this,”
ISA.1.18	says the 
ISA.1.18	“Though your sins are scarlet,
ISA.1.18	they will be as white as snow;
ISA.1.18	though they are crimson red,
ISA.1.18	they will be like wool.
ISA.1.19	If you are willing and obedient,
ISA.1.19	you will eat the good things of the land.
ISA.1.20	But if you refuse and rebel,
ISA.1.20	you will be devoured by the sword.”
ISA.1.20	For the mouth of the 
ISA.1.21	The faithful town —
ISA.1.21	what an adulteress
ISA.1.21	She was once full of justice.
ISA.1.21	Righteousness once dwelt in her,
ISA.1.21	but now, murderers!
ISA.1.22	Your silver has become dross to be discarded,
ISA.1.22	your beer
ISA.1.23	Your rulers are rebels,
ISA.1.23	friends of thieves.
ISA.1.23	They all love graft
ISA.1.23	and chase after bribes.
ISA.1.23	They do not defend the rights of the fatherless,
ISA.1.23	and the widow’s case never comes before them.
ISA.1.24	Therefore the Lord 
ISA.1.24	the Mighty One of Israel, declares:
ISA.1.24	“Ah, I will get even with my foes;
ISA.1.24	I will take revenge against my enemies.
ISA.1.25	I will turn my hand against you
ISA.1.25	and will burn away your dross completely;
ISA.1.25	I will remove all your impurities.
ISA.1.26	I will restore your judges
ISA.1.26	and your advisers to what they were at the start.
ISA.1.26	Afterward you will be called the Righteous City,
ISA.1.26	a Faithful Town.”
ISA.1.27	Zion will be redeemed by justice,
ISA.1.27	those who repent, by righteousness.
ISA.1.28	At the same time both rebels and sinners will be broken,
ISA.1.28	and those who abandon the 
ISA.1.29	Indeed, they
ISA.1.29	you desired,
ISA.1.29	and you will be embarrassed because of the garden shrines
ISA.1.29	you have chosen.
ISA.1.30	For you will become like an oak
ISA.1.30	whose leaves are withered,
ISA.1.30	and like a garden without water.
ISA.1.31	The strong one will become tinder,
ISA.1.31	and his work a spark;
ISA.1.31	both will burn together,
ISA.1.31	with no one to extinguish the flames.
ISA.2.1	The vision that Isaiah
ISA.2.2	In
ISA.2.2	the mountain of the 
ISA.2.2	at the top of the mountains
ISA.2.2	and will be raised above the hills.
ISA.2.2	All nations will stream to it,
ISA.2.3	and many peoples will come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.3	to the house of the God of Jacob.
ISA.2.3	He will teach us about his ways
ISA.2.3	so that we may walk in his paths.”
ISA.2.3	For instruction will go out of Zion
ISA.2.3	and the word of the 
ISA.2.4	He will settle disputes among the nations
ISA.2.4	and provide arbitration for many peoples.
ISA.2.4	They will beat their swords into plows
ISA.2.4	and their spears into pruning knives.
ISA.2.4	Nation will not take up the sword against nation,
ISA.2.4	and they will never again train for war.
ISA.2.5	House of Jacob,
ISA.2.5	come and let us walk in the 
ISA.2.6	For you have abandoned
ISA.2.6	the house of Jacob,
ISA.2.6	because they are full of divination from the East
ISA.2.6	and of fortune-tellers
ISA.2.6	They are in league
ISA.2.7	Their
ISA.2.7	and there is no limit to their treasures;
ISA.2.7	their land is full of horses,
ISA.2.7	and there is no limit to their chariots.
ISA.2.8	Their land is full of idols;
ISA.2.8	they worship the work of their hands,
ISA.2.8	what their fingers have made.
ISA.2.9	So humanity is brought low,
ISA.2.9	and each person is humbled.
ISA.2.9	Do not forgive them!
ISA.2.10	Go into the rocks
ISA.2.10	and hide in the dust
ISA.2.10	from the terror of the 
ISA.2.10	and from his majestic splendor.
ISA.2.11	The pride of mankind
ISA.2.11	and human loftiness will be brought low;
ISA.2.11	the 
ISA.2.12	For a day belonging to the 
ISA.2.12	against all that is proud and lofty,
ISA.2.12	against all that is lifted up — it will be humbled —
ISA.2.13	against all the cedars of Lebanon,
ISA.2.13	lofty and lifted up,
ISA.2.13	against all the oaks of Bashan,
ISA.2.14	against all the high mountains,
ISA.2.14	against all the lofty hills,
ISA.2.15	against every high tower,
ISA.2.15	against every fortified wall,
ISA.2.16	against every ship of Tarshish,
ISA.2.16	and against every splendid sea vessel.
ISA.2.17	The pride of mankind will be brought low,
ISA.2.17	and human loftiness will be humbled;
ISA.2.17	the 
ISA.2.18	The idols will vanish completely.
ISA.2.19	People will go into caves in the rocks
ISA.2.19	and holes in the ground,
ISA.2.19	away from the terror of the 
ISA.2.19	and from his majestic splendor,
ISA.2.19	when he rises to terrify the earth.
ISA.2.20	On that day people will throw
ISA.2.20	their silver and gold idols,
ISA.2.20	which they made to worship,
ISA.2.20	to the moles and the bats.
ISA.2.21	They will go into the caves of the rocks
ISA.2.21	and the crevices in the cliffs,
ISA.2.21	away from the terror of the 
ISA.2.21	and from his majestic splendor,
ISA.2.21	when he rises to terrify the earth.
ISA.2.22	Put no more trust in a mere human,
ISA.2.22	who has only the breath in his nostrils.
ISA.2.22	What is he really worth?
ISA.3.1	Note this: The Lord 
ISA.3.1	is about to remove from Jerusalem and from Judah
ISA.3.1	every kind of security:
ISA.3.1	the entire supply of bread and water,
ISA.3.2	heroes and warriors,
ISA.3.2	judges and prophets,
ISA.3.2	fortune-tellers and elders,
ISA.3.3	commanders of fifty and dignitaries,
ISA.3.3	counselors, cunning magicians,
ISA.3.4	“I will make youths their leaders,
ISA.3.4	and unstable rulers
ISA.3.5	The people will oppress one another,
ISA.3.5	man against man, neighbor against neighbor;
ISA.3.5	the young will act arrogantly toward the old,
ISA.3.5	and the worthless toward the honorable.
ISA.3.6	A man will even seize his brother
ISA.3.6	in his father’s house, saying:
ISA.3.6	“You have a cloak — you be our leader!
ISA.3.6	This heap of rubble will be under your control.”
ISA.3.7	On that day he will cry out, saying:
ISA.3.7	“I’m not a healer.
ISA.3.7	I don’t even have food or clothing in my house.
ISA.3.7	Don’t make me the leader of the people!”
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem has stumbled
ISA.3.8	and Judah has fallen
ISA.3.8	because they have spoken and acted against the 
ISA.3.8	defying his glorious presence.
ISA.3.9	The look on their faces testifies against them,
ISA.3.9	and like Sodom,
ISA.3.9	they do not conceal it.
ISA.3.9	Woe to them,
ISA.3.9	for they have brought disaster on themselves.
ISA.3.10	Tell the righteous that it will go well for them,
ISA.3.10	for they will eat the fruit of their labor.
ISA.3.11	Woe to the wicked — it will go badly for them,
ISA.3.11	for what they have done will be done to them.
ISA.3.12	Youths oppress my people,
ISA.3.12	and women rule over them.
ISA.3.12	My people, your leaders mislead you;
ISA.3.12	they confuse the direction of your paths.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.13	and stands to judge the people.
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.14	against the elders and leaders of his people:
ISA.3.14	“You have devastated the vineyard.
ISA.3.14	The plunder from the poor is in your houses.
ISA.3.15	Why do you crush my people
ISA.3.15	and grind the faces of the poor?”
ISA.3.15	This is the declaration of the Lord 
ISA.3.16	The 
ISA.3.16	Because the daughters of Zion are haughty,
ISA.3.16	walking with heads held high
ISA.3.16	and seductive eyes,
ISA.3.16	prancing along,
ISA.3.16	jingling their ankle bracelets,
ISA.3.17	the Lord will put scabs on the heads
ISA.3.17	of the daughters of Zion,
ISA.3.17	and the 
ISA.3.18	On that day
ISA.3.19	pendants, bracelets, veils, 
ISA.3.20	headdresses, ankle jewelry, sashes, perfume bottles, amulets,
ISA.3.21	signet rings, nose rings,
ISA.3.22	festive robes, capes, cloaks, purses, 
ISA.3.23	garments, linen clothes, turbans, and shawls.
ISA.3.24	Instead of perfume there will be a stench;
ISA.3.24	instead of a belt, a rope;
ISA.3.24	instead of beautifully styled hair,
ISA.3.24	instead of fine clothes, sackcloth;
ISA.3.24	instead of beauty, branding.
ISA.3.25	Your men will fall by the sword,
ISA.3.25	your warriors in battle.
ISA.3.26	Then her gates
ISA.3.26	deserted, she will sit on the ground.
ISA.4.1	On that day seven women
ISA.4.1	will seize one man,
ISA.4.1	“We will eat our own bread
ISA.4.1	and provide our own clothing.
ISA.4.1	Just let us bear your name.
ISA.4.1	Take away our disgrace.”
ISA.4.2	On that day the Branch
ISA.4.3	Whoever remains in Zion and whoever is left in Jerusalem
ISA.4.4	when the Lord has washed away the filth
ISA.4.5	Then the 
ISA.4.6	and there will be a shelter for shade from heat by day, and a refuge and shelter from storm and rain.
ISA.5.1	I will sing about the one I love,
ISA.5.1	a song about my loved one’s vineyard:
ISA.5.1	The one I love had a vineyard
ISA.5.1	on a very fertile hill.
ISA.5.2	He broke up the soil, cleared it of stones,
ISA.5.2	and planted it with the finest vines.
ISA.5.2	He built a tower in the middle of it
ISA.5.2	and even dug out a winepress there.
ISA.5.2	He expected
ISA.5.2	but it yielded worthless grapes.
ISA.5.3	So now, residents of Jerusalem
ISA.5.3	and men of Judah,
ISA.5.3	please judge between me
ISA.5.3	and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What more could I have done for my vineyard
ISA.5.4	than I did?
ISA.5.4	Why, when I expected a yield of good grapes,
ISA.5.4	did it yield worthless grapes?
ISA.5.5	Now I will tell you
ISA.5.5	what I am about to do to my vineyard:
ISA.5.5	I will remove its hedge,
ISA.5.5	and it will be consumed;
ISA.5.5	I will tear down its wall,
ISA.5.5	and it will be trampled.
ISA.5.6	I will make it a wasteland.
ISA.5.6	It will not be pruned or weeded;
ISA.5.6	thorns and briers will grow up.
ISA.5.6	I will also give orders to the clouds
ISA.5.6	that rain should not fall on it.
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.7	is the house of Israel,
ISA.5.7	and the men
ISA.5.7	the plant he delighted in.
ISA.5.7	He expected justice
ISA.5.7	but saw injustice;
ISA.5.7	he expected righteousness,
ISA.5.7	but heard cries of despair.
ISA.5.8	Woe to those who add house to house
ISA.5.8	and join field to field
ISA.5.8	until there is no more room
ISA.5.8	and you alone are left in the land.
ISA.5.9	I heard the 
ISA.5.9	Indeed, many houses
ISA.5.9	grand and lovely ones without inhabitants.
ISA.5.10	For a ten-acre
ISA.5.10	only six gallons of wine,
ISA.5.10	and ten bushels
ISA.5.10	only one bushel of grain.
ISA.5.11	Woe to those who rise early in the morning
ISA.5.11	in pursuit of beer,
ISA.5.11	who linger into the evening,
ISA.5.11	inflamed by wine.
ISA.5.12	At their feasts they have lyre, harp,
ISA.5.12	tambourine, flute, and wine.
ISA.5.12	They do not perceive the 
ISA.5.12	and they do not see the work of his hands.
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people will go into exile
ISA.5.13	because they lack knowledge;
ISA.5.13	her
ISA.5.13	and her masses are parched with thirst.
ISA.5.14	Therefore Sheol enlarges its throat
ISA.5.14	and opens wide its enormous jaws,
ISA.5.14	and down go Zion’s dignitaries, her masses,
ISA.5.14	her crowds, and those who celebrate in her!
ISA.5.15	Humanity is brought low, each person is humbled,
ISA.5.15	and haughty eyes are humbled.
ISA.5.16	But the 
ISA.5.16	and the holy God
ISA.5.17	Lambs will graze
ISA.5.17	as if in
ISA.5.17	and resident aliens
ISA.5.17	among the ruins of the rich.
ISA.5.18	Woe to those who drag iniquity
ISA.5.18	with cords of deceit
ISA.5.18	and pull sin along with cart ropes,
ISA.5.19	to those who say:
ISA.5.19	“Let him hurry up and do his work quickly
ISA.5.19	so that we can see it!
ISA.5.19	Let the plan
ISA.5.19	so that we can know it!”
ISA.5.20	Woe to those who call evil good
ISA.5.20	and good evil,
ISA.5.20	who substitute darkness for light
ISA.5.20	and light for darkness,
ISA.5.20	who substitute bitter for sweet
ISA.5.20	and sweet for bitter.
ISA.5.21	Woe to those who consider themselves wise
ISA.5.21	and judge themselves clever.
ISA.5.22	Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine,
ISA.5.22	who are champions at pouring beer,
ISA.5.23	who acquit the guilty for a bribe
ISA.5.23	and deprive the innocent of justice.
ISA.5.24	Therefore, as a tongue of fire consumes straw
ISA.5.24	and as dry grass shrivels in the flame,
ISA.5.24	so their roots will become like something rotten
ISA.5.24	and their blossoms will blow away like dust,
ISA.5.24	for they have rejected
ISA.5.24	the instruction of the 
ISA.5.24	and they have despised
ISA.5.24	the word of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.5.25	Therefore the 
ISA.5.25	He raised his hand against them and struck them;
ISA.5.25	the mountains quaked,
ISA.5.25	and their corpses were like garbage in the streets.
ISA.5.25	In all this, his anger has not turned away,
ISA.5.25	and his hand is still raised to strike.
ISA.5.26	He raises a signal flag for the distant nations
ISA.5.26	and whistles
ISA.5.26	Look — how quickly and swiftly they come!
ISA.5.27	None of them grows weary or stumbles;
ISA.5.27	no one slumbers or sleeps.
ISA.5.27	No belt is loose
ISA.5.27	and no sandal strap broken.
ISA.5.28	Their arrows are sharpened,
ISA.5.28	and all their bows strung.
ISA.5.28	Their horses’ hooves are like flint;
ISA.5.28	their chariot wheels are like a whirlwind.
ISA.5.29	Their roaring is like a lion’s;
ISA.5.29	they roar like young lions;
ISA.5.29	they growl and seize their prey
ISA.5.29	and carry it off,
ISA.5.29	and no one can rescue it.
ISA.5.30	On that day they will roar over it,
ISA.5.30	like the roaring of the sea.
ISA.5.30	When one looks at the land,
ISA.5.30	there will be darkness and distress;
ISA.5.30	light will be obscured by clouds.
ISA.6.1	In the year that King Uzziah
ISA.6.2	Seraphim
ISA.6.3	And one called to another:
ISA.6.3	Holy, holy, holy is the 
ISA.6.3	his glory
ISA.6.4	The foundations of the doorways shook
ISA.6.5	Then I said:
ISA.6.5	Woe is me
ISA.6.5	because I am a man of unclean lips
ISA.6.5	and live among a people of unclean lips,
ISA.6.5	and because my eyes have seen the King,
ISA.6.5	the 
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand was a glowing coal that he had taken from the altar
ISA.6.7	He touched my mouth
ISA.6.7	Now that this has touched your lips,
ISA.6.7	your iniquity is removed
ISA.6.7	and your sin is atoned for.
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the voice of the Lord asking:
ISA.6.8	Who should I send?
ISA.6.8	Who will go for us?
ISA.6.8	I said:
ISA.6.8	Here I am. Send me.
ISA.6.9	And he replied:
ISA.6.9	Go! Say to these people:
ISA.6.9	Keep listening, but do not understand;
ISA.6.9	keep looking, but do not perceive.
ISA.6.10	Make the minds
ISA.6.10	deafen their ears and blind their eyes;
ISA.6.10	otherwise they might see with their eyes
ISA.6.10	and hear with their ears,
ISA.6.10	understand with their minds,
ISA.6.10	turn back, and be healed.
ISA.6.11	Then I said, “Until when, Lord?” 
ISA.6.11	Until cities lie in ruins without inhabitants,
ISA.6.11	houses are without people,
ISA.6.11	the land is ruined and desolate,
ISA.6.12	and the 
ISA.6.12	leaving great emptiness in the land.
ISA.6.13	Though a tenth will remain in the land,
ISA.6.13	it will be burned again.
ISA.6.13	Like the terebinth or the oak
ISA.6.13	that leaves a stump when felled,
ISA.6.13	the holy seed
ISA.7.1	This took place during the reign of Ahaz, son of Jotham, son of Uzziah king of Judah:
ISA.7.2	When it became known to the house of David
ISA.7.3	The 
ISA.7.4	Say to him: Calm down and be quiet. Don’t be afraid or cowardly
ISA.7.5	For Aram, along with Ephraim and the son of Remaliah, has plotted harm against you. They say, 
ISA.7.6	‘Let us go up against Judah, terrorize it, and conquer it for ourselves. Then we can install Tabeel’s son as king in it.’”
ISA.7.7	This is what the Lord 
ISA.7.7	It will not happen; it will not occur.
ISA.7.8	The
ISA.7.8	the chief of Damascus is Rezin
ISA.7.8	(within sixty-five years
ISA.7.8	Ephraim will be too shattered to be a people),
ISA.7.9	the chief city of Ephraim is Samaria,
ISA.7.9	and the chief of Samaria is the son of Remaliah.
ISA.7.9	If you do not stand firm in your faith,
ISA.7.9	then you will not stand at all.
ISA.7.10	Then the 
ISA.7.11	“Ask for a sign
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz replied, “I will not ask. I will not test the 
ISA.7.13	Isaiah
ISA.7.14	Therefore, the Lord himself will give you
ISA.7.15	By the time he learns to reject what is bad and choose what is good,
ISA.7.16	For before the boy knows to reject what is bad and choose what is good, the land of the two kings you dread will be abandoned. 
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	On that day
ISA.7.18	the 
ISA.7.18	at the farthest streams of the Nile
ISA.7.18	and to bees in the land of Assyria.
ISA.7.19	All of them will come and settle
ISA.7.19	in the steep ravines, in the clefts of the rocks,
ISA.7.19	in all the thornbushes, and in all the water holes.
ISA.7.20	On that day the Lord will use a razor
ISA.7.21	On that day
ISA.7.21	a man will raise a young cow and two sheep,
ISA.7.22	and from the abundant milk they give
ISA.7.22	he will eat curds,
ISA.7.22	for every survivor in the land will eat curds and honey.
ISA.7.23	And on that day
ISA.7.23	every place where there were a thousand vines,
ISA.7.23	worth a thousand pieces of silver,
ISA.7.23	will become thorns and briers.
ISA.7.24	A man will go there with bow and arrows
ISA.7.24	because the whole land will be thorns and briers.
ISA.7.25	You will not go to all the hills
ISA.7.25	that were once tilled with a hoe,
ISA.7.25	for fear of the thorns and briers.
ISA.7.25	Those hills will be places for oxen to graze
ISA.7.25	and for sheep to trample.
ISA.8.1	Then the 
ISA.8.2	I have appointed
ISA.8.3	I was then intimate with the prophetess, and she conceived and gave birth to a son. The 
ISA.8.4	for before the boy knows how to call ‘Father,’ or ‘Mother,’
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	Because these people rejected
ISA.8.6	the slowly flowing water of Shiloah
ISA.8.6	and rejoiced with
ISA.8.6	and the son of Remaliah,
ISA.8.7	the Lord will certainly bring against them
ISA.8.7	the mighty rushing water of the Euphrates River —
ISA.8.7	the king of Assyria and all his glory.
ISA.8.7	It will overflow its channels
ISA.8.7	and spill over all its banks.
ISA.8.8	It will pour into Judah,
ISA.8.8	flood over it, and sweep through,
ISA.8.8	reaching up to the neck;
ISA.8.8	and its flooded banks
ISA.8.8	will fill your entire land, Immanuel!
ISA.8.9	Band together,
ISA.8.9	pay attention, all you distant lands;
ISA.8.9	prepare for war, and be broken;
ISA.8.9	prepare for war, and be broken.
ISA.8.10	Devise a plan; it will fail.
ISA.8.10	Make a prediction; it will not happen.
ISA.8.10	For God is with us.
ISA.8.11	For this is what the 
ISA.8.12	Do not call everything a conspiracy
ISA.8.12	these people say is a conspiracy.
ISA.8.12	Do not fear what they fear;
ISA.8.12	do not be terrified.
ISA.8.13	You are to regard only the 
ISA.8.13	Only he should be feared;
ISA.8.13	only he should be held in awe.
ISA.8.14	He will be a sanctuary;
ISA.8.14	but for the two houses of Israel,
ISA.8.14	he will be a stone
ISA.8.14	and a rock to trip over,
ISA.8.14	and a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
ISA.8.15	Many will stumble over these;
ISA.8.15	they will fall and be broken;
ISA.8.15	they will be snared and captured.
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony.
ISA.8.16	Seal up the instruction
ISA.8.17	I will wait for the 
ISA.8.17	who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob.
ISA.8.17	I will wait for him.
ISA.8.18	Here I am with the children the 
ISA.8.19	When they say to you, “Inquire of the mediums and the spiritists who chirp and mutter,”
ISA.8.20	Go to God’s instruction and testimony!
ISA.8.21	They will wander through the land, dejected and hungry. When they are famished, they will become enraged, and, looking upward, will curse their king and their God. 
ISA.8.22	They will look toward the earth
ISA.9.1	Nevertheless, the gloom of the distressed land will not be like that of the former times when he humbled the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali.
ISA.9.2	The people walking in darkness
ISA.9.2	have seen a great light;
ISA.9.2	a light has dawned
ISA.9.2	on those living in the land of darkness.
ISA.9.3	You have enlarged the nation
ISA.9.3	and increased its joy.
ISA.9.3	The people have rejoiced before you
ISA.9.3	as they rejoice at harvest time
ISA.9.3	and as they rejoice when dividing spoils.
ISA.9.4	For you have shattered their oppressive yoke
ISA.9.4	and the rod on their shoulders,
ISA.9.4	the staff of their oppressor,
ISA.9.4	just as you did on the day of Midian.
ISA.9.5	For every trampling boot of battle
ISA.9.5	and the bloodied garments of war
ISA.9.5	will be burned as fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.6	For a child will be born for us,
ISA.9.6	a son will be given to us,
ISA.9.6	and the government will be on his shoulders.
ISA.9.6	He will be named
ISA.9.6	Wonderful Counselor,
ISA.9.6	Eternal Father,
ISA.9.7	The dominion will be vast,
ISA.9.7	and its prosperity will never end.
ISA.9.7	He will reign on the throne of David
ISA.9.7	and over his kingdom,
ISA.9.7	to establish and sustain it
ISA.9.7	with justice and righteousness from now on and forever.
ISA.9.7	The zeal of the 
ISA.9.8	The Lord sent a message against Jacob;
ISA.9.8	it came against Israel.
ISA.9.9	All the people —
ISA.9.9	Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria
ISA.9.9	They will say with pride and arrogance:
ISA.9.10	“The bricks have fallen,
ISA.9.10	but we will rebuild with cut stones;
ISA.9.10	the sycamores have been cut down,
ISA.9.10	but we will replace them with cedars.”
ISA.9.11	The 
ISA.9.11	and stirred up his enemies.
ISA.9.12	Aram from the east and Philistia from the west
ISA.9.12	have consumed Israel with open mouths.
ISA.9.12	In all this, his anger has not turned away,
ISA.9.12	and his hand is still raised to strike.
ISA.9.13	The people did not turn to him who struck them;
ISA.9.13	they did not seek the 
ISA.9.14	So the 
ISA.9.14	palm branch and reed in a single day.
ISA.9.15	The head is the elder, the honored one;
ISA.9.15	the tail is the prophet, the one teaching lies.
ISA.9.16	The leaders of the people mislead them,
ISA.9.16	and those they mislead are swallowed up.
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord does not rejoice
ISA.9.17	over
ISA.9.17	and has no compassion
ISA.9.17	on its fatherless and widows,
ISA.9.17	for everyone is a godless evildoer,
ISA.9.17	and every mouth speaks folly.
ISA.9.17	In all this, his anger has not turned away,
ISA.9.17	and his hand is still raised to strike.
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burns like a fire
ISA.9.18	that consumes thorns and briers
ISA.9.18	and kindles the forest thickets
ISA.9.18	so that they go up in a column of smoke.
ISA.9.19	The land is scorched
ISA.9.19	by the wrath of the 
ISA.9.19	and the people are like fuel for the fire.
ISA.9.19	No one has compassion on his brother.
ISA.9.20	They carve meat on the right,
ISA.9.20	but they are still hungry;
ISA.9.20	they have eaten on the left,
ISA.9.20	but they are still not satisfied.
ISA.9.20	Each one eats the flesh of his own arm.
ISA.9.21	Manasseh is with Ephraim,
ISA.9.21	and Ephraim with Manasseh;
ISA.9.21	together, both are against Judah.
ISA.9.21	In all this, his anger has not turned away,
ISA.9.21	and his hand is still raised to strike.
ISA.10.1	Woe
ISA.10.1	and writing oppressive laws
ISA.10.2	to keep the poor from getting a fair trial
ISA.10.2	and to deprive the needy among my people of justice,
ISA.10.2	so that widows can be their spoil
ISA.10.2	and they can plunder the fatherless.
ISA.10.3	What will you do on the day of punishment
ISA.10.3	when devastation comes from far away?
ISA.10.3	Who will you run to for help?
ISA.10.3	Where will you leave your wealth?
ISA.10.4	There will be nothing to do
ISA.10.4	except crouch among the prisoners
ISA.10.4	or fall among the slain.
ISA.10.4	In all this, his anger has not turned away,
ISA.10.4	and his hand is still raised to strike.
ISA.10.5	Woe to Assyria, the rod of my anger —
ISA.10.5	the staff in their hands is my wrath.
ISA.10.6	I will send him against a godless nation;
ISA.10.6	I will command him to go
ISA.10.6	against a people destined for my rage,
ISA.10.6	to take spoils, to plunder,
ISA.10.6	and to trample them down like clay
ISA.10.7	But this is not what he intends;
ISA.10.7	this is not what he plans.
ISA.10.7	It is his intent to destroy
ISA.10.7	and to cut off many nations.
ISA.10.8	For he says,
ISA.10.8	“Aren’t all my commanders kings?
ISA.10.9	Isn’t Calno like Carchemish?
ISA.10.9	Isn’t Hamath like Arpad?
ISA.10.9	Isn’t Samaria
ISA.10.10	As my hand seized the idolatrous kingdoms,
ISA.10.10	whose idols exceeded those of Jerusalem and Samaria,
ISA.10.11	and as I did to Samaria and its worthless images
ISA.10.11	will I not also do to Jerusalem and its idols?” 
ISA.10.12	But when the Lord finishes all his work against Mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will say, “I
ISA.10.13	For he said:
ISA.10.13	I have done this by my own strength
ISA.10.13	and wisdom, for I am clever.
ISA.10.13	I abolished the borders of nations
ISA.10.13	and plundered their treasures;
ISA.10.13	like a mighty warrior, I subjugated the inhabitants.
ISA.10.14	My hand has reached out, as if into a nest,
ISA.10.14	to seize the wealth of the nations.
ISA.10.14	Like one gathering abandoned eggs,
ISA.10.14	I gathered the whole earth.
ISA.10.14	No wing fluttered;
ISA.10.14	no beak opened or chirped.
ISA.10.15	Does an ax exalt itself
ISA.10.15	above the one who chops with it?
ISA.10.15	Does a saw magnify itself
ISA.10.15	above the one who saws with it?
ISA.10.15	It would be like a rod waving the one who lifts
ISA.10.15	It would be like a staff lifting the one who isn’t wood!
ISA.10.16	Therefore the Lord 
ISA.10.16	will inflict an emaciating disease
ISA.10.16	on the well-fed of Assyria,
ISA.10.16	and he will kindle a burning fire
ISA.10.16	under its glory.
ISA.10.17	Israel’s Light will become a fire,
ISA.10.17	and its Holy One, a flame.
ISA.10.17	In one day it will burn and consume Assyria’s thorns and thistles.
ISA.10.18	He will completely destroy
ISA.10.18	the glory of its forests and orchards
ISA.10.18	as a sickness consumes a person.
ISA.10.19	The remaining trees of its forest
ISA.10.19	will be so few in number
ISA.10.19	that a child could count them.
ISA.10.20	On that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no longer depend on the one who struck them, but they will faithfully depend on the 
ISA.10.21	The remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob,
ISA.10.21	to the Mighty God.
ISA.10.22	Israel, even if your people were as numerous
ISA.10.22	as the sand of the sea,
ISA.10.22	only a remnant of them will return.
ISA.10.22	Destruction has been decreed;
ISA.10.22	justice overflows.
ISA.10.23	For throughout the land
ISA.10.23	the Lord 
ISA.10.23	is carrying out a destruction that was decreed.
ISA.10.24	Therefore, the Lord 
ISA.10.25	In just a little while my wrath will be spent and my anger will turn to their destruction.” 
ISA.10.26	And the 
ISA.10.27	On that day
ISA.10.27	his burden will fall from your shoulders,
ISA.10.27	and his yoke from your neck.
ISA.10.27	The yoke will be broken because your neck will be too large.
ISA.10.28	Assyria has come to Aiath
ISA.10.28	and has gone through Migron,
ISA.10.28	storing their equipment at Michmash.
ISA.10.29	They crossed over at the ford, saying,
ISA.10.29	“We will spend the night at Geba.”
ISA.10.29	The people of Ramah are trembling;
ISA.10.29	those at Gibeah of Saul have fled.
ISA.10.30	Cry aloud, daughter of Gallim!
ISA.10.30	Listen, Laishah!
ISA.10.30	Anathoth is miserable.
ISA.10.31	Madmenah has fled.
ISA.10.31	The inhabitants of Gebim have sought refuge.
ISA.10.32	Today the Assyrians will stand at Nob,
ISA.10.32	shaking their fists at the mountain of Daughter Zion,
ISA.10.32	the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	Look, the Lord 
ISA.10.33	will chop off the branches with terrifying power,
ISA.10.33	and the tall trees will be cut down,
ISA.10.33	the high trees felled.
ISA.10.34	He is clearing the thickets of the forest with an ax,
ISA.10.34	and Lebanon with its majesty will fall.
ISA.11.1	Then a shoot will grow from the stump of Jesse,
ISA.11.1	and a branch
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of the 
ISA.11.2	a Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
ISA.11.2	a Spirit of counsel and strength,
ISA.11.2	a Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	His delight will be in the fear of the 
ISA.11.3	He will not judge
ISA.11.3	by what he sees with his eyes,
ISA.11.3	he will not execute justice
ISA.11.3	by what he hears with his ears,
ISA.11.4	but he will judge the poor righteously
ISA.11.4	and execute justice for the oppressed of the land.
ISA.11.4	He will strike the land
ISA.11.4	with a scepter
ISA.11.4	and he will kill the wicked
ISA.11.4	with a command
ISA.11.5	Righteousness will be a belt around his hips;
ISA.11.5	faithfulness will be a belt around his waist.
ISA.11.6	The wolf will dwell with the lamb,
ISA.11.6	and the leopard will lie down with the goat.
ISA.11.6	The calf, the young lion, and the fattened calf will be together,
ISA.11.6	and a child will lead them.
ISA.11.7	The cow and the bear will graze,
ISA.11.7	their young ones will lie down together,
ISA.11.7	and the lion will eat straw like cattle.
ISA.11.8	An infant will play beside the cobra’s pit,
ISA.11.8	and a toddler will put his hand into a snake’s den.
ISA.11.9	They will not harm or destroy each other
ISA.11.9	on my entire holy mountain,
ISA.11.9	for the land will be as full
ISA.11.9	of the knowledge of the 
ISA.11.9	as the sea is filled with water.
ISA.11.10	On that day the root of Jesse
ISA.11.10	will stand as a banner for the peoples.
ISA.11.10	The nations will look to him for guidance,
ISA.11.10	and his resting place will be glorious.
ISA.11.11	On that day
ISA.11.12	He will lift up a banner for the nations
ISA.11.12	and gather the dispersed of Israel;
ISA.11.12	he will collect the scattered of Judah
ISA.11.12	from the four corners of the earth.
ISA.11.13	Ephraim’s envy will cease;
ISA.11.13	Judah’s harassing will end.
ISA.11.13	Ephraim will no longer be envious of Judah,
ISA.11.13	and Judah will not harass Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	But they will swoop down
ISA.11.14	on the Philistine flank to the west.
ISA.11.14	Together they will plunder the people of the east.
ISA.11.14	They will extend their power over Edom and Moab,
ISA.11.14	and the Ammonites will be their subjects.
ISA.11.15	The 
ISA.11.15	He will wave his hand over the Euphrates
ISA.11.15	with his mighty wind
ISA.11.15	and will split it into seven streams,
ISA.11.15	letting people walk through on foot.
ISA.11.16	There will be a highway for the remnant of his people
ISA.11.16	who will survive from Assyria,
ISA.11.16	as there was for Israel
ISA.11.16	when they came up from the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	On that day you will say:
ISA.12.1	“I will give thanks to you, 
ISA.12.1	although you were angry with me.
ISA.12.1	Your anger has turned away,
ISA.12.1	and you have comforted me.
ISA.12.2	Indeed, God is my salvation;
ISA.12.2	I will trust him and not be afraid,
ISA.12.2	for the 
ISA.12.2	is my strength and my song.
ISA.12.2	He has become my salvation.”
ISA.12.3	You will joyfully draw water
ISA.12.3	from the springs of salvation,
ISA.12.4	and on that day you will say:
ISA.12.4	“Give thanks to the 
ISA.12.4	Make his works known among the peoples.
ISA.12.4	Declare that his name is exalted.
ISA.12.5	Sing to the 
ISA.12.5	Let this be known throughout the earth.
ISA.12.6	Cry out and sing, citizen of Zion,
ISA.12.6	for the Holy One of Israel
ISA.12.6	in his greatness.”
ISA.13.1	A pronouncement
ISA.13.2	Lift up a banner on a barren mountain.
ISA.13.2	Call out to them.
ISA.13.2	Signal with your hand, and they will go
ISA.13.2	through the gates of the nobles.
ISA.13.3	I have commanded my consecrated ones;
ISA.13.3	yes, I have called my warriors,
ISA.13.3	who celebrate my triumph,
ISA.13.3	to execute my wrath.
ISA.13.4	Listen, a commotion on the mountains,
ISA.13.4	like that of a mighty people!
ISA.13.4	Listen, an uproar among the kingdoms,
ISA.13.4	like nations being gathered together!
ISA.13.4	The 
ISA.13.5	They are coming from a distant land,
ISA.13.5	from the farthest horizon —
ISA.13.5	the 
ISA.13.5	to destroy the whole country.
ISA.13.6	Wail! For the day of the 
ISA.13.6	It will come as destruction from the Almighty.
ISA.13.7	Therefore everyone’s hands will become weak,
ISA.13.7	and every man will lose heart.
ISA.13.8	They will be horrified;
ISA.13.8	pain and agony will seize them;
ISA.13.8	they will be in anguish like a woman in labor.
ISA.13.8	They will look at each other,
ISA.13.8	their faces flushed with fear.
ISA.13.9	Look, the day
ISA.13.9	cruel, with rage and burning anger —
ISA.13.9	to make the earth a desolation
ISA.13.9	and to destroy its sinners.
ISA.13.10	Indeed, the stars of the sky and its constellations
ISA.13.10	will not give their light.
ISA.13.10	The sun will be dark when it rises,
ISA.13.10	and the moon will not shine.
ISA.13.11	I will punish the world for its evil,
ISA.13.11	and wicked people for their iniquities.
ISA.13.11	I will put an end to the pride of the arrogant
ISA.13.11	and humiliate the insolence of tyrants.
ISA.13.12	I will make a human more scarce than fine gold,
ISA.13.12	and mankind more rare than the gold of Ophir.
ISA.13.13	Therefore I will make the heavens tremble,
ISA.13.13	and the earth will shake from its foundations
ISA.13.13	at the wrath of the 
ISA.13.13	on the day of his burning anger.
ISA.13.14	Like wandering gazelles
ISA.13.14	and like sheep without a shepherd,
ISA.13.14	each one will turn to his own people,
ISA.13.14	each one will flee to his own land.
ISA.13.15	Whoever is found will be stabbed,
ISA.13.15	and whoever is caught will die by the sword.
ISA.13.16	Their children will be dashed to pieces before their eyes;
ISA.13.16	their houses will be looted,
ISA.13.16	and their wives raped.
ISA.13.17	Look! I am stirring up the Medes against them,
ISA.13.17	who cannot be bought off with
ISA.13.17	and who have no desire for gold.
ISA.13.18	Their bows will cut young men to pieces.
ISA.13.18	They will have no compassion on offspring;
ISA.13.18	they will not look with pity on children.
ISA.13.19	And Babylon, the jewel of the kingdoms,
ISA.13.19	the glory of the pride of the Chaldeans,
ISA.13.19	will be like Sodom and Gomorrah
ISA.13.19	when God overthrew them.
ISA.13.20	It will never be inhabited
ISA.13.20	or lived in from generation to generation;
ISA.13.20	a nomad will not pitch his tent there,
ISA.13.20	and shepherds will not let their flocks rest there.
ISA.13.21	But desert creatures will lie down there,
ISA.13.21	and owls will fill the houses.
ISA.13.21	Ostriches will dwell there,
ISA.13.21	and wild goats will leap about.
ISA.13.22	Hyenas will howl in the fortresses,
ISA.13.22	and jackals, in the luxurious palaces.
ISA.13.22	Babylon’s time is almost up;
ISA.13.22	her days are almost over.
ISA.14.1	For the 
ISA.14.2	The nations will escort Israel and bring it to its homeland. Then the house of Israel will possess them as male and female slaves in the 
ISA.14.3	When the 
ISA.14.4	you will sing this song of contempt about the king of Babylon
ISA.14.4	How the oppressor has quieted down,
ISA.14.4	and how the raging
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.5	the scepter of the rulers.
ISA.14.6	It struck the peoples in anger
ISA.14.6	with unceasing blows.
ISA.14.6	It subdued the nations in rage
ISA.14.6	with relentless persecution.
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is calm and at rest;
ISA.14.7	people shout with a ringing cry.
ISA.14.8	Even the cypresses and the cedars of Lebanon
ISA.14.8	rejoice over you:
ISA.14.8	“Since you have been laid low,
ISA.14.8	no lumberjack has come against us.”
ISA.14.9	Sheol below is eager to greet your coming,
ISA.14.9	stirring up the spirits of the departed for you —
ISA.14.9	all the rulers
ISA.14.9	making all the kings of the nations
ISA.14.9	rise from their thrones.
ISA.14.10	They all respond to you, saying,
ISA.14.10	“You too have become as weak as we are;
ISA.14.10	you have become like us!
ISA.14.11	Your splendor has been brought down to Sheol,
ISA.14.11	along with the music of your harps.
ISA.14.11	Maggots are spread out under you,
ISA.14.11	and worms cover you.”
ISA.14.12	Shining morning star,
ISA.14.12	how you have fallen from the heavens!
ISA.14.12	You destroyer of nations,
ISA.14.12	you have been cut down to the ground.
ISA.14.13	You said to yourself,
ISA.14.13	“I will ascend to the heavens;
ISA.14.13	I will set up my throne
ISA.14.13	above the stars of God.
ISA.14.13	I will sit on the mount of the gods’ assembly,
ISA.14.13	in the remotest parts of the North.
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the highest clouds;
ISA.14.14	I will make myself like the Most High.”
ISA.14.15	But you will be brought down to Sheol
ISA.14.15	into the deepest regions of the Pit.
ISA.14.16	Those who see you will stare at you;
ISA.14.16	they will look closely at you:
ISA.14.16	“Is this the man who caused the earth to tremble,
ISA.14.16	who shook the kingdoms,
ISA.14.17	who turned the world into a wilderness,
ISA.14.17	who destroyed its cities
ISA.14.17	and would not release the prisoners to return home?”
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the nations
ISA.14.18	lie in splendor, each in his own tomb.
ISA.14.19	But you are thrown out without a grave,
ISA.14.19	like a worthless branch,
ISA.14.19	covered by those slain with the sword
ISA.14.19	and dumped into a rocky pit like a trampled corpse.
ISA.14.20	You will not join them in burial,
ISA.14.20	because you destroyed your land
ISA.14.20	and slaughtered your own people.
ISA.14.20	The offspring of evildoers
ISA.14.20	will never be mentioned again.
ISA.14.21	Prepare a place of slaughter for his sons,
ISA.14.21	because of the iniquity
ISA.14.21	They will never rise up to possess a land
ISA.14.21	or fill the surface of the earth with cities.
ISA.14.22	“I will rise up against them” — this is the declaration of the 
ISA.14.23	“I will make her a swampland and a region for herons,
ISA.14.23	This is the declaration of the 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.24	As I have purposed, so it will be;
ISA.14.24	as I have planned it, so it will happen.
ISA.14.25	I will break Assyria
ISA.14.25	I will tread him down on my mountain.
ISA.14.25	Then his yoke will be taken from them,
ISA.14.25	and his burden will be removed from their shoulders.
ISA.14.26	This is the plan
ISA.14.26	for the whole earth,
ISA.14.26	and this is the hand stretched out
ISA.14.26	against all the nations.
ISA.14.27	The 
ISA.14.27	therefore, who can stand in its way?
ISA.14.27	It is his hand that is outstretched,
ISA.14.27	so who can turn it back?
ISA.14.28	In the year that King Ahaz died,
ISA.14.29	Don’t rejoice, all of you in Philistia,
ISA.14.29	because the rod of the one who struck you
ISA.14.29	For a viper will come from the root
ISA.14.29	and from its egg comes a flying serpent.
ISA.14.30	Then the firstborn
ISA.14.30	and the impoverished will lie down in safety,
ISA.14.30	but I will kill your root with hunger,
ISA.14.30	and your remnant will be slain.
ISA.14.31	Wail, you gates!
ISA.14.31	Tremble with fear,
ISA.14.31	For a cloud of dust is coming from the north,
ISA.14.31	and there is no one missing from the invader’s ranks.
ISA.14.32	What answer will be given to the messengers from that nation?
ISA.14.32	The 
ISA.14.32	and his oppressed people find refuge in her.
ISA.15.1	A pronouncement concerning Moab:
ISA.15.1	Ar in Moab is devastated,
ISA.15.1	destroyed in a night.
ISA.15.1	Kir in Moab is devastated,
ISA.15.1	destroyed in a night.
ISA.15.2	Dibon went up to its temple
ISA.15.2	to weep at its high places.
ISA.15.2	Moab wails on Nebo and at
ISA.15.2	Every head is shaved;
ISA.15.2	every beard is chopped short.
ISA.15.3	In its streets they wear sackcloth;
ISA.15.3	on its rooftops and in its public squares everyone wails,
ISA.15.3	falling down and weeping.
ISA.15.4	Heshbon and Elealeh cry out;
ISA.15.4	their voices are heard as far away as Jahaz.
ISA.15.4	Therefore the soldiers of Moab cry out,
ISA.15.4	and they tremble.
ISA.15.5	My heart cries out over Moab,
ISA.15.5	whose fugitives flee as far as Zoar,
ISA.15.5	to Eglath-shelishiyah;
ISA.15.5	they go up the Ascent of Luhith weeping;
ISA.15.5	they raise a cry of destruction
ISA.15.5	on the road to Horonaim.
ISA.15.6	The Waters of Nimrim
ISA.15.6	the grass is withered, the foliage is gone,
ISA.15.6	and the vegetation has vanished.
ISA.15.7	So they carry their wealth and belongings
ISA.15.7	over the Wadi of the Willows.
ISA.15.8	For their cry echoes
ISA.15.8	throughout the territory of Moab.
ISA.15.8	Their wailing reaches Eglaim;
ISA.15.8	their wailing reaches Beer-elim.
ISA.15.9	The Waters of Dibon
ISA.15.9	but I will bring on Dibon
ISA.15.9	a lion for those who escape from Moab,
ISA.15.9	and for the survivors in the land.
ISA.16.1	Send lambs to the ruler of the land,
ISA.16.1	from Sela in the desert
ISA.16.1	to the mountain of Daughter Zion.
ISA.16.2	Like a bird fleeing,
ISA.16.2	forced from the nest,
ISA.16.2	the daughters of Moab
ISA.16.2	will be at the fords of the Arnon.
ISA.16.3	Give us counsel and make a decision.
ISA.16.3	Shelter us at noonday
ISA.16.3	with shade that is as dark as night.
ISA.16.3	Hide the refugees;
ISA.16.3	do not betray the one who flees.
ISA.16.4	Let my refugees stay with you;
ISA.16.4	be a refuge for Moab
ISA.16.4	When the oppressor has gone,
ISA.16.4	destruction has ended,
ISA.16.4	and marauders have vanished from the land,
ISA.16.5	a throne will be established in love,
ISA.16.5	and one will sit on it faithfully
ISA.16.5	in the tent of David,
ISA.16.5	judging and pursuing what is right,
ISA.16.5	quick to execute justice.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of Moab’s pride
ISA.16.6	how very proud he is —
ISA.16.6	his haughtiness, his pride, his arrogance,
ISA.16.6	and his empty boasting.
ISA.16.7	Therefore let Moab wail;
ISA.16.7	let every one of them wail for Moab.
ISA.16.7	You who are completely devastated, mourn
ISA.16.7	for the raisin cakes
ISA.16.8	For Heshbon’s terraced vineyards
ISA.16.8	and the grapevines of Sibmah have withered.
ISA.16.8	The rulers of the nations
ISA.16.8	have trampled its choice vines
ISA.16.8	that reached as far as Jazer
ISA.16.8	and spread to the desert.
ISA.16.8	Their shoots spread out
ISA.16.8	and reached the sea.
ISA.16.9	So I join with Jazer
ISA.16.9	to weep for the vines of Sibmah;
ISA.16.9	I drench Heshbon and Elealeh with my tears.
ISA.16.9	Triumphant shouts have fallen silent
ISA.16.9	over your summer fruit and your harvest.
ISA.16.10	Joy and rejoicing
ISA.16.10	no one is singing or shouting for joy in the vineyards.
ISA.16.10	No one tramples grapes
ISA.16.10	I have put an end to the shouting.
ISA.16.11	Therefore I moan like the sound of a lyre for Moab,
ISA.16.11	as does my innermost being for Kir-heres.
ISA.16.12	When Moab appears
ISA.16.12	and tires himself out on the high place
ISA.16.12	and comes to his sanctuary to pray,
ISA.16.12	it will do him no good.
ISA.16.13	This is the message that the 
ISA.16.14	And now the 
ISA.17.1	A pronouncement
ISA.17.1	Look, Damascus is no longer a city.
ISA.17.1	It has become a ruined heap.
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aroer are abandoned;
ISA.17.2	they will be places for flocks.
ISA.17.2	They will lie down without fear.
ISA.17.3	The fortress disappears from Ephraim,
ISA.17.3	and a kingdom from Damascus.
ISA.17.3	The remnant of Aram will be
ISA.17.3	like the splendor of the Israelites.
ISA.17.3	This is the declaration of the 
ISA.17.4	On that day
ISA.17.4	the splendor of Jacob will fade,
ISA.17.4	and his healthy body
ISA.17.5	It will be as if a reaper had gathered standing grain —
ISA.17.5	his arm harvesting the heads of grain —
ISA.17.5	and as if one had gleaned heads of grain
ISA.17.5	in the Valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	Only gleanings will be left in Israel,
ISA.17.6	as if an olive tree had been beaten —
ISA.17.6	two or three olives at the very top of the tree,
ISA.17.6	four or five on its fruitful branches.
ISA.17.6	This is the declaration of the 
ISA.17.7	On that day people will look to their Maker and will turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.17.8	They will not look to the altars
ISA.17.9	On that day their strong cities will be
ISA.17.9	like the abandoned woods and mountaintops
ISA.17.9	that were abandoned because of the Israelites;
ISA.17.9	there will be desolation.
ISA.17.10	For you have forgotten the God of your salvation,
ISA.17.10	and you have failed to remember
ISA.17.10	the rock of your strength;
ISA.17.10	therefore you will plant beautiful plants
ISA.17.10	and set out cuttings from exotic vines.
ISA.17.11	On the day that you plant,
ISA.17.11	you will help them to grow,
ISA.17.11	and in the morning
ISA.17.11	you will help your seed to sprout,
ISA.17.11	but the harvest will vanish
ISA.17.11	on the day of disease and incurable pain.
ISA.17.12	Ah! The roar of many peoples —
ISA.17.12	they roar like the roaring of the seas.
ISA.17.12	The raging of the nations —
ISA.17.12	they rage like the rumble of rushing water.
ISA.17.13	The nations rage like the rumble of a huge torrent.
ISA.17.13	He rebukes them, and they flee far away,
ISA.17.13	driven before the wind like chaff on the hills
ISA.17.13	and like tumbleweeds before a gale.
ISA.17.14	In the evening — sudden terror!
ISA.17.14	Before morning — it is gone!
ISA.17.14	This is the fate of those who plunder us
ISA.17.14	and the lot of those who ravage us.
ISA.18.1	Woe to the land of buzzing insect wings
ISA.18.1	beyond the rivers of Cush,
ISA.18.2	which sends envoys by sea,
ISA.18.2	in reed vessels over the water.
ISA.18.2	Go, swift messengers,
ISA.18.2	to a nation tall and smooth-skinned,
ISA.18.2	to a people feared far and near,
ISA.18.2	a powerful nation with a strange language,
ISA.18.2	whose land is divided by rivers.
ISA.18.3	All you inhabitants of the world
ISA.18.3	and you who live on the earth,
ISA.18.3	when a banner is raised on the mountains, look!
ISA.18.3	When a trumpet sounds, listen!
ISA.18.4	For the 
ISA.18.4	I will quietly look out from my place,
ISA.18.4	like shimmering heat in sunshine,
ISA.18.4	like a rain cloud in harvest heat.
ISA.18.5	For before the harvest, when the blossoming is over
ISA.18.5	and the blossom becomes a ripening grape,
ISA.18.5	he will cut off the shoots with a pruning knife,
ISA.18.5	and tear away and remove the branches.
ISA.18.6	They will all be left for the birds of prey on the hills
ISA.18.6	and for the wild animals of the land.
ISA.18.6	The birds of prey will spend the summer feeding on them,
ISA.18.6	and all the wild animals the winter.
ISA.18.7	At that time a gift will be brought to the 
ISA.19.1	A pronouncement
ISA.19.1	Look, the 
ISA.19.1	and is coming to Egypt.
ISA.19.1	Egypt’s idols will tremble before him,
ISA.19.1	and Egypt will lose heart.
ISA.19.2	I will provoke Egyptians against Egyptians;
ISA.19.2	each will fight against his brother
ISA.19.2	and each against his friend,
ISA.19.2	city against city, kingdom against kingdom.
ISA.19.3	Egypt’s spirit will be disturbed within it,
ISA.19.3	and I will frustrate its plans.
ISA.19.3	Then they will inquire of idols, ghosts,
ISA.19.3	and spiritists.
ISA.19.4	I will hand over Egypt to harsh masters,
ISA.19.4	and a strong king will rule it.
ISA.19.4	This is the declaration of the Lord 
ISA.19.5	The water of the sea will dry up,
ISA.19.5	and the river will be parched and dry.
ISA.19.6	The channels will stink;
ISA.19.6	they will dwindle, and Egypt’s canals will be parched.
ISA.19.6	Reed and rush will wilt.
ISA.19.7	The reeds by the Nile, by the mouth of the river,
ISA.19.7	and all the cultivated areas of the Nile
ISA.19.7	will wither, blow away, and vanish.
ISA.19.8	Then the fishermen will mourn.
ISA.19.8	All those who cast hooks into the Nile will lament,
ISA.19.8	and those who spread nets on the water will give up.
ISA.19.9	Those who work with flax will be dismayed;
ISA.19.9	those combing it and weaving linen will turn pale.
ISA.19.10	Egypt’s weavers
ISA.19.10	all her wage earners will be demoralized.
ISA.19.11	The princes of Zoan are complete fools;
ISA.19.11	Pharaoh’s wisest advisers give stupid advice!
ISA.19.11	How can you say to Pharaoh,
ISA.19.11	“I am one
ISA.19.11	a student of eastern
ISA.19.12	Where then are your wise men?
ISA.19.12	Let them tell you and reveal
ISA.19.12	what the 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan have been fools;
ISA.19.13	the princes of Memphis are deceived.
ISA.19.13	Her tribal chieftains have led Egypt astray.
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.14	The leaders have made Egypt stagger in all she does,
ISA.19.14	as a drunkard staggers in his vomit.
ISA.19.15	No head or tail, palm or reed,
ISA.19.15	will be able to do anything for Egypt.
ISA.19.16	On that day Egypt will be like women and will tremble with fear because of the threatening hand of the 
ISA.19.17	The land of Judah will terrify Egypt; whenever Judah is mentioned, Egypt will tremble because of what the 
ISA.19.18	On that day five cities in the land of Egypt will speak the language of Canaan and swear loyalty to the 
ISA.19.19	On that day there will be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	It will be a sign and witness to the 
ISA.19.21	The 
ISA.19.22	The 
ISA.19.23	On that day there will be a highway
ISA.19.24	On that day Israel will form a triple alliance with Egypt and Assyria — a blessing within the land. 
ISA.19.25	The 
ISA.20.1	In the year that the chief commander,
ISA.20.2	during that time the 
ISA.20.3	the 
ISA.20.4	so the king of Assyria will lead the captives of Egypt
ISA.20.5	Those who made Cush their hope and Egypt their boast will be dismayed and ashamed.
ISA.20.6	And the inhabitants of this coastland will say on that day, ‘Look, this is what has happened to those we relied on and fled to for help to rescue us from the king of Assyria! Now, how will we escape? ’”
ISA.21.1	A pronouncement
ISA.21.1	Like storms that pass over the Negev,
ISA.21.1	it comes from the desert, from the land of terror.
ISA.21.2	A troubling vision is declared to me:
ISA.21.2	“The treacherous one acts treacherously,
ISA.21.2	and the destroyer destroys.
ISA.21.2	Advance, Elam! Lay siege, you Medes!
ISA.21.2	I will put an end to all the groaning.”
ISA.21.3	Therefore I am
ISA.21.3	Pain grips me, like the pain of a woman in labor.
ISA.21.3	I am too perplexed to hear,
ISA.21.3	too dismayed to see.
ISA.21.4	My heart staggers;
ISA.21.4	horror terrifies me.
ISA.21.4	He has turned my last glimmer of hope
ISA.21.4	into sheer terror.
ISA.21.5	Prepare a table,
ISA.21.5	Eat and drink!
ISA.21.5	Rise up, you princes, and oil the shields!
ISA.21.6	For the Lord has said to me,
ISA.21.6	“Go, post a lookout;
ISA.21.6	let him report what he sees.
ISA.21.7	When he sees riders —
ISA.21.7	pairs of horsemen,
ISA.21.7	riders on donkeys,
ISA.21.7	riders on camels —
ISA.21.7	he must pay close attention.”
ISA.21.8	Then the lookout
ISA.21.8	“Lord, I stand on the watchtower all day,
ISA.21.8	and I stay at my post all night.
ISA.21.9	Look, riders come —
ISA.21.9	horsemen in pairs.”
ISA.21.9	And he answered, saying,
ISA.21.9	“Babylon has fallen,
ISA.21.9	All the images of her gods
ISA.21.9	have been shattered on the ground.”
ISA.21.10	My people who have been crushed
ISA.21.10	on the threshing floor,
ISA.21.10	I have declared to you
ISA.21.10	what I have heard from the 
ISA.21.10	the God of Israel.
ISA.21.11	A pronouncement
ISA.21.11	One calls to me from Seir,
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, what is left of the night?
ISA.21.11	Watchman, what is left of the night?”
ISA.21.12	The watchman said,
ISA.21.12	“Morning has come, and also night.
ISA.21.12	If you want to ask, ask!
ISA.21.12	Come back again.”
ISA.21.13	A pronouncement concerning Arabia:
ISA.21.13	In the desert
ISA.21.13	you will camp for the night,
ISA.21.13	you caravans of Dedanites.
ISA.21.14	Bring water for the thirsty.
ISA.21.14	The inhabitants of the land of Tema
ISA.21.14	meet
ISA.21.15	For they have fled from swords,
ISA.21.15	from the drawn sword,
ISA.21.15	from the bow that is strung,
ISA.21.15	and from the stress of battle.
ISA.21.16	For the Lord said this to me: “Within one year,
ISA.21.17	The remaining Kedarite archers will be few in number.” For the 
ISA.22.1	A pronouncement
ISA.22.1	What’s the matter with you?
ISA.22.1	Why have all of you gone up to the rooftops?
ISA.22.2	The noisy city, the jubilant town,
ISA.22.2	is filled with celebration.
ISA.22.2	Your dead did not die by the sword;
ISA.22.2	they were not killed in battle.
ISA.22.3	All your rulers have fled together,
ISA.22.3	captured without a bow.
ISA.22.3	All your fugitives were captured together;
ISA.22.3	they had fled far away.
ISA.22.4	Therefore I said,
ISA.22.4	“Look away from me! Let me weep bitterly!
ISA.22.4	Do not try to comfort me
ISA.22.4	about the destruction of my dear
ISA.22.5	For the Lord 
ISA.22.5	had a day of tumult, trampling, and confusion
ISA.22.5	in the Valley of Vision —
ISA.22.5	people shouting
ISA.22.6	Elam took up a quiver
ISA.22.6	with chariots and horsemen,
ISA.22.6	and Kir
ISA.22.7	Your best valleys were full of chariots,
ISA.22.7	and horsemen were positioned at the city gates.
ISA.22.8	He removed the defenses of Judah.
ISA.22.8	On that day you looked to the weapons in the House of the Forest.
ISA.22.9	You saw that there were many breaches in the walls of the city of David.
ISA.22.10	You counted the houses of Jerusalem so that you could tear them down to fortify the wall. 
ISA.22.11	You made a reservoir between the walls
ISA.22.12	On that day the Lord 
ISA.22.12	called for weeping,
ISA.22.12	and for the wearing of sackcloth.
ISA.22.13	But look: joy and gladness,
ISA.22.13	butchering of cattle, slaughtering of sheep and goats,
ISA.22.13	eating of meat, and drinking of wine —
ISA.22.13	“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die!” 
ISA.22.14	The 
ISA.22.14	“This iniquity will not be wiped out for you people as long as you live.”
ISA.22.14	The Lord 
ISA.22.15	The Lord 
ISA.22.16	What are you doing here? Who authorized you to carve out a tomb for yourself here, carving your tomb on the height and cutting a resting place for yourself out of rock?
ISA.22.17	Look, you strong man! The 
ISA.22.18	wind you up into a ball, and sling you into a wide land.
ISA.22.19	I will remove you from your office; you will be ousted from your position.
ISA.22.20	“On that day I will call for my servant, Eliakim son of Hilkiah.
ISA.22.21	I will clothe him with your robe and tie your sash around him. I will hand your authority over to him, and he will be like a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
ISA.22.22	I will place the key
ISA.22.23	I will drive him, like a peg, into a firm place. He will be a throne of honor for his father’s family. 
ISA.22.24	They will hang on him all the glory of his father’s family: the descendants and the offshoots — all the small vessels, from bowls to every kind of jar. 
ISA.22.25	On that day” — the declaration of the 
ISA.23.1	A pronouncement
ISA.23.1	Wail, ships of Tarshish,
ISA.23.1	for your haven has been destroyed.
ISA.23.1	Word has reached them from the land of Cyprus.
ISA.23.2	Mourn, inhabitants of the coastland,
ISA.23.2	you merchants of Sidon;
ISA.23.2	your agents have crossed the sea
ISA.23.3	over deep water.
ISA.23.3	Tyre’s revenue was the grain from Shihor —
ISA.23.3	the harvest of the Nile.
ISA.23.3	She was the merchant among the nations.
ISA.23.4	Be ashamed, Sidon, the stronghold of the sea,
ISA.23.4	for the sea has spoken:
ISA.23.4	“I have not been in labor or given birth.
ISA.23.4	I have not raised young men
ISA.23.4	or brought up young women.”
ISA.23.5	When the news reaches Egypt,
ISA.23.5	they will be in anguish over the news about Tyre.
ISA.23.6	Cross over to Tarshish;
ISA.23.6	wail, inhabitants of the coastland!
ISA.23.7	Is this your jubilant city,
ISA.23.7	whose origin was in ancient times,
ISA.23.7	whose feet have taken her
ISA.23.7	to reside far away?
ISA.23.8	Who planned this against Tyre,
ISA.23.8	the bestower of crowns,
ISA.23.8	whose traders are princes,
ISA.23.8	whose merchants are the honored ones of the earth?
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.9	to desecrate all its glorious beauty,
ISA.23.9	to disgrace all the honored ones of the earth.
ISA.23.10	Overflow
ISA.23.10	there is no longer anything to restrain you.
ISA.23.11	He stretched out his hand over the sea;
ISA.23.11	he made kingdoms tremble.
ISA.23.11	The 
ISA.23.11	that the Canaanite fortresses be destroyed.
ISA.23.12	He said,
ISA.23.12	“You will not celebrate anymore,
ISA.23.12	ravished young woman, daughter of Sidon.
ISA.23.12	Get up and cross over to Cyprus
ISA.23.12	even there you will have no rest!”
ISA.23.13	Look at the land of the Chaldeans —
ISA.23.13	a people who no longer exist.
ISA.23.13	Assyria destined it for desert creatures.
ISA.23.13	They set up their siege towers
ISA.23.13	and stripped its palaces.
ISA.23.13	They made it a ruin.
ISA.23.14	Wail, ships of Tarshish,
ISA.23.14	because your fortress is destroyed!
ISA.23.15	On that day Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years — the life span of one king. At the end of seventy years, what the song says about the prostitute will happen to Tyre:
ISA.23.16	Pick up your lyre,
ISA.23.16	stroll through the city,
ISA.23.16	you forgotten prostitute.
ISA.23.16	Play skillfully,
ISA.23.16	sing many a song
ISA.23.16	so that you will be remembered.
ISA.23.17	And at the end of the seventy years,
ISA.23.18	But her profits and wages will be dedicated to the 
ISA.24.1	Look, the 
ISA.24.1	and making it desolate.
ISA.24.1	He will twist its surface and scatter its inhabitants:
ISA.24.2	people and priest alike,
ISA.24.2	servant and master,
ISA.24.2	female servant and mistress,
ISA.24.2	buyer and seller,
ISA.24.2	lender and borrower,
ISA.24.2	creditor and debtor.
ISA.24.3	The earth will be stripped completely bare
ISA.24.3	and will be totally plundered,
ISA.24.3	for the 
ISA.24.4	The earth mourns and withers;
ISA.24.4	the world wastes away and withers;
ISA.24.4	the exalted people of the earth waste away.
ISA.24.5	The earth is polluted by its inhabitants,
ISA.24.5	for they have transgressed teachings,
ISA.24.5	overstepped decrees,
ISA.24.5	and broken the permanent covenant.
ISA.24.6	Therefore a curse has consumed the earth,
ISA.24.6	and its inhabitants have become guilty;
ISA.24.6	the earth’s inhabitants have been burned,
ISA.24.6	and only a few survive.
ISA.24.7	The new wine mourns;
ISA.24.7	the vine withers.
ISA.24.7	All the carousers now groan.
ISA.24.8	The joyful tambourines
ISA.24.8	The noise of the jubilant has stopped.
ISA.24.8	The joyful lyre has ceased.
ISA.24.9	They no longer sing and drink wine;
ISA.24.9	beer is bitter to those who drink it.
ISA.24.10	The city of chaos is shattered;
ISA.24.10	every house is closed to entry.
ISA.24.11	In the streets they cry
ISA.24.11	All joy grows dark;
ISA.24.11	earth’s rejoicing goes into exile.
ISA.24.12	Only desolation remains in the city;
ISA.24.12	its gate has collapsed in ruins.
ISA.24.13	For this is how it will be on earth
ISA.24.13	among the nations:
ISA.24.13	like a harvested olive tree,
ISA.24.13	like a gleaning after a grape harvest.
ISA.24.14	They raise their voices, they sing out;
ISA.24.14	they proclaim in the west
ISA.24.14	the majesty of the 
ISA.24.15	Therefore, in the east honor the 
ISA.24.15	In the coasts and islands of the west
ISA.24.15	honor the name of the 
ISA.24.15	the God of Israel.
ISA.24.16	From the ends of the earth we hear songs:
ISA.24.16	The Splendor of the Righteous One.
ISA.24.16	But I said, “I waste away! I waste away!
ISA.24.16	Woe is me.”
ISA.24.16	The treacherous act treacherously;
ISA.24.16	the treacherous deal very treacherously.
ISA.24.17	Panic, pit, and trap await you
ISA.24.17	who dwell on the earth.
ISA.24.18	Whoever flees at the sound of panic
ISA.24.18	will fall into a pit,
ISA.24.18	and whoever escapes from the pit
ISA.24.18	will be caught in a trap.
ISA.24.18	For the windows on high are opened,
ISA.24.18	and the foundations of the earth are shaken.
ISA.24.19	The earth is completely devastated;
ISA.24.19	the earth is split open;
ISA.24.19	the earth is violently shaken.
ISA.24.20	The earth staggers like a drunkard
ISA.24.20	and sways like a hut.
ISA.24.20	Earth’s rebellion weighs it down,
ISA.24.20	and it falls, never to rise again.
ISA.24.21	On that day
ISA.24.21	the army of the heights in the heights
ISA.24.21	and the kings of the ground on the ground.
ISA.24.22	They will be gathered together
ISA.24.22	like prisoners in a pit.
ISA.24.22	They will be confined to a dungeon;
ISA.24.22	after many days they will be punished.
ISA.24.23	The moon will be put to shame
ISA.24.23	and the sun disgraced,
ISA.24.23	because the 
ISA.24.23	on Mount Zion in Jerusalem,
ISA.24.23	and he will display his glory
ISA.24.23	in the presence of his elders.
ISA.25.1	I will exalt you. I will praise your name,
ISA.25.1	for you have accomplished wonders,
ISA.25.1	plans formed long ago, with perfect faithfulness.
ISA.25.2	For you have turned the city into a pile of rocks,
ISA.25.2	a fortified city, into ruins;
ISA.25.2	the fortress of barbarians
ISA.25.2	it will never be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	Therefore, a strong people will honor you.
ISA.25.3	The cities of violent nations will fear you.
ISA.25.4	For you have been a stronghold for the poor person,
ISA.25.4	a stronghold for the needy
ISA.25.4	a refuge from storms and a shade from heat.
ISA.25.4	When the breath of the violent
ISA.25.4	is like a storm against a wall,
ISA.25.5	like heat in a dry land,
ISA.25.5	you will subdue the uproar of barbarians.
ISA.25.5	As the shade of a cloud cools the heat of the day,
ISA.25.5	so he will silence the song of the violent.
ISA.25.6	On this mountain,
ISA.25.6	the 
ISA.25.6	a feast with aged wine, prime cuts of choice meat,
ISA.25.7	On this mountain
ISA.25.7	he will destroy the burial shroud,
ISA.25.7	the shroud over all the peoples,
ISA.25.7	the sheet covering all the nations;
ISA.25.8	he will destroy death forever.
ISA.25.8	The Lord 
ISA.25.8	from every face
ISA.25.8	and remove his people’s disgrace
ISA.25.8	from the whole earth,
ISA.25.8	for the 
ISA.25.9	On that day it will be said,
ISA.25.9	“Look, this is our God;
ISA.25.9	we have waited for him, and he has saved us.
ISA.25.9	This is the 
ISA.25.9	Let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation.”
ISA.25.10	For the 
ISA.25.10	But Moab
ISA.25.10	as straw is trampled in a dung pile.
ISA.25.11	He will spread out his arms in the middle of it,
ISA.25.11	as a swimmer spreads out his arms to swim.
ISA.25.11	His pride will be brought low,
ISA.25.11	along with the trickery of his hands.
ISA.25.12	The high-walled fortress will be brought down,
ISA.25.12	thrown to the ground, to the dust.
ISA.26.1	On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
ISA.26.1	We have a strong city.
ISA.26.1	Salvation is established as walls and ramparts.
ISA.26.2	Open the gates
ISA.26.2	so a righteous nation can come in —
ISA.26.2	one that remains faithful.
ISA.26.3	You will keep the mind that is dependent on you
ISA.26.3	in perfect peace,
ISA.26.3	for it is trusting in you.
ISA.26.4	Trust in the 
ISA.26.4	because in the 
ISA.26.5	For he has humbled those who live in lofty places —
ISA.26.5	an inaccessible city.
ISA.26.5	He brings it down; he brings it down to the ground;
ISA.26.5	he throws it to the dust.
ISA.26.6	Feet trample it,
ISA.26.6	the feet of the humble,
ISA.26.6	the steps of the poor.
ISA.26.7	The path of the righteous is level;
ISA.26.7	you clear a straight path for the righteous.
ISA.26.8	Yes, 
ISA.26.8	in the path of your judgments.
ISA.26.8	Our desire is for your name and renown.
ISA.26.9	I long for you in the night;
ISA.26.9	yes, my spirit within me diligently seeks you,
ISA.26.9	for when your judgments are in the land,
ISA.26.9	the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	But if the wicked man is shown favor,
ISA.26.10	he does not learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	In a righteous land he acts unjustly
ISA.26.10	and does not see the majesty of the 
ISA.26.11	but they do not see it.
ISA.26.11	Let them see your zeal for your people
ISA.26.11	and be put to shame.
ISA.26.11	Let fire consume your adversaries.
ISA.26.12	for you have also done all our work for us.
ISA.26.13	but we remember your name alone.
ISA.26.14	The dead do not live;
ISA.26.14	departed spirits do not rise up.
ISA.26.14	Indeed, you have punished and destroyed them;
ISA.26.14	you have wiped out all memory of them.
ISA.26.15	You have added to the nation, 
ISA.26.15	You have added to the nation; you are honored.
ISA.26.15	You have expanded all the borders of the land.
ISA.26.16	they poured out whispered prayers
ISA.26.16	because your discipline fell on them.
ISA.26.17	As a pregnant woman about to give birth
ISA.26.17	writhes and cries out in her pains,
ISA.26.17	so we were before you, 
ISA.26.18	We became pregnant, we writhed in pain;
ISA.26.18	we gave birth to wind.
ISA.26.18	We have won no victories on earth,
ISA.26.18	and the earth’s inhabitants have not fallen.
ISA.26.19	Your dead will live; their bodies
ISA.26.19	Awake and sing, you who dwell in the dust!
ISA.26.19	For you will be covered with the morning dew,
ISA.26.19	and the earth will bring out the departed spirits.
ISA.26.20	Go, my people, enter your rooms
ISA.26.20	and close your doors behind you.
ISA.26.20	Hide for a little while until the wrath has passed.
ISA.26.21	For look, the 
ISA.26.21	to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity.
ISA.26.21	The earth will reveal the blood shed on it
ISA.26.21	and will no longer conceal her slain.
ISA.27.1	On that day the 
ISA.27.2	On that day
ISA.27.2	sing about a desirable vineyard:
ISA.27.3	I am the 
ISA.27.3	to water it regularly.
ISA.27.3	So that no one disturbs it,
ISA.27.3	I watch over it night and day.
ISA.27.4	I am not angry.
ISA.27.4	If only there were thorns and briers
ISA.27.4	I would trample them
ISA.27.4	and burn them to the ground.
ISA.27.5	Or let it take hold of my strength;
ISA.27.5	let it make peace with me —
ISA.27.5	make peace with me.
ISA.27.6	In days to come, Jacob will take root.
ISA.27.6	Israel will blossom and bloom
ISA.27.6	and fill the whole world with fruit.
ISA.27.7	Did the 
ISA.27.7	as he struck the one who struck Israel?
ISA.27.7	Was Israel killed like those killed by the 
ISA.27.8	You disputed with Israel
ISA.27.8	by banishing and driving her away.
ISA.27.8	He removed her with his severe storm
ISA.27.8	on the day of the east wind.
ISA.27.9	Therefore Jacob’s iniquity
ISA.27.9	and the result of the removal of his sin will be this:
ISA.27.9	when he makes all the altar stones
ISA.27.9	like crushed bits of chalk,
ISA.27.9	no Asherah poles or incense altars will remain standing.
ISA.27.10	For the fortified city will be desolate,
ISA.27.10	pastures deserted and abandoned like a wilderness.
ISA.27.10	Calves will graze there,
ISA.27.10	and there they will spread out and strip its branches.
ISA.27.11	When its branches dry out, they will be broken off.
ISA.27.11	Women will come and make fires with them,
ISA.27.11	for they are not a people with understanding.
ISA.27.11	Therefore their Maker
ISA.27.11	and their Creator will not be gracious to them.
ISA.27.12	On that day
ISA.27.12	the 
ISA.27.12	as far as the Wadi of Egypt,
ISA.27.12	and you Israelites will be gathered one by one.
ISA.27.13	On that day
ISA.27.13	a great trumpet
ISA.27.13	and those lost in the land of Assyria will come,
ISA.27.13	as well as those dispersed in the land of Egypt;
ISA.27.13	and they will worship the 
ISA.27.13	at Jerusalem on the holy mountain.
ISA.28.1	Woe to the majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards,
ISA.28.1	and to the fading flower of its beautiful splendor,
ISA.28.1	which is on the summit above the rich valley.
ISA.28.1	Woe to those overcome with wine.
ISA.28.2	Look, the Lord has a strong and mighty one
ISA.28.2	like a devastating hail storm,
ISA.28.2	like a storm with strong flooding water.
ISA.28.2	He will bring it across the land with his hand.
ISA.28.3	The majestic crown of Ephraim’s drunkards
ISA.28.3	will be trampled underfoot.
ISA.28.4	The fading flower of his beautiful splendor,
ISA.28.4	which is on the summit above the rich valley,
ISA.28.4	will be like a ripe fig before the summer harvest.
ISA.28.4	Whoever sees it will swallow it
ISA.28.4	while it is still in his hand.
ISA.28.5	On that day
ISA.28.5	the 
ISA.28.5	and a diadem of splendor
ISA.28.5	to the remnant of his people,
ISA.28.6	a spirit of justice
ISA.28.6	to the one who sits in judgment,
ISA.28.6	and strength
ISA.28.6	to those who repel attacks at the city gate.
ISA.28.7	Even these stagger because of wine
ISA.28.7	and stumble under the influence of beer:
ISA.28.7	priest and prophet stagger because of beer,
ISA.28.7	they are confused by wine.
ISA.28.7	They stumble because of beer,
ISA.28.7	they are muddled in their visions,
ISA.28.7	they stumble in their judgments.
ISA.28.8	Indeed, all their tables are covered with vomit;
ISA.28.8	there is no place without a stench.
ISA.28.9	Who is he trying to teach?
ISA.28.9	Who is he trying to instruct?
ISA.28.9	Infants
ISA.28.9	Babies
ISA.28.10	“Law after law, law after law,
ISA.28.10	line after line, line after line,
ISA.28.10	a little here, a little there.”
ISA.28.11	For he will speak to this people
ISA.28.11	with stammering speech
ISA.28.11	and in a foreign language.
ISA.28.12	He had said to them:
ISA.28.12	“This is the place of rest;
ISA.28.12	let the weary rest;
ISA.28.12	this is the place of repose.”
ISA.28.12	But they would not listen.
ISA.28.13	The word of the 
ISA.28.13	“Law after law, law after law,
ISA.28.13	line after line, line after line,
ISA.28.13	a little here, a little there,”
ISA.28.13	so they go stumbling backward,
ISA.28.13	to be broken, trapped, and captured.
ISA.28.14	Therefore hear the word of the 
ISA.28.14	who rule this people in Jerusalem.
ISA.28.15	For you said, “We have made a covenant with Death,
ISA.28.15	and we have an agreement with Sheol;
ISA.28.15	when the overwhelming catastrophe
ISA.28.15	it will not touch us,
ISA.28.15	because we have made falsehood our refuge
ISA.28.15	and have hidden behind treachery.”
ISA.28.16	Therefore the Lord 
ISA.28.16	“Look, I have laid a stone
ISA.28.16	a tested stone,
ISA.28.16	a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation;
ISA.28.16	the one who believes will be unshakable.
ISA.28.17	And I will make justice the measuring line
ISA.28.17	and righteousness the mason’s level.”
ISA.28.17	Hail will sweep away the false refuge,
ISA.28.17	and water will flood your hiding place.
ISA.28.18	Your covenant with Death will be dissolved,
ISA.28.18	and your agreement with Sheol will not last.
ISA.28.18	When the overwhelming catastrophe passes through,
ISA.28.18	you will be trampled.
ISA.28.19	Every time it passes through,
ISA.28.19	it will carry you away;
ISA.28.19	it will pass through every morning —
ISA.28.19	every day and every night.
ISA.28.19	Only terror
ISA.28.19	to understand the message.
ISA.28.20	Indeed, the bed is too short to stretch out on,
ISA.28.20	and its cover too small to wrap up in.
ISA.28.21	For the 
ISA.28.21	He will rise in wrath, as at the Valley of Gibeon,
ISA.28.21	to do his work, his unexpected work,
ISA.28.21	and to perform his task, his unfamiliar task.
ISA.28.22	So now, do not scoff,
ISA.28.22	or your shackles will become stronger.
ISA.28.22	Indeed, I have heard from the Lord 
ISA.28.22	a decree of destruction for the whole land.
ISA.28.23	Listen and hear my voice.
ISA.28.23	Pay attention and hear what I say.
ISA.28.24	Does the plowman plow every day to plant seed?
ISA.28.24	Does he continuously break up and cultivate the soil?
ISA.28.25	When he has leveled its surface,
ISA.28.25	does he not then scatter black cumin and sow cumin?
ISA.28.25	He plants wheat in rows and barley in plots,
ISA.28.25	with spelt as their border.
ISA.28.26	His God teaches him order;
ISA.28.26	he instructs him.
ISA.28.27	Certainly black cumin is not threshed
ISA.28.27	with a threshing board,
ISA.28.27	and a cart wheel is not rolled over the cumin.
ISA.28.27	But black cumin is beaten out with a stick,
ISA.28.27	and cumin with a rod.
ISA.28.28	Bread grain is crushed,
ISA.28.28	but is not threshed endlessly.
ISA.28.28	Though the wheel of the farmer’s cart rumbles,
ISA.28.28	his horses do not crush it.
ISA.28.29	This also comes from the 
ISA.28.29	He gives wondrous advice;
ISA.28.29	he gives great wisdom.
ISA.29.1	Woe to Ariel,
ISA.29.1	the city where David camped!
ISA.29.1	Continue year after year;
ISA.29.1	let the festivals recur.
ISA.29.2	I will oppress Ariel,
ISA.29.2	and there will be mourning and crying,
ISA.29.2	and she will be to me like an Ariel.
ISA.29.3	I will camp in a circle around you;
ISA.29.3	I will besiege you with earth ramps,
ISA.29.3	and I will set up my siege towers against you.
ISA.29.4	You will be brought down;
ISA.29.4	you will speak from the ground,
ISA.29.4	and your words will come from low in the dust.
ISA.29.4	Your voice will be like that of a spirit from the ground;
ISA.29.4	your speech will whisper from the dust.
ISA.29.5	Your many foes
ISA.29.5	and many of the ruthless, like blowing chaff.
ISA.29.5	Then suddenly, in an instant,
ISA.29.6	you will be punished by the 
ISA.29.6	with thunder, earthquake, and loud noise,
ISA.29.6	storm, tempest, and a flame of consuming fire.
ISA.29.7	All the many nations
ISA.29.7	going out to battle against Ariel —
ISA.29.7	all the attackers, the siege works against her,
ISA.29.7	and those who oppress her —
ISA.29.7	will then be like a dream, a vision in the night.
ISA.29.8	It will be like a hungry one who dreams he is eating,
ISA.29.8	then wakes and is still hungry;
ISA.29.8	and like a thirsty one who dreams he is drinking,
ISA.29.8	then wakes and is still thirsty, longing for water.
ISA.29.8	So it will be for all the many nations
ISA.29.8	who go to battle against Mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	Stop and be astonished;
ISA.29.9	blind yourselves and be blind!
ISA.29.9	They are drunk,
ISA.29.9	they stagger,
ISA.29.10	For the 
ISA.29.10	an overwhelming urge to
ISA.29.10	he has shut your eyes (the prophets)
ISA.29.10	and covered your heads (the seers).
ISA.29.11	For you the entire vision will be like the words of a sealed document.
ISA.29.12	And if the document is given to one who cannot read and he is asked to read it,
ISA.29.13	The Lord said:
ISA.29.13	These people approach me with their speeches
ISA.29.13	to honor me with lip-service
ISA.29.13	yet their hearts are far from me,
ISA.29.13	and human rules direct their worship of me.
ISA.29.14	Therefore, I will again confound these people
ISA.29.14	with wonder after wonder.
ISA.29.14	The wisdom of their wise will vanish,
ISA.29.14	and the perception of their perceptive will be hidden.
ISA.29.15	Woe to those who go to great lengths
ISA.29.15	to hide their plans from the 
ISA.29.15	They do their works in the dark,
ISA.29.15	and say, “Who sees us? Who knows us?” 
ISA.29.16	You have turned things around,
ISA.29.16	as if the potter were the same as the clay.
ISA.29.16	How can what is made say about its maker,
ISA.29.16	“He didn’t make me”?
ISA.29.16	How can what is formed
ISA.29.16	say about the one who formed it,
ISA.29.16	“He doesn’t understand what he’s doing”?
ISA.29.17	Isn’t it true that in just a little while
ISA.29.17	Lebanon will become an orchard,
ISA.29.17	and the orchard will seem like a forest?
ISA.29.18	On that day the deaf will hear
ISA.29.18	the words of a document,
ISA.29.18	and out of a deep darkness
ISA.29.18	the eyes of the blind will see.
ISA.29.19	The humble will have joy
ISA.29.19	after joy in the 
ISA.29.19	and the poor people will rejoice
ISA.29.19	in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.29.20	For the ruthless one will vanish,
ISA.29.20	the scorner will disappear,
ISA.29.20	and all those who lie in wait with evil intent
ISA.29.20	will be killed —
ISA.29.21	those who, with their speech,
ISA.29.21	accuse a person of wrongdoing,
ISA.29.21	who set a trap for the one mediating at the city gate
ISA.29.21	and without cause deprive the righteous of justice.
ISA.29.22	Therefore, the 
ISA.29.22	Jacob will no longer be ashamed,
ISA.29.22	and his face will no longer be pale.
ISA.29.23	For when he sees his children,
ISA.29.23	the work of my hands within his nation,
ISA.29.23	they will honor my name,
ISA.29.23	they will honor the Holy One of Jacob
ISA.29.23	and stand in awe of the God of Israel.
ISA.29.24	Those who are confused will gain understanding,
ISA.29.24	and those who grumble will accept instruction.
ISA.30.1	Woe to the rebellious children!
ISA.30.1	This is the 
ISA.30.1	They carry out a plan,
ISA.30.1	they make an alliance,
ISA.30.1	but against my will,
ISA.30.1	piling sin on top of sin.
ISA.30.2	Without asking my advice
ISA.30.2	they set out to go down to Egypt
ISA.30.2	in order to seek shelter under Pharaoh’s protection
ISA.30.2	and take refuge in Egypt’s shadow.
ISA.30.3	But Pharaoh’s protection will become your shame,
ISA.30.3	and refuge in Egypt’s shadow your humiliation.
ISA.30.4	For though his
ISA.30.4	and his messengers reach as far as Hanes,
ISA.30.5	everyone will be ashamed
ISA.30.5	because of a people who can’t help.
ISA.30.5	They are of no benefit, they are no help;
ISA.30.5	they are good for nothing but shame and disgrace.
ISA.30.6	A pronouncement
ISA.30.6	Through a land of trouble and distress,
ISA.30.6	of lioness and lion,
ISA.30.6	of viper and flying serpent,
ISA.30.6	they carry their wealth on the backs of donkeys
ISA.30.6	and their treasures on the humps of camels,
ISA.30.6	to a people who will not help them.
ISA.30.7	Egypt’s help is completely worthless;
ISA.30.7	therefore, I call her:
ISA.30.7	Rahab Who Just Sits.
ISA.30.8	Go now, write it on a tablet in their presence
ISA.30.8	and inscribe it on a scroll;
ISA.30.8	it will be for the future,
ISA.30.8	forever and ever.
ISA.30.9	They are a rebellious people,
ISA.30.9	deceptive children,
ISA.30.9	children who do not want to listen to the 
ISA.30.10	They say to the seers, “Do not see,”
ISA.30.10	and to the prophets,
ISA.30.10	“Do not prophesy the truth to us.
ISA.30.10	Tell us flattering things.
ISA.30.10	Prophesy illusions.
ISA.30.11	Get out of the way!
ISA.30.11	Leave the pathway.
ISA.30.11	Rid us of the Holy One of Israel.”
ISA.30.12	Therefore the Holy One of Israel says:
ISA.30.12	“Because you have rejected this message
ISA.30.12	and have trusted in oppression and deceit,
ISA.30.12	and have depended on them,
ISA.30.13	this iniquity
ISA.30.13	like a crumbling gap,
ISA.30.13	a bulge in a high wall
ISA.30.13	whose collapse will come in an instant — suddenly!
ISA.30.14	Its collapse will be like the shattering
ISA.30.14	of a potter’s jar,
ISA.30.14	so that not even a fragment of pottery
ISA.30.14	will be found among its shattered remains —
ISA.30.14	no fragment large enough to take fire from a hearth
ISA.30.14	or scoop water from a cistern.”
ISA.30.15	For the Lord 
ISA.30.15	“You will be delivered by returning and resting;
ISA.30.15	your strength will lie in quiet confidence.
ISA.30.15	But you are not willing.”
ISA.30.16	You say, “No!
ISA.30.16	We will escape on horses” —
ISA.30.16	therefore you will escape! —
ISA.30.16	and, “We will ride on fast horses” —
ISA.30.16	but those who pursue you will be faster.
ISA.30.17	One thousand will flee at the threat of one,
ISA.30.17	at the threat of five you will flee,
ISA.30.17	until you remain
ISA.30.17	like a solitary pole on a mountaintop
ISA.30.17	or a banner on a hill.
ISA.30.18	Therefore the 
ISA.30.18	and is rising up to show you compassion,
ISA.30.18	for the 
ISA.30.18	All who wait patiently for him are happy.
ISA.30.19	For people will live on Zion in Jerusalem. You will never weep again; he will show favor to you at the sound of your outcry; as soon as he hears, he will answer you. 
ISA.30.20	The Lord will give you meager bread and water during oppression,
ISA.30.21	and whenever you turn to the right or to the left, your ears will hear this command behind you: “This is the way. Walk in it.”
ISA.30.22	Then you will defile your silver-plated idols and your gold-plated images. You will throw them away like menstrual cloths, and call them filth.
ISA.30.23	Then he will send rain for your seed that you have sown in the ground, and the food, the produce of the ground, will be rich and plentiful. On that day your cattle will graze in open pastures.
ISA.30.24	The oxen and donkeys that work the ground will eat salted fodder scattered with winnowing shovel
ISA.30.25	Streams flowing with water will be on every high mountain and every raised hill on the day of great slaughter when the towers fall. 
ISA.30.26	The moonlight will be as bright as the sunlight, and the sunlight will be seven times brighter
ISA.30.27	Look there! The 
ISA.30.27	his anger burning and heavy with smoke.
ISA.30.27	His lips are full of fury,
ISA.30.27	and his tongue is like a consuming fire.
ISA.30.28	His breath is like an overflowing torrent
ISA.30.28	that rises to the neck.
ISA.30.28	He comes to sift the nations in a sieve of destruction
ISA.30.28	and to put a bridle on the jaws of the peoples
ISA.30.28	to lead them astray.
ISA.30.29	Your singing will be like that
ISA.30.29	on the night of a holy festival,
ISA.30.29	and your heart will rejoice
ISA.30.29	like one who walks to the music of a flute,
ISA.30.29	going up to the mountain of the 
ISA.30.29	to the Rock of Israel.
ISA.30.30	And the 
ISA.30.30	and reveal his arm
ISA.30.30	and a flame of consuming fire,
ISA.30.30	in driving rain, a torrent, and hailstones.
ISA.30.31	Assyria will be shattered by the voice of the 
ISA.30.31	He will strike with a rod.
ISA.30.32	And every stroke of the appointed
ISA.30.32	that the 
ISA.30.32	will be to the sound of tambourines and lyres;
ISA.30.32	he will fight against him with brandished weapons.
ISA.30.33	Indeed! Topheth has been ready
ISA.30.33	for the king for a long time.
ISA.30.33	Its funeral pyre is deep and wide,
ISA.30.33	with plenty of fire and wood.
ISA.30.33	The breath of the 
ISA.30.33	kindles it.
ISA.31.1	Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help
ISA.31.1	and who depend on horses!
ISA.31.1	They trust in the abundance of chariots
ISA.31.1	and in the large number of horsemen.
ISA.31.1	They do not look
ISA.31.1	and they do not seek the 
ISA.31.2	But he also is wise and brings disaster.
ISA.31.2	He does not go back on what he says;
ISA.31.2	he will rise up against the house of the wicked
ISA.31.2	and against the allies of evildoers.
ISA.31.3	Egyptians are men, not God;
ISA.31.3	their horses are flesh, not spirit.
ISA.31.3	When the 
ISA.31.3	the helper will stumble
ISA.31.3	and the one who is helped will fall;
ISA.31.3	both will perish together.
ISA.31.4	For this is what the 
ISA.31.4	As a lion or young lion growls over its prey
ISA.31.4	when a band of shepherds is called out against it,
ISA.31.4	and is not terrified by their shouting
ISA.31.4	or subdued by their noise,
ISA.31.4	so the 
ISA.31.4	to fight on Mount Zion
ISA.31.4	and on its hill.
ISA.31.5	Like hovering birds,
ISA.31.5	so the 
ISA.31.5	by protecting it, he will rescue it,
ISA.31.5	by sparing it, he will deliver it.
ISA.31.6	Return to the one the Israelites have greatly rebelled against.
ISA.31.7	For on that day, every one of you will reject the silver and gold idols that your own hands have sinfully made.
ISA.31.8	Then Assyria will fall,
ISA.31.8	but not by human sword;
ISA.31.8	a sword will devour him,
ISA.31.8	but not one made by man.
ISA.31.8	He will flee from the sword;
ISA.31.8	his young men will be put to forced labor.
ISA.31.9	His rock
ISA.31.9	and his officers will be afraid because of the signal flag.
ISA.31.9	This is the 
ISA.32.1	Indeed, a king will reign righteously,
ISA.32.1	and rulers will rule justly.
ISA.32.2	Each will be like a shelter from the wind,
ISA.32.2	a refuge from the rain,
ISA.32.2	like flowing streams
ISA.32.2	and the shade of a massive rock in an arid land.
ISA.32.3	Then the eyes of those who see will not be closed,
ISA.32.3	and the ears of those who hear will listen.
ISA.32.4	The reckless mind will gain knowledge,
ISA.32.4	and the stammering tongue
ISA.32.5	A fool will no longer be called a noble,
ISA.32.5	nor a scoundrel said to be important.
ISA.32.6	For a fool speaks foolishness
ISA.32.6	and his mind plots iniquity.
ISA.32.6	He lives in a godless way
ISA.32.6	and speaks falsely about the 
ISA.32.6	He leaves the hungry empty
ISA.32.6	and deprives the thirsty of drink.
ISA.32.7	The scoundrel’s weapons are destructive;
ISA.32.7	he hatches plots to destroy the needy with lies,
ISA.32.7	even when the poor person says what is right.
ISA.32.8	But a noble person plans noble things;
ISA.32.8	he stands up for noble causes.
ISA.32.9	Stand up, you complacent women;
ISA.32.9	listen to me.
ISA.32.9	Pay attention to what I say,
ISA.32.9	you overconfident daughters.
ISA.32.10	In a little more than a year
ISA.32.10	you overconfident ones will shudder,
ISA.32.10	for the grapes will fail
ISA.32.10	and the harvest will not come.
ISA.32.11	Shudder, you complacent ones;
ISA.32.11	tremble, you overconfident ones!
ISA.32.11	Strip yourselves bare
ISA.32.11	and put sackcloth around your waists.
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts in mourning
ISA.32.12	for the delightful fields and the fruitful vines,
ISA.32.13	for the ground of my people
ISA.32.13	growing thorns and briers,
ISA.32.13	indeed, for every joyous house in the jubilant city.
ISA.32.14	For the palace will be deserted,
ISA.32.14	the busy city abandoned.
ISA.32.14	The hill and the watchtower will become
ISA.32.14	barren places forever,
ISA.32.14	the joy of wild donkeys,
ISA.32.14	and a pasture for flocks,
ISA.32.15	until the Spirit
ISA.32.15	Then the desert will become an orchard,
ISA.32.15	and the orchard will seem like a forest.
ISA.32.16	Then justice will inhabit the wilderness,
ISA.32.16	and righteousness will dwell in the orchard.
ISA.32.17	The result of righteousness will be peace;
ISA.32.17	the effect of righteousness
ISA.32.17	will be quiet confidence forever.
ISA.32.18	Then my people will dwell in a peaceful place,
ISA.32.18	in safe and secure dwellings.
ISA.32.19	But hail will level the forest,
ISA.32.19	and the city will sink into the depths.
ISA.32.20	You will be happy as you sow seed
ISA.32.20	beside abundant water,
ISA.32.20	and as you let oxen and donkeys range freely.
ISA.33.1	Woe, you destroyer never destroyed,
ISA.33.1	you traitor never betrayed!
ISA.33.1	When you have finished destroying,
ISA.33.1	you will be destroyed.
ISA.33.1	When you have finished betraying,
ISA.33.1	they will betray you.
ISA.33.2	Be our strength every morning
ISA.33.2	and our salvation in time of trouble.
ISA.33.3	The peoples flee at the thunderous noise;
ISA.33.3	the nations scatter when you rise in your majesty.
ISA.33.4	Your spoil will be gathered as locusts are gathered;
ISA.33.4	people will swarm over it like an infestation of locusts.
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.5	he has filled Zion with justice and righteousness.
ISA.33.6	There will be times of security for you —
ISA.33.6	a storehouse of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.
ISA.33.6	The fear of the 
ISA.33.7	Listen! Their warriors cry loudly in the streets;
ISA.33.7	the messengers of peace weep bitterly.
ISA.33.8	The highways are deserted;
ISA.33.8	travel has ceased.
ISA.33.8	An agreement has been broken,
ISA.33.8	cities
ISA.33.8	and human life disregarded.
ISA.33.9	The land mourns and withers;
ISA.33.9	Lebanon is ashamed and wilted.
ISA.33.9	Sharon is like a desert;
ISA.33.9	Bashan and Carmel shake off their leaves.
ISA.33.10	“Now I will rise up,”
ISA.33.10	“Now I will lift myself up.
ISA.33.10	Now I will be exalted.
ISA.33.11	You will conceive chaff;
ISA.33.11	you will give birth to stubble.
ISA.33.11	Your breath is fire that will consume you.
ISA.33.12	The peoples will be burned to ashes,
ISA.33.12	like thorns cut down and burned in a fire.
ISA.33.13	You who are far off, hear what I have done;
ISA.33.13	you who are near,
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are afraid;
ISA.33.14	trembling seizes the ungodly:
ISA.33.14	“Who among us can dwell with a consuming fire?
ISA.33.14	Who among us can dwell with ever-burning flames?”
ISA.33.15	The one who lives righteously
ISA.33.15	and speaks rightly,
ISA.33.15	who refuses profit from extortion,
ISA.33.15	whose hand never takes a bribe,
ISA.33.15	who stops his ears from listening to murderous plots
ISA.33.15	and shuts his eyes against evil schemes
ISA.33.16	he will dwell on the heights;
ISA.33.16	his refuge will be the rocky fortresses,
ISA.33.16	his food provided, his water assured.
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the King in his beauty;
ISA.33.17	you will see a vast land.
ISA.33.18	Your mind will meditate on the past terror:
ISA.33.18	“Where is the accountant?
ISA.33.18	Where is the tribute collector?
ISA.33.18	Where is the one who spied out our defenses?” 
ISA.33.19	You will no longer see the barbarians,
ISA.33.19	a people whose speech is difficult to comprehend —
ISA.33.19	who stammer in a language that is not understood.
ISA.33.20	Look at Zion, the city of our festival times.
ISA.33.20	Your eyes will see Jerusalem,
ISA.33.20	a peaceful pasture,
ISA.33.20	its tent pegs will not be pulled up
ISA.33.20	nor will any of its cords be loosened.
ISA.33.21	For the majestic one, our 
ISA.33.21	a place of rivers and broad streams
ISA.33.21	where ships that are rowed will not go,
ISA.33.21	and majestic vessels will not pass.
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.22	the 
ISA.33.22	the 
ISA.33.22	He will save us.
ISA.33.23	Your ropes are slack;
ISA.33.23	they cannot hold the base of the mast
ISA.33.23	or spread out the flag.
ISA.33.23	Then abundant spoil will be divided,
ISA.33.23	the lame will plunder it,
ISA.33.24	and none there will say, “I am sick.”
ISA.33.24	The people who dwell there
ISA.33.24	will be forgiven
ISA.34.1	You nations, come here and listen;
ISA.34.1	you peoples, pay attention!
ISA.34.1	Let the earth and all that fills it hear,
ISA.34.1	the world and all that comes from it.
ISA.34.2	The 
ISA.34.2	furious with all their armies.
ISA.34.2	He will set them apart for destruction,
ISA.34.2	giving them over to slaughter.
ISA.34.3	Their slain will be thrown out,
ISA.34.3	and the stench of their corpses will rise;
ISA.34.3	the mountains will flow
ISA.34.4	All
ISA.34.4	The sky will roll up like a scroll,
ISA.34.4	and its stars will all wither
ISA.34.4	as leaves wither on the vine,
ISA.34.4	and foliage on the fig tree.
ISA.34.5	When my sword has drunk its fill
ISA.34.5	it will then come down on Edom
ISA.34.5	and on the people I have set apart for destruction.
ISA.34.6	The 
ISA.34.6	It drips with fat,
ISA.34.6	with the blood of lambs and goats,
ISA.34.6	with the fat of the kidneys of rams.
ISA.34.6	For the 
ISA.34.6	a great slaughter in the land of Edom.
ISA.34.7	The wild oxen will be struck
ISA.34.7	and young bulls with the mighty bulls.
ISA.34.7	Their land will be soaked with
ISA.34.7	and their soil will be saturated with fat.
ISA.34.8	For the 
ISA.34.8	a time of paying back Edom
ISA.34.8	for its hostility against Zion.
ISA.34.9	Edom’s streams will be turned into pitch,
ISA.34.9	her soil into sulfur;
ISA.34.9	her land will become burning pitch.
ISA.34.10	It will never go out — day or night.
ISA.34.10	Its smoke will go up forever.
ISA.34.10	It will be desolate, from generation to generation;
ISA.34.10	no one will pass through it forever and ever.
ISA.34.11	Eagle owls
ISA.34.11	and long-eared owls and ravens will dwell there.
ISA.34.11	The 
ISA.34.11	and a plumb line over her
ISA.34.11	for her destruction and chaos.
ISA.34.12	No nobles will be left to proclaim a king,
ISA.34.12	and all her princes will come to nothing.
ISA.34.13	Her palaces will be overgrown with thorns;
ISA.34.13	her fortified cities, with thistles and briers.
ISA.34.13	She will become a dwelling for jackals,
ISA.34.13	an abode
ISA.34.14	The desert creatures will meet hyenas,
ISA.34.14	and one wild goat will call to another.
ISA.34.14	Indeed, the night birds will stay there
ISA.34.14	and will find a resting place.
ISA.34.15	Sand partridges
ISA.34.15	they will lay and hatch their eggs
ISA.34.15	and will gather their broods under their shadows.
ISA.34.15	Indeed, the birds of prey will gather there,
ISA.34.15	each with its mate.
ISA.34.16	Search and read the scroll of the 
ISA.34.16	Not one of them will be missing,
ISA.34.16	none will be lacking its mate,
ISA.34.16	because he has ordered it by my
ISA.34.16	and he will gather them by his Spirit.
ISA.34.17	He has cast the lot for them;
ISA.34.17	his hand allotted their portion with a measuring line.
ISA.34.17	They will possess it forever;
ISA.34.17	they will dwell in it from generation to generation.
ISA.35.1	The wilderness and the dry land will be glad;
ISA.35.1	the desert will rejoice and blossom like a wildflower.
ISA.35.2	It will blossom abundantly
ISA.35.2	and will also rejoice with joy and singing.
ISA.35.2	The glory of Lebanon will be given to it,
ISA.35.2	the splendor of Carmel and Sharon.
ISA.35.2	They will see the glory of the 
ISA.35.2	the splendor of our God.
ISA.35.3	Strengthen the weak hands,
ISA.35.3	steady the shaking knees!
ISA.35.4	Say to the cowardly:
ISA.35.4	“Be strong; do not fear!
ISA.35.4	Here is your God; vengeance is coming.
ISA.35.4	God’s retribution is coming; he will save you.”
ISA.35.5	Then the eyes of the blind will be opened,
ISA.35.5	and the ears of the deaf unstopped.
ISA.35.6	Then the lame will leap like a deer,
ISA.35.6	and the tongue of the mute will sing for joy,
ISA.35.6	for water will gush in the wilderness,
ISA.35.6	and streams in the desert;
ISA.35.7	the parched ground will become a pool,
ISA.35.7	and the thirsty land springs.
ISA.35.7	In the haunt of jackals,
ISA.35.7	there will be grass, reeds, and papyrus.
ISA.35.8	A road will be there and a way;
ISA.35.8	it will be called the Holy Way.
ISA.35.8	The unclean will not travel on it,
ISA.35.8	but it will be for the one who walks the path.
ISA.35.8	Fools will not wander on it.
ISA.35.9	There will be no lion there,
ISA.35.9	and no vicious beast will go up on it;
ISA.35.9	they will not be found there.
ISA.35.9	But the redeemed will walk on it,
ISA.35.10	and the ransomed of the 
ISA.35.10	and come to Zion with singing,
ISA.35.10	crowned with unending joy.
ISA.35.10	Joy and gladness will overtake them,
ISA.35.10	and sorrow and sighing will flee.
ISA.36.1	In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah,
ISA.36.2	Then the king of Assyria sent his royal spokesman, along with a massive army, from Lachish
ISA.36.3	Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary,
ISA.36.4	The royal spokesman said to them, “Tell Hezekiah:
ISA.36.4	The great king, the king of Assyria, says this: What are you relying on?
ISA.36.5	You
ISA.36.6	Look, you are relying on Egypt, that splintered reed of a staff
ISA.36.7	Suppose you say to me, ‘We rely on the 
ISA.36.8	“Now make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria. I’ll give you two thousand horses if you’re able to supply riders for them! 
ISA.36.9	How then can you drive back a single officer among the least of my master’s servants? How can you rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen?
ISA.36.10	Have I attacked this land to destroy it without the 
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the royal spokesman, “Please speak to your servants in Aramaic,
ISA.36.12	But the royal spokesman replied, “Has my master sent me to speak these words to your master and to you, and not to the men who are sitting on the wall, who are destined with you to eat their own excrement and drink their own urine?”
ISA.36.13	Then the royal spokesman stood and called out loudly in Hebrew:
ISA.36.13	Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria! 
ISA.36.14	This is what the king says: “Don’t let Hezekiah deceive you,
ISA.36.15	Don’t let Hezekiah persuade you to rely on the 
ISA.36.16	Don’t listen to Hezekiah, for this is what the king of Assyria says: “Make peace
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land — a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards. 
ISA.36.18	Beware that Hezekiah does not mislead you by saying, ‘The 
ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?
ISA.36.20	Who among all the gods of these lands ever rescued his land from my power? So will the 
ISA.36.21	But they kept silent; they didn’t say anything, for the king’s command was, “Don’t answer him.”
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and Joah son of Asaph, the court historian, came to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and reported to him the words of the royal spokesman.
ISA.37.1	When King Hezekiah heard their report,
ISA.37.2	He sent Eliakim, who was in charge of the palace, Shebna the court secretary, and the leading priests, who were wearing sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
ISA.37.3	They said to him, “This is what Hezekiah says: ‘Today is a day of distress, rebuke, and disgrace.
ISA.37.4	Perhaps the 
ISA.37.5	So the servants of King Hezekiah went to Isaiah, 
ISA.37.6	who said to them, “Tell your master, ‘The 
ISA.37.7	I am about to put a spirit
ISA.37.8	When the royal spokesman heard that the king of Assyria had pulled out of Lachish,
ISA.37.9	The king had heard concerning King Tirhakah of Cush,
ISA.37.10	“Say this to King Hezekiah of Judah: ‘Don’t let your God, on whom you rely, deceive you
ISA.37.11	Look, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the countries: they completely destroyed them. Will you be rescued? 
ISA.37.12	Did the gods of the nations
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of
ISA.37.14	Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers’ hands, read it, then went up to the 
ISA.37.15	Then Hezekiah prayed
ISA.37.17	Listen closely, 
ISA.37.18	, it is true that the kings of Assyria have devastated all these countries and their lands. 
ISA.37.19	They have thrown their gods into the fire, for they were not gods
ISA.37.20	Now, 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah: “The 
ISA.37.22	this is the word the 
ISA.37.22	Virgin Daughter Zion
ISA.37.22	despises you and scorns you;
ISA.37.22	Daughter Jerusalem shakes her head
ISA.37.22	behind your back.
ISA.37.23	Who is it you have mocked
ISA.37.23	Against whom have you raised your voice
ISA.37.23	and lifted your eyes in pride?
ISA.37.23	Against the Holy One of Israel!
ISA.37.24	You have mocked the Lord through
ISA.37.24	You have said, “With my many chariots
ISA.37.24	I have gone up to the heights of the mountains,
ISA.37.24	to the far recesses of Lebanon.
ISA.37.24	I cut down its tallest cedars,
ISA.37.24	its choice cypress trees.
ISA.37.24	I came to its distant heights,
ISA.37.24	its densest forest.
ISA.37.25	I dug wells and drank water in foreign lands.
ISA.37.25	I dried up all the streams of Egypt
ISA.37.25	with the soles of my feet.”
ISA.37.26	Have you not heard?
ISA.37.26	I designed it long ago;
ISA.37.26	I planned it in days gone by.
ISA.37.26	I have now brought it to pass,
ISA.37.26	and you have crushed fortified cities
ISA.37.26	into piles of rubble.
ISA.37.27	Their inhabitants have become powerless,
ISA.37.27	dismayed, and ashamed.
ISA.37.27	They are plants of the field,
ISA.37.27	tender grass,
ISA.37.27	grass on the rooftops,
ISA.37.27	blasted by the east wind.
ISA.37.28	But I know your sitting down,
ISA.37.28	your going out and your coming in,
ISA.37.28	and your raging against me.
ISA.37.29	Because your raging against me
ISA.37.29	and your arrogance have reached my ears,
ISA.37.29	I will put my hook in your nose
ISA.37.29	and my bit in your mouth;
ISA.37.29	I will make you go back
ISA.37.29	the way you came.
ISA.37.30	“‘This will be the sign for you:
ISA.37.31	The surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root
ISA.37.32	For a remnant
ISA.37.33	“Therefore, this is what the 
ISA.37.33	He will not enter this city,
ISA.37.33	shoot an arrow here,
ISA.37.33	come before it with a shield,
ISA.37.33	or build up a siege ramp against it.
ISA.37.34	He will go back
ISA.37.34	the way he came,
ISA.37.34	and he will not enter this city.
ISA.37.34	This is the 
ISA.37.35	I will defend this city and rescue it
ISA.37.35	for my sake
ISA.37.35	and for the sake of my servant David.”
ISA.37.36	Then
ISA.37.37	So King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and left. He returned home and lived in Nineveh.
ISA.37.38	One day, while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer struck him down with the sword and escaped to the land of Ararat.
ISA.38.1	In those days Hezekiah became terminally ill.
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the 
ISA.38.3	He said, “Please, 
ISA.38.4	Then the word of the 
ISA.38.5	“Go and tell Hezekiah, ‘This is what the 
ISA.38.6	And I will rescue you and this city from the grasp of the king of Assyria; I will defend this city.
ISA.38.7	This is the sign to you
ISA.38.8	I am going to make the sun’s shadow that goes down on the stairway of Ahaz go back by ten steps.’”
ISA.38.9	A poem by King Hezekiah of Judah after he had been sick and had recovered from his illness:
ISA.38.10	I said: In the prime
ISA.38.10	I must go to the gates of Sheol;
ISA.38.10	I am deprived of the rest of my years.
ISA.38.11	I said: I will never see the 
ISA.38.11	the 
ISA.38.11	I will not look on humanity any longer
ISA.38.11	with the inhabitants of what is passing away.
ISA.38.12	My dwelling is plucked up and removed from me
ISA.38.12	like a shepherd’s tent.
ISA.38.12	I have rolled up my life like a weaver;
ISA.38.12	he cuts me off from the loom.
ISA.38.12	By nightfall
ISA.38.13	I thought until the morning:
ISA.38.13	He will break all my bones like a lion.
ISA.38.13	By nightfall you make an end of me.
ISA.38.14	I chirp like a swallow or a crane;
ISA.38.14	I moan like a dove.
ISA.38.14	My eyes grow weak looking upward.
ISA.38.14	Lord, I am oppressed; support me.
ISA.38.15	What can I say?
ISA.38.15	He has spoken to me,
ISA.38.15	and he himself has done it.
ISA.38.15	I walk along slowly all my years
ISA.38.15	because of the bitterness of my soul.
ISA.38.16	Lord, by such things people live,
ISA.38.16	and in every one of them my spirit finds life;
ISA.38.16	you have restored me to health
ISA.38.16	and let me live.
ISA.38.17	Indeed, it was for my own well-being
ISA.38.17	that I had such intense bitterness;
ISA.38.17	but your love has delivered me
ISA.38.17	from the Pit of destruction,
ISA.38.17	for you have thrown all my sins behind your back.
ISA.38.18	For Sheol cannot thank you;
ISA.38.18	Death cannot praise you.
ISA.38.18	Those who go down to the Pit
ISA.38.18	cannot hope for your faithfulness.
ISA.38.19	The living, only the living can thank you,
ISA.38.19	as I do today;
ISA.38.19	a father will make your faithfulness known to children.
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.20	we will play stringed instruments
ISA.38.20	all the days of our lives
ISA.38.20	at the house of the 
ISA.38.21	Now Isaiah
ISA.38.22	And Hezekiah had asked, “What is the sign that I will go up to the 
ISA.39.1	At that time
ISA.39.2	Hezekiah was pleased with the letters, and he showed the envoys his treasure house — the silver, the gold, the spices, and the precious oil — and all his armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries.
ISA.39.3	Then the prophet Isaiah came to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say, and where did they come to you from?”
ISA.39.3	Hezekiah replied, “They came to me from a distant country, from Babylon.”
ISA.39.4	Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your palace?”
ISA.39.4	Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything in my palace. There isn’t anything in my treasuries that I didn’t show them.”
ISA.39.5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Hear the word of the 
ISA.39.6	‘Look, the days are coming when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until today will be carried off to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the 
ISA.39.7	‘Some of your descendants — who come from you, whom you father — will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”
ISA.39.8	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The word of the 
ISA.40.1	“Comfort, comfort my people,”
ISA.40.1	says your God.
ISA.40.2	“Speak tenderly to
ISA.40.2	and announce to her
ISA.40.2	that her time of forced labor is over,
ISA.40.2	her iniquity
ISA.40.2	and she has received from the 
ISA.40.2	double for all her sins.”
ISA.40.3	A voice of one crying out:
ISA.40.3	Prepare the way of the 
ISA.40.3	make a straight highway for our God in the desert.
ISA.40.4	Every valley will be lifted up,
ISA.40.4	and every mountain and hill will be leveled;
ISA.40.4	the uneven ground will become smooth
ISA.40.4	and the rough places, a plain.
ISA.40.5	And the glory of the 
ISA.40.5	and all humanity
ISA.40.5	for the mouth of the 
ISA.40.6	A voice was saying, “Cry out!”
ISA.40.6	Another said,
ISA.40.6	“All humanity is grass,
ISA.40.6	and all its goodness is like the flower of the field.
ISA.40.7	The grass withers, the flowers fade
ISA.40.7	when the breath
ISA.40.7	indeed, the people are grass.
ISA.40.8	The grass withers, the flowers fade,
ISA.40.8	but the word of our God remains forever.”
ISA.40.9	Zion, herald of good news,
ISA.40.9	go up on a high mountain.
ISA.40.9	Jerusalem, herald of good news,
ISA.40.9	raise your voice loudly.
ISA.40.9	Raise it, do not be afraid!
ISA.40.9	Say to the cities of Judah,
ISA.40.9	“Here is your God!” 
ISA.40.10	See, the Lord 
ISA.40.10	and his power establishes his rule.
ISA.40.10	His wages are with him,
ISA.40.10	and his reward accompanies him.
ISA.40.11	He protects his flock like a shepherd;
ISA.40.11	he gathers the lambs in his arms
ISA.40.11	and carries them in the fold of his garment.
ISA.40.11	He gently leads those that are nursing.
ISA.40.12	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand
ISA.40.12	or marked off the heavens with the span of his hand?
ISA.40.12	Who has gathered the dust of the earth in a measure
ISA.40.12	or weighed the mountains on a balance
ISA.40.12	and the hills on the scales?
ISA.40.13	Who has directed
ISA.40.13	or who gave him counsel?
ISA.40.14	Who did he consult?
ISA.40.14	Who gave him understanding
ISA.40.14	and taught him the paths of justice?
ISA.40.14	Who taught him knowledge
ISA.40.14	and showed him the way of understanding?
ISA.40.15	Look, the nations are like a drop in a bucket;
ISA.40.15	they are considered as a speck of dust on the scales;
ISA.40.15	he lifts up the islands like fine dust.
ISA.40.16	Lebanon’s cedars are not enough for fuel,
ISA.40.16	or its animals enough for a burnt offering.
ISA.40.17	All the nations are as nothing before him;
ISA.40.17	they are considered by him
ISA.40.17	as empty nothingness.
ISA.40.18	With whom will you compare God?
ISA.40.18	What likeness will you set up for comparison with him?
ISA.40.19	An idol? — something that a smelter casts
ISA.40.19	and a metalworker plates with gold
ISA.40.19	and makes silver chains for?
ISA.40.20	A poor person contributes wood for a pedestal
ISA.40.20	that will not rot.
ISA.40.20	He looks for a skilled craftsman
ISA.40.20	to set up an idol that will not fall over.
ISA.40.21	Do you not know?
ISA.40.21	Have you not heard?
ISA.40.21	Has it not been declared to you
ISA.40.21	from the beginning?
ISA.40.21	Have you not considered
ISA.40.21	the foundations of the earth?
ISA.40.22	God is enthroned above the circle of the earth;
ISA.40.22	its inhabitants are like grasshoppers.
ISA.40.22	He stretches out the heavens like thin cloth
ISA.40.22	and spreads them out like a tent to live in.
ISA.40.23	He reduces princes to nothing
ISA.40.23	and makes judges of the earth like a wasteland.
ISA.40.24	They are barely planted, barely sown,
ISA.40.24	their stem hardly takes root in the ground
ISA.40.24	when he blows on them and they wither,
ISA.40.24	and a whirlwind carries them away like stubble.
ISA.40.25	“To whom will you compare me,
ISA.40.25	or who is my equal?” asks the Holy One.
ISA.40.26	Look up
ISA.40.26	Who created
ISA.40.26	He brings out the stars by number;
ISA.40.26	he calls all of them by name.
ISA.40.26	Because of his great power and strength,
ISA.40.26	not one of them is missing.
ISA.40.27	Jacob, why do you say,
ISA.40.27	and, Israel, why do you assert:
ISA.40.27	“My way is hidden from the 
ISA.40.27	and my claim is ignored by my God”?
ISA.40.28	Do you not know?
ISA.40.28	Have you not heard?
ISA.40.28	The 
ISA.40.28	the Creator of the whole earth.
ISA.40.28	He never becomes faint or weary;
ISA.40.28	there is no limit to his understanding.
ISA.40.29	He gives strength to the faint
ISA.40.29	and strengthens the powerless.
ISA.40.30	Youths may become faint and weary,
ISA.40.30	and young men stumble and fall,
ISA.40.31	but those who trust in the 
ISA.40.31	will renew their strength;
ISA.40.31	they will soar on wings like eagles;
ISA.40.31	they will run and not become weary,
ISA.40.31	they will walk and not faint.
ISA.41.1	“Be silent before me, coasts and islands!
ISA.41.1	And let peoples renew their strength.
ISA.41.1	Let them approach; let them testify;
ISA.41.1	let’s come together for the trial.
ISA.41.2	Who has stirred up someone from the east?
ISA.41.2	In righteousness he calls him to serve.
ISA.41.2	The 
ISA.41.2	and he subdues kings.
ISA.41.2	He makes them like dust with his sword,
ISA.41.2	like wind-driven stubble with his bow.
ISA.41.3	He pursues them, going on safely,
ISA.41.3	hardly touching the path with his feet.
ISA.41.4	Who has performed and done this,
ISA.41.4	calling the generations from the beginning?
ISA.41.4	I am the 
ISA.41.4	and with the last
ISA.41.5	The coasts and islands see and are afraid,
ISA.41.5	the whole earth trembles.
ISA.41.5	They approach and arrive.
ISA.41.6	Each one helps the other,
ISA.41.6	and says to another, “Take courage!”
ISA.41.7	The craftsman encourages the metalworker;
ISA.41.7	the one who flattens with the hammer
ISA.41.7	encourages the one who strikes the anvil,
ISA.41.7	saying of the soldering, “It is good.”
ISA.41.7	He fastens it with nails so that it will not fall over.
ISA.41.8	But you, Israel, my servant,
ISA.41.8	Jacob, whom I have chosen,
ISA.41.8	descendant of Abraham, my friend
ISA.41.9	I brought
ISA.41.9	and called you from its farthest corners.
ISA.41.9	I said to you: You are my servant;
ISA.41.9	I have chosen you; I haven’t rejected you.
ISA.41.10	Do not fear, for I am with you;
ISA.41.10	do not be afraid, for I am your God.
ISA.41.10	I will strengthen you; I will help you;
ISA.41.10	I will hold on to you with my righteous right hand.
ISA.41.11	Be sure that all who are enraged against you
ISA.41.11	will be ashamed and disgraced;
ISA.41.11	those who contend with you
ISA.41.11	will become as nothing and will perish.
ISA.41.12	You will look for those who contend with you,
ISA.41.12	but you will not find them.
ISA.41.12	Those who war against you
ISA.41.12	will become absolutely nothing.
ISA.41.13	For I am the 
ISA.41.13	who holds your right hand,
ISA.41.13	who says to you, ‘Do not fear,
ISA.41.13	I will help you.
ISA.41.14	Do not fear, you worm Jacob,
ISA.41.14	you men
ISA.41.14	I will help you’ —
ISA.41.14	this is the 
ISA.41.14	Your Redeemer
ISA.41.15	See, I will make you into a sharp threshing board,
ISA.41.15	new, with many teeth.
ISA.41.15	You will thresh mountains and pulverize them
ISA.41.15	and make hills into chaff.
ISA.41.16	You will winnow them
ISA.41.16	and a wind will carry them away,
ISA.41.16	a whirlwind will scatter them.
ISA.41.16	But you will rejoice in the 
ISA.41.16	you will boast in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.41.17	The poor and the needy seek water, but there is none;
ISA.41.17	their tongues are parched with thirst.
ISA.41.17	I will answer them.
ISA.41.17	I am the 
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers on the barren heights,
ISA.41.18	and springs in the middle of the plains.
ISA.41.18	I will turn the desert into a pool
ISA.41.18	and dry land into springs.
ISA.41.19	I will plant cedars,
ISA.41.19	acacias, myrtles, and olive trees in the wilderness.
ISA.41.19	I will put juniper trees,
ISA.41.19	elms, and cypress trees together in the desert,
ISA.41.20	so that all may see and know,
ISA.41.20	consider and understand,
ISA.41.20	that the hand of the 
ISA.41.20	the Holy One of Israel has created
ISA.41.21	“Submit your case,” says the 
ISA.41.21	“Present your arguments,” says Jacob’s King.
ISA.41.22	“Let them come and tell us
ISA.41.22	what will happen.
ISA.41.22	Tell us the past events,
ISA.41.22	so that we may reflect on them
ISA.41.22	and know the outcome,
ISA.41.22	or tell us the future.
ISA.41.23	Tell us the coming events,
ISA.41.23	then we will know that you are gods.
ISA.41.23	Indeed, do something good or bad,
ISA.41.23	then we will be in awe
ISA.41.24	Look, you are nothing
ISA.41.24	and your work is worthless.
ISA.41.24	Anyone who chooses you is detestable.
ISA.41.25	“I have stirred up one from the north,
ISA.41.25	one from the east
ISA.41.25	He will march over rulers as if they were mud,
ISA.41.25	like a potter who treads the clay.
ISA.41.26	Who told about this from the beginning,
ISA.41.26	so that we might know,
ISA.41.26	and from times past,
ISA.41.26	so that we might say, ‘He is right’?
ISA.41.26	No one announced it,
ISA.41.26	no one told it,
ISA.41.26	no one heard your words.
ISA.41.27	I was the first to say to Zion,
ISA.41.27	‘Look! Here they are!’
ISA.41.27	And I gave Jerusalem a herald with good news.
ISA.41.28	When I look, there is no one;
ISA.41.28	there is no counselor among them;
ISA.41.28	when I ask them, they have nothing to say.
ISA.41.29	Look, all of them are a delusion;
ISA.41.29	their works are nonexistent;
ISA.41.29	their images are wind and emptiness.
ISA.42.1	“This
ISA.42.1	this is my chosen one;
ISA.42.1	I have put my Spirit on him;
ISA.42.1	he will bring justice
ISA.42.2	He will not cry out or shout
ISA.42.2	or make his voice heard in the streets.
ISA.42.3	He will not break a bruised reed,
ISA.42.3	and he will not put out a smoldering wick;
ISA.42.3	he will faithfully bring justice.
ISA.42.4	He will not grow weak or be discouraged
ISA.42.4	until he has established justice on earth.
ISA.42.4	The coasts and islands will wait for his instruction.”
ISA.42.5	This is what God, the 
ISA.42.5	who created the heavens and stretched them out,
ISA.42.5	who spread out the earth and what comes from it,
ISA.42.5	who gives breath to the people on it
ISA.42.5	and spirit to those who walk on it
ISA.42.6	“I am the 
ISA.42.6	for a righteous purpose,
ISA.42.6	and I will hold you by your hand.
ISA.42.6	I will watch over you, and I will appoint you
ISA.42.6	to be a covenant for the people
ISA.42.6	and a light to the nations,
ISA.42.7	in order to open blind eyes,
ISA.42.7	to bring out prisoners from the dungeon,
ISA.42.7	and those sitting in darkness from the prison house.
ISA.42.8	I am the 
ISA.42.8	and I will not give my glory to another
ISA.42.8	or my praise to idols.
ISA.42.9	The past events have indeed happened.
ISA.42.9	Now I declare new events;
ISA.42.9	I announce them to you before they occur.”
ISA.42.10	Sing a new song to the 
ISA.42.10	sing his praise from the ends of the earth,
ISA.42.10	you who go down to the sea with all that fills it,
ISA.42.10	you coasts and islands with your
ISA.42.11	Let the desert and its cities shout,
ISA.42.11	the settlements where Kedar dwells cry aloud.
ISA.42.11	Let the inhabitants of Sela sing for joy;
ISA.42.11	let them cry out from the mountaintops.
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory to the 
ISA.42.12	and declare his praise in the coasts and islands.
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.13	he stirs up his zeal like a soldier.
ISA.42.13	He shouts, he roars aloud,
ISA.42.13	he prevails over his enemies.
ISA.42.14	“I have kept silent from ages past;
ISA.42.14	I have been quiet and restrained myself.
ISA.42.14	But now, I will groan like a woman in labor,
ISA.42.14	gasping breathlessly.
ISA.42.15	I will lay waste mountains and hills
ISA.42.15	and dry up all their vegetation.
ISA.42.15	I will turn rivers into islands
ISA.42.15	and dry up marshes.
ISA.42.16	I will lead the blind by a way they did not know;
ISA.42.16	I will guide them on paths they have not known.
ISA.42.16	I will turn darkness to light in front of them
ISA.42.16	and rough places into level ground.
ISA.42.16	This is what I will do for them,
ISA.42.16	and I will not abandon them.
ISA.42.17	They will be turned back and utterly ashamed —
ISA.42.17	those who trust in an idol
ISA.42.17	and say to a cast image,
ISA.42.17	‘You are our gods! ’ 
ISA.42.18	“Listen, you deaf!
ISA.42.18	Look, you blind, so that you may see.
ISA.42.19	Who is blind but my servant,
ISA.42.19	or deaf like my messenger I am sending?
ISA.42.19	Who is blind like my dedicated one,
ISA.42.19	or blind like the servant of the 
ISA.42.20	Though seeing many things,
ISA.42.20	Though his ears are open, he does not listen.”
ISA.42.21	Because of his righteousness, the 
ISA.42.21	to magnify his instruction and make it glorious.
ISA.42.22	But this is a people plundered and looted,
ISA.42.22	all of them trapped in holes
ISA.42.22	or imprisoned in dungeons.
ISA.42.22	They have become plunder
ISA.42.22	with no one to rescue them
ISA.42.22	and loot, with no one saying, “Give it back!”
ISA.42.23	Who among you will hear this?
ISA.42.23	Let him listen and obey in the future.
ISA.42.24	Who gave Jacob to the robber,
ISA.42.24	and Israel to the plunderers?
ISA.42.24	Was it not the 
ISA.42.24	Have we not sinned against him?
ISA.42.24	They were not willing to walk in his ways,
ISA.42.24	and they would not listen to his instruction.
ISA.42.25	So he poured out his furious anger
ISA.42.25	and the power of war on Jacob.
ISA.42.25	It surrounded him with fire, but he did not know it;
ISA.42.25	it burned him, but he didn’t take it to heart.
ISA.43.1	Now this is what the 
ISA.43.1	the one who created you, Jacob,
ISA.43.1	and the one who formed you, Israel
ISA.43.1	“Do not fear, for I have redeemed you;
ISA.43.1	I have called you by your name; you are mine.
ISA.43.2	I will be with you
ISA.43.2	when you pass through the waters,
ISA.43.2	and when you pass through the rivers,
ISA.43.2	they will not overwhelm you.
ISA.43.2	You will not be scorched
ISA.43.2	when you walk through the fire,
ISA.43.2	and the flame will not burn you.
ISA.43.3	For I am the 
ISA.43.3	the Holy One of Israel, and your Savior.
ISA.43.3	I have given Egypt as a ransom for you,
ISA.43.3	Cush and Seba in your place.
ISA.43.4	Because you are precious in my sight
ISA.43.4	and honored, and I love you,
ISA.43.4	I will give people in exchange for you
ISA.43.4	and nations instead of your life.
ISA.43.5	Do not fear, for I am with you;
ISA.43.5	I will bring your descendants from the east,
ISA.43.5	and gather you from the west.
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’
ISA.43.6	and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back!’
ISA.43.6	Bring my sons from far away,
ISA.43.6	and my daughters from the ends of the earth
ISA.43.7	everyone who bears my name
ISA.43.7	and is created for my glory.
ISA.43.7	I have formed them; indeed, I have made them.”
ISA.43.8	Bring out a people who are blind, yet have eyes,
ISA.43.8	and are deaf, yet have ears.
ISA.43.9	All the nations are gathered together,
ISA.43.9	and the peoples are assembled.
ISA.43.9	Who among them can declare this,
ISA.43.9	and tell us the former things?
ISA.43.9	Let them present their witnesses
ISA.43.9	to vindicate themselves,
ISA.43.9	so that people may hear and say, “It is true.”
ISA.43.10	“You are my witnesses”
ISA.43.10	this is the 
ISA.43.10	“and my servant whom I have chosen,
ISA.43.10	so that you may know and believe me
ISA.43.10	and understand that I am he.
ISA.43.10	No god was formed before me,
ISA.43.10	and there will be none after me.
ISA.43.11	I — I am the 
ISA.43.11	Besides me, there is no Savior.
ISA.43.12	I alone declared, saved, and proclaimed —
ISA.43.12	and not some foreign god
ISA.43.12	So you are my witnesses” —
ISA.43.12	this is the 
ISA.43.12	“and
ISA.43.13	Also, from today on I am he alone,
ISA.43.13	and none can rescue from my power.
ISA.43.13	I act, and who can reverse it?” 
ISA.43.14	This is what the 
ISA.43.14	Because of you, I will send an army
ISA.43.14	and bring all of them as fugitives,
ISA.43.14	even the Chaldeans
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.15	the Creator of Israel, your King.
ISA.43.16	This is what the 
ISA.43.16	who makes a way in the sea,
ISA.43.16	and a path through raging water,
ISA.43.17	who brings out the chariot and horse,
ISA.43.17	the army and the mighty one together
ISA.43.17	(they lie down, they do not rise again;
ISA.43.17	they are extinguished, put out like a wick
ISA.43.18	“Do not remember the past events,
ISA.43.18	pay no attention to things of old.
ISA.43.19	Look, I am about to do something new;
ISA.43.19	even now it is coming. Do you not see it?
ISA.43.19	Indeed, I will make a way in the wilderness,
ISA.43.19	rivers
ISA.43.20	Wild animals —
ISA.43.20	jackals and ostriches — will honor me,
ISA.43.20	because I provide water in the wilderness,
ISA.43.20	and rivers in the desert,
ISA.43.20	to give drink to my chosen people.
ISA.43.21	The people I formed for myself
ISA.43.21	will declare my praise.
ISA.43.22	“But, Jacob, you have not called on me,
ISA.43.22	because, Israel, you have become weary of me.
ISA.43.23	You have not brought me your sheep for burnt offerings
ISA.43.23	or honored me with your sacrifices.
ISA.43.23	I have not burdened you with offerings
ISA.43.23	or wearied you with incense.
ISA.43.24	You have not bought me aromatic cane with silver,
ISA.43.24	or satisfied me with the fat of your sacrifices.
ISA.43.24	But you have burdened me with your sins;
ISA.43.24	you have wearied me
ISA.43.25	“I — I sweep away your transgressions
ISA.43.25	for my own sake
ISA.43.25	and remember your sins no more.
ISA.43.26	Remind me. Let’s argue the case together.
ISA.43.26	Recount the facts, so that you may be vindicated.
ISA.43.27	Your first father sinned,
ISA.43.27	and your mediators have rebelled against me.
ISA.43.28	So I defiled the officers of the sanctuary,
ISA.43.28	and set Jacob apart for destruction
ISA.43.28	and Israel for scorn.
ISA.44.1	“And now listen, Jacob my servant,
ISA.44.1	Israel whom I have chosen.
ISA.44.2	This is the word of the 
ISA.44.2	your Maker, the one who formed you from the womb:
ISA.44.2	He will help you.
ISA.44.2	Do not fear, Jacob my servant,
ISA.44.2	Jeshurun
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water on the thirsty land
ISA.44.3	and streams on the dry ground;
ISA.44.3	I will pour out my Spirit
ISA.44.3	and my blessing on your offspring.
ISA.44.4	They will sprout among
ISA.44.4	like poplars by flowing streams.
ISA.44.5	This one will say, ‘I am the 
ISA.44.5	another will use the name of Jacob;
ISA.44.5	still another will write on his hand, ‘The 
ISA.44.5	and take on the name of Israel.”
ISA.44.6	This is what the 
ISA.44.6	I am the first and I am the last.
ISA.44.6	There is no God but me.
ISA.44.7	Who, like me, can announce the future?
ISA.44.7	Let him say so and make a case before me,
ISA.44.7	since I have established an ancient people.
ISA.44.7	Let these gods declare
ISA.44.7	and what will take place.
ISA.44.8	Do not be startled or afraid.
ISA.44.8	Have I not told you and declared it long ago?
ISA.44.8	You are my witnesses!
ISA.44.8	Is there any God but me?
ISA.44.8	There is no other Rock;
ISA.44.9	All who make idols are nothing,
ISA.44.9	and what they treasure benefits no one.
ISA.44.9	Their witnesses do not see or know anything,
ISA.44.9	so they will be put to shame.
ISA.44.10	Who makes a god or casts a metal image
ISA.44.10	that benefits no one?
ISA.44.11	Look, all its worshipers will be put to shame,
ISA.44.11	and the craftsmen are humans.
ISA.44.11	They all will assemble and stand;
ISA.44.11	they all will be startled and put to shame.
ISA.44.12	The ironworker labors over the coals,
ISA.44.12	shapes the idol with hammers,
ISA.44.12	and works it with his strong arm.
ISA.44.12	Also he grows hungry and his strength fails;
ISA.44.12	he doesn’t drink water and is faint.
ISA.44.13	The woodworker stretches out a measuring line,
ISA.44.13	he outlines it with a stylus;
ISA.44.13	he shapes it with chisels
ISA.44.13	and outlines it with a compass.
ISA.44.13	He makes it according to a human form,
ISA.44.13	like a beautiful person,
ISA.44.13	to dwell in a temple.
ISA.44.14	He cuts down
ISA.44.14	or he takes a cypress or an oak.
ISA.44.14	He lets it grow strong among the trees of the forest.
ISA.44.14	He plants a laurel, and the rain makes it grow.
ISA.44.15	A person can use it for fuel.
ISA.44.15	He takes some of it and warms himself;
ISA.44.15	also he kindles a fire and bakes bread;
ISA.44.15	he even makes it into a god and worships it;
ISA.44.15	he makes an idol from it and bows down to it.
ISA.44.16	He burns half of it in a fire,
ISA.44.16	and he roasts meat on that half.
ISA.44.16	He eats the roast and is satisfied.
ISA.44.16	He warms himself and says, “Ah!
ISA.44.16	I am warm, I see the blaze.”
ISA.44.17	He makes a god or his idol with the rest of it.
ISA.44.17	He bows down to it and worships;
ISA.44.17	he prays to it,
ISA.44.18	Such people
ISA.44.18	and cannot understand,
ISA.44.18	for he has shut their eyes
ISA.44.18	and their minds so they cannot understand.
ISA.44.19	No one comes to his senses;
ISA.44.19	no one has the perception or insight to say,
ISA.44.19	“I burned half of it in the fire,
ISA.44.19	I also baked bread on its coals,
ISA.44.19	I roasted meat and ate.
ISA.44.19	Should I make something detestable
ISA.44.19	Should I bow down to a block of wood?”
ISA.44.20	He feeds on
ISA.44.20	His deceived mind has led him astray,
ISA.44.20	and he cannot rescue himself,
ISA.44.20	or say, “Isn’t there a lie in my right hand?” 
ISA.44.21	Remember these things, Jacob,
ISA.44.21	and Israel, for you are my servant;
ISA.44.21	I formed you, you are my servant;
ISA.44.21	Israel, you will never be forgotten by me.
ISA.44.22	I have swept away your transgressions like a cloud,
ISA.44.22	and your sins like a mist.
ISA.44.22	Return to me,
ISA.44.22	for I have redeemed you.
ISA.44.23	Rejoice, heavens,
ISA.44.23	shout, depths of the earth.
ISA.44.23	Break out into singing, mountains,
ISA.44.23	forest, and every tree in it.
ISA.44.23	For the 
ISA.44.23	and glorifies himself through Israel.
ISA.44.24	This is what the 
ISA.44.24	I am the 
ISA.44.24	who stretched out the heavens by myself;
ISA.44.24	who alone spread out the earth;
ISA.44.25	who destroys the omens of the false prophets
ISA.44.25	and makes fools of diviners;
ISA.44.25	who confounds the wise
ISA.44.25	and makes their knowledge foolishness;
ISA.44.26	who confirms the message of his servant
ISA.44.26	and fulfills the counsel of his messengers;
ISA.44.26	who says to Jerusalem, “She will be inhabited,”
ISA.44.26	and to the cities of Judah, “They will be rebuilt,”
ISA.44.26	and I will restore her ruins;
ISA.44.27	who says to the depths of the sea, “Be dry,”
ISA.44.27	and I will dry up your rivers;
ISA.44.28	who says to Cyrus,
ISA.44.28	he will fulfill all my pleasure”
ISA.44.28	and says to Jerusalem, “She will be rebuilt,”
ISA.44.28	and of the temple, “Its foundation will be laid.”
ISA.45.1	The 
ISA.45.1	whose right hand I have grasped
ISA.45.1	to subdue nations before him
ISA.45.1	and disarm
ISA.45.1	to open doors before him,
ISA.45.1	and even city gates will not be shut:
ISA.45.2	“I will go before you
ISA.45.2	and level the uneven places;
ISA.45.2	I will shatter the bronze doors
ISA.45.2	and cut the iron bars in two.
ISA.45.3	I will give you the treasures of darkness
ISA.45.3	and riches from secret places,
ISA.45.3	so that you may know that I am the 
ISA.45.3	I am the God of Israel, who calls you by your name.
ISA.45.4	I call you by your name,
ISA.45.4	for the sake of my servant Jacob
ISA.45.4	and Israel my chosen one.
ISA.45.4	I give a name to you,
ISA.45.4	though you do not know me.
ISA.45.5	I am the 
ISA.45.5	there is no God but me.
ISA.45.5	I will strengthen
ISA.45.5	though you do not know me,
ISA.45.6	so that all may know from the rising of the sun to its setting
ISA.45.6	that there is no one but me.
ISA.45.6	I am the 
ISA.45.7	I form light and create darkness,
ISA.45.7	I make success and create disaster;
ISA.45.7	I am the 
ISA.45.8	“Heavens, sprinkle from above,
ISA.45.8	and let the skies shower righteousness.
ISA.45.8	Let the earth open up
ISA.45.8	so that salvation will sprout
ISA.45.8	and righteousness will spring up with it.
ISA.45.8	I, the 
ISA.45.9	“Woe to the one who argues with his Maker —
ISA.45.9	one clay pot among many.
ISA.45.9	Does clay say to the one forming it,
ISA.45.9	‘What are you making? ’ 
ISA.45.9	Or does your work say,
ISA.45.9	‘He has no hands’?
ISA.45.10	Woe to the one who says to his father,
ISA.45.10	‘What are you fathering?’
ISA.45.10	or to his mother,
ISA.45.10	‘What are you giving birth to? ’”
ISA.45.11	This is what the 
ISA.45.11	the Holy One of Israel
ISA.45.11	“Ask me what is to happen to
ISA.45.11	and instruct me about the work of my hands.
ISA.45.12	I made the earth,
ISA.45.12	and created humans on it.
ISA.45.12	It was my hands that stretched out the heavens,
ISA.45.12	and I commanded everything in them.
ISA.45.13	I have stirred him up in righteousness,
ISA.45.13	and will level all roads for him.
ISA.45.13	He will rebuild my city,
ISA.45.13	and set my exiles free,
ISA.45.13	not for a price or a bribe,”
ISA.45.13	says the 
ISA.45.14	This is what the 
ISA.45.14	“The products of Egypt and the merchandise of Cush
ISA.45.14	and the Sabeans, men of stature,
ISA.45.14	will come over to you
ISA.45.14	and will be yours;
ISA.45.14	they will follow you,
ISA.45.14	they will come over in chains
ISA.45.14	and bow down to you.
ISA.45.14	They will confess
ISA.45.14	‘God is indeed with you,
ISA.45.14	there is no other God.’”
ISA.45.15	Yes, you are a God who hides,
ISA.45.15	God of Israel, Savior.
ISA.45.16	All of them are put to shame, even humiliated;
ISA.45.16	the makers of idols go in humiliation together.
ISA.45.17	Israel will be saved by the 
ISA.45.17	with an everlasting salvation;
ISA.45.17	you will not be put to shame or humiliated
ISA.45.17	for all eternity.
ISA.45.18	For this is what the 
ISA.45.18	the Creator of the heavens,
ISA.45.18	the God who formed the earth and made it,
ISA.45.18	the one who established it
ISA.45.18	(he did not create it to be a wasteland,
ISA.45.18	but formed it to be inhabited)
ISA.45.18	he says, “I am the 
ISA.45.18	and there is no other.
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret,
ISA.45.19	somewhere in a land of darkness.
ISA.45.19	I did not say to the descendants of Jacob:
ISA.45.19	Seek me in a wasteland.
ISA.45.19	I am the 
ISA.45.19	who declares what is right.
ISA.45.20	“Come, gather together,
ISA.45.20	and approach, you fugitives of the nations.
ISA.45.20	Those who carry their wooden idols
ISA.45.20	and pray to a god who cannot save
ISA.45.20	have no knowledge.
ISA.45.21	Speak up and present your case
ISA.45.21	yes, let them consult each other.
ISA.45.21	Who predicted this long ago?
ISA.45.21	Who announced it from ancient times?
ISA.45.21	Was it not I, the 
ISA.45.21	There is no other God but me,
ISA.45.21	a righteous God and Savior;
ISA.45.21	there is no one except me.
ISA.45.22	Turn to me and be saved,
ISA.45.22	all the ends of the earth.
ISA.45.22	For I am God,
ISA.45.22	and there is no other.
ISA.45.23	By myself I have sworn;
ISA.45.23	truth has gone from my mouth,
ISA.45.23	a word that will not be revoked:
ISA.45.23	Every knee will bow
ISA.45.23	every tongue will swear allegiance.
ISA.45.24	It will be said about me, ‘Righteousness and strength
ISA.45.24	are found only in the 
ISA.45.24	All who are enraged against him
ISA.45.24	will come to him and be put to shame.
ISA.45.25	All the descendants of Israel
ISA.45.25	will be justified and find glory through the 
ISA.46.1	Bel crouches; Nebo cowers.
ISA.46.1	Idols depicting them are consigned to beasts and cattle.
ISA.46.1	The images you carry are loaded,
ISA.46.1	as a burden for the weary animal.
ISA.46.2	The gods cower; they crouch together;
ISA.46.2	they are not able to rescue the burden,
ISA.46.2	but they themselves go into captivity.
ISA.46.3	“Listen to me, house of Jacob,
ISA.46.3	all the remnant of the house of Israel,
ISA.46.3	who have been sustained from the womb,
ISA.46.3	carried along since birth.
ISA.46.4	I will be the same until your old age,
ISA.46.4	and I will bear you up when you turn gray.
ISA.46.4	I have made you, and I will carry you;
ISA.46.4	I will bear and rescue you.
ISA.46.5	“Who will you compare me or make me equal to?
ISA.46.5	Who will you measure me with,
ISA.46.5	so that we should be like each other?
ISA.46.6	Those who pour out their bags of gold
ISA.46.6	and weigh out silver on scales —
ISA.46.6	they hire a goldsmith and he makes it into a god.
ISA.46.6	Then they kneel and bow down to it.
ISA.46.7	They lift it to their shoulder and bear it along;
ISA.46.7	they set it in its place, and there it stands;
ISA.46.7	it does not budge from its place.
ISA.46.7	They cry out to it but it doesn’t answer;
ISA.46.7	it saves no one from his trouble.
ISA.46.8	“Remember this and be brave;
ISA.46.8	take it to heart, you transgressors!
ISA.46.9	Remember what happened long ago,
ISA.46.9	for I am God, and there is no other;
ISA.46.9	I am God, and no one is like me.
ISA.46.10	I declare the end from the beginning,
ISA.46.10	and from long ago what is not yet done,
ISA.46.10	saying: my plan will take place,
ISA.46.10	and I will do all my will.
ISA.46.11	I call a bird of prey
ISA.46.11	a man for my purpose from a far country.
ISA.46.11	Yes, I have spoken; so I will also bring it about.
ISA.46.11	I have planned it; I will also do it.
ISA.46.12	Listen to me, you hardhearted,
ISA.46.12	far removed from justice:
ISA.46.13	I am bringing my justice near;
ISA.46.13	it is not far away,
ISA.46.13	and my salvation will not delay.
ISA.46.13	I will put salvation in Zion,
ISA.46.13	my splendor in Israel.
ISA.47.1	“Go down and sit in the dust,
ISA.47.1	Virgin Daughter Babylon.
ISA.47.1	Sit on the ground without a throne,
ISA.47.1	Daughter Chaldea!
ISA.47.1	For you will no longer be called pampered and spoiled.
ISA.47.2	Take millstones and grind flour;
ISA.47.2	remove your veil,
ISA.47.2	strip off your skirt, bare your thigh,
ISA.47.2	wade through the streams.
ISA.47.3	Your nakedness will be uncovered,
ISA.47.3	and your disgrace will be exposed.
ISA.47.3	I will take vengeance;
ISA.47.3	I will spare no one.”
ISA.47.4	The Holy One of Israel is our Redeemer;
ISA.47.4	The 
ISA.47.5	“Daughter Chaldea,
ISA.47.5	sit in silence
ISA.47.5	For you will no longer be called mistress of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	I was angry with my people;
ISA.47.6	I profaned my possession,
ISA.47.6	and I handed them over to you.
ISA.47.6	You showed them no mercy;
ISA.47.6	you made your yoke very heavy on the elderly.
ISA.47.7	You said, ‘I will be the queen forever.’
ISA.47.7	You did not take these things to heart
ISA.47.7	or think about their outcome.
ISA.47.8	“So now hear this, lover of luxury,
ISA.47.8	who sits securely,
ISA.47.8	who says to herself,
ISA.47.8	‘I am, and there is no one else.
ISA.47.8	I will never be a widow
ISA.47.8	or know the loss of children.’
ISA.47.9	These two things will happen to you
ISA.47.9	suddenly, in one day:
ISA.47.9	loss of children and widowhood.
ISA.47.9	They will happen to you in their entirety,
ISA.47.9	in spite of your many sorceries
ISA.47.9	and the potency of your spells.
ISA.47.10	You were secure in your wickedness;
ISA.47.10	you said, ‘No one sees me.’
ISA.47.10	Your wisdom and knowledge
ISA.47.10	led you astray.
ISA.47.10	You said to yourself,
ISA.47.10	‘I am, and there is no one else.’
ISA.47.11	But disaster will happen to you;
ISA.47.11	you will not know how to avert it.
ISA.47.11	And it will fall on you,
ISA.47.11	but you will be unable to ward it off.
ISA.47.11	Devastation will happen to you suddenly
ISA.47.11	and unexpectedly.
ISA.47.12	So take your stand with your spells
ISA.47.12	and your many sorceries,
ISA.47.12	which you have wearied yourself with from your youth.
ISA.47.12	Perhaps you will be able to succeed;
ISA.47.12	perhaps you will inspire terror!
ISA.47.13	You are worn out with your many consultations.
ISA.47.13	So let the astrologers stand and save you —
ISA.47.13	those who observe the stars,
ISA.47.13	those who predict monthly
ISA.47.13	what will happen to you.
ISA.47.14	Look, they are like stubble;
ISA.47.14	fire burns them.
ISA.47.14	They cannot rescue themselves
ISA.47.14	from the power
ISA.47.14	This is not a coal for warming themselves,
ISA.47.14	or a fire to sit beside!
ISA.47.15	This is what they are to you —
ISA.47.15	those who have wearied you
ISA.47.15	and have traded with you from your youth —
ISA.47.15	each wanders on his own way;
ISA.47.15	no one can save you.
ISA.48.1	“Listen to this, house of Jacob —
ISA.48.1	those who are called by the name Israel
ISA.48.1	and have descended from
ISA.48.1	who swear by the name of the 
ISA.48.1	and declare the God of Israel,
ISA.48.1	but not in truth or righteousness.
ISA.48.2	For they are named after the Holy City,
ISA.48.2	and lean on the God of Israel;
ISA.48.2	his name is the 
ISA.48.3	I declared the past events long ago;
ISA.48.3	they came out of my mouth; I proclaimed them.
ISA.48.3	Suddenly I acted, and they occurred.
ISA.48.4	Because I know that you are stubborn,
ISA.48.4	and your neck is iron
ISA.48.4	and your forehead bronze,
ISA.48.5	therefore I declared to you long ago.
ISA.48.5	I announced it to you before it occurred,
ISA.48.5	so you could not claim, ‘My idol caused them;
ISA.48.5	my carved image and cast idol control them.’
ISA.48.6	You have heard it. Observe it all.
ISA.48.6	Will you not acknowledge it?
ISA.48.6	From now on I will announce new things to you,
ISA.48.6	hidden things that you have not known.
ISA.48.7	They have been created now, and not long ago;
ISA.48.7	you have not heard of them before today,
ISA.48.7	so you could not claim, ‘I already knew them!’
ISA.48.8	You have never heard; you have never known;
ISA.48.8	for a long time your ears have not been open.
ISA.48.8	For I knew that you were very treacherous,
ISA.48.8	and were known as a rebel from birth.
ISA.48.9	I will delay my anger for the sake of my name,
ISA.48.9	and I will restrain myself for your benefit and for my praise,
ISA.48.9	so that you will not be destroyed.
ISA.48.10	Look, I have refined you,
ISA.48.10	I have tested
ISA.48.11	I will act for my own sake, indeed, my own,
ISA.48.11	for how can I
ISA.48.11	I will not give my glory to another.
ISA.48.12	“Listen to me, Jacob,
ISA.48.12	and Israel, the one called by me:
ISA.48.12	I am he; I am the first,
ISA.48.12	I am also the last.
ISA.48.13	My own hand founded the earth,
ISA.48.13	and my right hand spread out the heavens;
ISA.48.13	when I summoned them,
ISA.48.13	they stood up together.
ISA.48.14	All of you, assemble and listen!
ISA.48.14	Who among the idols
ISA.48.14	The 
ISA.48.14	he will accomplish his will against Babylon,
ISA.48.14	and his arm will be against the Chaldeans.
ISA.48.15	I — I have spoken;
ISA.48.15	yes, I have called him;
ISA.48.15	I have brought him,
ISA.48.15	and he will succeed in his mission.
ISA.48.16	Approach me and listen to this.
ISA.48.16	From the beginning I have not spoken in secret;
ISA.48.16	from the time anything existed, I was there.”
ISA.48.16	And now the Lord 
ISA.48.16	has sent me and his Spirit.
ISA.48.17	This is what the 
ISA.48.17	I am the 
ISA.48.17	who teaches you for your benefit,
ISA.48.17	who leads you in the way you should go.
ISA.48.18	If only you had paid attention to my commands.
ISA.48.18	Then your peace would have been like a river,
ISA.48.18	and your righteousness like the waves of the sea.
ISA.48.19	Your descendants would have been as countless as the sand,
ISA.48.19	and the offspring of your body like its grains;
ISA.48.19	their name would not be cut off
ISA.48.19	or eliminated from my presence.
ISA.48.20	Leave Babylon,
ISA.48.20	flee from the Chaldeans!
ISA.48.20	Declare with a shout of joy,
ISA.48.20	proclaim this,
ISA.48.20	let it go out to the end of the earth;
ISA.48.20	announce,
ISA.48.20	“The 
ISA.48.21	They did not thirst
ISA.48.21	when he led them through the deserts;
ISA.48.21	he made water flow from the rock for them;
ISA.48.21	he split the rock, and water gushed out.
ISA.48.22	“There is no peace for the wicked,” says the 
ISA.49.1	Coasts and islands,
ISA.49.1	distant peoples, pay attention.
ISA.49.1	The 
ISA.49.1	He named me while I was in my mother’s womb.
ISA.49.2	He made my words like a sharp sword;
ISA.49.2	he hid me in the shadow of his hand.
ISA.49.2	He made me like a sharpened arrow;
ISA.49.2	he hid me in his quiver.
ISA.49.3	He said to me, “You are my servant,
ISA.49.3	Israel, in whom I will be glorified.”
ISA.49.4	But I myself said: I have labored in vain,
ISA.49.4	I have spent my strength for nothing and futility;
ISA.49.4	yet my vindication is with the 
ISA.49.4	and my reward is with my God.
ISA.49.5	And now, says the 
ISA.49.5	who formed me from the womb to be his servant,
ISA.49.5	to bring Jacob back to him
ISA.49.5	so that Israel might be gathered to him;
ISA.49.5	for I am honored in the sight of the 
ISA.49.5	and my God is my strength —
ISA.49.6	he says,
ISA.49.6	“It is not enough for you to be my servant
ISA.49.6	raising up the tribes of Jacob
ISA.49.6	and restoring the protected ones of Israel.
ISA.49.6	I will also make you a light for the nations,
ISA.49.6	to be my salvation to the ends of the earth.”
ISA.49.7	This is what the 
ISA.49.7	the Redeemer
ISA.49.7	to one who is despised,
ISA.49.7	to one abhorred by people,
ISA.49.7	to a servant of rulers:
ISA.49.7	“Kings will see, princes will stand up,
ISA.49.7	and they
ISA.49.7	because of the 
ISA.49.7	the Holy One of Israel
ISA.49.8	This is what the 
ISA.49.8	I will answer you in a time of favor,
ISA.49.8	and I will help you in the day of salvation.
ISA.49.8	I will keep you, and I will appoint you
ISA.49.8	to be a covenant for the people,
ISA.49.8	to restore the land,
ISA.49.8	to make them possess the desolate inheritances,
ISA.49.9	saying to the prisoners: Come out,
ISA.49.9	and to those who are in darkness: Show yourselves.
ISA.49.9	They will feed along the pathways,
ISA.49.9	and their pastures will be on all the barren heights.
ISA.49.10	They will not hunger or thirst,
ISA.49.10	the scorching heat or sun will not strike them;
ISA.49.10	for their compassionate one will guide them,
ISA.49.10	and lead them to springs.
ISA.49.11	I will make all my mountains into a road,
ISA.49.11	and my highways will be raised up.
ISA.49.12	See, these will come from far away,
ISA.49.12	from the north and from the west,
ISA.49.12	and from the land of Sinim.
ISA.49.13	Shout for joy, you heavens!
ISA.49.13	Earth, rejoice!
ISA.49.13	Mountains break into joyful shouts!
ISA.49.13	For the 
ISA.49.13	and will have compassion on his afflicted ones.
ISA.49.14	Zion says, “The 
ISA.49.14	the Lord has forgotten me!”
ISA.49.15	“Can a woman forget her nursing child,
ISA.49.15	or lack compassion for the child of her womb?
ISA.49.15	Even if these forget,
ISA.49.15	yet I will not forget you.
ISA.49.16	Look, I have inscribed you on the palms of my hands;
ISA.49.16	your walls are continually before me.
ISA.49.17	Your builders
ISA.49.17	those who destroy and devastate you will leave you.
ISA.49.18	Look up, and look around.
ISA.49.18	They all gather together; they come to you.
ISA.49.18	As I live” —
ISA.49.18	this is the 
ISA.49.18	“you will wear all your children
ISA.49.18	and put them on as a bride does.
ISA.49.19	For your waste and desolate places
ISA.49.19	and your land marked by ruins —
ISA.49.19	will now be indeed too small for the inhabitants,
ISA.49.19	and those who swallowed you up will be far away.
ISA.49.20	Yet as you listen, the children
ISA.49.20	that you have been deprived of will say,
ISA.49.20	‘This place is too small for me;
ISA.49.20	make room for me so that I may settle.’
ISA.49.21	Then you will say within yourself,
ISA.49.21	‘Who fathered these for me?
ISA.49.21	I was deprived of my children and unable to conceive,
ISA.49.21	exiled and wandering —
ISA.49.21	but who brought them up?
ISA.49.21	See, I was left by myself —
ISA.49.21	but these, where did they come from?’” 
ISA.49.22	This is what the Lord 
ISA.49.22	Look, I will lift up my hand to the nations,
ISA.49.22	and raise my banner to the peoples.
ISA.49.22	They will bring your sons in their arms,
ISA.49.22	and your daughters will be carried on their shoulders.
ISA.49.23	Kings will be your guardians
ISA.49.23	and their queens
ISA.49.23	They will bow down to you
ISA.49.23	with their faces to the ground
ISA.49.23	and lick the dust at your feet.
ISA.49.23	Then you will know that I am the 
ISA.49.23	those who put their hope in me
ISA.49.23	will not be put to shame.
ISA.49.24	Can the prey be taken from a mighty man,
ISA.49.24	or the captives of a tyrant
ISA.49.25	For this is what the 
ISA.49.25	“Even the captives of a mighty man will be taken,
ISA.49.25	and the prey of a tyrant will be delivered;
ISA.49.25	I will contend with the one who contends with you,
ISA.49.25	and I will save your children.
ISA.49.26	I will make your oppressors eat their own flesh,
ISA.49.26	and they will be drunk with their own blood
ISA.49.26	as with sweet wine.
ISA.49.26	Then all people will know
ISA.49.26	that I, the 
ISA.49.26	and your Redeemer,
ISA.50.1	This is what the 
ISA.50.1	Where is your mother’s divorce certificate
ISA.50.1	that I used to send her away?
ISA.50.1	Or to which of my creditors did I sell you?
ISA.50.1	Look, you were sold for your iniquities,
ISA.50.1	and your mother was sent away
ISA.50.1	because of your transgressions.
ISA.50.2	Why was no one there when I came?
ISA.50.2	Why was there no one to answer when I called?
ISA.50.2	Is my arm too weak to redeem?
ISA.50.2	Or do I have no power to rescue?
ISA.50.2	Look, I dry up the sea by my rebuke;
ISA.50.2	I turn the rivers into a wilderness;
ISA.50.2	their fish rot because of lack of water
ISA.50.2	and die of thirst.
ISA.50.3	I dress the heavens in black
ISA.50.3	and make sackcloth their clothing.
ISA.50.4	The Lord 
ISA.50.4	the tongue of those who are instructed
ISA.50.4	to know how to sustain the weary with a word.
ISA.50.4	He awakens me each morning;
ISA.50.4	he awakens my ear to listen like those being instructed.
ISA.50.5	The Lord 
ISA.50.5	and I was not rebellious;
ISA.50.5	I did not turn back.
ISA.50.6	I gave my back to those who beat me,
ISA.50.6	and my cheeks to those who tore out my beard.
ISA.50.6	I did not hide my face from scorn and spitting.
ISA.50.7	The Lord 
ISA.50.7	therefore I have not been humiliated;
ISA.50.7	therefore I have set my face like flint,
ISA.50.7	and I know I will not be put to shame.
ISA.50.8	The one who vindicates me is near;
ISA.50.8	who will contend with me?
ISA.50.8	Let us confront each other.
ISA.50.8	Who has a case against me?
ISA.50.8	Let him come near me!
ISA.50.9	In truth, the Lord 
ISA.50.9	who will condemn me?
ISA.50.9	Indeed, all of them will wear out like a garment;
ISA.50.9	a moth will devour them.
ISA.50.10	Who among you fears the 
ISA.50.10	and listens to his servant?
ISA.50.10	Who among you walks in darkness,
ISA.50.10	and has no light?
ISA.50.10	Let him trust in the name of the 
ISA.50.10	let him lean on his God.
ISA.50.11	Look, all you who kindle a fire,
ISA.50.11	who encircle yourselves with
ISA.50.11	walk in the light of your fire
ISA.50.11	and of the torches you have lit!
ISA.50.11	This is what you’ll get from my hand:
ISA.50.11	you will lie down in a place of torment.
ISA.51.1	Listen to me, you who pursue righteousness,
ISA.51.1	you who seek the 
ISA.51.1	Look to the rock from which you were cut,
ISA.51.1	and to the quarry from which you were dug.
ISA.51.2	Look to Abraham your father,
ISA.51.2	and to Sarah who gave birth to you.
ISA.51.2	When I called him, he was only one;
ISA.51.2	I blessed him and made him many.
ISA.51.3	For the 
ISA.51.3	he will comfort all her waste places,
ISA.51.3	and he will make her wilderness like Eden,
ISA.51.3	and her desert like the garden of the 
ISA.51.3	Joy and gladness will be found in her,
ISA.51.3	thanksgiving and melodious song.
ISA.51.4	Pay attention to me, my people,
ISA.51.4	and listen to me, my nation;
ISA.51.4	for instruction will come from me,
ISA.51.4	and my justice for a light to the nations.
ISA.51.4	I will bring it about quickly.
ISA.51.5	My righteousness is near,
ISA.51.5	my salvation appears,
ISA.51.5	and my arms will bring justice to the nations.
ISA.51.5	The coasts and islands will put their hope in me,
ISA.51.5	and they will look to my strength.
ISA.51.6	Look up to the heavens,
ISA.51.6	and look at the earth beneath;
ISA.51.6	for the heavens will vanish like smoke,
ISA.51.6	the earth will wear out like a garment,
ISA.51.6	and its inhabitants will die like gnats.
ISA.51.6	But my salvation will last forever,
ISA.51.6	and my righteousness will never be shattered.
ISA.51.7	Listen to me, you who know righteousness,
ISA.51.7	the people in whose heart is my instruction:
ISA.51.7	do not fear disgrace by men,
ISA.51.7	and do not be shattered by their taunts.
ISA.51.8	For moths will devour them like a garment,
ISA.51.8	and worms will eat them like wool.
ISA.51.8	But my righteousness will last forever,
ISA.51.8	and my salvation for all generations.
ISA.51.9	Wake up, wake up!
ISA.51.9	Arm of the 
ISA.51.9	Wake up as in days past,
ISA.51.9	as in generations long ago.
ISA.51.9	Wasn’t it you who hacked Rahab to pieces,
ISA.51.9	who pierced the sea monster?
ISA.51.10	Wasn’t it you who dried up the sea,
ISA.51.10	the waters of the great deep,
ISA.51.10	who made the sea-bed into a road
ISA.51.10	for the redeemed to pass over?
ISA.51.11	And the ransomed of the 
ISA.51.11	and come to Zion with singing,
ISA.51.11	crowned with unending joy.
ISA.51.11	Joy and gladness will overtake them,
ISA.51.11	and sorrow and sighing will flee.
ISA.51.12	I — I am the one who comforts you.
ISA.51.12	Who are you that you should fear humans who die,
ISA.51.12	or a son of man who is given up like grass?
ISA.51.13	But you have forgotten the 
ISA.51.13	who stretched out the heavens
ISA.51.13	and laid the foundations of the earth.
ISA.51.13	You are in constant dread all day long
ISA.51.13	because of the fury of the oppressor,
ISA.51.13	who has set himself to destroy.
ISA.51.13	But where is the fury of the oppressor?
ISA.51.14	The prisoner
ISA.51.14	he will not die and go to the Pit,
ISA.51.14	and his food will not be lacking.
ISA.51.15	For I am the 
ISA.51.15	who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar
ISA.51.15	his name is the 
ISA.51.16	I have put my words in your mouth,
ISA.51.16	and covered you in the shadow of my hand,
ISA.51.16	in order to plant
ISA.51.16	to found the earth,
ISA.51.16	and to say to Zion, “You are my people.”
ISA.51.17	Wake yourself, wake yourself up!
ISA.51.17	Stand up, Jerusalem,
ISA.51.17	you who have drunk the cup of his fury
ISA.51.17	from the 
ISA.51.17	you who have drunk the goblet to the dregs —
ISA.51.17	the cup that causes people to stagger.
ISA.51.18	There is no one to guide her
ISA.51.18	among all the children she has raised;
ISA.51.18	there is no one to take hold of her hand
ISA.51.18	among all the offspring she has brought up.
ISA.51.19	These two things have happened to you:
ISA.51.19	devastation and destruction,
ISA.51.19	famine and sword.
ISA.51.19	Who will grieve for you?
ISA.51.19	How can I
ISA.51.20	Your children have fainted;
ISA.51.20	they lie at the head of every street
ISA.51.20	like an antelope in a net.
ISA.51.20	They are full of the 
ISA.51.20	the rebuke of your God.
ISA.51.21	So listen to this, suffering
ISA.51.21	and drunken one — but not with wine.
ISA.51.22	This is what your Lord says —
ISA.51.22	the 
ISA.51.22	who defends his people
ISA.51.22	“Look, I have removed from your hand
ISA.51.22	the cup that causes staggering;
ISA.51.22	that goblet, the cup of my fury.
ISA.51.22	You will never drink it again.
ISA.51.23	I will put it into the hands of your tormentors,
ISA.51.23	who said to you:
ISA.51.23	Lie down, so we can walk over you.
ISA.51.23	You made your back like the ground,
ISA.51.23	and like a street for those who walk on it.
ISA.52.1	“Wake up, wake up;
ISA.52.1	put on your strength, Zion!
ISA.52.1	Put on your beautiful garments,
ISA.52.1	Jerusalem, the Holy City!
ISA.52.1	For the uncircumcised and the unclean
ISA.52.1	will no longer enter you.
ISA.52.2	Stand up, shake the dust off yourself!
ISA.52.2	Take your seat, Jerusalem.
ISA.52.2	Remove the bonds
ISA.52.2	captive Daughter Zion.”
ISA.52.3	For this is what the 
ISA.52.3	“You were sold for nothing,
ISA.52.3	and you will be redeemed without silver.”
ISA.52.4	For this is what the Lord 
ISA.52.4	“At first my people went down to Egypt to reside there,
ISA.52.4	then Assyria oppressed them without cause.
ISA.52.5	So now what have I here” —
ISA.52.5	this is the 
ISA.52.5	“that my people are taken away for nothing?
ISA.52.5	Its rulers wail” —
ISA.52.5	this is the 
ISA.52.5	“and my name is continually blasphemed all day long.
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people will know my name;
ISA.52.6	therefore they will know on that day
ISA.52.6	that I am he who says:
ISA.52.6	Here I am.”
ISA.52.7	How beautiful on the mountains
ISA.52.7	are the feet of the herald,
ISA.52.7	who proclaims peace,
ISA.52.7	who brings news of good things,
ISA.52.7	who proclaims salvation,
ISA.52.7	who says to Zion, “Your God reigns!” 
ISA.52.8	The voices of your watchmen
ISA.52.8	they lift up their voices,
ISA.52.8	shouting for joy together;
ISA.52.8	for every eye will see
ISA.52.8	when the 
ISA.52.9	Be joyful, rejoice together,
ISA.52.9	you ruins of Jerusalem!
ISA.52.9	For the 
ISA.52.9	he has redeemed Jerusalem.
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.10	in the sight of all the nations;
ISA.52.10	all the ends of the earth will see
ISA.52.10	the salvation of our God.
ISA.52.11	Leave, leave, go out from there!
ISA.52.11	Do not touch anything unclean;
ISA.52.11	go out from her, purify yourselves,
ISA.52.11	you who carry the vessels of the 
ISA.52.12	For you will not leave in a hurry,
ISA.52.12	and you will not have to take flight;
ISA.52.12	because the 
ISA.52.12	and the God of Israel is your rear guard.
ISA.52.13	See, my servant
ISA.52.13	he will be raised and lifted up and greatly exalted.
ISA.52.14	Just as many were appalled at you
ISA.52.14	his appearance was so disfigured
ISA.52.14	that he did not look like a man,
ISA.52.14	and his form did not resemble a human being —
ISA.52.15	so he will sprinkle many nations.
ISA.52.15	Kings will shut their mouths because of him,
ISA.52.15	for they will see what had not been told them,
ISA.52.15	and they will understand what they had not heard.
ISA.53.1	Who has believed what we have heard?
ISA.53.1	And to whom has the arm of the 
ISA.53.2	He grew up before him like a young plant
ISA.53.2	and like a root out of dry ground.
ISA.53.2	He didn’t have an impressive form
ISA.53.2	or majesty that we should look at him,
ISA.53.2	no appearance that we should desire him.
ISA.53.3	He was despised and rejected by men,
ISA.53.3	a man of suffering who knew what sickness was.
ISA.53.3	He was like someone people turned away from;
ISA.53.3	he was despised, and we didn’t value him.
ISA.53.4	Yet he himself bore our sicknesses,
ISA.53.4	and he carried our pains;
ISA.53.4	but we in turn regarded him stricken,
ISA.53.4	struck down by God,
ISA.53.5	But he was pierced because of our rebellion,
ISA.53.5	crushed because of our iniquities;
ISA.53.5	punishment
ISA.53.5	and we are healed by his wounds.
ISA.53.6	We all went astray like sheep;
ISA.53.6	we all have turned to our own way;
ISA.53.6	and the 
ISA.53.6	for
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed and afflicted,
ISA.53.7	yet he did not open his mouth.
ISA.53.7	Like a lamb led to the slaughter
ISA.53.7	and like a sheep silent before her shearers,
ISA.53.7	he did not open his mouth.
ISA.53.8	He was taken away because of oppression and judgment;
ISA.53.8	and who considered his fate?
ISA.53.8	For he was cut off from the land of the living;
ISA.53.8	he was struck because of my people’s rebellion.
ISA.53.9	He was assigned a grave with the wicked,
ISA.53.9	but he was with a rich man at his death,
ISA.53.9	because he had done no violence
ISA.53.9	and had not spoken deceitfully.
ISA.53.10	Yet the 
ISA.53.10	When
ISA.53.10	he will see his seed, he will prolong his days,
ISA.53.10	and by his hand, the 
ISA.53.11	After his anguish,
ISA.53.11	he will see light
ISA.53.11	By his knowledge,
ISA.53.11	my righteous
ISA.53.11	and he will carry their iniquities.
ISA.53.12	Therefore I will give him
ISA.53.12	and he will receive
ISA.53.12	because he willingly submitted to death,
ISA.53.12	and was counted among the rebels;
ISA.53.12	yet he bore the sin of many
ISA.53.12	and interceded for the rebels.
ISA.54.1	“Rejoice, childless one, who did not give birth;
ISA.54.1	burst into song and shout,
ISA.54.1	you who have not been in labor!
ISA.54.1	For the children of the desolate one will be more
ISA.54.1	than the children of the married woman,”
ISA.54.1	says the 
ISA.54.2	“Enlarge the site of your tent,
ISA.54.2	and let your tent curtains be stretched out;
ISA.54.2	do not hold back;
ISA.54.2	lengthen your ropes,
ISA.54.2	and drive your pegs deep.
ISA.54.3	For you will spread out to the right and to the left,
ISA.54.3	and your descendants will dispossess nations
ISA.54.3	and inhabit the desolate cities.
ISA.54.4	“Do not be afraid, for you will not be put to shame;
ISA.54.4	don’t be humiliated, for you will not be disgraced.
ISA.54.4	For you will forget the shame of your youth,
ISA.54.4	and you will no longer remember
ISA.54.4	the disgrace of your widowhood.
ISA.54.5	Indeed, your husband is your Maker
ISA.54.5	his name is the 
ISA.54.5	and the Holy One of Israel
ISA.54.5	he is called the God of the whole earth.
ISA.54.6	For the 
ISA.54.6	like a wife deserted and wounded in spirit,
ISA.54.6	a wife of one’s youth
ISA.54.6	says your God.
ISA.54.7	“I deserted you for a brief moment,
ISA.54.7	but I will take you back with abundant compassion.
ISA.54.8	In a surge of anger
ISA.54.8	I hid my face
ISA.54.8	but I will have compassion on you
ISA.54.8	with everlasting love,”
ISA.54.8	says the 
ISA.54.9	“For this is like the days
ISA.54.9	when I swore that the water of Noah
ISA.54.9	would never flood the earth again,
ISA.54.9	so I have sworn that I will not be angry with you
ISA.54.9	or rebuke you.
ISA.54.10	Though the mountains move
ISA.54.10	and the hills shake,
ISA.54.10	my love will not be removed from you
ISA.54.10	and my covenant of peace
ISA.54.10	says your compassionate 
ISA.54.11	“Poor Jerusalem, storm-tossed, and not comforted,
ISA.54.11	I will set your stones in black mortar,
ISA.54.11	and lay your foundations in lapis lazuli.
ISA.54.12	I will make your fortifications
ISA.54.12	your gates out of sparkling stones,
ISA.54.12	and all your walls out of precious stones.
ISA.54.13	Then all your children will be taught by the 
ISA.54.13	their prosperity will be great,
ISA.54.14	and you will be established
ISA.54.14	on a foundation of righteousness.
ISA.54.14	You will be far from oppression,
ISA.54.14	you will certainly not be afraid;
ISA.54.14	you will be far from terror,
ISA.54.14	it will certainly not come near you.
ISA.54.15	If anyone attacks you,
ISA.54.15	it is not from me;
ISA.54.15	whoever attacks you
ISA.54.15	will fall before you.
ISA.54.16	Look, I have created the craftsman
ISA.54.16	who blows on the charcoal fire
ISA.54.16	and produces a weapon suitable for its task;
ISA.54.16	and I have created the destroyer to cause havoc.
ISA.54.17	No weapon formed against you will succeed,
ISA.54.17	and you will refute any accusation
ISA.54.17	raised against you in court.
ISA.54.17	This is the heritage of the 
ISA.54.17	and their vindication is from me.”
ISA.54.17	This is the 
ISA.55.1	“Come, everyone who is thirsty,
ISA.55.1	come to the water;
ISA.55.1	and you without silver,
ISA.55.1	come, buy, and eat!
ISA.55.1	Come, buy wine and milk
ISA.55.1	without silver and without cost!
ISA.55.2	Why do you spend silver on what is not food,
ISA.55.2	and your wages on what does not satisfy?
ISA.55.2	Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good,
ISA.55.2	and you will enjoy the choicest of foods.
ISA.55.3	Pay attention and come to me;
ISA.55.3	listen, so that you will live.
ISA.55.3	I will make a permanent covenant with you
ISA.55.3	on the basis of the faithful kindnesses of David.
ISA.55.4	Since I have made him a witness to the peoples,
ISA.55.4	a leader and commander for the peoples,
ISA.55.5	so you will summon a nation you do not know,
ISA.55.5	and nations who do not know you will run to you.
ISA.55.5	For the 
ISA.55.5	even the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.55.5	has glorified you.”
ISA.55.6	Seek the 
ISA.55.6	call to him while he is near.
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked one abandon his way
ISA.55.7	and the sinful one his thoughts;
ISA.55.7	let him return to the 
ISA.55.7	so he may have compassion on him,
ISA.55.7	and to our God, for he will freely forgive.
ISA.55.8	“For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
ISA.55.8	and your ways are not my ways.”
ISA.55.8	This is the 
ISA.55.9	“For as heaven is higher than earth,
ISA.55.9	so my ways are higher than your ways,
ISA.55.9	and my thoughts than your thoughts.
ISA.55.10	For just as rain and snow fall from heaven
ISA.55.10	and do not return there
ISA.55.10	without saturating the earth
ISA.55.10	and making it germinate and sprout,
ISA.55.10	and providing seed to sow
ISA.55.10	and food to eat,
ISA.55.11	so my word that comes from my mouth
ISA.55.11	will not return to me empty,
ISA.55.11	but it will accomplish what I please
ISA.55.11	and will prosper in what I send it to do.”
ISA.55.12	You will indeed go out with joy
ISA.55.12	and be peacefully guided;
ISA.55.12	the mountains and the hills will break into singing before you,
ISA.55.12	and all the trees of the field will clap their hands.
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thornbush, a cypress will come up,
ISA.55.13	and instead of the brier, a myrtle will come up;
ISA.55.13	this will stand as a monument for the 
ISA.55.13	an everlasting sign that will not be destroyed.
ISA.56.1	This is what the 
ISA.56.1	Preserve justice and do what is right,
ISA.56.1	for my salvation is coming soon,
ISA.56.1	and my righteousness will be revealed.
ISA.56.2	Happy is the person who does this,
ISA.56.2	the son of man who holds it fast,
ISA.56.2	who keeps the Sabbath without desecrating it,
ISA.56.2	and keeps his hand from doing any evil.
ISA.56.3	No foreigner who has joined himself to the 
ISA.56.3	should say,
ISA.56.3	“The 
ISA.56.3	and the eunuch should not say,
ISA.56.3	“Look, I am a dried-up tree.”
ISA.56.4	For the 
ISA.56.4	“For the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,
ISA.56.4	and choose what pleases me,
ISA.56.4	and hold firmly to my covenant,
ISA.56.5	I will give them, in my house and within my walls,
ISA.56.5	a memorial and a name
ISA.56.5	better than sons and daughters.
ISA.56.5	I will give each of them an everlasting name
ISA.56.5	that will never be cut off.
ISA.56.6	As for the foreigners who join themselves to the 
ISA.56.6	to minister to him, to love the name of the 
ISA.56.6	and to become his servants —
ISA.56.6	all who keep the Sabbath without desecrating it
ISA.56.6	and who hold firmly to my covenant —
ISA.56.7	I will bring them to my holy mountain
ISA.56.7	and let them rejoice in my house of prayer.
ISA.56.7	Their burnt offerings and sacrifices
ISA.56.7	will be acceptable on my altar,
ISA.56.7	for my house will be called a house of prayer
ISA.56.7	for all nations.”
ISA.56.8	This is the declaration of the Lord 
ISA.56.8	who gathers the dispersed of Israel:
ISA.56.8	“I will gather to them still others
ISA.56.8	besides those already gathered.”
ISA.56.9	All you animals of the field and forest,
ISA.56.9	come and eat!
ISA.56.10	Israel’s
ISA.56.10	they know nothing;
ISA.56.10	all of them are mute dogs,
ISA.56.10	they cannot bark;
ISA.56.10	they dream, lie down,
ISA.56.10	and love to sleep.
ISA.56.11	These dogs have fierce appetites;
ISA.56.11	they never have enough.
ISA.56.11	And they are shepherds
ISA.56.11	who have no discernment;
ISA.56.11	all of them turn to their own way,
ISA.56.11	every last one for his own profit.
ISA.56.12	“Come, let me get some wine,
ISA.56.12	let’s guzzle some beer;
ISA.56.12	and tomorrow will be like today,
ISA.56.12	only far better!” 
ISA.57.1	The righteous person perishes,
ISA.57.1	and no one takes it to heart;
ISA.57.1	the faithful are taken away,
ISA.57.1	with no one realizing
ISA.57.1	that the righteous person is taken away
ISA.57.1	because of
ISA.57.2	He will enter into peace —
ISA.57.2	they will rest on their beds
ISA.57.2	everyone who lives uprightly.
ISA.57.3	But come here,
ISA.57.3	you witch’s sons,
ISA.57.3	offspring of an adulterer and a prostitute!
ISA.57.4	Who are you mocking?
ISA.57.4	Who are you opening your mouth
ISA.57.4	and sticking out your tongue at?
ISA.57.4	Isn’t it you, you rebellious children,
ISA.57.4	you offspring of liars,
ISA.57.5	who burn with lust among the oaks,
ISA.57.5	under every green tree,
ISA.57.5	who slaughter children in the wadis
ISA.57.5	below the clefts of the rocks?
ISA.57.6	Your portion is among the smooth stones of the wadi;
ISA.57.6	indeed, they are your lot.
ISA.57.6	You have even poured out a drink offering to them;
ISA.57.6	you have offered a grain offering;
ISA.57.6	should I be satisfied with these?
ISA.57.7	You have placed your bed
ISA.57.7	on a high and lofty mountain;
ISA.57.7	you also went up there to offer sacrifice.
ISA.57.8	You have set up your memorial
ISA.57.8	behind the door and doorpost.
ISA.57.8	For away from me, you stripped,
ISA.57.8	went up, and made your bed wide,
ISA.57.8	and you have made a bargain
ISA.57.8	You have loved their bed;
ISA.57.8	you have gazed on their genitals.
ISA.57.9	You went to the king with oil
ISA.57.9	and multiplied your perfumes;
ISA.57.9	you sent your envoys far away
ISA.57.9	and sent them down even to Sheol.
ISA.57.10	You became weary on your many journeys,
ISA.57.10	but you did not say, “It’s hopeless!” 
ISA.57.10	You found a renewal of your strength;
ISA.57.10	therefore you did not grow weak.
ISA.57.11	Who was it you dreaded and feared,
ISA.57.11	so that you lied and didn’t remember me
ISA.57.11	or take it to heart?
ISA.57.11	I have kept silent for a long time, haven’t I?
ISA.57.11	So you do not fear me.
ISA.57.12	I will announce your righteousness,
ISA.57.12	and your works — they will not profit you.
ISA.57.13	When you cry out,
ISA.57.13	let your collection of idols rescue you!
ISA.57.13	The wind will carry all of them off,
ISA.57.13	a breath will take them away.
ISA.57.13	But whoever takes refuge in me
ISA.57.13	will inherit the land
ISA.57.13	and possess my holy mountain.
ISA.57.14	He said,
ISA.57.14	“Build it up, build it up, prepare the way,
ISA.57.14	remove every obstacle from my people’s way.”
ISA.57.15	For the High and Exalted One,
ISA.57.15	who lives forever, whose name is holy,
ISA.57.15	“I live in a high and holy place,
ISA.57.15	and with the oppressed and lowly of spirit,
ISA.57.15	to revive the spirit of the lowly
ISA.57.15	and revive the heart of the oppressed.
ISA.57.16	For I will not accuse you forever,
ISA.57.16	and I will not always be angry;
ISA.57.16	for then the spirit would grow weak before me,
ISA.57.16	even the breath, which I have made.
ISA.57.17	Because of his sinful greed I was angry,
ISA.57.17	so I struck him; I was angry and hid;
ISA.57.17	but he went on turning back to the desires of his heart.
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways, but I will heal him;
ISA.57.18	I will lead him and restore comfort
ISA.57.18	to him and his mourners,
ISA.57.19	creating words of praise.”
ISA.57.19	The 
ISA.57.19	“Peace, peace to the one who is far or near,
ISA.57.19	and I will heal him.
ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like the storm-tossed sea,
ISA.57.20	for it cannot be still,
ISA.57.20	and its water churns up mire and muck.
ISA.57.21	There is no peace for the wicked,”
ISA.57.21	says my God.
ISA.58.1	“Cry out loudly,
ISA.58.1	Raise your voice like a trumpet.
ISA.58.1	Tell my people their transgression
ISA.58.1	and the house of Jacob their sins.
ISA.58.2	They seek me day after day
ISA.58.2	and delight to know my ways,
ISA.58.2	like a nation that does what is right
ISA.58.2	and does not abandon the justice of their God.
ISA.58.2	They ask me for righteous judgments;
ISA.58.2	they delight in the nearness of God.”
ISA.58.3	“Why have we fasted, but you have not seen?
ISA.58.3	We have denied ourselves, but you haven’t noticed!” 
ISA.58.3	“Look, you do as you please on the day of your fast,
ISA.58.3	and oppress all your workers.
ISA.58.4	You fast with contention and strife
ISA.58.4	to strike viciously with your fist.
ISA.58.4	You cannot fast as you do today,
ISA.58.4	hoping to make your voice heard on high.
ISA.58.5	Will the fast I choose be like this:
ISA.58.5	A day for a person to deny himself,
ISA.58.5	to bow his head like a reed,
ISA.58.5	and to spread out sackcloth and ashes?
ISA.58.5	Will you call this a fast
ISA.58.5	and a day acceptable to the 
ISA.58.6	Isn’t this the fast I choose:
ISA.58.6	To break the chains of wickedness,
ISA.58.6	to untie the ropes of the yoke,
ISA.58.6	to set the oppressed free,
ISA.58.6	and to tear off every yoke?
ISA.58.7	Is it not to share your bread with the hungry,
ISA.58.7	to bring the poor and homeless into your house,
ISA.58.7	to clothe the naked when you see him,
ISA.58.7	and not to ignore your own flesh and blood?
ISA.58.8	Then your light will appear like the dawn,
ISA.58.8	and your recovery will come quickly.
ISA.58.8	Your righteousness will go before you,
ISA.58.8	and the 
ISA.58.9	At that time, when you call, the 
ISA.58.9	when you cry out, he will say, ‘Here I am.’
ISA.58.9	If you get rid of the yoke among you,
ISA.58.9	the finger-pointing and malicious speaking,
ISA.58.10	and if you offer yourself
ISA.58.10	and satisfy the afflicted one,
ISA.58.10	then your light will shine in the darkness,
ISA.58.10	and your night will be like noonday.
ISA.58.11	The 
ISA.58.11	satisfy you in a parched land,
ISA.58.11	and strengthen your bones.
ISA.58.11	You will be like a watered garden
ISA.58.11	and like a spring whose water never runs dry.
ISA.58.12	Some of you will rebuild the ancient ruins;
ISA.58.12	you will restore the foundations laid long ago;
ISA.58.12	you will be called the repairer of broken walls,
ISA.58.12	the restorer of streets where people live.
ISA.58.13	“If you keep from desecrating
ISA.58.13	from doing whatever you want on my holy day;
ISA.58.13	if you call the Sabbath a delight,
ISA.58.13	and the holy day of the 
ISA.58.13	if you honor it, not going your own ways,
ISA.58.13	seeking your own pleasure, or talking business;
ISA.58.14	then you will delight in the 
ISA.58.14	and I will make you ride over the heights of the land,
ISA.58.14	and let you enjoy the heritage of your father Jacob.”
ISA.58.14	For the mouth of the 
ISA.59.1	Indeed, the 
ISA.59.1	and his ear is not too deaf to hear.
ISA.59.2	But your iniquities
ISA.59.2	from your God,
ISA.59.2	and your sins have hidden his face from you
ISA.59.2	so that he does not listen.
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood
ISA.59.3	and your fingers, with iniquity;
ISA.59.3	your lips have spoken lies,
ISA.59.3	and your tongues mutter injustice.
ISA.59.4	No one makes claims justly;
ISA.59.4	no one pleads honestly.
ISA.59.4	They trust in empty and worthless words;
ISA.59.4	they conceive trouble and give birth to iniquity.
ISA.59.5	They hatch viper’s eggs
ISA.59.5	and weave spider’s webs.
ISA.59.5	Whoever eats their eggs will die;
ISA.59.5	crack one open, and a viper is hatched.
ISA.59.6	Their webs cannot become clothing,
ISA.59.6	and they cannot cover themselves with their works.
ISA.59.6	Their works are sinful works,
ISA.59.6	and violent acts are in their hands.
ISA.59.7	Their feet run after evil,
ISA.59.7	and they rush to shed innocent blood.
ISA.59.7	Their thoughts are sinful thoughts;
ISA.59.7	ruin and wretchedness are in their paths.
ISA.59.8	They have not known the path of peace,
ISA.59.8	and there is no justice in their ways.
ISA.59.8	They have made their roads crooked;
ISA.59.8	no one who walks on them will know peace.
ISA.59.9	Therefore justice is far from us,
ISA.59.9	and righteousness does not reach us.
ISA.59.9	We hope for light, but there is darkness;
ISA.59.9	for brightness, but we live in the night.
ISA.59.10	We grope along a wall like the blind;
ISA.59.10	we grope like those without eyes.
ISA.59.10	We stumble at noon as though it were twilight;
ISA.59.10	we are like the dead among those who are healthy.
ISA.59.11	We all growl like bears
ISA.59.11	and moan like doves.
ISA.59.11	We hope for justice, but there is none;
ISA.59.11	for salvation, but it is far from us.
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions have multiplied before you,
ISA.59.12	and our sins testify against us.
ISA.59.12	For our transgressions are with us,
ISA.59.12	and we know our iniquities:
ISA.59.13	transgression and deception against the 
ISA.59.13	turning away from following our God,
ISA.59.13	speaking oppression and revolt,
ISA.59.13	conceiving and uttering lying words from the heart.
ISA.59.14	Justice is turned back,
ISA.59.14	and righteousness stands far off.
ISA.59.14	For truth has stumbled in the public square,
ISA.59.14	and honesty cannot enter.
ISA.59.15	Truth is missing,
ISA.59.15	and whoever turns from evil is plundered.
ISA.59.15	The 
ISA.59.15	and he was offended.
ISA.59.16	He saw that there was no man —
ISA.59.16	he was amazed that there was no one interceding;
ISA.59.16	so his own arm brought salvation,
ISA.59.16	and his own righteousness supported him.
ISA.59.17	He put on righteousness as body armor,
ISA.59.17	and a helmet of salvation on his head;
ISA.59.17	he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,
ISA.59.17	and he wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak.
ISA.59.18	So he will repay according to their deeds:
ISA.59.18	fury to his enemies,
ISA.59.18	retribution to his foes,
ISA.59.18	and he will repay the coasts and islands.
ISA.59.19	They will fear the name of the 
ISA.59.19	and his glory in the east;
ISA.59.19	for he will come like a rushing stream
ISA.59.19	driven by the wind of the 
ISA.59.20	“The Redeemer
ISA.59.20	and to those in Jacob who turn from transgression.”
ISA.59.20	This is the 
ISA.59.21	“As for me, this is my covenant with them,”
ISA.60.1	Arise, shine, for your light has come,
ISA.60.1	and the glory of the 
ISA.60.2	For look, darkness will cover the earth,
ISA.60.2	and total darkness the peoples;
ISA.60.2	but the 
ISA.60.2	and his glory will appear over you.
ISA.60.3	Nations will come to your light,
ISA.60.3	and kings to your shining brightness.
ISA.60.4	Raise your eyes and look around:
ISA.60.4	they all gather and come to you;
ISA.60.4	your sons will come from far away,
ISA.60.4	and your daughters on the hips of nannies.
ISA.60.5	Then you will see and be radiant,
ISA.60.5	and your heart will tremble and rejoice,
ISA.60.5	because the riches of the sea will become yours
ISA.60.5	and the wealth of the nations will come to you.
ISA.60.6	Caravans of camels will cover your land
ISA.60.6	young camels of Midian and Ephah —
ISA.60.6	all of them will come from Sheba.
ISA.60.6	They will carry gold and frankincense
ISA.60.6	and proclaim the praises of the 
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar will be gathered to you;
ISA.60.7	the rams of Nebaioth will serve you
ISA.60.7	and go up on my altar as an acceptable sacrifice.
ISA.60.7	I will glorify my beautiful house.
ISA.60.8	Who are these who fly like a cloud,
ISA.60.8	like doves to their shelters?
ISA.60.9	Yes, the coasts and islands will wait for me
ISA.60.9	with the ships of Tarshish in the lead,
ISA.60.9	to bring your children from far away,
ISA.60.9	their silver and gold with them,
ISA.60.9	for the honor of the 
ISA.60.9	the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.60.9	who has glorified you.
ISA.60.10	Foreigners will rebuild your walls,
ISA.60.10	and their kings will serve you.
ISA.60.10	Although I struck you in my wrath,
ISA.60.10	yet I will show mercy to you with my favor.
ISA.60.11	Your city gates will always be open;
ISA.60.11	they will never be shut day or night
ISA.60.11	so that the wealth of the nations
ISA.60.11	may be brought into you,
ISA.60.11	with their kings being led in procession.
ISA.60.12	For the nation and the kingdom
ISA.60.12	that will not serve you will perish;
ISA.60.12	those nations will be annihilated.
ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon will come to you
ISA.60.13	its pine, elm, and cypress together
ISA.60.13	to beautify the place of my sanctuary,
ISA.60.13	and I will glorify my dwelling place.
ISA.60.14	The sons of your oppressors
ISA.60.14	will come and bow down to you;
ISA.60.14	all who reviled you
ISA.60.14	will fall facedown at your feet.
ISA.60.14	They will call you the City of the 
ISA.60.14	Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.60.15	Instead of your being deserted and hated,
ISA.60.15	with no one passing through,
ISA.60.15	I will make you an object of eternal pride,
ISA.60.15	a joy from age to age.
ISA.60.16	You will nurse on the milk of nations,
ISA.60.16	and nurse at the breast of kings;
ISA.60.16	you will know that I, the 
ISA.60.16	and Redeemer,
ISA.60.17	I will bring gold instead of bronze;
ISA.60.17	I will bring silver instead of iron,
ISA.60.17	bronze instead of wood,
ISA.60.17	and iron instead of stones.
ISA.60.17	I will appoint peace as your government
ISA.60.17	and righteousness as your overseers.
ISA.60.18	Violence will never again be heard of in your land;
ISA.60.18	devastation and destruction
ISA.60.18	will be gone from your borders.
ISA.60.18	You will call your walls Salvation
ISA.60.18	and your city gates Praise.
ISA.60.19	The sun will no longer be your light by day,
ISA.60.19	and the brightness of the moon will not shine on you.
ISA.60.19	The 
ISA.60.19	and your God will be your splendor.
ISA.60.20	Your sun will no longer set,
ISA.60.20	and your moon will not fade;
ISA.60.20	for the 
ISA.60.20	and the days of your sorrow will be over.
ISA.60.21	All your people will be righteous;
ISA.60.21	they will possess the land forever;
ISA.60.21	they are the branch I planted,
ISA.60.21	the work of my
ISA.60.21	so that I may be glorified.
ISA.60.22	The least will become a thousand,
ISA.60.22	the smallest a mighty nation.
ISA.60.22	I am the 
ISA.60.22	I will accomplish it quickly in its time.
ISA.61.1	The Spirit of the Lord 
ISA.61.1	because the 
ISA.61.1	to bring good news to the poor.
ISA.61.1	He has sent me to heal
ISA.61.1	to proclaim liberty to the captives
ISA.61.1	and freedom to the prisoners;
ISA.61.2	to proclaim the year of the 
ISA.61.2	and the day of our God’s vengeance;
ISA.61.2	to comfort
ISA.61.3	to provide for those who mourn in Zion;
ISA.61.3	to give them a crown of beauty instead of ashes,
ISA.61.3	festive oil instead of mourning,
ISA.61.3	and splendid clothes instead of despair.
ISA.61.3	And they will be called righteous trees,
ISA.61.3	planted by the 
ISA.61.3	to glorify him.
ISA.61.4	They will rebuild the ancient ruins;
ISA.61.4	they will restore the former devastations;
ISA.61.4	they will renew the ruined cities,
ISA.61.4	the devastations of many generations.
ISA.61.5	Strangers will stand and feed your flocks,
ISA.61.5	and foreigners will be your plowmen and vinedressers.
ISA.61.6	But you will be called the 
ISA.61.6	they will speak of you as ministers of our God;
ISA.61.6	you will eat the wealth of the nations,
ISA.61.6	and you will boast in their riches.
ISA.61.7	In place of your shame, you will have a double portion;
ISA.61.7	in place of disgrace, they will rejoice over their share.
ISA.61.7	So they will possess double in their land,
ISA.61.7	and eternal joy will be theirs.
ISA.61.8	For I the 
ISA.61.8	I hate robbery and injustice;
ISA.61.8	I will faithfully reward my people
ISA.61.8	and make a permanent covenant
ISA.61.9	Their descendants will be known among the nations,
ISA.61.9	and their posterity among the peoples.
ISA.61.9	All who see them will recognize
ISA.61.9	that they are a people the 
ISA.61.10	I rejoice greatly in the 
ISA.61.10	I exult in my God;
ISA.61.10	for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation
ISA.61.10	and wrapped me in a robe of righteousness,
ISA.61.10	as a groom wears a turban
ISA.61.10	and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
ISA.61.11	For as the earth produces its growth,
ISA.61.11	and as a garden enables what is sown to spring up,
ISA.61.11	so the Lord 
ISA.61.11	to spring up before all the nations.
ISA.62.1	I will not keep silent because of Zion,
ISA.62.1	and I will not keep still because of Jerusalem,
ISA.62.1	until her righteousness shines like a bright light
ISA.62.1	and her salvation, like a flaming torch.
ISA.62.2	Nations will see your righteousness
ISA.62.2	and all kings, your glory.
ISA.62.2	You will be given a new name
ISA.62.2	that the 
ISA.62.3	You will be a glorious crown in the 
ISA.62.3	and a royal diadem in the palm of your God’s hand.
ISA.62.4	You will no longer be called Deserted,
ISA.62.4	and your land will not be called Desolate;
ISA.62.4	instead, you will be called My Delight Is in Her,
ISA.62.4	and your land Married;
ISA.62.4	for the 
ISA.62.4	and your land will be married.
ISA.62.5	For as a young man marries a young woman,
ISA.62.5	so your sons will marry you;
ISA.62.5	and as a groom rejoices over his bride,
ISA.62.5	so your God will rejoice over you.
ISA.62.6	Jerusalem,
ISA.62.6	I have appointed watchmen on your walls;
ISA.62.6	they will never be silent, day or night.
ISA.62.6	There is no rest for you,
ISA.62.6	who remind the 
ISA.62.7	Do not give him rest
ISA.62.7	until he establishes and makes Jerusalem
ISA.62.7	the praise of the earth.
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.8	and his strong arm:
ISA.62.8	I will no longer give your grain
ISA.62.8	to your enemies for food,
ISA.62.8	and foreigners will not drink the new wine
ISA.62.8	for which you have labored.
ISA.62.9	For those who gather grain will eat it
ISA.62.9	and praise the 
ISA.62.9	and those who harvest the grapes will drink the wine
ISA.62.9	in my holy courts.
ISA.62.10	Go out, go out through the city gates;
ISA.62.10	prepare a way for the people!
ISA.62.10	Build it up, build up the highway;
ISA.62.10	clear away the stones!
ISA.62.10	Raise a banner for the peoples.
ISA.62.11	Look, the 
ISA.62.11	to the ends of the earth,
ISA.62.11	“Say to Daughter Zion:
ISA.62.11	Look, your salvation is coming,
ISA.62.11	his wages are with him,
ISA.62.11	and his reward accompanies him.”
ISA.62.12	And they will be called
ISA.62.12	the 
ISA.62.12	and you will be called Cared For,
ISA.62.12	A City Not Deserted.
ISA.63.1	Who is this coming from Edom
ISA.63.1	in crimson-stained garments from Bozrah —
ISA.63.1	this one who is splendid in his apparel,
ISA.63.1	striding in his formidable
ISA.63.1	It is I, proclaiming vindication,
ISA.63.1	powerful to save.
ISA.63.2	Why are your clothes red,
ISA.63.2	and your garments like one who treads a winepress?
ISA.63.3	I trampled the winepress alone,
ISA.63.3	and no one from the nations was with me.
ISA.63.3	I trampled them in my anger
ISA.63.3	and ground them underfoot in my fury;
ISA.63.3	their blood spattered my garments,
ISA.63.3	and all my clothes were stained.
ISA.63.4	For I planned the day of vengeance,
ISA.63.4	and the year of my redemption
ISA.63.5	I looked, but there was no one to help,
ISA.63.5	and I was amazed that no one assisted;
ISA.63.5	so my arm accomplished victory for me,
ISA.63.5	and my wrath assisted me.
ISA.63.6	I crushed nations in my anger;
ISA.63.6	I made them drunk with my wrath
ISA.63.6	and poured out their blood on the ground.
ISA.63.7	I will make known the 
ISA.63.7	and the 
ISA.63.7	because of all the 
ISA.63.7	even the many good things
ISA.63.7	he has done for the house of Israel,
ISA.63.7	which he did for them based on his compassion
ISA.63.7	and the abundance of his faithful love.
ISA.63.8	He said, “They are indeed my people,
ISA.63.8	children who will not be disloyal,”
ISA.63.8	and he became their Savior.
ISA.63.9	In all their suffering, he suffered,
ISA.63.9	and the angel of his presence saved them.
ISA.63.9	He redeemed them
ISA.63.9	because of his love and compassion;
ISA.63.9	he lifted them up and carried them
ISA.63.9	all the days of the past.
ISA.63.10	But they rebelled
ISA.63.10	and grieved his Holy Spirit.
ISA.63.10	So he became their enemy
ISA.63.10	and fought against them.
ISA.63.11	Then he
ISA.63.11	the days of Moses and his people.
ISA.63.11	Where is he who brought them out of the sea
ISA.63.11	with the shepherds
ISA.63.11	Where is he who put his Holy Spirit among the flock?
ISA.63.12	He made his glorious strength
ISA.63.12	available at the right hand of Moses,
ISA.63.12	divided the water before them
ISA.63.12	to make an eternal name for himself,
ISA.63.13	and led them through the depths
ISA.63.13	like a horse in the wilderness,
ISA.63.13	so that they did not stumble.
ISA.63.14	Like cattle that go down into the valley,
ISA.63.14	the Spirit of the 
ISA.63.14	You led your people this way
ISA.63.14	to make a glorious name for yourself.
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven and see
ISA.63.15	from your lofty home — holy and beautiful.
ISA.63.15	Where is your zeal and your might?
ISA.63.15	Your yearning
ISA.63.15	are withheld from me.
ISA.63.16	Yet you are our Father,
ISA.63.16	even though Abraham does not know us
ISA.63.16	and Israel doesn’t recognize us.
ISA.63.16	You, 
ISA.63.16	your name is Our Redeemer
ISA.63.16	from Ancient Times.
ISA.63.17	Why, 
ISA.63.17	You harden our hearts so we do not fear
ISA.63.17	Return, because of your servants,
ISA.63.17	the tribes of your heritage.
ISA.63.18	Your holy people had a possession
ISA.63.18	for a little while,
ISA.63.18	but our enemies have trampled down
ISA.63.18	your sanctuary.
ISA.63.19	We have become like those you never ruled,
ISA.63.19	like those who did not bear your name.
ISA.64.1	If only you would tear the heavens open
ISA.64.1	and come down,
ISA.64.1	so that mountains would quake at your presence
ISA.64.2	just as fire kindles brushwood,
ISA.64.2	and fire boils water —
ISA.64.2	to make your name known to your enemies,
ISA.64.2	so that nations will tremble at your presence!
ISA.64.3	When you did awesome works
ISA.64.3	that we did not expect,
ISA.64.3	you came down,
ISA.64.3	and the mountains quaked at your presence.
ISA.64.4	From ancient times no one has heard,
ISA.64.4	no one has listened to,
ISA.64.4	no eye has seen any God except you
ISA.64.4	who acts on behalf of the one who waits for him.
ISA.64.5	You welcome the one who joyfully does what is right;
ISA.64.5	they remember you in your ways.
ISA.64.5	But we have sinned, and you were angry.
ISA.64.5	How can we be saved if we remain in our sins?
ISA.64.6	All of us have become like something unclean,
ISA.64.6	and all our righteous acts are like a polluted
ISA.64.6	all of us wither like a leaf,
ISA.64.6	and our iniquities
ISA.64.7	No one calls on your name,
ISA.64.7	striving to take hold of you.
ISA.64.7	For you have hidden your face from us
ISA.64.7	and made us melt because of
ISA.64.8	Yet 
ISA.64.8	we are the clay, and you are our potter;
ISA.64.8	we all are the work of your hands.
ISA.64.9	or remember our iniquity forever.
ISA.64.9	Please look — all of us are your people!
ISA.64.10	Your holy cities have become a wilderness;
ISA.64.10	Zion has become a wilderness,
ISA.64.10	Jerusalem a desolation.
ISA.64.11	Our holy and beautiful
ISA.64.11	where our fathers praised you,
ISA.64.11	has been burned down,
ISA.64.11	and all that was dear to us lies in ruins.
ISA.64.12	Will you keep silent and afflict us severely?
ISA.65.1	“I was sought by those who did not ask;
ISA.65.1	I was found by those who did not seek me.
ISA.65.1	I said, ‘Here I am, here I am,’
ISA.65.1	to a nation that did not call on
ISA.65.2	I spread out my hands all day long
ISA.65.2	to a rebellious people
ISA.65.2	who walk in the path that is not good,
ISA.65.2	following their own thoughts.
ISA.65.3	These people continually anger me
ISA.65.3	to my face,
ISA.65.3	sacrificing in gardens,
ISA.65.3	burning incense on bricks,
ISA.65.4	sitting among the graves,
ISA.65.4	spending nights in secret places,
ISA.65.4	eating the meat of pigs,
ISA.65.4	and putting polluted broth in their bowls.
ISA.65.5	They say, ‘Keep to yourself,
ISA.65.5	don’t come near me, for I am too holy for you!’
ISA.65.5	These practices are smoke in my nostrils,
ISA.65.5	a fire that burns all day long.
ISA.65.6	Look, it is written in front of me:
ISA.65.6	I will not keep silent,
ISA.65.6	I will repay them fully
ISA.65.7	for your iniquities and the iniquities
ISA.65.7	of your
ISA.65.7	says the 
ISA.65.7	“Because they burned incense on the mountains
ISA.65.7	and reproached me on the hills,
ISA.65.7	I will reward them fully
ISA.65.7	for their former deeds.”
ISA.65.8	The 
ISA.65.8	“As the new wine is found in a bunch of grapes,
ISA.65.8	and one says, ‘Don’t destroy it,
ISA.65.8	for there’s some good
ISA.65.8	so I will act because of my servants
ISA.65.8	and not destroy them all.
ISA.65.9	I will produce descendants from Jacob,
ISA.65.9	and heirs to my mountains from Judah;
ISA.65.9	my chosen
ISA.65.9	and my servants will dwell there.
ISA.65.10	Sharon will be a pasture for flocks,
ISA.65.10	and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down,
ISA.65.10	for my people who have sought me.
ISA.65.11	But you who abandon the 
ISA.65.11	who forget my holy mountain,
ISA.65.11	who prepare a table for Fortune
ISA.65.11	and fill bowls of mixed wine for Destiny,
ISA.65.12	I will destine you for the sword,
ISA.65.12	and all of you will kneel down to be slaughtered,
ISA.65.12	because I called and you did not answer,
ISA.65.12	I spoke and you did not hear;
ISA.65.12	you did what was evil in my sight
ISA.65.12	and chose what I did not delight in.”
ISA.65.13	Therefore, this is what the Lord 
ISA.65.13	“My servants will eat,
ISA.65.13	but you will be hungry;
ISA.65.13	my servants will drink,
ISA.65.13	but you will be thirsty;
ISA.65.13	my servants will rejoice,
ISA.65.13	but you will be put to shame.
ISA.65.14	My servants will shout for joy from a glad heart,
ISA.65.14	but you will cry out from an anguished heart,
ISA.65.14	and you will lament out of a broken spirit.
ISA.65.15	You will leave your name behind
ISA.65.15	as a curse for my chosen ones,
ISA.65.15	and the Lord 
ISA.65.15	but he will give his servants another name.
ISA.65.16	Whoever asks for a blessing in the land
ISA.65.16	will ask for a blessing by the God of truth,
ISA.65.16	and whoever swears in the land
ISA.65.16	will swear by the God of truth.
ISA.65.16	For the former troubles will be forgotten
ISA.65.16	and hidden from my sight.
ISA.65.17	“For I will create a new heaven and a new earth;
ISA.65.17	the past events will not be remembered or come to mind.
ISA.65.18	Then be glad and rejoice forever
ISA.65.18	in what I am creating;
ISA.65.18	for I will create Jerusalem to be a joy
ISA.65.18	and its people to be a delight.
ISA.65.19	I will rejoice in Jerusalem
ISA.65.19	and be glad in my people.
ISA.65.19	The sound of weeping and crying
ISA.65.19	will no longer be heard in her.
ISA.65.20	In her, a nursing infant will no longer live
ISA.65.20	only a few days,
ISA.65.20	or an old man not live out his days.
ISA.65.20	Indeed, the one who dies at a hundred years old
ISA.65.20	will be mourned as a young man,
ISA.65.20	and the one who misses a hundred years
ISA.65.20	will be considered cursed.
ISA.65.21	People will build houses and live in them;
ISA.65.21	they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
ISA.65.22	They will not build and others live in them;
ISA.65.22	they will not plant and others eat.
ISA.65.22	For my people’s lives will be
ISA.65.22	like the lifetime of a tree.
ISA.65.22	My chosen ones will fully enjoy
ISA.65.22	the work of their hands.
ISA.65.23	They will not labor without success
ISA.65.23	or bear children destined for disaster,
ISA.65.23	for they will be a people blessed by the 
ISA.65.23	along with their descendants.
ISA.65.24	Even before they call, I will answer;
ISA.65.24	while they are still speaking, I will hear.
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb will feed together,
ISA.65.25	and the lion will eat straw like cattle,
ISA.65.25	but the serpent’s food will be dust!
ISA.65.25	They will not do what is evil or destroy
ISA.65.25	on my entire holy mountain,”
ISA.65.25	says the 
ISA.66.1	This is what the 
ISA.66.1	Heaven
ISA.66.1	and earth is my footstool.
ISA.66.1	Where could you possibly build a house for me?
ISA.66.1	And where would my resting place be?
ISA.66.2	My hand made all these things,
ISA.66.2	and so they all came into being.
ISA.66.2	This is the 
ISA.66.2	I will look favorably on this kind of person:
ISA.66.2	one who is humble,
ISA.66.2	and trembles at my word.
ISA.66.3	One person slaughters an ox, another kills a person;
ISA.66.3	one person sacrifices a lamb, another breaks a dog’s neck;
ISA.66.3	one person offers a grain offering, another offers pig’s blood;
ISA.66.3	one person offers incense, another praises an idol —
ISA.66.3	all these have chosen their ways
ISA.66.3	and delight in their abhorrent practices.
ISA.66.4	So I will choose their punishment,
ISA.66.4	and I will bring on them what they dread
ISA.66.4	because I called and no one answered;
ISA.66.4	I spoke and they did not listen;
ISA.66.4	they did what was evil in my sight
ISA.66.4	and chose what I did not delight in.
ISA.66.5	You who tremble at his word,
ISA.66.5	hear the word of the 
ISA.66.5	“Your brothers who hate and exclude you
ISA.66.5	for my name’s sake have said,
ISA.66.5	‘Let the 
ISA.66.5	so that we can see your joy!’
ISA.66.5	But they will be put to shame.”
ISA.66.6	A sound of uproar from the city!
ISA.66.6	A voice from the temple —
ISA.66.6	the voice of the 
ISA.66.6	paying back his enemies what they deserve!
ISA.66.7	Before Zion was in labor, she gave birth;
ISA.66.7	before she was in pain, she delivered a boy.
ISA.66.8	Who has heard of such a thing?
ISA.66.8	Who has seen such things?
ISA.66.8	Can a land be born in one day
ISA.66.8	or a nation be delivered in an instant?
ISA.66.8	Yet as soon as Zion was in labor,
ISA.66.8	she gave birth to her sons.
ISA.66.9	“Will I bring a baby to the point of birth
ISA.66.9	and not deliver it?”
ISA.66.9	says the 
ISA.66.9	“or will I who deliver, close the womb?”
ISA.66.9	says your God.
ISA.66.10	Be glad for Jerusalem and rejoice over her,
ISA.66.10	all who love her.
ISA.66.10	Rejoice greatly with her,
ISA.66.10	all who mourn over her —
ISA.66.11	so that you may nurse and be satisfied
ISA.66.11	from her comforting breast
ISA.66.11	and drink deeply and delight yourselves
ISA.66.11	from her glorious breasts.
ISA.66.12	For this is what the 
ISA.66.12	I will make peace flow to her like a river,
ISA.66.12	and the wealth
ISA.66.12	you will nurse and be carried on her hip
ISA.66.12	and bounced on her lap.
ISA.66.13	As a mother comforts her son,
ISA.66.13	so I will comfort you,
ISA.66.13	and you will be comforted in Jerusalem.
ISA.66.14	You will see, you will rejoice,
ISA.66.14	and you
ISA.66.14	then the 
ISA.66.14	but he will show his wrath against his enemies.
ISA.66.15	Look, the 
ISA.66.15	his chariots are like the whirlwind
ISA.66.15	to execute his anger with fury
ISA.66.15	and his rebuke with flames of fire.
ISA.66.16	For the 
ISA.66.16	on all people
ISA.66.16	and many will be slain by the 
ISA.66.17	“Those who dedicate and purify themselves to enter the groves
ISA.66.17	This is the 
ISA.66.18	“Knowing
ISA.66.19	I will establish a sign among them, and I will send survivors from them to the nations — to Tarshish, Put,
ISA.66.20	They will bring all your brothers from all the nations as a gift to the 
ISA.66.21	I will also take some of them as priests and Levites,”
ISA.66.22	“For just as the new heavens and the new earth,
ISA.66.22	which I will make,
ISA.66.22	will remain before me” —
ISA.66.22	this is the 
ISA.66.22	“so your offspring and your name will remain.
ISA.66.23	All mankind will come to worship me
ISA.66.23	from one New Moon to another
ISA.66.23	and from one Sabbath to another,”
ISA.66.23	says the 
ISA.66.24	“As they leave, they will see the dead bodies of those who have rebelled against me;
JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah,
JER.1.2	The word of the 
JER.1.3	It also came throughout the days of Jehoiakim
JER.1.4	The word of the 
JER.1.5	I chose you before I formed you in the womb;
JER.1.5	I set you apart before you were born.
JER.1.5	I appointed you a prophet to the nations.
JER.1.6	But I protested, “Oh no, Lord 
JER.1.7	Then the 
JER.1.7	Do not say, “I am only a youth,”
JER.1.7	for you will go to everyone I send you to
JER.1.7	and speak whatever I tell you.
JER.1.8	Do not be afraid of anyone,
JER.1.8	for I will be with you to rescue you.
JER.1.8	This is the 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.9	I have now filled your mouth with my words.
JER.1.10	See, I have appointed you today
JER.1.10	over nations and kingdoms
JER.1.10	to uproot and tear down,
JER.1.10	to destroy and demolish,
JER.1.10	to build and plant.
JER.1.11	Then the word of the 
JER.1.11	I replied, “I see a branch of an almond tree.”
JER.1.12	The 
JER.1.13	Again the word of the 
JER.1.13	And I replied, “I see a boiling pot,
JER.1.14	Then the 
JER.1.15	Indeed, I am about to summon all the clans and kingdoms of the north.”
JER.1.15	This is the 
JER.1.15	They will come, and each king will set up his throne
JER.1.15	at the entrance to Jerusalem’s gates.
JER.1.15	They will attack all her surrounding walls
JER.1.15	and all the other cities of Judah.
JER.1.16	“I will pronounce my judgments against them for all the evil they did when they abandoned me to burn incense to other gods and to worship the works of their own hands.
JER.1.17	“Now, get ready. Stand up and tell them everything that I command you. Do not be intimidated by them
JER.1.18	Today, I am the one who has made you a fortified city,
JER.1.19	They will fight against you but never prevail over you,
JER.1.19	This is the 
JER.2.1	The word of the 
JER.2.2	“Go and announce directly to Jerusalem that this is what the 
JER.2.2	I remember the loyalty of your youth,
JER.2.2	your love as a bride —
JER.2.2	how you followed me in the wilderness,
JER.2.2	in a land not sown.
JER.2.3	Israel was holy to the 
JER.2.3	the firstfruits of his harvest.
JER.2.3	All who ate of it found themselves guilty;
JER.2.3	disaster came on them.”
JER.2.3	This is the 
JER.2.4	Hear the word of the 
JER.2.4	and all families of the house of Israel.
JER.2.5	This is what the 
JER.2.5	What fault did your fathers find in me
JER.2.5	that they went so far from me,
JER.2.5	followed worthless idols,
JER.2.5	and became worthless themselves?
JER.2.6	They stopped asking, “Where is the 
JER.2.6	who brought us from the land of Egypt,
JER.2.6	who led us through the wilderness,
JER.2.6	through a land of deserts and ravines,
JER.2.6	through a land of drought and darkness,
JER.2.6	a land no one traveled through
JER.2.6	and where no one lived?”
JER.2.7	I brought you to a fertile land
JER.2.7	to eat its fruit and bounty,
JER.2.7	but after you entered, you defiled my land;
JER.2.7	you made my inheritance
JER.2.8	The priests quit asking, “Where is the 
JER.2.8	The experts in the law no longer knew me,
JER.2.8	and the rulers
JER.2.8	The prophets prophesied by
JER.2.8	and followed useless idols.
JER.2.9	Therefore, I will bring a case against you again.
JER.2.9	This is the 
JER.2.9	I will bring a case against your children’s children.
JER.2.10	Cross over to the coasts of Cyprus
JER.2.10	Send someone to Kedar
JER.2.10	see if there has ever been anything like this:
JER.2.11	Has a nation ever exchanged its gods?
JER.2.11	(But they were not gods!
JER.2.11	Yet my people have exchanged their
JER.2.11	for useless idols.
JER.2.12	Be appalled at this, heavens;
JER.2.12	be shocked and utterly desolated!
JER.2.12	This is the 
JER.2.13	For my people have committed a double evil:
JER.2.13	They have abandoned me,
JER.2.13	the fountain of living water,
JER.2.13	and dug cisterns for themselves —  
JER.2.13	cracked cisterns that cannot hold water.
JER.2.14	Is Israel a slave?
JER.2.14	Was he born into slavery?
JER.2.14	Why else has he become a prey?
JER.2.15	The young lions have roared at him;
JER.2.15	they have roared loudly.
JER.2.15	They have laid waste his land.
JER.2.15	His cities are in ruins, without inhabitants.
JER.2.16	The men of Memphis and Tahpanhes
JER.2.16	have also broken your skull.
JER.2.17	Have you not brought this on yourself
JER.2.17	by abandoning the 
JER.2.17	while he was leading you along the way?
JER.2.18	Now what will you gain
JER.2.18	by traveling along the way to Egypt
JER.2.18	to drink the water of the Nile?
JER.2.18	What will you gain
JER.2.18	by traveling along the way to Assyria
JER.2.18	to drink the water of the Euphrates?
JER.2.19	Your own evil will discipline you;
JER.2.19	your own apostasies will reprimand you.
JER.2.19	Recognize
JER.2.19	for you to abandon the 
JER.2.19	and to have no fear of me.
JER.2.19	This is the declaration of the Lord 
JER.2.20	For long ago I
JER.2.20	I
JER.2.20	You insisted, “I will not serve!”
JER.2.20	On every high hill
JER.2.20	and under every green tree
JER.2.20	you lay down like a prostitute.
JER.2.21	I planted you, a choice vine
JER.2.21	from the very best seed.
JER.2.21	How then could you turn into
JER.2.21	a degenerate, foreign vine?
JER.2.22	Even if you wash with lye
JER.2.22	and use a great amount of bleach,
JER.2.22	the stain of your iniquity is still in front of me.
JER.2.22	This is the Lord 
JER.2.23	How can you protest, “I am not defiled;
JER.2.23	I have not followed the Baals”?
JER.2.23	Look at your behavior in the valley;
JER.2.23	acknowledge what you have done.
JER.2.23	You are a swift young camel
JER.2.23	twisting and turning on her way,
JER.2.24	a wild donkey
JER.2.24	She sniffs the wind in the heat of her desire.
JER.2.24	Who can control her passion?
JER.2.24	All who look for her will not become weary;
JER.2.24	they will find her in her mating season.
JER.2.25	Keep your feet from going bare
JER.2.25	and your throat from thirst.
JER.2.25	But you say, “It’s hopeless;
JER.2.25	I love strangers,
JER.2.25	and I will continue to follow them.”
JER.2.26	Like the shame of a thief when he is caught,
JER.2.26	so the house of Israel has been put to shame.
JER.2.26	They, their kings, their officials,
JER.2.26	their priests, and their prophets
JER.2.27	say to a tree, “You are my father,”
JER.2.27	and to a stone, “You gave birth to me.”
JER.2.27	For they have turned their back to me
JER.2.27	and not their face,
JER.2.27	yet in their time of disaster
JER.2.27	“Rise up and save us!”
JER.2.28	But where are your gods you made for yourself?
JER.2.28	Let them rise up and save you
JER.2.28	in your time of disaster if they can,
JER.2.28	for your gods are as numerous as your cities, Judah.
JER.2.29	Why do you bring a case against me?
JER.2.29	All of you have rebelled against me.
JER.2.29	This is the 
JER.2.30	I have struck down your children in vain;
JER.2.30	they would not accept discipline.
JER.2.30	Your own sword has devoured your prophets
JER.2.30	like a ravaging lion.
JER.2.31	Evil generation,
JER.2.31	pay attention to the word of the 
JER.2.31	Have I been a wilderness to Israel
JER.2.31	or a land of dense darkness?
JER.2.31	Why do my people claim,
JER.2.31	“We will go where we want;
JER.2.31	we will no longer come to you”?
JER.2.32	Can a young woman forget her jewelry
JER.2.32	or a bride her wedding sash?
JER.2.32	Yet my people have forgotten me
JER.2.32	for countless days.
JER.2.33	How skillfully you pursue love;
JER.2.33	you also teach evil women your ways.
JER.2.34	Moreover, your skirts are stained
JER.2.34	with the blood of the innocent poor.
JER.2.34	You did not catch them breaking and entering.
JER.2.34	But in spite of all these things
JER.2.35	you claim, “I am innocent.
JER.2.35	His anger is sure to turn away from me.”
JER.2.35	But I will certainly judge you
JER.2.35	because you have said, “I have not sinned.”
JER.2.36	How unstable you are,
JER.2.36	constantly changing your ways!
JER.2.36	You will be put to shame by Egypt
JER.2.36	just as you were put to shame by Assyria.
JER.2.37	Moreover, you will be led out from here
JER.2.37	with your hands on your head
JER.2.37	since the 
JER.2.37	you will not succeed even with their help.
JER.3.1	If
JER.3.1	and she leaves him to marry another,
JER.3.1	can he ever return to her?
JER.3.1	Wouldn’t such a land
JER.3.1	But you!
JER.3.1	You have prostituted yourself with many partners
JER.3.1	can you return to me?
JER.3.1	This is the 
JER.3.2	Look to the barren heights
JER.3.2	Where have you not been immoral?
JER.3.2	You sat waiting for them beside the highways
JER.3.2	like a nomad in the desert.
JER.3.2	You have defiled the land
JER.3.2	with your prostitution and wickedness.
JER.3.3	This is why the showers haven’t come
JER.3.3	why there has been no spring rain.
JER.3.3	You have the brazen look
JER.3.3	and refuse to be ashamed.
JER.3.4	Haven’t you recently called to me, “My Father.
JER.3.4	You were my friend in my youth.
JER.3.5	Will he bear a grudge forever?
JER.3.5	Will he be endlessly infuriated?”
JER.3.5	This is what you have said,
JER.3.5	but you have done the evil things
JER.3.5	you are capable of.
JER.3.6	In the days of King Josiah the 
JER.3.7	I thought, ‘After she has done all these things, she will return to me.’  
JER.3.8	I
JER.3.9	Indifferent to
JER.3.10	Yet in spite of all this, her treacherous sister Judah didn’t return to me with all her heart
JER.3.10	This is the 
JER.3.11	The 
JER.3.12	Go, proclaim these words to the north, and say,
JER.3.12	‘Return, unfaithful Israel.
JER.3.12	This is the 
JER.3.12	I will not look on you with anger,
JER.3.12	for I am unfailing in my love.
JER.3.12	This is the 
JER.3.12	I will not be angry forever.
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge your guilt
JER.3.13	you have rebelled against the 
JER.3.13	You have scattered your favors to strangers
JER.3.13	under every green tree
JER.3.13	and have not obeyed me.
JER.3.13	This is the 
JER.3.14	“‘Return, you faithless children
JER.3.15	I will give you shepherds who are loyal to me,
JER.3.16	When you multiply and increase in the land,
JER.3.17	At that time Jerusalem will be called The 
JER.3.18	In those days the house of Judah will join with the house of Israel,
JER.3.19	I thought, “How I long to make you my sons
JER.3.19	and give you a desirable land,
JER.3.19	the most beautiful inheritance
JER.3.19	I thought, “You will call me ‘My Father’
JER.3.19	and never turn away from me.”
JER.3.20	However, as a woman may betray her lover,
JER.3.20	so you have betrayed
JER.3.20	This is the 
JER.3.21	A sound is heard on the barren heights:
JER.3.21	the children of Israel weeping and begging for mercy,
JER.3.21	for they have perverted their way;
JER.3.21	they have forgotten the 
JER.3.22	Return, you faithless children.
JER.3.22	I will heal your unfaithfulness.
JER.3.22	“Here we are, coming to you,
JER.3.22	for you are the 
JER.3.23	Surely, falsehood comes from the hills,
JER.3.23	commotion from the mountains,
JER.3.23	but the salvation of Israel
JER.3.23	is only in the 
JER.3.24	From the time of our youth
JER.3.24	the shameful one
JER.3.24	what our fathers have worked for —
JER.3.24	their flocks and their herds,
JER.3.24	their sons and their daughters.
JER.3.25	Let us lie down in our shame;
JER.3.25	let our disgrace cover us.
JER.3.25	We have sinned against the 
JER.3.25	both we and our fathers,
JER.3.25	from the time of our youth even to this day.
JER.3.25	We have not obeyed the 
JER.4.1	If you return,
JER.4.1	this is the 
JER.4.1	you will return to me,
JER.4.1	if you remove your abhorrent idols
JER.4.1	from my presence
JER.4.1	and do not waver,
JER.4.2	then you can swear, “As the 
JER.4.2	in truth,
JER.4.2	then the nations will be blessed
JER.4.2	and will pride themselves in him.
JER.4.3	For this is what the 
JER.4.3	Break up the unplowed ground;
JER.4.3	do not sow among the thorns.
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the 
JER.4.4	remove the foreskin of your hearts,
JER.4.4	men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem.
JER.4.4	Otherwise, my wrath will break out like fire
JER.4.4	and burn with no one to extinguish it
JER.4.4	because of your evil deeds.
JER.4.5	Declare in Judah, proclaim in Jerusalem, and say:
JER.4.5	Blow the ram’s horn throughout the land.
JER.4.5	Cry out loudly and say:
JER.4.5	Assemble yourselves,
JER.4.5	and let’s flee to the fortified cities.
JER.4.6	Lift up a signal flag toward Zion.
JER.4.6	Run for cover! Don’t stand still!
JER.4.6	For I am bringing disaster from the north —
JER.4.6	a crushing blow.
JER.4.7	A lion has gone up from his thicket;
JER.4.7	a destroyer of nations has set out.
JER.4.7	He has left his lair
JER.4.7	to make your land a waste.
JER.4.7	Your cities will be reduced to uninhabited ruins.
JER.4.8	Because of this, put on sackcloth;
JER.4.8	mourn and wail,
JER.4.8	for the 
JER.4.8	has not turned away from us.
JER.4.9	“On that day” — this is the 
JER.4.10	I said, “Oh no, Lord 
JER.4.11	“At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, ‘A searing wind
JER.4.12	a wind too strong for this comes at my call.
JER.4.13	Look, he advances like clouds;
JER.4.13	his chariots are like a storm.
JER.4.13	His horses are swifter than eagles.
JER.4.13	Woe to us, for we are ruined!
JER.4.14	Wash the evil from your heart,
JER.4.14	so that you will be delivered.
JER.4.14	How long will you harbor
JER.4.14	malicious thoughts?
JER.4.15	For a voice announces from Dan,
JER.4.15	proclaiming malice from Mount Ephraim.
JER.4.16	Warn the nations: Look!
JER.4.16	Proclaim to Jerusalem:
JER.4.16	Those who besiege are coming
JER.4.16	from a distant land;
JER.4.16	they raise their voices
JER.4.16	against the cities of Judah.
JER.4.17	They have her surrounded
JER.4.17	like those who guard a field,
JER.4.17	because she has rebelled against me.
JER.4.17	This is the 
JER.4.18	Your way and your actions
JER.4.18	have brought this on you.
JER.4.18	This is your punishment. It is very bitter,
JER.4.18	because it has reached your heart!
JER.4.19	My anguish, my anguish!
JER.4.19	Oh, the pain in
JER.4.19	My heart pounds;
JER.4.19	I cannot be silent.
JER.4.19	For you, my soul,
JER.4.19	have heard the sound of the ram’s horn —
JER.4.19	the shout of battle.
JER.4.20	Disaster after disaster
JER.4.20	because the whole land is destroyed.
JER.4.20	Suddenly my tents are destroyed,
JER.4.20	my tent curtains, in a moment.
JER.4.21	How long must I see the signal flag
JER.4.21	and hear the sound of the ram’s horn?
JER.4.22	“For my people are fools;
JER.4.22	they do not know me.
JER.4.22	They are foolish children,
JER.4.22	without understanding.
JER.4.22	They are skilled in doing what is evil,
JER.4.22	but they do not know how to do what is good.”
JER.4.23	I looked at the earth,
JER.4.23	and it was formless and empty.
JER.4.23	I looked to the heavens,
JER.4.23	and their light was gone.
JER.4.24	I looked at the mountains,
JER.4.24	and they were quaking;
JER.4.24	all the hills shook.
JER.4.25	I looked, and there was no human being,
JER.4.25	and all the birds of the sky had fled.
JER.4.26	I looked, and the fertile field
JER.4.26	All its cities were torn down
JER.4.26	because of the 
JER.4.26	and his burning anger.
JER.4.27	For this is what the 
JER.4.27	The whole land will be a desolation,
JER.4.27	but I will not finish it off.
JER.4.28	Because of this, the earth will mourn;
JER.4.28	the skies above will grow dark.
JER.4.28	I have spoken; I have planned,
JER.4.28	and I will not relent or turn back from it.
JER.4.29	Every city flees
JER.4.29	at the sound of the horseman and the archer.
JER.4.29	They enter the thickets
JER.4.29	and climb among the rocks.
JER.4.29	Every city is abandoned;
JER.4.29	no inhabitant is left.
JER.4.30	And you, devastated one, what are you doing
JER.4.30	that you dress yourself in scarlet,
JER.4.30	that you adorn yourself with gold jewelry,
JER.4.30	that you enhance your eyes with makeup?
JER.4.30	You beautify yourself for nothing.
JER.4.30	Your lovers reject you;
JER.4.30	they intend to take your life.
JER.4.31	I hear a cry like a woman in labor,
JER.4.31	a cry of anguish like one bearing her first child.
JER.4.31	The cry of Daughter Zion gasping for breath,
JER.4.31	stretching out her hands:
JER.4.31	“Woe is me, for my life is weary
JER.4.31	because of the murderers!”
JER.5.1	Roam
JER.5.1	Investigate;
JER.5.1	search in her squares.
JER.5.1	If you find one person,
JER.5.1	any who acts justly,
JER.5.1	who pursues faithfulness,
JER.5.1	then I will forgive her.
JER.5.2	When they say, “As the 
JER.5.2	they are swearing falsely.
JER.5.3	You have struck them, but they felt no pain.
JER.5.3	You finished them off,
JER.5.3	but they refused to accept discipline.
JER.5.3	They made their faces harder than rock,
JER.5.3	and they refused to return.
JER.5.4	Then I thought:
JER.5.4	They are just the poor;
JER.5.4	they have been foolish.
JER.5.4	For they don’t understand the way of the 
JER.5.4	the justice of their God.
JER.5.5	I will go to the powerful
JER.5.5	and speak to them.
JER.5.5	Surely they know the way of the 
JER.5.5	the justice of their God.
JER.5.5	However, these also had broken the yoke
JER.5.5	and torn off the chains.
JER.5.6	Therefore, a lion from the forest will strike them down.
JER.5.6	A wolf from arid plains will ravage them.
JER.5.6	A leopard
JER.5.6	Anyone who leaves them will be torn to pieces
JER.5.6	because their rebellious acts are many,
JER.5.6	their unfaithful deeds numerous.
JER.5.7	Why should I forgive you?
JER.5.7	Your children have abandoned me
JER.5.7	and sworn by those who are not gods.
JER.5.7	I satisfied their needs, yet they committed adultery;
JER.5.7	they gashed themselves
JER.5.8	They are well-fed,
JER.5.8	each neighing
JER.5.9	Should I not punish them for these things?
JER.5.9	This is the 
JER.5.9	Should I not avenge myself
JER.5.9	on such a nation as this?
JER.5.10	Go up among her vineyard terraces and destroy them,
JER.5.10	but do not finish them off.
JER.5.10	Prune away her shoots,
JER.5.10	for they do not belong to the 
JER.5.11	They, the house of Israel and the house of Judah,
JER.5.11	have dealt very treacherously with me.
JER.5.11	This is the 
JER.5.12	They have contradicted the 
JER.5.12	and insisted, “It won’t happen.
JER.5.12	Harm won’t come to us;
JER.5.12	we won’t see sword or famine.”
JER.5.13	The prophets become only wind,
JER.5.13	for the 
JER.5.13	This will in fact happen to them.
JER.5.14	Therefore, this is what the Lord 
JER.5.14	Because you have spoken this word,
JER.5.14	I am going to make my words
JER.5.14	become fire in your mouth.
JER.5.14	These people are the wood,
JER.5.14	and the fire will consume them.
JER.5.15	I am about to bring a nation
JER.5.15	from far away against you,
JER.5.15	house of Israel.
JER.5.15	This is the 
JER.5.15	It is an established nation,
JER.5.15	an ancient nation,
JER.5.15	a nation whose language you do not know
JER.5.15	and whose speech you do not understand.
JER.5.16	Their quiver is like an open grave;
JER.5.16	they are all warriors.
JER.5.17	They will consume your harvest and your food.
JER.5.17	They will consume your sons and your daughters.
JER.5.17	They will consume your flocks and your herds.
JER.5.17	They will consume your vines and your fig trees.
JER.5.17	With the sword they will destroy
JER.5.17	your fortified cities
JER.5.18	“But even in those days” — this is the 
JER.5.19	When people ask, ‘For what offense has the 
JER.5.20	“Declare this in the house of Jacob; proclaim it in Judah, saying:
JER.5.21	Hear this,
JER.5.21	you foolish and senseless
JER.5.21	They have eyes, but they don’t see.
JER.5.21	They have ears, but they don’t hear.
JER.5.22	Do you not fear me?
JER.5.22	This is the 
JER.5.22	Do you not tremble before me,
JER.5.22	the one who set the sand as the boundary of the sea,
JER.5.22	an enduring barrier that it cannot cross?
JER.5.22	The waves surge, but they cannot prevail.
JER.5.22	They roar but cannot pass over it.
JER.5.23	But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts.
JER.5.23	They have turned aside and have gone away.
JER.5.24	They have not said to themselves,
JER.5.24	‘Let’s fear the 
JER.5.24	who gives the seasonal rains, both autumn and spring,
JER.5.24	who guarantees to us the fixed weeks of the harvest.’
JER.5.25	Your guilty acts have diverted these things from you.
JER.5.25	Your sins have withheld my bounty from you,
JER.5.26	for wicked men live among my people.
JER.5.26	They watch like hunters
JER.5.26	They set a trap;
JER.5.26	they catch men.
JER.5.27	Like a cage full of birds,
JER.5.27	so their houses are full of deceit.
JER.5.27	Therefore they have grown powerful and rich.
JER.5.28	They have become fat
JER.5.28	They have also excelled in evil matters.
JER.5.28	They have not taken up cases,
JER.5.28	such as the case of the fatherless, so they might prosper,
JER.5.28	and they have not defended the rights of the needy.
JER.5.29	Should I not punish them for these things?
JER.5.29	This is the 
JER.5.29	Should I not avenge myself
JER.5.29	on such a nation as this?
JER.5.30	An appalling, horrible thing
JER.5.30	has taken place in the land.
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesy falsely,
JER.5.31	and the priests rule by their own authority.
JER.5.31	My people love it like this.
JER.5.31	But what will you do at the end of it?
JER.6.1	“Run for cover
JER.6.1	out of Jerusalem, Benjaminites.
JER.6.1	Sound the ram’s horn
JER.6.1	raise a smoke signal
JER.6.1	for disaster threatens from the north,
JER.6.1	even a crushing blow.
JER.6.2	Though she is beautiful and delicate,
JER.6.2	I will destroy
JER.6.3	Shepherds and their flocks will come against her;
JER.6.3	they will pitch their tents all around her.
JER.6.3	Each will pasture his own portion.
JER.6.4	Set them apart for war
JER.6.4	rise up, let’s attack at noon.
JER.6.4	Woe to us, for the day is passing;
JER.6.4	the evening shadows grow long.
JER.6.5	Rise up, let’s attack by night.
JER.6.5	Let us destroy her fortresses.”
JER.6.6	For this is what the 
JER.6.6	Cut down the trees;
JER.6.6	raise a siege ramp against Jerusalem.
JER.6.6	This city must be punished.
JER.6.6	There is nothing but oppression within her.
JER.6.7	As a well gushes out its water,
JER.6.7	so she pours out her evil.
JER.6.7	Violence and destruction
JER.6.7	Sickness and wounds keep coming to my attention.
JER.6.8	Be warned, Jerusalem,
JER.6.8	or I will turn away from you;
JER.6.8	I will make you a desolation,
JER.6.8	a land without inhabitants.
JER.6.9	This is what the 
JER.6.9	Glean the remnant of Israel
JER.6.9	as thoroughly as a vine.
JER.6.9	Pass your hand once more like a grape gatherer
JER.6.9	over the branches.
JER.6.10	Who can I speak to and give such a warning
JER.6.10	that they will listen?
JER.6.10	Look, their ear is uncircumcised,
JER.6.10	so they cannot pay attention.
JER.6.10	See, the word of the 
JER.6.10	they find no pleasure in it.
JER.6.11	But I am full of the 
JER.6.11	I am tired of holding it back.
JER.6.11	Pour it out on the children in the street,
JER.6.11	on the gathering of young men as well.
JER.6.11	For both husband and wife will be captured,
JER.6.11	the old with the very old.
JER.6.12	Their houses will be turned over to others,
JER.6.12	their fields and wives as well,
JER.6.12	for I will stretch out my hand
JER.6.12	against the inhabitants of the land.
JER.6.12	This is the 
JER.6.13	For from the least to the greatest of them,
JER.6.13	everyone is making profit dishonestly.
JER.6.13	From prophet to priest,
JER.6.13	everyone deals falsely.
JER.6.14	They have treated my people’s brokenness superficially,
JER.6.14	claiming, “Peace, peace,”
JER.6.14	when there is no peace.
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed when they acted so detestably?
JER.6.15	They weren’t at all ashamed.
JER.6.15	They can no longer feel humiliation.
JER.6.15	Therefore, they will fall among the fallen.
JER.6.15	When I punish them, they will collapse,
JER.6.15	says the 
JER.6.16	This is what the 
JER.6.16	Stand by the roadways and look.
JER.6.16	Ask about the ancient paths,
JER.6.16	“Which is the way to what is good?”
JER.6.16	Then take it
JER.6.16	and find rest for yourselves.
JER.6.16	But they protested, “We won’t!”
JER.6.17	I appointed watchmen over you
JER.6.17	and said, “Listen for the sound of the ram’s horn.”
JER.6.17	But they protested, “We won’t listen!”
JER.6.18	Therefore listen, you nations
JER.6.18	and you witnesses,
JER.6.18	learn what the charge is against them.
JER.6.19	Listen, earth!
JER.6.19	I am about to bring disaster on these people,
JER.6.19	the fruit of their own plotting,
JER.6.19	for they have paid no attention to my words.
JER.6.19	They have rejected my instruction.
JER.6.20	What use to me is frankincense from Sheba
JER.6.20	or sweet cane
JER.6.20	Your burnt offerings are not acceptable;
JER.6.20	your sacrifices do not please me.
JER.6.21	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.6.21	I am going to place stumbling blocks before these people;
JER.6.21	fathers and sons together will stumble over them;
JER.6.21	friends and neighbors will also perish.
JER.6.22	This is what the 
JER.6.22	Look,
JER.6.22	a great nation will be stirred up
JER.6.22	from the remote regions of the earth.
JER.6.23	They grasp bow and javelin.
JER.6.23	They are cruel and show no mercy.
JER.6.23	Their voice roars like the sea,
JER.6.23	and they ride on horses,
JER.6.23	lined up like men in battle formation
JER.6.23	against you, Daughter Zion.
JER.6.24	We have heard about it,
JER.6.24	and our hands have become weak.
JER.6.24	Distress has seized us —
JER.6.24	pain, like a woman in labor.
JER.6.25	Don’t go out to the fields;
JER.6.25	don’t walk on the road.
JER.6.25	For the enemy has a sword;
JER.6.25	terror is on every side.
JER.6.26	My dear
JER.6.26	and roll in the dust.
JER.6.26	Mourn as you would for an only son,
JER.6.26	a bitter lament,
JER.6.26	for suddenly the destroyer
JER.6.27	I have appointed you to be an assayer among my people —
JER.6.27	a refiner
JER.6.27	so you may know and assay their way of life.
JER.6.28	All are stubborn rebels
JER.6.28	spreading slander.
JER.6.28	They are bronze and iron;
JER.6.28	all of them are corrupt.
JER.6.29	The bellows blow,
JER.6.29	blasting the lead with fire.
JER.6.29	The refining is completely in vain;
JER.6.29	the evil ones are not separated out.
JER.6.30	They are called rejected silver,
JER.6.30	for the 
JER.7.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.7.2	“Stand in the gate of the house of the 
JER.7.3	“‘This is what the 
JER.7.4	Do not trust deceitful words, chanting, “This is the temple of the 
JER.7.5	Instead, if you really correct your ways and your actions, if you act justly toward one another,
JER.7.6	if you no longer oppress the resident alien, the fatherless, and the widow
JER.7.7	I will allow you to live in this place, the land I gave to your ancestors
JER.7.8	But look, you keep trusting in deceitful words that cannot help.
JER.7.9	“‘Do you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear falsely, burn incense to Baal, and follow other gods that you have not known?
JER.7.10	Then do you come and stand before me in this house
JER.7.11	Has this house, which bears my name, become a den of robbers
JER.7.11	This is the 
JER.7.12	“‘But return to my place that was at Shiloh, where I made my name dwell at first.
JER.7.13	Now, because you have done all these things — this is the 
JER.7.14	what I did to Shiloh I will do to the house that bears my name
JER.7.15	I will banish you from my presence, just as I banished all of your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.’  
JER.7.16	“As for you, do not pray for these people.
JER.7.17	Don’t you see how they behave in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The sons gather wood, the fathers light the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the queen of heaven,
JER.7.19	But are they really provoking me?” 
JER.7.20	Therefore, this is what the Lord 
JER.7.21	This is what the 
JER.7.22	for when I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I did not speak with them
JER.7.23	However, I did give them this command: ‘Obey me, and then I will be your God, and you will be my people. Follow every way I command you so that it may go well with you.’  
JER.7.24	Yet they didn’t listen or pay attention
JER.7.25	Since the day your ancestors came out of the land of Egypt until today, I have sent all my servants the prophets
JER.7.26	However, my people wouldn’t listen to me or pay attention but became obstinate;
JER.7.27	“When you speak all these things to them, they will not listen to you. When you call to them, they will not answer you. 
JER.7.28	Therefore, declare to them, ‘This is the nation that would not listen to the 
JER.7.29	Cut off the hair of your sacred vow
JER.7.30	“For the Judeans have done what is evil in my sight.” This is the 
JER.7.31	They have built the high places of Topheth
JER.7.32	“Therefore, look, the days are coming”
JER.7.33	The corpses of these people will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land, with no one to scare them away.
JER.7.34	I will remove from the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem the sound of joy and gladness and the voices of the groom and the bride,
JER.8.1	“At that time” — this is the 
JER.8.2	They will be exposed
JER.8.3	Death will be chosen over life
JER.8.4	“You are to say to them: This is what the 
JER.8.4	Do people fall and not get up again?
JER.8.4	If they turn away, do they not return?
JER.8.5	Why have these people turned away?
JER.8.5	Why is Jerusalem always turning away?
JER.8.5	They take hold of deceit;
JER.8.5	they refuse to return.
JER.8.6	I have paid careful attention.
JER.8.6	They do not speak what is right.
JER.8.6	No one regrets his evil,
JER.8.6	asking, ‘What have I done?’
JER.8.6	Everyone has stayed his course
JER.8.6	like a horse rushing into battle.
JER.8.7	Even storks in the sky
JER.8.7	know their seasons.
JER.8.7	Turtledoves, swallows, and cranes
JER.8.7	are aware of their migration,
JER.8.7	but my people do not know
JER.8.7	the requirements of the 
JER.8.8	“How can you claim, ‘We are wise;
JER.8.8	the law of the 
JER.8.8	In fact, the lying pen of scribes
JER.8.8	has produced falsehood.
JER.8.9	The wise will be put to shame;
JER.8.9	they will be dismayed and snared.
JER.8.9	They have rejected the word of the 
JER.8.9	so what wisdom do they really have?
JER.8.10	Therefore, I will give
JER.8.10	their fields to new occupants,
JER.8.10	for from the least to the greatest,
JER.8.10	everyone is making profit dishonestly.
JER.8.10	From prophet to priest,
JER.8.10	everyone deals falsely.
JER.8.11	They have treated the brokenness
JER.8.11	of my dear
JER.8.11	claiming, ‘Peace, peace,’
JER.8.11	when there is no peace.
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed when they acted so detestably?
JER.8.12	They weren’t at all ashamed.
JER.8.12	They can no longer feel humiliation.
JER.8.12	Therefore, they will fall among the fallen.
JER.8.12	When I punish them, they will collapse,”
JER.8.12	says the 
JER.8.13	I will gather them and bring them to an end.
JER.8.13	This is the 
JER.8.13	There will be no grapes on the vine,
JER.8.13	no figs on the fig tree,
JER.8.13	and even the leaf will wither.
JER.8.13	Whatever I have given them will be lost to them.
JER.8.14	Why are we just sitting here?
JER.8.14	Gather together; let us enter the fortified cities
JER.8.14	and perish there,
JER.8.14	for the 
JER.8.14	He has given us poisoned water to drink,
JER.8.14	because we have sinned against the 
JER.8.15	We hoped for peace, but there was nothing good;
JER.8.15	for a time of healing, but there was only terror.
JER.8.16	From Dan, the snorting of horses is heard.
JER.8.16	At the sound of the neighing of mighty steeds,
JER.8.16	the whole land quakes.
JER.8.16	They come to devour the land and everything in it,
JER.8.16	the city and all its residents.
JER.8.17	Indeed, I am about to send snakes among you,
JER.8.17	poisonous vipers
JER.8.17	They will bite you.
JER.8.17	This is the 
JER.8.18	My joy has flown away;
JER.8.18	grief has settled on me.
JER.8.18	My heart is sick.
JER.8.19	Listen — the cry of my dear people
JER.8.19	from a faraway land,
JER.8.19	“Is the 
JER.8.19	her King not within her?”
JER.8.19	Why have they angered me
JER.8.19	with their carved images,
JER.8.19	with their worthless foreign idols?
JER.8.20	Harvest has passed, summer has ended,
JER.8.20	but we have not been saved.
JER.8.21	I am broken by the brokenness
JER.8.21	of my dear people.
JER.8.21	I mourn; horror has taken hold of me.
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead?
JER.8.22	Is there no physician there?
JER.8.22	So why has the healing of my dear people
JER.8.22	not come about?
JER.9.1	If my head were a flowing spring,
JER.9.1	my eyes a fountain of tears,
JER.9.1	I would weep day and night
JER.9.1	over the slain of my dear
JER.9.2	If only I had a traveler’s lodging place
JER.9.2	in the wilderness,
JER.9.2	I would abandon my people
JER.9.2	and depart from them,
JER.9.2	for they are all adulterers,
JER.9.2	a solemn assembly of treacherous people.
JER.9.3	They bent their tongues like their bows;
JER.9.3	lies and not faithfulness prevail in the land,
JER.9.3	for they proceed from one evil to another,
JER.9.3	and they do not take me into account.
JER.9.3	This is the 
JER.9.4	Everyone has to be on guard against his friend.
JER.9.4	Don’t trust any brother,
JER.9.4	for every brother will certainly deceive,
JER.9.4	and every friend spread slander.
JER.9.5	Each one betrays his friend;
JER.9.5	no one tells the truth.
JER.9.5	They have taught their tongues to speak lies;
JER.9.5	they wear themselves out doing wrong.
JER.9.6	You live in a world of deception.
JER.9.6	In their deception they refuse to know me.
JER.9.6	This is the 
JER.9.7	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.9.7	I am about to refine them and test them,
JER.9.7	for what else can I do
JER.9.7	because of my dear
JER.9.8	Their tongues are deadly arrows —
JER.9.8	they speak deception.
JER.9.8	With his mouth
JER.9.8	one speaks peaceably with his friend,
JER.9.8	but inwardly he sets up an ambush.
JER.9.9	Should I not punish them for these things?
JER.9.9	This is the 
JER.9.9	Should I not avenge myself
JER.9.9	on such a nation as this?
JER.9.10	I will raise weeping and a lament
JER.9.10	over the mountains,
JER.9.10	a dirge over the wilderness grazing land,
JER.9.10	for they have been so scorched
JER.9.10	that no one passes through.
JER.9.10	The sound of cattle is no longer heard.
JER.9.10	From the birds of the sky to the animals,
JER.9.10	everything has fled — they have gone away.
JER.9.11	I will make Jerusalem a heap of rubble,
JER.9.11	a jackals’ den.
JER.9.11	I will make the cities of Judah a desolation,
JER.9.11	an uninhabited place.
JER.9.12	Who is the person wise enough to understand this?
JER.9.13	The 
JER.9.14	Instead, they followed the stubbornness of their hearts
JER.9.15	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them among the nations
JER.9.17	This is what the 
JER.9.17	Consider, and summon the women who mourn;
JER.9.17	send for the skillful women.
JER.9.18	Let them come quickly to raise a lament over us
JER.9.18	so that our eyes may overflow with tears,
JER.9.18	our eyelids be soaked with weeping.
JER.9.19	For a sound of lamentation is heard from Zion:
JER.9.19	How devastated we are.
JER.9.19	We are greatly ashamed,
JER.9.19	for we have abandoned the land;
JER.9.19	our dwellings have been torn down.
JER.9.20	Now hear the word of the 
JER.9.20	Pay attention to
JER.9.20	Teach your daughters a lament
JER.9.20	and one another a dirge,
JER.9.21	for Death
JER.9.21	it has entered our fortresses,
JER.9.21	cutting off children from the streets,
JER.9.21	young men from the squares.
JER.9.22	“Speak as follows: ‘This is what the 
JER.9.23	“‘This is what the 
JER.9.23	The wise person should not boast in his wisdom;
JER.9.23	the strong should not boast in his strength;
JER.9.23	the wealthy should not boast in his wealth.
JER.9.24	But the one who boasts should boast in this:
JER.9.24	that he understands and knows me
JER.9.24	that I am the 
JER.9.24	justice, and righteousness on the earth,
JER.9.24	for I delight in these things.
JER.9.24	This is the 
JER.9.25	“‘Look, the days are coming — this is the 
JER.9.26	Egypt, Judah, Edom, the Ammonites, Moab, and all the inhabitants of the desert who clip the hair on their temples.
JER.10.1	Hear the word that the 
JER.10.2	This is what the 
JER.10.2	Do not learn the way of the nations
JER.10.2	or be terrified by signs in the heavens,
JER.10.2	although the nations are terrified by them,
JER.10.3	for the customs of the peoples are worthless.
JER.10.3	Someone cuts down a tree from the forest;
JER.10.3	it is worked by the hands of a craftsman with a chisel.
JER.10.4	He decorates it with silver and gold.
JER.10.4	It is fastened with hammer and nails,
JER.10.4	so it won’t totter.
JER.10.5	Like scarecrows in a cucumber patch,
JER.10.5	their idols cannot speak.
JER.10.5	They must be carried
JER.10.5	Do not fear them for they can do no harm
JER.10.5	and they cannot do any good.
JER.10.6	You are great;
JER.10.6	your name is great in power.
JER.10.7	Who should not fear you,
JER.10.7	King of the nations?
JER.10.7	It is what you deserve.
JER.10.7	For among all the wise people of the nations
JER.10.7	and among all their kingdoms,
JER.10.7	there is no one like you.
JER.10.8	They are both stupid and foolish,
JER.10.8	instructed by worthless idols
JER.10.8	made of wood!
JER.10.9	Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish
JER.10.9	and gold from Uphaz.
JER.10.9	The work of a craftsman
JER.10.9	and of a goldsmith’s hands
JER.10.9	is clothed in blue and purple,
JER.10.9	all the work of skilled artisans.
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.10	he is the living God
JER.10.10	The earth quakes at his wrath,
JER.10.10	and the nations cannot endure his rage.
JER.10.11	You are to say this to them: “The gods that did not make the heavens
JER.10.12	He made the earth by his power,
JER.10.12	established the world
JER.10.12	and spread out the heavens by his understanding.
JER.10.13	When he thunders,
JER.10.13	the waters in the heavens are in turmoil,
JER.10.13	and he causes the clouds to rise
JER.10.13	from the ends of the earth.
JER.10.13	He makes lightning for the rain
JER.10.13	and brings the wind from his storehouses.
JER.10.14	Everyone is stupid and ignorant.
JER.10.14	Every goldsmith is put to shame
JER.10.14	by his carved image,
JER.10.14	for his cast images are a lie;
JER.10.14	there is no breath in them.
JER.10.15	They are worthless, a work to be mocked.
JER.10.15	At the time of their punishment
JER.10.15	they will be destroyed.
JER.10.16	Jacob’s Portion
JER.10.16	because he is the one who formed all things.
JER.10.16	Israel is the tribe of his inheritance;
JER.10.16	the 
JER.10.17	Gather up your belongings
JER.10.17	you who live under siege.
JER.10.18	For this is what the 
JER.10.18	Look, I am flinging away
JER.10.18	the land’s residents at this time
JER.10.18	and bringing them such distress
JER.10.18	that they will feel it.
JER.10.19	Woe to me because of my brokenness —
JER.10.19	I am severely wounded!
JER.10.19	I exclaimed, “This is my intense suffering,
JER.10.19	but I must bear it.”
JER.10.20	My tent is destroyed;
JER.10.20	all my tent cords are snapped.
JER.10.20	My sons have departed from me and are no more.
JER.10.20	I have no one to pitch my tent again
JER.10.20	or to hang up my curtains.
JER.10.21	For the shepherds are stupid:
JER.10.21	They don’t seek the 
JER.10.21	Therefore they have not prospered,
JER.10.21	and their whole flock is scattered.
JER.10.22	Listen! A noise — it is coming —
JER.10.22	a great commotion
JER.10.22	The cities of Judah will be made desolate,
JER.10.22	a jackals’ den.
JER.10.23	I know, 
JER.10.23	that a person’s way of life is not his own;
JER.10.23	no one who walks determines his own steps.
JER.10.24	Discipline me, 
JER.10.24	not in your anger,
JER.10.24	or you will reduce me to nothing.
JER.10.25	Pour out your wrath on the nations
JER.10.25	that don’t recognize you
JER.10.25	and on the families
JER.10.25	that don’t call on your name,
JER.10.25	for they have consumed Jacob;
JER.10.25	they have consumed him and finished him off
JER.10.25	and made his homeland desolate.
JER.11.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.11.2	“Listen to the words of this covenant
JER.11.3	Tell them, ‘This is what the 
JER.11.4	which I commanded your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt,
JER.11.5	in order to establish the oath I swore to your ancestors,
JER.11.5	I answered, “Amen, 
JER.11.6	The 
JER.11.7	For I strongly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of the land of Egypt until today, warning them time and time again,
JER.11.8	Yet they would not obey or pay attention; each one followed the stubbornness of his evil heart.
JER.11.9	The 
JER.11.10	They have returned to the iniquities of their fathers
JER.11.11	“Therefore, this is what the 
JER.11.12	Then the cities of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods they have been burning incense to, but they certainly will not save them in their time of disaster.
JER.11.13	Your gods are indeed as numerous as your cities, Judah,
JER.11.14	“As for you, do not pray for these people. Do not raise up a cry or a prayer on their behalf,
JER.11.15	What right does my beloved have
JER.11.15	to be in my house,
JER.11.15	having carried out so many evil schemes?
JER.11.15	Can holy meat
JER.11.15	so you can celebrate?
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.16	a flourishing olive tree,
JER.11.16	beautiful with well-formed fruit.
JER.11.16	He has set fire to it,
JER.11.16	and its branches are consumed
JER.11.16	with the sound of a mighty tumult.
JER.11.17	“The 
JER.11.18	The 
JER.11.18	Then you helped me to see their deeds,
JER.11.19	for I was like a docile
JER.11.19	I didn’t know that they had devised plots against me:
JER.11.19	“Let’s destroy the tree with its fruit;
JER.11.19	let’s cut him off from the land of the living
JER.11.19	so that his name will no longer be remembered.”
JER.11.20	But, 
JER.11.20	who tests
JER.11.20	let me see your vengeance on them,
JER.11.20	for I have presented my case to you.
JER.11.21	Therefore, here is what the 
JER.11.22	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.11.23	They will have no remnant, for I will bring disaster on the people of Anathoth
JER.12.1	You will be righteous, 
JER.12.1	even if I bring a case against you.
JER.12.1	Yet, I wish to contend with you:
JER.12.1	Why does the way of the wicked prosper?
JER.12.1	Why do all the treacherous live at ease?
JER.12.2	You planted them,
JER.12.2	They have grown and produced fruit.
JER.12.2	You are ever on their lips,
JER.12.2	but far from their conscience.
JER.12.3	As for you, 
JER.12.3	You test whether my heart is with you.
JER.12.3	Drag the wicked away like sheep to slaughter
JER.12.3	and set them apart for the day of killing.
JER.12.4	How long will the land mourn
JER.12.4	and the grass of every field wither?
JER.12.4	Because of the evil of its residents,
JER.12.4	animals and birds have been swept away,
JER.12.4	for the people have said,
JER.12.4	“He cannot see what our end will be.”
JER.12.5	If you have raced with runners
JER.12.5	and they have worn you out,
JER.12.5	how can you compete with horses?
JER.12.5	If you stumble
JER.12.5	what will you do in the thickets of the Jordan?
JER.12.6	Even your brothers — your own father’s family —
JER.12.6	even they were treacherous to you;
JER.12.6	even they have cried out loudly after you.
JER.12.6	Do not have confidence in them,
JER.12.6	though they speak well of you.
JER.12.7	I have abandoned my house;
JER.12.7	I have deserted my inheritance.
JER.12.7	I have handed the love of my life
JER.12.7	over to her enemies.
JER.12.8	My inheritance has behaved toward me
JER.12.8	like a lion in the forest.
JER.12.8	She has roared against me.
JER.12.8	Therefore, I hate her.
JER.12.9	Is my inheritance like a hyena
JER.12.9	Are birds of prey circling her?
JER.12.9	Go, gather all the wild animals;
JER.12.9	bring them to devour her.
JER.12.10	Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard;
JER.12.10	they have trampled my plot of land.
JER.12.10	They have turned my desirable plot
JER.12.10	into a desolate wasteland.
JER.12.11	They have made it a desolation.
JER.12.11	It mourns, desolate, before me.
JER.12.11	All the land is desolate,
JER.12.11	but no one takes it to heart.
JER.12.12	Over all the barren heights in the wilderness
JER.12.12	the destroyers have come,
JER.12.12	for the 
JER.12.12	from one end of the earth to the other.
JER.12.12	No one has peace.
JER.12.13	They have sown wheat but harvested thorns.
JER.12.13	They have exhausted themselves but have no profit.
JER.12.13	Be put to shame by your harvests
JER.12.13	because of the 
JER.12.14	This is what the 
JER.12.15	After I have uprooted them, I will once again have compassion
JER.12.16	If they will diligently learn the ways of my people
JER.12.17	However, if they will not obey, then I will uproot and destroy that nation.”
JER.12.17	This is the 
JER.13.1	This is what the 
JER.13.2	So I bought underwear as the 
JER.13.3	Then the word of the 
JER.13.4	“Take the underwear that you bought and are wearing,
JER.13.5	So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the 
JER.13.6	A long time later the 
JER.13.7	So I went to the Euphrates and dug up the underwear and got it from the place where I had hidden it, but it was ruined — of no use at all.
JER.13.8	Then the word of the 
JER.13.9	“This is what the 
JER.13.10	These evil people, who refuse to listen to me, who follow the stubbornness of their own hearts,
JER.13.11	Just as underwear clings to one’s waist, so I fastened the whole house of Israel and of Judah to me”
JER.13.12	“Say this to them: ‘This is what the 
JER.13.13	And you will say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.13.14	I will smash them against each other, fathers and sons alike — this is the 
JER.13.15	Listen and pay attention. Do not be proud,
JER.13.15	for the 
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.16	before he brings darkness,
JER.13.16	before your feet stumble
JER.13.16	on the mountains at dusk.
JER.13.16	You wait for light,
JER.13.16	but he brings darkest gloom
JER.13.16	and makes total darkness.
JER.13.17	But if you will not listen,
JER.13.17	my innermost being will weep in secret
JER.13.17	because of your pride.
JER.13.17	My eyes will overflow with tears,
JER.13.17	for the 
JER.13.18	Say to the king and the queen mother:
JER.13.18	Take a humble seat,
JER.13.18	for your glorious crowns
JER.13.18	have fallen from your heads.
JER.13.19	The cities of the Negev are under siege;
JER.13.19	no one can help them.
JER.13.19	All of Judah has been taken into exile,
JER.13.19	taken completely into exile.
JER.13.20	Look up and see
JER.13.20	those coming from the north.
JER.13.20	Where is the flock entrusted to you,
JER.13.20	the sheep that were your pride?
JER.13.21	What will you say when he appoints
JER.13.21	close friends as leaders over you,
JER.13.21	ones you yourself trained?
JER.13.21	Won’t labor pains seize you,
JER.13.21	as they do a woman in labor?
JER.13.22	And when you ask yourself,
JER.13.22	“Why have these things happened to me?”
JER.13.22	it is because of your great guilt
JER.13.22	that your skirts have been stripped off,
JER.13.22	your body exposed.
JER.13.23	Can the Cushite change his skin,
JER.13.23	or a leopard his spots?
JER.13.23	If so, you might be able to do what is good,
JER.13.23	you who are instructed in evil.
JER.13.24	I will scatter you
JER.13.24	before the desert wind.
JER.13.25	This is your lot,
JER.13.25	what I have decreed for you —
JER.13.25	this is the 
JER.13.25	because you have forgotten me
JER.13.25	and trusted in lies.
JER.13.26	I will pull your skirts up over your face
JER.13.26	so that your shame might be seen.
JER.13.27	Your adulteries and your lustful neighing,
JER.13.27	your depraved prostitution
JER.13.27	on the hills, in the fields —
JER.13.27	I have seen your abhorrent acts.
JER.13.27	Woe to you, Jerusalem!
JER.13.27	You are unclean —
JER.13.27	for how long yet?
JER.14.1	This is the word of the 
JER.14.2	Judah mourns;
JER.14.2	her city gates languish.
JER.14.2	Her people are on the ground in mourning;
JER.14.2	Jerusalem’s cry rises up.
JER.14.3	Their nobles send their servants
JER.14.3	They go to the cisterns;
JER.14.3	they find no water;
JER.14.3	their containers return empty.
JER.14.3	They are ashamed and humiliated;
JER.14.3	they cover their heads.
JER.14.4	The ground is cracked
JER.14.4	since no rain has fallen on the land.
JER.14.4	The farmers are ashamed;
JER.14.4	they cover their heads.
JER.14.5	Even the doe in the field
JER.14.5	gives birth and abandons her fawn
JER.14.5	since there is no grass.
JER.14.6	Wild donkeys stand on the barren heights
JER.14.6	panting for air like jackals.
JER.14.6	Their eyes fail
JER.14.6	because there are no green plants.
JER.14.7	Though our iniquities testify against us,
JER.14.7	Indeed, our rebellions
JER.14.7	we have sinned against you.
JER.14.8	Hope of Israel,
JER.14.8	its Savior in time of distress,
JER.14.8	why are you like a resident alien in the land,
JER.14.8	like a traveler stopping only for the night?
JER.14.9	Why are you like a helpless man,
JER.14.9	like a warrior unable to save?
JER.14.9	Yet you are among us, 
JER.14.9	and we bear your name.
JER.14.9	Don’t leave us!
JER.14.10	This is what the 
JER.14.10	Truly they love to wander;
JER.14.10	they never rest their feet.
JER.14.10	So the 
JER.14.10	Now he will remember their iniquity
JER.14.10	and punish their sins.
JER.14.11	Then the 
JER.14.12	If they fast, I will not hear their cry of despair. If they offer burnt offering and grain offering, I will not accept them. Rather, I will finish them off by sword, famine, and plague.”
JER.14.13	And I replied, “Oh no, Lord 
JER.14.14	But the 
JER.14.15	“Therefore, this is what the 
JER.14.16	The people they are prophesying to will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. There will be no one to bury them
JER.14.17	You are to speak this word to them:
JER.14.17	Let my eyes overflow with tears;
JER.14.17	day and night may they not stop,
JER.14.17	for the virgin daughter of my people
JER.14.17	has been destroyed by a crushing blow,
JER.14.17	an extremely severe wound.
JER.14.18	If I go out to the field,
JER.14.18	look — those slain by the sword!
JER.14.18	If I enter the city,
JER.14.18	look — those ill
JER.14.18	For both prophet and priest
JER.14.18	travel to a land they do not know.
JER.14.19	Have you completely rejected Judah?
JER.14.19	Do you detest
JER.14.19	Why do you strike us
JER.14.19	with no hope of healing for us?
JER.14.19	We hoped for peace,
JER.14.19	but there was nothing good;
JER.14.19	for a time of healing,
JER.14.19	but there was only terror.
JER.14.20	We acknowledge our wickedness, 
JER.14.20	the iniquity of our fathers;
JER.14.20	indeed, we have sinned against you.
JER.14.21	For your name’s sake, don’t despise us.
JER.14.21	Don’t disdain your glorious throne.
JER.14.21	Remember your covenant
JER.14.21	do not break it.
JER.14.22	Can any of the worthless idols of the nations
JER.14.22	Or can the skies alone give showers?
JER.14.22	Are you not the 
JER.14.22	We therefore put our hope in you,
JER.14.22	for you have done all these things.
JER.15.1	Then the 
JER.15.2	If they ask you, ‘Where will we go? ’ tell them: This is what the 
JER.15.2	Those destined for death,
JER.15.2	those destined for the sword, to the sword.
JER.15.2	Those destined for famine, to famine;
JER.15.2	those destined for captivity, to captivity.
JER.15.3	“I will ordain four kinds
JER.15.4	I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh
JER.15.5	Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem?
JER.15.5	Who will show sympathy toward you?
JER.15.5	Who will turn aside
JER.15.5	to ask about your well-being?
JER.15.6	You have left me.”
JER.15.6	This is the 
JER.15.6	“You have turned your back,
JER.15.6	so I have stretched out my hand against you
JER.15.6	and destroyed you.
JER.15.6	I am tired
JER.15.7	I scattered them with a winnowing fork
JER.15.7	at the city gates of the land.
JER.15.7	I made them childless; I destroyed my people.
JER.15.7	They would not turn from their ways.
JER.15.8	I made their widows more numerous
JER.15.8	than the sand of the seas.
JER.15.8	I brought a destroyer at noon
JER.15.8	against the mother of young men.
JER.15.8	I suddenly released on her
JER.15.8	agitation and terrors.
JER.15.9	The mother of seven grew faint;
JER.15.9	she breathed her last breath.
JER.15.9	Her sun set while it was still day;
JER.15.9	she was ashamed and humiliated.
JER.15.9	The rest of them I will give over to the sword
JER.15.9	in the presence of their enemies.”
JER.15.9	This is the 
JER.15.10	Woe is me, my mother,
JER.15.10	that you gave birth to me,
JER.15.10	a man who incites dispute and conflict
JER.15.10	in all the land.
JER.15.10	I did not lend or borrow,
JER.15.10	yet everyone curses me.
JER.15.11	The 
JER.15.11	Haven’t I set you loose for your good?
JER.15.11	Haven’t I punished you
JER.15.11	in a time of trouble,
JER.15.11	in a time of distress with the enemy?
JER.15.12	Can anyone smash iron,
JER.15.12	iron from the north, or bronze?
JER.15.13	I will give up your wealth
JER.15.13	and your treasures as plunder,
JER.15.13	without cost,
JER.15.13	in all your borders.
JER.15.14	Then I will make you serve your enemies
JER.15.14	in a land you do not know,
JER.15.14	for my anger will kindle a fire
JER.15.14	that will burn against you.
JER.15.15	You know,
JER.15.15	remember me and take note of me.
JER.15.15	Avenge me against my persecutors.
JER.15.15	In your patience,
JER.15.15	Know that I suffer disgrace for your honor.
JER.15.16	Your words were found, and I ate them.
JER.15.16	Your words became a delight to me
JER.15.16	and the joy of my heart,
JER.15.16	for I bear your name,
JER.15.17	I never sat with the band of revelers,
JER.15.17	and I did not celebrate with them.
JER.15.17	Because your hand was on me, I sat alone,
JER.15.17	for you filled me with indignation.
JER.15.18	Why has my pain become unending,
JER.15.18	my wound incurable,
JER.15.18	refusing to be healed?
JER.15.18	You truly have become like a mirage to me —
JER.15.18	water that is not reliable.
JER.15.19	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.15.19	If you return, I will take you back;
JER.15.19	you will stand in my presence.
JER.15.19	And if you speak noble words,
JER.15.19	rather than worthless ones,
JER.15.19	you will be my spokesman.
JER.15.19	It is they who must return to you;
JER.15.19	you must not return to them.
JER.15.20	Then I will make you a fortified wall of bronze
JER.15.20	to this people.
JER.15.20	They will fight against you
JER.15.20	but will not overcome you,
JER.15.20	for I am with you
JER.15.20	to save you and rescue you.
JER.15.20	This is the 
JER.15.21	I will rescue you from the power of evil people
JER.15.21	and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless.
JER.16.1	The word of the 
JER.16.2	“Do not marry or have sons or daughters in this place. 
JER.16.3	For this is what the 
JER.16.4	They will die from deadly diseases. They will not be mourned or buried but will be like manure on the soil’s surface.
JER.16.5	“For this is what the 
JER.16.6	“Both great and small will die in this land without burial. No lament will be made for them, nor will anyone cut himself or
JER.16.7	Food won’t be provided for the mourner
JER.16.8	Do not enter the house where feasting is taking place to sit with them to eat and drink. 
JER.16.9	For this is what the 
JER.16.10	“When you tell these people all these things, they will say to you, ‘Why has the 
JER.16.11	Then you will answer them, ‘Because your fathers abandoned me
JER.16.12	You did more evil than your fathers.
JER.16.13	So I will hurl you from this land into a land that you and your fathers are not familiar with.
JER.16.14	“However, look, the days are coming”
JER.16.15	but rather, ‘As the 
JER.16.16	“I am about to send for many fishermen”
JER.16.17	for my gaze takes in all their ways.
JER.16.18	I will first repay them double for their iniquity
JER.16.19	my refuge in a time of distress,
JER.16.19	the nations will come to you
JER.16.19	from the ends of the earth, and they will say,
JER.16.19	“Our fathers inherited only lies,
JER.16.19	worthless idols
JER.16.20	Can one make gods for himself?
JER.16.20	But they are not gods.
JER.16.21	“Therefore, I am about to inform them,
JER.16.21	and this time I will make them know
JER.16.21	my power and my might;
JER.16.21	then they will know that my name is the 
JER.17.1	The sin of Judah is inscribed
JER.17.1	with an iron stylus.
JER.17.1	With a diamond point
JER.17.1	it is engraved on the tablet of their hearts
JER.17.1	and on the horns of their
JER.17.2	while their children remember their altars
JER.17.2	and their Asherah poles, by the green trees
JER.17.2	on the high hills  
JER.17.3	my mountains in the countryside.
JER.17.3	I will give up your wealth
JER.17.3	and all your treasures as plunder
JER.17.3	because of the sin of your high places
JER.17.3	in all your borders.
JER.17.4	You will, on your own, relinquish your inheritance
JER.17.4	that I gave you.
JER.17.4	I will make you serve your enemies
JER.17.4	in a land you do not know,
JER.17.4	for you have set my anger on fire;
JER.17.4	it will burn forever.
JER.17.5	This is what the 
JER.17.5	Cursed is the person who trusts in mankind.
JER.17.5	He makes human flesh his strength,
JER.17.5	and his heart turns from the 
JER.17.6	He will be like a juniper in the Arabah;
JER.17.6	he cannot see when good comes
JER.17.6	but dwells in the parched places in the wilderness,
JER.17.6	in a salt land where no one lives.
JER.17.7	The person who trusts in the 
JER.17.7	whose confidence indeed is the 
JER.17.8	He will be like a tree planted by water:
JER.17.8	it sends its roots out toward a stream,
JER.17.8	it doesn’t fear when heat comes,
JER.17.8	and its foliage remains green.
JER.17.8	It will not worry in a year of drought
JER.17.8	or cease producing fruit.
JER.17.9	The heart is more deceitful than anything else,
JER.17.9	and incurable — who can understand it?
JER.17.10	I, the 
JER.17.10	I test the heart
JER.17.10	to give to each according to his way,
JER.17.10	according to what his actions deserve.
JER.17.11	He who makes a fortune unjustly
JER.17.11	is like a partridge that hatches eggs it didn’t lay.
JER.17.11	In the middle of his life
JER.17.11	his riches will abandon him,
JER.17.11	so in the end he will be a fool.
JER.17.12	A glorious throne
JER.17.12	on high
JER.17.12	is the place of our sanctuary.
JER.17.13	all who abandon you
JER.17.13	will be put to shame.
JER.17.13	All who turn away from me
JER.17.13	will be written in the dirt,
JER.17.13	for they have abandoned
JER.17.13	the 
JER.17.14	Heal me, 
JER.17.14	save me, and I will be saved,
JER.17.14	for you are my praise.
JER.17.15	Hear how they keep challenging me,
JER.17.15	“Where is the word of the 
JER.17.15	Let it come!”
JER.17.16	But I have not run away from being your shepherd,
JER.17.16	and I have not longed for the fatal day.
JER.17.16	You know my words were spoken in your presence.
JER.17.17	Don’t become a terror to me.
JER.17.17	You are my refuge
JER.17.18	Let my persecutors be put to shame,
JER.17.18	but don’t let me be put to shame.
JER.17.18	Let them be terrified, but don’t let me be terrified.
JER.17.18	Bring on them the day of disaster;
JER.17.18	shatter them with total
JER.17.19	This is what the 
JER.17.20	Announce to them, ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.17.21	This is what the 
JER.17.22	Do not carry a load out of your houses on the Sabbath day or do any work,
JER.17.23	They wouldn’t listen or pay attention but became obstinate,
JER.17.24	“‘However, if you listen to me — this is the 
JER.17.25	kings and princes will enter through the gates of this city. They will sit on the throne of David;
JER.17.26	Then people will come from the cities of Judah and from the area around Jerusalem, from the land of Benjamin and from the Judean foothills, from the hill country and from the Negev
JER.17.27	But if you do not listen to me to keep the Sabbath day holy by not carrying a load while entering the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, I will set fire to its gates,
JER.18.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.18.2	“Go down at once to the potter’s house;
JER.18.3	So I went down to the potter’s house, and there he was, working away at the wheel.
JER.18.4	But the jar that he was making from the clay became flawed in the potter’s hand, so he made it into another jar, as it seemed right for him to do.
JER.18.5	The word of the 
JER.18.6	“House of Israel, can I not treat you as this potter treats his clay?” — this is the 
JER.18.7	At one moment I might announce concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will uproot, tear down, and destroy it.
JER.18.8	However, if that nation about which I have made the announcement turns from its evil, I will relent concerning the disaster I had planned to do to it.
JER.18.9	At another time I might announce concerning a nation or a kingdom that I will build and plant it.
JER.18.10	However, if it does what is evil in my sight by not listening to me, I will relent concerning the good I had said I would do to it.
JER.18.11	So now, say to the men of Judah and to the residents of Jerusalem, ‘This is what the 
JER.18.12	But they will say, ‘It’s hopeless.
JER.18.13	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.18.13	Ask among the nations,
JER.18.13	who has heard things like these?
JER.18.13	Virgin Israel has done a most horrible thing.
JER.18.14	Does the snow of Lebanon ever leave the highland crags?
JER.18.14	Or does cold water flowing from a distance ever fail?
JER.18.15	Yet my people have forgotten me.
JER.18.15	They burn incense to worthless idols
JER.18.15	that make them stumble in their ways
JER.18.15	on the ancient roads,
JER.18.15	and make them walk on new paths, not the highway.
JER.18.16	They have made their land a horror,
JER.18.16	a perpetual object of scorn;
JER.18.16	all who pass by it will be appalled
JER.18.16	and shake their heads.
JER.18.17	I will scatter them before the enemy like the east wind.
JER.18.17	I will show them
JER.18.17	on the day of their calamity.
JER.18.18	Then certain ones said, “Come, let’s make plans against Jeremiah,
JER.18.19	Pay attention to me, 
JER.18.19	Hear what my opponents are saying!
JER.18.20	Should good be repaid with evil?
JER.18.20	Yet they have dug a pit for me.
JER.18.20	Remember how I stood before you
JER.18.20	to speak good on their behalf,
JER.18.20	to turn your anger from them.
JER.18.21	Therefore, hand their children over to famine,
JER.18.21	and give them over to the power of the sword.
JER.18.21	Let their wives become childless and widowed,
JER.18.21	their husbands slain by deadly disease,
JER.18.21	their young men struck down by the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses
JER.18.22	when you suddenly bring raiders against them,
JER.18.22	for they have dug a pit to capture me
JER.18.22	and have hidden snares for my feet.
JER.18.23	But you, 
JER.18.23	all their deadly plots against me.
JER.18.23	Do not wipe out their iniquity;
JER.18.23	do not blot out their sin before you.
JER.18.23	Let them be forced to stumble before you;
JER.18.23	deal with them in the time of your anger.
JER.19.1	This is what the 
JER.19.2	and go out to Ben Hinnom Valley
JER.19.3	Say, ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.19.4	because they have abandoned me
JER.19.5	They have built high places to Baal on which to burn their children in the fire as burnt offerings to Baal, something I have never commanded or mentioned; I never entertained the thought.
JER.19.6	“‘Therefore, look, the days are coming
JER.19.7	I will spoil the plans of Judah and Jerusalem in this place. I will make them fall by the sword before their enemies, by the hand of those who intend to take their life. I will provide their corpses as food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land.
JER.19.8	I will make this city desolate, an object of scorn. Everyone who passes by it will be appalled and scoff because of all its wounds.
JER.19.9	I will make them eat the flesh of their sons and their daughters, and they will eat each other’s flesh in the distressing siege inflicted on them by their enemies who intend to take their life.’
JER.19.10	“Then you are to shatter the jar in the presence of the people going with you, 
JER.19.11	and you are to proclaim to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.19.12	That is what I will do to this place — this is the declaration of the 
JER.19.13	The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will become impure like that place Topheth — all the houses on whose rooftops they have burned incense to all the stars in the sky
JER.19.14	Jeremiah returned from Topheth, where the 
JER.19.15	“This is what the 
JER.20.1	Pashhur the priest,
JER.20.2	So Pashhur had the prophet Jeremiah beaten and put him in the stocks
JER.20.3	The next day, when Pashhur released Jeremiah from the stocks, Jeremiah said to him, “The 
JER.20.4	for this is what the 
JER.20.5	I will give away all the wealth
JER.20.6	As for you, Pashhur, and all who live in your house, you will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon.
JER.20.7	You deceived
JER.20.7	You seized me and prevailed.
JER.20.7	I am a laughingstock all the time;
JER.20.7	everyone ridicules me.
JER.20.8	For whenever I speak, I cry out,
JER.20.8	I proclaim, “Violence and destruction!” 
JER.20.8	so the word of the 
JER.20.8	constant disgrace and derision.
JER.20.9	I say, “I won’t mention him
JER.20.9	or speak any longer in his name.”
JER.20.9	But his message becomes a fire burning in my heart,
JER.20.9	shut up in my bones.
JER.20.9	I become tired of holding it in,
JER.20.9	and I cannot prevail.
JER.20.10	For I have heard the gossip of many people,
JER.20.10	“Terror is on every side!
JER.20.10	Report him; let’s report him!”
JER.20.10	Everyone I trusted
JER.20.10	“Perhaps he will be deceived
JER.20.10	so that we might prevail against him
JER.20.10	and take our vengeance on him.”
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.11	Therefore, my persecutors will stumble and not prevail.
JER.20.11	Since they have not succeeded, they will be utterly shamed,
JER.20.11	an everlasting humiliation that will never be forgotten.
JER.20.12	and seeing the heart
JER.20.12	let me see your vengeance on them,
JER.20.12	for I have presented my case to you.
JER.20.13	Sing to the 
JER.20.13	Praise the 
JER.20.13	for he rescues the life of the needy
JER.20.13	from evil people.
JER.20.14	May the day I was born
JER.20.14	be cursed.
JER.20.14	May the day my mother bore me
JER.20.14	never be blessed.
JER.20.15	May the man be cursed
JER.20.15	who brought the news to my father, saying,
JER.20.15	“A male child is born to you,”
JER.20.15	bringing him great joy.
JER.20.16	Let that man be like the cities
JER.20.16	the 
JER.20.16	Let him hear an outcry in the morning
JER.20.16	and a war cry at noontime
JER.20.17	because he didn’t kill me in the womb
JER.20.17	so that my mother might have been my grave,
JER.20.17	her womb eternally pregnant.
JER.20.18	Why did I come out of the womb
JER.20.18	to see only struggle and sorrow,
JER.20.18	to end my life in shame?
JER.21.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.21.2	“Inquire of the 
JER.21.3	But Jeremiah answered, “This is what you are to say to Zedekiah: 
JER.21.4	‘This is what the 
JER.21.5	I myself will fight against you
JER.21.6	I will strike the residents of this city, both people and animals. They will die in a severe plague. 
JER.21.7	Afterward — this is the 
JER.21.8	“But tell this people, ‘This is what the 
JER.21.9	Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, famine, and plague, but whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live and will retain his life like the spoils of war.
JER.21.10	For I have set my face against this city to bring disaster and not good
JER.21.11	“And to the house of the king of Judah say this: ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.21.12	House of David, this is what the 
JER.21.12	Administer justice every morning,
JER.21.12	and rescue the victim of robbery
JER.21.12	from his oppressor,
JER.21.12	or my anger will flare up like fire
JER.21.12	and burn unquenchably
JER.21.12	because of your evil deeds.
JER.21.13	Beware! I am against you,
JER.21.13	you who sit above the valley,
JER.21.13	you atop the rocky plateau —
JER.21.13	this is the 
JER.21.13	you who say, “Who can come down against us?
JER.21.13	Who can enter our hiding places?”
JER.21.14	I will punish you according to what you have done
JER.21.14	this is the 
JER.21.14	I will kindle a fire in your forest
JER.21.14	that will consume everything around it.’”
JER.22.1	This is what the 
JER.22.2	You are to say, ‘Hear the word of the 
JER.22.3	This is what the 
JER.22.4	For if you conscientiously carry out this word, then kings sitting on David’s throne will enter through the gates of this palace
JER.22.5	But if you do not obey these words, then I swear by myself
JER.22.6	For this is what the 
JER.22.6	“You are like Gilead
JER.22.6	or the summit of Lebanon,
JER.22.6	but I will certainly turn you into a wilderness,
JER.22.6	uninhabited cities.
JER.22.7	I will set apart destroyers
JER.22.7	each with his weapons.
JER.22.7	They will cut down the choicest of your cedars
JER.22.7	and throw them into the fire.
JER.22.8	“Many nations will pass by this city and ask one another, ‘Why did the 
JER.22.9	They will answer, ‘Because they abandoned the covenant
JER.22.10	Do not weep for the dead;
JER.22.10	do not mourn for him.
JER.22.10	Weep bitterly for the one who has gone away,
JER.22.10	for he will never return again
JER.22.10	and see his native land.
JER.22.11	For this is what the 
JER.22.12	but he will die in the place where they deported him, never seeing this land again.”
JER.22.13	Woe for the one who builds his palace
JER.22.13	through unrighteousness,
JER.22.13	his upstairs rooms through injustice,
JER.22.13	who makes his neighbor serve without pay
JER.22.13	and will not give him his wages,
JER.22.14	who says, “I will build myself a massive palace,
JER.22.14	with spacious upstairs rooms.”
JER.22.14	He will cut windows
JER.22.14	and it will be paneled with cedar
JER.22.14	and painted bright red.
JER.22.15	Are you a king because you excel in cedar?
JER.22.15	Didn’t your father eat and drink
JER.22.15	and administer justice and righteousness?
JER.22.15	Then it went well with him.
JER.22.16	He took up the case of the poor and needy;
JER.22.16	then it went well.
JER.22.16	Is this not what it means to know me?
JER.22.16	This is the 
JER.22.17	But you have eyes and a heart for nothing
JER.22.17	except your own dishonest profit,
JER.22.17	shedding innocent blood
JER.22.17	and committing extortion and oppression.
JER.22.18	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.22.18	They will not mourn for him, saying,
JER.22.18	“Woe, my brother!” or “Woe, my sister!”
JER.22.18	They will not mourn for him, saying,
JER.22.18	“Woe, lord! Woe, his majesty!”
JER.22.19	He will be buried like a donkey,
JER.22.19	dragged off and thrown
JER.22.19	outside Jerusalem’s gates.
JER.22.20	Go up to Lebanon and cry out;
JER.22.20	raise your voice in Bashan;
JER.22.20	cry out from Abarim,
JER.22.20	for all your lovers
JER.22.21	I spoke to you when you were secure.
JER.22.21	You said, “I will not listen.”
JER.22.21	This has been your way since youth;
JER.22.21	indeed, you have never listened to me.
JER.22.22	The wind will take charge of
JER.22.22	and your lovers will go into captivity.
JER.22.22	Then you will be ashamed and humiliated
JER.22.22	because of all your evil.
JER.22.23	You residents of Lebanon,
JER.22.23	nestled among the cedars,
JER.22.23	how you will groan
JER.22.23	agony like a woman in labor.
JER.22.24	“As I live” — this is the 
JER.22.25	In fact, I will hand you over to those you dread,
JER.22.26	I will hurl you and the mother who gave birth
JER.22.27	They will never return to the land they long to return to.”
JER.22.28	Is this man Coniah a despised, shattered pot,
JER.22.28	a jar no one wants?
JER.22.28	Why are he and his descendants hurled out
JER.22.28	and cast into a land they have not known?
JER.22.29	Earth, earth, earth,
JER.22.29	hear the word of the 
JER.22.30	This is what the 
JER.22.30	Record this man as childless,
JER.22.30	a man who will not be successful in his lifetime.
JER.22.30	None of his descendants will succeed
JER.22.30	in sitting on the throne of David
JER.22.30	or ruling again in Judah.
JER.23.1	“Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!” 
JER.23.2	“Therefore, this is what the 
JER.23.3	“I will gather the remnant of my flock from all the lands where I have banished them,
JER.23.4	I will raise up shepherds over them who will tend them.
JER.23.5	“Look, the days are coming”
JER.23.5	“when I will raise up a Righteous Branch for David.
JER.23.5	He will reign wisely as king
JER.23.5	and administer justice and righteousness in the land.
JER.23.6	In his days Judah will be saved,
JER.23.6	and Israel will dwell securely.
JER.23.6	This is the name he will be called:
JER.23.6	The 
JER.23.7	“Look, the days are coming”
JER.23.8	but, ‘As the 
JER.23.9	Concerning the prophets:
JER.23.9	My heart is broken within me,
JER.23.9	and all my bones tremble.
JER.23.9	I have become like a drunkard,
JER.23.9	like a man overcome by wine,
JER.23.9	because of the 
JER.23.9	because of his holy words.
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers;
JER.23.10	the land mourns
JER.23.10	and the grazing lands in the wilderness have dried up.
JER.23.10	Their way of life
JER.23.10	and their power is not rightly used
JER.23.11	because both prophet and priest are ungodly,
JER.23.11	even in my house
JER.23.11	This is the 
JER.23.12	Therefore, their way will seem
JER.23.12	like slippery paths in the gloom.
JER.23.12	They will be driven away and fall down there,
JER.23.12	for I will bring disaster on them,
JER.23.12	the year of their punishment.
JER.23.12	This is the 
JER.23.13	Among the prophets of Samaria
JER.23.13	I saw something disgusting:
JER.23.13	They prophesied by Baal
JER.23.13	and led my people Israel astray.
JER.23.14	Among the prophets of Jerusalem also
JER.23.14	I saw a horrible thing:
JER.23.14	They commit adultery and walk in lies.
JER.23.14	They strengthen the hands of evildoers,
JER.23.14	and none turns his back on evil.
JER.23.14	They are all like Sodom
JER.23.14	Jerusalem’s residents are like Gomorrah.
JER.23.15	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.23.15	I am about to feed them wormwood
JER.23.15	and give them poisoned water to drink,
JER.23.15	for from the prophets of Jerusalem
JER.23.15	ungodliness
JER.23.16	This is what the 
JER.23.17	They keep on saying to those who despise me,
JER.23.18	For who has stood in the council
JER.23.18	to see and hear his word?
JER.23.18	Who has paid attention to his word and obeyed?
JER.23.19	Look, a storm from the 
JER.23.19	Wrath has gone out,
JER.23.19	a whirling storm.
JER.23.19	It will whirl about the heads of the wicked.
JER.23.20	The 
JER.23.20	until he has completely fulfilled the purposes of his heart.
JER.23.20	In time to come you will understand it clearly.
JER.23.21	I did not send out these prophets,
JER.23.21	yet they ran.
JER.23.21	I did not speak to them,
JER.23.21	yet they prophesied.
JER.23.22	If they had really stood in my council,
JER.23.22	they would have enabled my people to hear my words
JER.23.22	and would have turned them from their evil ways
JER.23.22	and their evil deeds.
JER.23.23	“Am I a God who is only near”
JER.23.24	Can a person hide in secret places where I cannot see him?” 
JER.23.25	“I have heard what the prophets who prophesy a lie in my name have said: ‘I had a dream! I had a dream! ’ 
JER.23.26	How long will this continue in the minds of the prophets prophesying lies, prophets of the deceit of their own minds? 
JER.23.27	Through their dreams that they tell one another, they plan to cause my people to forget my name as their fathers forgot my name through Baal worship.
JER.23.28	The prophet who has only a dream should recount the dream, but the one who has my word should speak my word truthfully, for what is straw compared to grain?” — this is the 
JER.23.29	“Is not my word like fire” — this is the 
JER.23.30	Therefore, take note! I am against the prophets”
JER.23.31	I am against the prophets” — the 
JER.23.32	I am against those who prophesy false dreams”
JER.23.33	“Now when these people or a prophet or a priest asks you, ‘What is the burden
JER.23.34	As for the prophet, priest, or people who say, ‘The burden of the 
JER.23.35	This is what each man is to say to his friend and to his brother: ‘What has the 
JER.23.36	But no longer refer to
JER.23.37	Say to the prophet, ‘What has the 
JER.23.38	But if you say, ‘The burden of the 
JER.23.39	I will surely forget you.
JER.23.40	I will bring on you everlasting disgrace and humiliation
JER.24.1	After King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had deported Jeconiah
JER.24.2	One basket contained very good figs, like early figs,
JER.24.3	The 
JER.24.3	I said, “Figs! The good figs are very good, but the bad figs are extremely bad, so bad they are inedible.”
JER.24.4	The word of the 
JER.24.5	“This is what the 
JER.24.6	I will keep my eyes on them for their good
JER.24.7	I will give them a heart to know me,
JER.24.8	“But as for the bad figs, so bad they are inedible,
JER.24.9	I will make them an object of horror
JER.24.10	I will send the sword, famine, and plague
JER.25.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim
JER.25.2	The prophet Jeremiah spoke concerning all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem as follows: 
JER.25.3	“From the thirteenth year of Josiah son of Amon,
JER.25.4	The 
JER.25.5	He announced, ‘Turn, each of you, from your evil way of life and from your evil deeds.
JER.25.6	Do not follow other gods to serve them and to bow in worship to them,
JER.25.7	“‘But you have not obeyed me’ — this is the 
JER.25.8	“Therefore, this is what the 
JER.25.9	I am going to send for all the families of the north’
JER.25.10	I will eliminate the sound of joy and gladness from them — the voice of the groom and the bride,
JER.25.11	This whole land will become a desolate ruin, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
JER.25.12	When the seventy years are completed, I will punish the king of Babylon and that nation’ — this is the 
JER.25.13	I will bring on that land all my words I have spoken against it, all that is written in this book that Jeremiah prophesied against all the nations. 
JER.25.14	For many nations and great kings will enslave them, and I will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands.’”
JER.25.15	This is what the 
JER.25.16	They will drink, stagger,
JER.25.17	So I took the cup from the 
JER.25.18	Jerusalem and the other cities of Judah, its kings and its officials, to make them a desolate ruin, an example for scorn and cursing — as it is today;
JER.25.19	Pharaoh king of Egypt, his officers, his leaders, all his people,
JER.25.20	and all the mixed peoples;
JER.25.20	all the kings of the land of Uz;
JER.25.20	all the kings of the land of the Philistines — Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the remnant of Ashdod;
JER.25.21	Edom, Moab, and the Ammonites;
JER.25.22	all the kings of Tyre,
JER.25.22	all the kings of Sidon,
JER.25.22	and the kings of the coasts and islands;
JER.25.23	Dedan, Tema, Buz, and all those who clip the hair on their temples;
JER.25.24	all the kings of Arabia,
JER.25.24	and all the kings of the mixed peoples who have settled in the desert;
JER.25.25	all the kings of Zimri,
JER.25.25	all the kings of Elam,
JER.25.25	and all the kings of Media;
JER.25.26	all the kings of the north, both near and far from one another;
JER.25.26	that is, all the kingdoms of the world throughout the earth.
JER.25.26	Finally, the king of Sheshach
JER.25.27	“Then you are to say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.25.28	If
JER.25.29	For I am already bringing disaster
JER.25.30	“As for you, you are to prophesy all these things to them, and say to them:
JER.25.30	The 
JER.25.30	he makes his voice heard from his holy dwelling.
JER.25.30	He roars loudly over his grazing land;
JER.25.30	he calls out with a shout, like those who tread grapes,
JER.25.30	against all the inhabitants of the earth.
JER.25.31	The tumult reaches to the ends of the earth
JER.25.31	because the 
JER.25.31	He enters into judgment with all people.
JER.25.31	As for the wicked, he hands them over to the sword —
JER.25.31	this is the 
JER.25.32	“This is what the 
JER.25.32	Pay attention! Disaster spreads
JER.25.32	from nation to nation.
JER.25.32	A huge storm is stirred up
JER.25.32	from the ends of the earth.”
JER.25.33	Those slain by the 
JER.25.34	Wail, you shepherds, and cry out.
JER.25.34	Roll in the dust,
JER.25.34	Because the days of your slaughter have come,
JER.25.34	you will fall and become shattered like a precious vase.
JER.25.35	Flight will be impossible for the shepherds,
JER.25.35	and escape, for the leaders of the flock.
JER.25.36	Hear the sound of the shepherds’ cry,
JER.25.36	the wail of the leaders of the flock,
JER.25.36	for the 
JER.25.37	Peaceful grazing land will become lifeless
JER.25.37	because of the 
JER.25.38	He has left his den like a lion,
JER.25.38	for their land has become a desolation
JER.25.38	because of the sword
JER.25.38	because of his burning anger.
JER.26.1	At the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim
JER.26.2	“This is what the 
JER.26.3	Perhaps they will listen and turn — each from his evil way of life — so that I might relent
JER.26.4	You are to say to them, ‘This is what the 
JER.26.5	and by listening to the words of my servants the prophets
JER.26.6	I will make this temple like Shiloh.
JER.26.7	The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the temple of the 
JER.26.8	When he finished the address the 
JER.26.9	How dare you prophesy in the name of the 
JER.26.10	When the officials of Judah heard about these things, they went from the king’s palace to the 
JER.26.11	Then the priests and prophets said to the officials and all the people, “This man deserves the death sentence because he has prophesied against this city, as you have heard with your own ears.”
JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people, “The 
JER.26.13	So now, correct your ways and deeds,
JER.26.14	As for me, here I am in your hands; do to me what you think is good and right. 
JER.26.15	But know for certain that if you put me to death, you will bring innocent blood
JER.26.16	Then the officials and all the people told the priests and prophets, “This man doesn’t deserve the death sentence, for he has spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	Some of the elders of the land stood up
JER.26.18	“Micah the Moreshite
JER.26.18	Zion will be plowed like a field,
JER.26.18	Jerusalem will become ruins,
JER.26.18	and the temple’s mountain will be a high thicket.’
JER.26.19	Did King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah put him to death? Did not the king fear the 
JER.26.20	Another man was also prophesying in the name of the 
JER.26.21	King Jehoiakim, all his warriors, and all the officials heard his words, and the king tried to put him to death. When Uriah heard, he fled in fear and went to Egypt. 
JER.26.22	But King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt: Elnathan son of Achbor
JER.26.23	They brought Uriah out of Egypt and took him to King Jehoiakim, who executed him with the sword and threw his corpse into the burial place of the common people.
JER.26.24	But Ahikam
JER.27.1	At the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah
JER.27.2	This is what the 
JER.27.3	Send word to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon
JER.27.4	Command them to go to their masters, saying, ‘This is what the 
JER.27.5	“By my great strength and outstretched arm,
JER.27.6	So now I have placed all these lands under the authority of my servant
JER.27.7	All nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until the time for his own land comes, and then many nations and great kings will enslave him.
JER.27.8	“‘“As for the nation or kingdom that does not serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and does not place its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation I will punish by sword, famine, and plague — this is the 
JER.27.9	So you should not listen to your prophets, diviners,
JER.27.10	They are prophesying a lie
JER.27.11	But as for the nation that will put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, I will leave it in its own land, and that nation will cultivate
JER.27.12	I spoke to King Zedekiah of Judah
JER.27.13	Why should you and your people die
JER.27.14	Do not listen to the words of the prophets who are telling you, ‘Don’t serve the king of Babylon,’ for they are prophesying a lie to you.
JER.27.15	‘I have not sent them’ — this is the 
JER.27.16	Then I spoke to the priests and all these people, saying, “This is what the 
JER.27.17	Do not listen to them. Serve the king of Babylon and live! Why should this city become a ruin?
JER.27.18	If they are indeed prophets and if the word of the

JER.27.20	those King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon did not take when he deported Jeconiah
JER.27.21	Yes, this is what the 
JER.27.22	‘They will be taken to Babylon and will remain there until I attend to them again.’
JER.28.1	In that same year, at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah,
JER.28.2	“This is what the 
JER.28.3	Within two years I will restore to this place all the articles of the 
JER.28.4	And I will restore to this place Jeconiah
JER.28.5	The prophet Jeremiah replied to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and all the people who were standing in the temple of the 
JER.28.6	The prophet Jeremiah said, “Amen!
JER.28.7	Only listen to this message I am speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people. 
JER.28.8	The prophets who preceded you and me from ancient times prophesied war, disaster,
JER.28.9	As for the prophet who prophesies peace — only when the word of the prophet comes true will the prophet be recognized as one the 
JER.28.10	The prophet Hananiah then took the yoke bar from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah and broke it.
JER.28.11	In the presence of all the people Hananiah proclaimed, “This is what the 
JER.28.12	After the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke bar from the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the 
JER.28.13	“Go say to Hananiah, ‘This is what the

JER.29.1	This is the text of the letter
JER.29.2	This was after King Jeconiah,
JER.29.3	He sent the letter with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah,
JER.29.4	This is what the 
JER.29.5	“Build houses and live in them.
JER.29.6	Find wives for yourselves, and have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons and give your daughters to men in marriage so that they may bear sons and daughters. Multiply there; do not decrease.

JER.29.8	For this is what the 
JER.29.9	for they are prophesying falsely to you in my name. I have not sent them.”
JER.29.10	For this is what the 
JER.29.11	For I know the plans I have for you”
JER.29.12	You will call to me and come and pray to me, and I will listen to you.
JER.29.13	You will seek me
JER.29.14	I will be found by you” — this is the 
JER.29.15	You have said, “The 
JER.29.16	But this is what the 
JER.29.17	This is what the 
JER.29.18	I will pursue them with sword, famine, and plague. I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth — a curse and a desolation, an object of scorn and a disgrace among all the nations
JER.29.19	I will do this because they have not listened to my words” — this is the 
JER.29.20	Hear the word of the 
JER.29.21	This is what the 
JER.29.22	Based on what happens to them, all the exiles of Judah who are in Babylon will create a curse
JER.29.23	because they have committed an outrage

JER.29.25	“This is what the 
JER.29.26	‘The 
JER.29.27	So now, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth who has been acting like a prophet among you?
JER.29.28	For he has sent word to us in Babylon, claiming, “The exile will be long. Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat their produce.”’ ” 
JER.29.29	The priest Zephaniah read this letter in the hearing of the prophet Jeremiah.
JER.29.30	Then the word of the 
JER.29.31	“Send a message to all the exiles, saying, ‘This is what the 
JER.29.32	this is what the

JER.30.3	for look, the days are coming” — this is the 
JER.30.4	These are the words the 
JER.30.5	This is what the 
JER.30.5	We have heard a cry of terror,
JER.30.5	of dread — there is no peace.
JER.30.6	Ask and see
JER.30.6	whether a male can give birth.
JER.30.6	Why then do I see every man
JER.30.6	with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor
JER.30.6	and every face turned pale?
JER.30.7	How awful that day will be!
JER.30.7	There will be no other like it!
JER.30.7	It will be a time of trouble for Jacob,
JER.30.7	but he will be saved out of it.
JER.30.8	On that day —
JER.30.8	this is the declaration of the 
JER.30.8	I will break his yoke from your neck
JER.30.8	and tear off your chains,

JER.30.9	They will serve the 
JER.30.9	and David their king,
JER.30.9	whom I will raise up for them.
JER.30.10	As for you, my servant Jacob,
JER.30.10	do not be afraid —
JER.30.10	this is the 
JER.30.10	and do not be discouraged, Israel,
JER.30.10	for without fail I will save you out of a distant place,
JER.30.10	your descendants, from the land of their captivity!
JER.30.10	Jacob will return and have calm and quiet
JER.30.10	with no one to frighten him.
JER.30.11	For I will be with you —
JER.30.11	this is the 
JER.30.11	to save you!
JER.30.11	I will bring destruction on all the nations
JER.30.11	where I have scattered you;
JER.30.11	however, I will not bring destruction on you.
JER.30.11	I will discipline you justly,
JER.30.11	and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
JER.30.12	For this is what the 
JER.30.12	Your injury is incurable;
JER.30.12	your wound most severe.
JER.30.13	You have no defender for your case.
JER.30.13	There is no remedy for your sores,
JER.30.13	and no healing for you.
JER.30.14	All your lovers have forgotten you;
JER.30.14	they no longer look for you,
JER.30.14	for I have struck you as an enemy would,
JER.30.14	with the discipline
JER.30.14	because of your enormous guilt
JER.30.14	and your innumerable sins.
JER.30.15	Why do you cry out about your injury?
JER.30.15	Your pain has no cure!
JER.30.15	I have done these things to you
JER.30.15	because of your enormous guilt
JER.30.15	and your innumerable sins.
JER.30.16	Nevertheless, all who devoured you will be devoured,
JER.30.16	and all your adversaries — all of them —
JER.30.16	will go off into exile.
JER.30.16	Those who plunder you will be plundered,
JER.30.16	and all who raid you will be raided.
JER.30.17	But I will bring you health
JER.30.17	and will heal you of your wounds —
JER.30.17	this is the 
JER.30.17	for they call you Outcast,
JER.30.17	Zion whom no one cares about.
JER.30.18	This is what the 
JER.30.18	I will certainly restore the fortunes
JER.30.18	and show compassion
JER.30.18	Every city will be rebuilt on its mound;
JER.30.18	every citadel will stand on its proper site.
JER.30.19	Thanksgiving will come out of them,
JER.30.19	a sound of rejoicing.
JER.30.19	I will multiply them, and they will not decrease;
JER.30.19	I will honor them, and they will not be insignificant.
JER.30.20	His children will be as in past days;
JER.30.20	his congregation will be established in my presence.
JER.30.20	I will punish all his oppressors.
JER.30.21	Jacob’s leader will be one of them;
JER.30.21	his ruler will issue from him.
JER.30.21	I will invite him to me, and he will approach me,
JER.30.21	for who would otherwise risk his life to approach me?
JER.30.21	This is the 
JER.30.22	You will be my people,
JER.30.22	and I will be your God.
JER.30.23	Look, a storm from the 
JER.30.23	Wrath has gone out,
JER.30.23	a churning storm.
JER.30.23	It will whirl about the heads of the wicked.
JER.30.24	The 
JER.30.24	until he has completely fulfilled the purposes of his heart.
JER.30.24	In time to come you will understand it.
JER.31.1	“At that time” — this is the 
JER.31.2	This is what the 
JER.31.2	The people who survived the sword
JER.31.2	found favor in the wilderness.
JER.31.2	When Israel went to find rest,
JER.31.3	the 
JER.31.3	I have loved you with an everlasting love;
JER.31.3	therefore, I have continued to extend faithful love to you.
JER.31.4	Again I will build you so that you will be rebuilt,
JER.31.4	Virgin Israel.
JER.31.4	You will take up your tambourines again
JER.31.4	and go out in joyful dancing.
JER.31.5	You will plant vineyards again
JER.31.5	on the mountains of Samaria;
JER.31.5	the planters will plant and will enjoy the fruit.
JER.31.6	For there will be a day when watchmen will call out
JER.31.6	in the hill country of Ephraim,
JER.31.6	“Come, let’s go up to Zion,
JER.31.6	to the 
JER.31.7	For this is what the 
JER.31.7	Sing with joy for Jacob;
JER.31.7	shout for the foremost of the nations!
JER.31.7	Proclaim, praise, and say,
JER.31.7	“
JER.31.7	the remnant of Israel!” 
JER.31.8	Watch! I am going to bring them from the northern land.
JER.31.8	I will gather them from remote regions of the earth
JER.31.8	the blind and the lame will be with them,
JER.31.8	along with those who are pregnant and those about to give birth.
JER.31.8	They will return here as a great assembly!
JER.31.9	They will come weeping,
JER.31.9	but I will bring them back with consolation.
JER.31.9	I will lead them to wadis filled with water,
JER.31.9	by a smooth way where they will not stumble,
JER.31.9	for I am Israel’s Father,
JER.31.9	and Ephraim is my firstborn.
JER.31.10	Nations, hear the word of the 
JER.31.10	and tell it among the far off coasts and islands!
JER.31.10	Say, “The one who scattered Israel will gather him.
JER.31.10	He will watch over him as a shepherd guards his flock,
JER.31.11	for the 
JER.31.11	and redeemed him from the power of one stronger than he.”
JER.31.12	They will come and shout for joy on the heights of Zion;
JER.31.12	they will be radiant with joy
JER.31.12	because of the 
JER.31.12	because of the grain, the new wine, the fresh oil,
JER.31.12	and because of the young of the flocks and herds.
JER.31.12	Their life will be like an irrigated garden,
JER.31.12	and they will no longer grow weak from hunger.
JER.31.13	Then the young women will rejoice with dancing,
JER.31.13	while young and old men rejoice together.
JER.31.13	I will turn their mourning into joy,
JER.31.13	give them consolation,
JER.31.13	and bring happiness out of grief.
JER.31.14	I will refresh the priests with an abundance,
JER.31.14	and my people will be satisfied with my goodness.
JER.31.14	This is the 
JER.31.15	This is what the 
JER.31.15	A voice was heard in Ramah,
JER.31.15	a lament with bitter weeping —
JER.31.15	Rachel weeping for her children,
JER.31.15	refusing to be comforted for her children
JER.31.15	because they are no more.
JER.31.16	This is what the 
JER.31.16	Keep your voice from weeping
JER.31.16	and your eyes from tears,
JER.31.16	for the reward for your work will come —
JER.31.16	this is the 
JER.31.16	and your children will return from the enemy’s land.
JER.31.17	There is hope for your future
JER.31.17	this is the 
JER.31.17	and your children will return to their own territory.
JER.31.18	I have surely heard Ephraim moaning,
JER.31.18	“You disciplined me, and I have been disciplined
JER.31.18	like an untrained calf.
JER.31.18	Take me back, so that I can return,
JER.31.18	for you, 
JER.31.19	After my return, I felt regret;
JER.31.19	After I was instructed, I struck my thigh in grief.
JER.31.19	I was ashamed and humiliated
JER.31.19	because I bore the disgrace of my youth.”
JER.31.20	Isn’t Ephraim a precious son to me,
JER.31.20	a delightful child?
JER.31.20	Whenever I speak against him,
JER.31.20	I certainly still think about him.
JER.31.20	Therefore, my inner being yearns for him;
JER.31.20	I will truly have compassion on him.
JER.31.20	This is the 
JER.31.21	Set up road markers
JER.31.21	establish signposts!
JER.31.21	Keep the highway in mind,
JER.31.21	the way you have traveled.
JER.31.21	Return, Virgin Israel!
JER.31.21	Return to these cities of yours.
JER.31.22	How long will you turn here and there,
JER.31.22	faithless daughter?
JER.31.22	For the 
JER.31.22	a female
JER.31.23	This is what the 
JER.31.24	Judah and all its cities will live in it together — also farmers and those who move
JER.31.25	for I satisfy the thirsty person and feed all those who are weak.”
JER.31.26	At this I awoke and looked around. My sleep had been most pleasant to me.
JER.31.27	“Look, the days are coming” — this is the 
JER.31.28	Just as I watched over them to uproot and to tear them down, to demolish and to destroy, and to cause disaster,
JER.31.29	“In those days, it will never again be said,
JER.31.29	‘The fathers have eaten sour grapes,
JER.31.29	and the children’s teeth are set on edge.’
JER.31.30	Rather, each will die for his own iniquity.
JER.31.31	“Look, the days are coming”
JER.31.32	This one will not be like the covenant I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt — my covenant that they broke even though I am their master”
JER.31.33	“Instead, this is the covenant I will make with the house of Israel after those days” — the 
JER.31.34	No longer will one teach his neighbor or his brother, saying, ‘Know the 
JER.31.35	“This is what the 
JER.31.35	The one who gives the sun for light by day,
JER.31.35	the fixed order of moon and stars for light by night,
JER.31.35	who stirs up the sea and makes its waves roar
JER.31.35	the 
JER.31.36	If this fixed order departs from before me —
JER.31.36	this is the 
JER.31.36	only then will Israel’s descendants cease
JER.31.36	to be a nation before me forever.
JER.31.37	“This is what the 
JER.31.37	Only if the heavens above can be measured
JER.31.37	and the foundations of the earth below explored,
JER.31.37	will I reject all of Israel’s descendants
JER.31.37	because of all they have done —
JER.31.37	this is the 
JER.31.38	“Look, the days are coming” — the 
JER.31.39	A measuring line will once again stretch out straight to the hill of Gareb
JER.31.40	The whole valley — the corpses, the ashes, and all the fields as far as the Kidron Valley
JER.32.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.32.2	At that time, the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem,
JER.32.3	King Zedekiah of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, “Why are you prophesying as you do? You say, ‘This is what the 
JER.32.4	King Zedekiah of Judah will not escape from the Chaldeans; indeed, he will certainly be handed over to Babylon’s king. They will speak face to face
JER.32.5	He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, where he will stay until I attend to him — this is the 
JER.32.6	Jeremiah replied, “The word of the 
JER.32.7	Watch! Hanamel, the son of your uncle Shallum, is coming to you to say, ‘Buy my field in Anathoth
JER.32.8	“Then, as the 
JER.32.9	So I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel, and I weighed out the silver to him
JER.32.10	I recorded it on a scroll,
JER.32.11	I took the purchase agreement — the sealed copy with its terms and conditions and the open copy —  
JER.32.12	and gave the purchase agreement to Baruch
JER.32.13	“I charged Baruch in their sight, 
JER.32.14	‘This is what the 
JER.32.15	For this is what the 
JER.32.16	“After I had given the purchase agreement to Baruch, son of Neriah, I prayed to the 
JER.32.17	Oh, Lord 
JER.32.18	You show faithful love to thousands but lay the fathers’ iniquity on their sons’ laps after them,
JER.32.19	the one great in counsel and powerful in action. Your eyes are on all the ways of the children of men
JER.32.20	You performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt
JER.32.21	You brought your people Israel out of Egypt with signs and wonders, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror.
JER.32.22	You gave them this land you swore to give to their ancestors, a land flowing with milk and honey.
JER.32.23	They entered and possessed it, but they did not obey you or live according to your instructions.
JER.32.24	Look! Siege ramps
JER.32.25	Yet you, Lord 
JER.32.26	The word of the 
JER.32.27	“Look, I am the 
JER.32.28	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.32.29	The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come and set this city on fire. They will burn it, including the houses where incense has been burned to Baal on their rooftops and where drink offerings have been poured out to other gods to anger me.
JER.32.30	From their youth, the Israelites and Judeans have done nothing but what is evil in my sight! They have done nothing but anger me by the work of their hands”
JER.32.31	“for this city has caused my wrath and fury from the day it was built until now. I will therefore remove it from my presence
JER.32.32	because of all the evil the Israelites and Judeans have done to anger me — they, their kings,
JER.32.33	They have turned their backs to me and not their faces.
JER.32.34	They have placed their abhorrent things
JER.32.35	They have built the high places of Baal in Ben Hinnom Valley to sacrifice their sons and daughters in the fire
JER.32.36	“Now therefore, this is what the 
JER.32.37	I will certainly gather them from all the lands where I have banished them in my anger, rage and intense wrath, and I will return them to this place and make them live in safety.
JER.32.38	They will be my people, and I will be their God.
JER.32.39	I will give them integrity of heart
JER.32.40	“I will make a permanent covenant with them:
JER.32.41	I will take delight in them to do what is good for them, and with all my heart and mind I will faithfully plant them in this land.
JER.32.42	“For this is what the 
JER.32.43	Fields will be bought in this land about which you are saying,
JER.32.44	Fields will be purchased, the transaction written on a scroll and sealed,
JER.32.44	This is the 
JER.33.1	While he was still confined in the guard’s courtyard,
JER.33.2	“The 
JER.33.3	Call to me and I will answer you
JER.33.4	For this is what the 
JER.33.5	The people coming to fight the Chaldeans will fill the houses with the corpses of their own men that I strike down in my wrath and rage. I have hidden my face
JER.33.6	Yet I will certainly bring health
JER.33.7	I will restore the fortunes
JER.33.8	I will purify them from all the iniquity they have committed against me,
JER.33.9	This city will bear on my behalf a name of joy, praise, and glory
JER.33.10	“This is what the 
JER.33.11	a sound of joy and gladness, the voice of the groom and the bride,
JER.33.11	Give thanks to the 
JER.33.11	for the 
JER.33.11	his faithful love endures forever
JER.33.11	as they bring thank offerings to the temple of the 
JER.33.12	“This is what the 
JER.33.13	The flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them
JER.33.14	“Look, the days are coming” —
JER.33.14	this is the 
JER.33.14	“when I will fulfill the good promise
JER.33.14	that I have spoken
JER.33.14	concerning the house of Israel
JER.33.14	and the house of Judah.
JER.33.15	In those days and at that time
JER.33.15	I will cause a Righteous Branch
JER.33.15	to sprout up for David,
JER.33.15	and he will administer justice
JER.33.15	and righteousness in the land.
JER.33.16	In those days Judah will be saved,
JER.33.16	and Jerusalem will dwell securely,
JER.33.16	and this is what she will be named:
JER.33.16	The 
JER.33.17	“For this is what the 
JER.33.18	The Levitical priests will never fail to have a man always before me to offer burnt offerings, to burn grain offerings, and to make sacrifices.”
JER.33.19	The word of the 
JER.33.20	“This is what the 
JER.33.21	then also my covenant with my servant David
JER.33.22	Even as the stars of heaven cannot be counted, and the sand of the sea cannot be measured,
JER.33.23	The word of the 
JER.33.24	“Have you not noticed what these people have said? They say, ‘The 
JER.33.25	This is what the 
JER.33.26	then I might also reject the descendants of Jacob and of my servant David. That is, I would not take rulers from his descendants to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But in fact, I will restore their fortunes
JER.34.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.2	“This is what the 
JER.34.3	As for you, you will not escape
JER.34.4	“‘Yet hear the 
JER.34.5	you will die peacefully. There will be a burning ceremony for you just like the burning ceremonies for your ancestors, the kings of old who came before you.
JER.34.6	So the prophet Jeremiah related all these words to King Zedekiah of Judah in Jerusalem 
JER.34.7	while the king of Babylon’s army was attacking Jerusalem and all of Judah’s remaining cities — that is, Lachish and Azekah,
JER.34.8	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.9	As a result, each was to let his male and female Hebrew slaves go free, and no one was to enslave his fellow Judean.
JER.34.10	All the officials and people who entered into covenant to let their male and female slaves go free — in order not to enslave them any longer — obeyed and let them go free. 
JER.34.11	Afterward, however, they changed their minds and took back their male and female slaves they had let go free and forced them to become slaves again.
JER.34.12	Then the word of the 
JER.34.13	“This is what the 
JER.34.14	‘At the end of seven years, each of you must let his fellow Hebrew who sold himself
JER.34.15	Today you repented and did what pleased me, each of you proclaiming freedom for his neighbor. You made a covenant before me
JER.34.16	But you have changed your minds
JER.34.17	“Therefore, this is what the 
JER.34.18	As for those who disobeyed my covenant,
JER.34.19	The officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the court officials, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the pieces of the calf —  
JER.34.20	all these I will hand over to their enemies, to those who intend to take their life. Their corpses will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals of the land.
JER.34.21	I will hand King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials over to their enemies, to those who intend to take their lives, to the king of Babylon’s army that is withdrawing. 
JER.34.22	I am about to give the command — this is the 
JER.35.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.35.2	“Go to the house of the Rechabites, speak to them,
JER.35.3	So I took Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, son of Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons — the entire house of the Rechabites —  
JER.35.4	and I brought them into the temple of the 
JER.35.5	I set jars filled with wine and some cups before the sons of the house of the Rechabites and said to them, “Drink wine!”
JER.35.6	But they replied, “We do not drink wine, for Jonadab,
JER.35.7	You must not build a house or sow seed or plant a vineyard. Those things are not for you. Rather, you must live in tents your whole life, so you may live a long time on the soil where you stay as a resident alien.’
JER.35.8	We have obeyed Jonadab, son of our ancestor Rechab, in all he commanded us. So we haven’t drunk wine our whole life — we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters. 
JER.35.9	We also have not built houses to live in and do not have vineyard, field, or seed. 
JER.35.10	But we have lived in tents and have obeyed and done everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. 
JER.35.11	However, when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon marched into the land,
JER.35.12	Then the word of the 
JER.35.13	“This is what the 
JER.35.14	The words of Jonadab, son of Rechab, have been carried out. He commanded his descendants not to drink wine, and they have not drunk to this day because they have obeyed their ancestor’s command. But I have spoken to you time and time again,
JER.35.15	Time and time again
JER.35.16	Yes, the sons of Jonadab son of Rechab carried out their ancestor’s command he gave them, but these people have not obeyed me. 
JER.35.17	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.35.18	But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremiah said, “This is what the 
JER.35.19	this is what the 
JER.36.1	In the fourth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah,
JER.36.2	“Take a scroll,
JER.36.3	Perhaps when the house of Judah hears about all the disaster I am planning to bring on them, each one of them will turn from his evil way. Then I will forgive their iniquity
JER.36.4	So Jeremiah summoned Baruch
JER.36.5	Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch, “I am restricted;
JER.36.6	so you must go and read from the scroll — which you wrote at my dictation
JER.36.7	Perhaps their petition will come before the 
JER.36.8	So Baruch son of Neriah did everything the prophet Jeremiah had commanded him. At the 
JER.36.9	In the fifth year of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month,
JER.36.10	Then at the 
JER.36.11	When Micaiah son of Gemariah, son of Shaphan, heard all the words of the 
JER.36.12	he went down to the scribe’s chamber in the king’s palace. All the officials were sitting there — Elishama the scribe, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor,
JER.36.13	Micaiah reported to them all the words he had heard when Baruch read from the scroll in the hearing of the people. 
JER.36.14	Then all the officials sent word to Baruch through Jehudi son of Nethaniah, son of Shelemiah, son of Cushi, saying, “Bring the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come.” So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll and went to them. 
JER.36.15	They said to him, “Sit down and read it in our hearing.” So Baruch read it in their hearing.
JER.36.16	When they had heard all the words, they turned to each other in fear and said to Baruch, “We must surely tell the king all these things.” 
JER.36.17	Then they asked Baruch, “Tell us, how did you write all these words? At his dictation?” 
JER.36.18	Baruch said to them, “At his dictation. He recited all these words to me while I was writing on the scroll in ink.”
JER.36.19	The officials said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah must hide and tell no one where you are.” 
JER.36.20	Then, after depositing the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, the officials came to the king at the courtyard and reported everything in the hearing of the king. 
JER.36.21	The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi then read it in the hearing of the king and all the officials who were standing by the king. 
JER.36.22	Since it was the ninth month, the king was sitting in his winter quarters
JER.36.23	As soon as Jehudi would read three or four columns, Jehoiakim would cut the scroll
JER.36.24	As they heard all these words, the king and all of his servants did not become terrified
JER.36.25	Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah had urged the king not to burn the scroll, he did not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	Then the king commanded Jerahmeel the king’s son, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to seize the scribe Baruch and the prophet Jeremiah, but the 
JER.36.27	After the king had burned the scroll and the words Baruch had written at Jeremiah’s dictation,
JER.36.28	“Take another scroll, and once again write on it the original words that were on the original scroll that King Jehoiakim of Judah burned.
JER.36.29	You are to proclaim concerning King Jehoiakim of Judah, ‘This is what the 
JER.36.30	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.36.31	I will punish him, his descendants, and his officers for their iniquity. I will bring on them, on the residents of Jerusalem, and on the people of Judah all the disaster, which I warned them about but they did not listen.’”
JER.36.32	Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah, the scribe, and he wrote on it at Jeremiah’s dictation
JER.37.1	Zedekiah son of Josiah
JER.37.2	He and his officers and the people of the land did not obey the words of the 
JER.37.3	Nevertheless, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal
JER.37.4	Jeremiah was going about his daily tasks
JER.37.5	Pharaoh’s army had left Egypt,
JER.37.6	The word of the 
JER.37.7	“This is what the 
JER.37.8	The Chaldeans will then return and fight against this city. They will capture it and burn it.
JER.37.9	This is what the 
JER.37.10	Indeed, if you were to strike down the entire Chaldean army that is fighting with you,
JER.37.11	When the Chaldean army withdrew from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh’s army, 
JER.37.12	Jeremiah started to leave Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to claim his portion there
JER.37.13	But when he was at the Benjamin Gate,
JER.37.14	“That’s a lie,” Jeremiah replied. “I am not defecting to the Chaldeans!” Irijah would not listen to him but apprehended Jeremiah and took him to the officials. 
JER.37.15	The officials were angry at Jeremiah and beat him and placed him in jail in the house of Jonathan
JER.37.16	So Jeremiah went into a cell in the dungeon
JER.37.17	King Zedekiah later sent for him and received him, and in his house privately asked him, “Is there a word from the 
JER.37.17	“There is,” Jeremiah responded. He continued, “You will be handed over to the king of Babylon.”
JER.37.18	Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “How have I sinned against you or your servants or these people that you have put me in prison? 
JER.37.19	Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, claiming, ‘The king of Babylon will not come against you and this land’?
JER.37.20	So now please listen, my lord the king. May my petition come before you.
JER.37.21	So King Zedekiah gave orders, and Jeremiah was placed in the guard’s courtyard.
JER.38.1	Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jucal
JER.38.2	“This is what the 
JER.38.3	This is what the 
JER.38.4	The officials then said to the king, “This man ought to die, because he is weakening the morale
JER.38.5	King Zedekiah said, “Here he is; he’s in your hands since the king can’t do anything against you.” 
JER.38.6	So they took Jeremiah and dropped him into the cistern of Malchiah the king’s son, which was in the guard’s courtyard, lowering Jeremiah with ropes. There was no water in the cistern, only mud, and Jeremiah sank in the mud.
JER.38.7	But Ebed-melech, a Cushite court official in the king’s palace, heard Jeremiah had been put into the cistern. While the king was sitting at the Benjamin Gate,
JER.38.8	Ebed-melech went from the king’s palace and spoke to the king: 
JER.38.9	“My lord the king, these men have been evil in all they have done to the prophet Jeremiah. They have dropped him into the cistern where he will die from hunger, because there is no more bread in the city.”
JER.38.10	So the king commanded Ebed-melech, the Cushite, “Take from here thirty men under your authority
JER.38.11	So Ebed-melech took the men under his authority
JER.38.12	Ebed-melech the Cushite called down to Jeremiah, “Place these old rags and clothes between your armpits and the ropes.” Jeremiah did this. 
JER.38.13	They pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern, but he remained in the guard’s courtyard.
JER.38.14	King Zedekiah sent for the prophet Jeremiah and received him at the third entrance of the 
JER.38.15	Jeremiah replied to Zedekiah, “If I tell you, you will kill me, won’t you? Besides, if I give you advice, you won’t listen to me anyway.”
JER.38.16	King Zedekiah swore to Jeremiah in private,
JER.38.17	Jeremiah therefore said to Zedekiah, “This is what the 
JER.38.18	But if you do not surrender to the officials of the king of Babylon, then this city will be handed over to the Chaldeans.
JER.38.19	But King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I am worried about the Judeans who have defected to the Chaldeans. They may hand me over to the Judeans to abuse me.”
JER.38.20	“They will not hand you over,” Jeremiah replied. “Obey the 
JER.38.21	But if you refuse to surrender, this is the verdict
JER.38.22	‘All the women
JER.38.22	“Your trusted friends
JER.38.22	and overcame you.
JER.38.22	Your feet sank into the mire,
JER.38.22	and they deserted you.”
JER.38.23	All your wives and children will be brought out to the Chaldeans.
JER.38.24	Then Zedekiah warned Jeremiah, “Don’t let anyone know about this conversation
JER.38.25	The officials may hear that I have spoken with you
JER.38.26	If they do, tell them, ‘I was bringing before the king my petition that he not return me to the house of Jonathan to die there.’”
JER.38.27	All the officials did come to Jeremiah, and they questioned him. He reported the exact words to them the king had commanded, and they quit speaking with him because the conversation
JER.38.28	Jeremiah remained in the guard’s courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured, and he was there when it happened.
JER.39.1	In the ninth year of King Zedekiah of Judah, in the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army and laid siege to it.
JER.39.2	In the fourth month of Zedekiah’s eleventh year, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken into.
JER.39.3	All the officials of the king of Babylon entered and sat at the Middle Gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar, Nebusarsechim
JER.39.4	When King Zedekiah of Judah and all the fighting men saw them, they fled. They left the city at night by way of the king’s garden
JER.39.5	However, the Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They arrested him and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar, Babylon’s king, at Riblah in the land of Hamath. The king passed sentence on him there.
JER.39.6	At Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, and he also slaughtered all Judah’s nobles. 
JER.39.7	Then he blinded Zedekiah and put him in bronze chains to take him to Babylon.
JER.39.8	The Chaldeans next burned down the king’s palace and the people’s houses and tore down the walls of Jerusalem.
JER.39.9	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guards,
JER.39.10	However, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guards, left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who owned nothing, and he gave them vineyards and fields at that time.
JER.39.11	Speaking through Nebuzaradan, captain of the guards, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gave orders concerning Jeremiah: 
JER.39.12	“Take him and look after him. Don’t do him any harm, but do for him whatever he says.” 
JER.39.13	Nebuzaradan, captain of the guards, Nebushazban the chief of staff, Nergal-sharezer the chief soothsayer, and all the captains of Babylon’s king 
JER.39.14	had Jeremiah brought from the guard’s courtyard
JER.39.15	Now the word of the 
JER.39.16	“Go tell Ebed-melech the Cushite,
JER.39.17	But I will rescue you on that day — this is the 
JER.39.18	Indeed, I will certainly deliver you so that you do not fall by the sword. Because you have trusted in me, you will retain your life like the spoils of war.
JER.40.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.40.2	The captain of the guards took Jeremiah and said to him, “The 
JER.40.3	and the 
JER.40.4	Now pay attention: Today I am setting you free from the chains that were on your hands.
JER.40.5	When Jeremiah had not yet turned to go, Nebuzaradan said to him,
JER.40.6	Jeremiah therefore went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah,
JER.40.7	All the commanders of the armies that were in the countryside — they and their men — heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam over the land. He had been put in charge of the men, women, and children from among the poorest of the land, who had not been deported to Babylon. 
JER.40.8	So they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. The commanders included Ishmael
JER.40.9	Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men, assuring them, “Don’t be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it will go well for you.
JER.40.10	As for me, I am going to live in Mizpah to represent you
JER.40.11	When all the Judeans in Moab
JER.40.12	they all returned from all the places where they had been banished
JER.40.13	Meanwhile, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies in the countryside came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 
JER.40.14	and warned him, “Don’t you realize that Baalis, king of the Ammonites, has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah
JER.40.15	Then Johanan son of Kareah suggested to Gedaliah in private at Mizpah, “Let me go kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah. No one will know it. Why should he kill you and allow all of Judah that has gathered around you to scatter and the remnant of Judah to perish?” 
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam responded to Johanan son of Kareah, “Don’t do that! What you’re saying about Ishmael is a lie.”
JER.41.1	In the seventh month, Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama, of the royal family and one of the king’s chief officers, came with ten men to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. They ate a meal together there in Mizpah, 
JER.41.2	but then Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, with the sword; he killed the one the king of Babylon had appointed in the land.
JER.41.3	Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah, as well as the Chaldean soldiers who were there.
JER.41.4	On the day after he had killed Gedaliah, when no one knew yet, 
JER.41.5	eighty men came from Shechem, Shiloh,
JER.41.6	Ishmael son of Nethaniah came out of Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he came. When he encountered them, he said, “Come to Gedaliah son of Ahikam!” 
JER.41.7	But when they came into the city, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and the men with him slaughtered them and threw them into
JER.41.8	However, there were ten men among them who said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us, for we have hidden treasure in the field — wheat, barley, oil, and honey!” So he stopped and did not kill them along with their companions. 
JER.41.9	Now the cistern where Ishmael had thrown all the corpses of the men he had struck down was a large one
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people of Mizpah including the daughters of the king — all those who remained in Mizpah over whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guards, had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Ishmael son of Nethaniah took them captive and set off to cross over to the Ammonites.
JER.41.11	When Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies
JER.41.12	they took all their men and went to fight with Ishmael son of Nethaniah. They found him by the great pool in Gibeon.
JER.41.13	When all the people held by Ishmael saw Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the army with him, they rejoiced. 
JER.41.14	All the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and rejoined Johanan son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites. 
JER.41.16	Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies with him then took from Mizpah all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael son of Nethaniah after Ishmael had killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam — men, soldiers, women, children, and court officials whom he brought back from Gibeon. 
JER.41.17	They left, stopping in Geruth Chimham,
JER.41.18	away from the Chaldeans. For they feared them because Ishmael son of Nethaniah had struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
JER.42.1	Then all the commanders of the armies, along with Johanan son of Kareah,
JER.42.2	the prophet Jeremiah and said, “May our petition come before you;
JER.42.3	that the 
JER.42.4	So the prophet Jeremiah said to them, “I have heard. I will now pray to the 
JER.42.5	And they said to Jeremiah, “May the 
JER.42.6	Whether it is pleasant or unpleasant, we will obey the 
JER.42.7	At the end of ten days, the word of the 
JER.42.8	and he summoned Johanan son of Kareah, all the commanders of the armies who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.
JER.42.9	He said to them, “This is what the 
JER.42.10	‘If you will indeed stay in this land, then I will rebuild and not demolish you,
JER.42.11	Don’t be afraid of the king of Babylon
JER.42.12	I will grant you compassion,
JER.42.13	“But if you say, ‘We will not stay in this land,’
JER.42.14	and if you say, ‘No, instead we’ll go to the land of Egypt
JER.42.15	then hear the word of the 
JER.42.16	then the sword
JER.42.17	All who resolve to go to Egypt to stay there for a while will die by the sword, famine, and plague. They will have no survivor or fugitive from the disaster I will bring on them.’
JER.42.18	“For this is what the 
JER.42.19	The 
JER.42.20	You have gone astray at the cost of your lives
JER.42.21	For I have told you today, but you have not obeyed the 
JER.42.22	Now therefore, know for certain that by the sword, famine, and plague you will die in the place where you desired to go to stay for a while.”
JER.43.1	When Jeremiah had finished speaking to all the people all the words of the 
JER.43.2	then Azariah
JER.43.3	Rather, Baruch son of Neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the Chaldeans to put us to death or to deport us to Babylon!”
JER.43.4	So Johanan son of Kareah, all the commanders of the armies, and all the people failed to obey the 
JER.43.5	Instead, Johanan son of Kareah and all the commanders of the armies led away the whole remnant of Judah,
JER.43.6	They led away the men, women, children, king’s daughters, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan, captain of the guards, had allowed to remain with Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan.
JER.43.7	They went to the land of Egypt because they did not obey the 
JER.43.8	Then the word of the 
JER.43.9	“Pick up some large stones and set them in the mortar of the brick pavement that is at the opening of Pharaoh’s palace at Tahpanhes. Do this in the sight of the Judean men 
JER.43.10	and tell them, ‘This is what the 
JER.43.11	He will come and strike down the land of Egypt
JER.43.12	I
JER.43.13	He will smash the sacred pillars of the sun temple
JER.44.1	This is the word that came to Jeremiah for all the Jews living in the land of Egypt — at Migdol,
JER.44.2	“This is what the 
JER.44.3	because of the evil they committed to anger me,
JER.44.4	So I sent you all my servants the prophets time and time again,
JER.44.5	But they did not listen or pay attention; they did not turn from their evil or stop burning incense to other gods. 
JER.44.6	So my fierce wrath poured out and burned in Judah’s cities and Jerusalem’s streets
JER.44.7	“So now, this is what the 
JER.44.8	You are angering me by the work of your hands. You are burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have gone to stay for a while. As a result, you will be cut off and become an example for cursing and insult among all the nations of earth.
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, the evils of Judah’s kings, the evils of their wives, your own evils, and the evils of your wives that were committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.44.10	They have not become humble to this day, and they have not feared or followed my instruction or my statutes that I set before you and your ancestors.
JER.44.11	“Therefore, this is what the 
JER.44.12	And I will take away the remnant of Judah,
JER.44.13	I will punish those living in the land of Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem by sword, famine, and plague. 
JER.44.14	Then the remnant of Judah — those going to live for a while there in the land of Egypt — will have no fugitive or survivor to return to the land of Judah where they are longing
JER.44.15	However, all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, all the women standing by — a great assembly — and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt at Pathros answered Jeremiah, 
JER.44.16	“As for the word you spoke to us in the name of the 
JER.44.17	Instead, we will do everything we promised:
JER.44.18	but from the time we ceased to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to offer her drink offerings, we have lacked everything, and through sword and famine we have met our end.”
JER.44.19	And the women said,
JER.44.20	But Jeremiah responded to all the people — the men, women, and all the people who were answering him: 
JER.44.21	“As for the incense you burned in Judah’s cities
JER.44.22	The 
JER.44.23	Because you burned incense and sinned against the 
JER.44.24	Then Jeremiah said to all the people, including all the women, “Hear the word of the 
JER.44.25	This is what the 
JER.44.26	“Therefore, hear the word of the 
JER.44.27	I am watching over them for disaster and not for good,
JER.44.28	Those who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah only few in number,
JER.44.29	This will be a sign to you’ — this is the 
JER.44.30	This is what the 
JER.45.1	This is the word that the prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah
JER.45.2	“This is what the 
JER.45.3	‘You have said, “Woe is me, because the 
JER.45.4	“This is what you are to say to him: ‘This is what the 
JER.45.5	But as for you, do you pursue great things for yourself? Stop pursuing! For I am about to bring disaster on everyone” — this is the 
JER.46.1	This is the word of the 
JER.46.2	About Egypt and the army of Pharaoh Neco, Egypt’s king,
JER.46.3	Deploy small shields
JER.46.3	approach for battle!
JER.46.4	Harness the horses;
JER.46.4	mount the steeds;
JER.46.4	take your positions with helmets on!
JER.46.4	Polish the lances;
JER.46.4	put on armor!
JER.46.5	Why have I seen this?
JER.46.5	They are terrified,
JER.46.5	they are retreating,
JER.46.5	their warriors are crushed,
JER.46.5	they flee headlong,
JER.46.5	they never look back,
JER.46.5	terror is on every side!
JER.46.5	This is the 
JER.46.6	The swift cannot flee,
JER.46.6	and the warrior cannot escape!
JER.46.6	In the north by the bank of the Euphrates River,
JER.46.6	they stumble and fall.
JER.46.7	Who is this, rising like the Nile,
JER.46.7	with waters that churn like rivers?
JER.46.8	Egypt rises like the Nile,
JER.46.8	and its waters churn like rivers.
JER.46.8	He boasts, “I will go up, I will cover the earth;
JER.46.8	I will destroy cities with their residents.”
JER.46.9	Rise up, you cavalry!
JER.46.9	Race furiously, you chariots!
JER.46.9	Let the warriors march out —
JER.46.9	Cush and Put,
JER.46.9	who are able to handle shields,
JER.46.9	and the men of Lud,
JER.46.9	who are able to handle and string the bow.
JER.46.10	That day belongs to the Lord, the 
JER.46.10	a day of vengeance to avenge himself
JER.46.10	against his adversaries.
JER.46.10	The sword will devour and be satisfied;
JER.46.10	it will drink its fill of their blood,
JER.46.10	because it will be a sacrifice
JER.46.10	in the northern land by the Euphrates River.
JER.46.11	Go up to Gilead and get balm,
JER.46.11	Virgin Daughter Egypt!
JER.46.11	You have multiplied remedies in vain;
JER.46.11	there is no healing for you.
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of your dishonor,
JER.46.12	and your cries fill the earth,
JER.46.12	because warrior stumbles against warrior
JER.46.12	and together both of them have fallen.
JER.46.13	This is the word the 
JER.46.14	Announce it in Egypt, and proclaim it in Migdol!
JER.46.14	Proclaim it in Memphis and in Tahpanhes!
JER.46.14	Say, “Take positions! Prepare yourself,
JER.46.14	for the sword devours all around you.”
JER.46.15	Why have your strong ones been swept away?
JER.46.15	Each has not stood,
JER.46.15	for the 
JER.46.16	He continues to stumble.
JER.46.16	Indeed, each falls over the other.
JER.46.16	They say, “Get up! Let’s return to our people
JER.46.16	and to our native land,
JER.46.16	away from the oppressor’s sword.”
JER.46.17	There they will cry out,
JER.46.17	“Pharaoh king of Egypt was all noise;
JER.46.17	he let the opportune moment pass.”
JER.46.18	As I live —
JER.46.18	this is the King’s declaration; 
JER.46.18	the king of Babylon
JER.46.18	and like Carmel by the sea.
JER.46.19	Get your bags ready for exile,
JER.46.19	inhabitant of Daughter Egypt!
JER.46.19	For Memphis will become a desolation,
JER.46.19	uninhabited ruins.
JER.46.20	Egypt is a beautiful young cow,
JER.46.20	but a horsefly from the north is coming against her.
JER.46.21	Even her mercenaries among her
JER.46.21	are like stall-fed calves.
JER.46.21	They too will turn back;
JER.46.21	together they will flee;
JER.46.21	they will not take their stand,
JER.46.21	for the day of their calamity is coming on them,
JER.46.21	the time of their punishment.
JER.46.22	Egypt will hiss like a slithering snake,
JER.46.22	for the enemy will come with an army;
JER.46.22	with axes they will come against her
JER.46.22	like those who cut trees.
JER.46.23	They will cut down her forest —
JER.46.23	this is the 
JER.46.23	though it is dense,
JER.46.23	for they are more numerous than locusts;
JER.46.23	they cannot be counted.
JER.46.24	Daughter Egypt will be put to shame,
JER.46.24	handed over to a northern people.
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	I will hand them over to those who intend to take their lives
JER.46.26	This is the 
JER.46.27	But you, my servant Jacob, do not be afraid,
JER.46.27	and do not be discouraged, Israel,
JER.46.27	for without fail I will save you from far away,
JER.46.27	and your descendants from the land of their captivity!
JER.46.27	Jacob will return and have calm and quiet
JER.46.27	with no one to frighten him.
JER.46.28	And you, my servant Jacob, do not be afraid —
JER.46.28	this is the 
JER.46.28	for I will be with you.
JER.46.28	I will bring destruction on all the nations
JER.46.28	where I have banished you,
JER.46.28	but I will not bring destruction on you.
JER.46.28	I will discipline you with justice,
JER.46.28	and I will by no means leave you unpunished.
JER.47.1	This is the word of the 
JER.47.2	This is what the 
JER.47.2	Look, water is rising from the north
JER.47.2	and becoming an overflowing wadi.
JER.47.2	It will overflow the land and everything in it,
JER.47.2	the cities and their inhabitants.
JER.47.2	The people will cry out,
JER.47.2	and every inhabitant of the land will wail.
JER.47.3	At the sound of the stomping hooves of his stallions,
JER.47.3	the rumbling of his chariots,
JER.47.3	and the clatter of their wheels,
JER.47.3	fathers will not turn back for their sons.
JER.47.3	They will be utterly helpless
JER.47.4	on account of the day that is coming
JER.47.4	to destroy all the Philistines,
JER.47.4	to cut off from Tyre and Sidon
JER.47.4	every remaining ally.
JER.47.4	Indeed, the 
JER.47.4	the remnant of the coastland of Caphtor.
JER.47.5	Baldness
JER.47.5	Ashkelon will become silent.
JER.47.5	Remnant of their valley,
JER.47.5	how long will you gash yourself?
JER.47.6	Oh, sword of the 
JER.47.6	How long will you be restless?
JER.47.6	Go back to your sheath;
JER.47.6	be still; be silent!
JER.47.7	How can it
JER.47.7	when the 
JER.47.7	He has assigned it
JER.47.7	against Ashkelon and the shore of the sea.
JER.48.1	About Moab,
JER.48.1	Woe to Nebo,
JER.48.1	Kiriathaim will be put to shame;
JER.48.1	The fortress will be put to shame and dismayed!
JER.48.2	There is no longer praise for Moab;
JER.48.2	they plan harm against her in Heshbon:
JER.48.2	Come, let’s cut her off from nationhood.
JER.48.2	Also, Madmen, you will be silenced;
JER.48.2	the sword will follow
JER.48.3	A voice cries out from Horonaim,
JER.48.3	“devastation and a crushing blow!” 
JER.48.4	Moab will be shattered;
JER.48.4	her little ones will cry out.
JER.48.5	For on the Ascent to Luhith
JER.48.5	they will be weeping continually,
JER.48.5	and on the descent to Horonaim
JER.48.5	will be heard cries of distress over the destruction:
JER.48.6	Flee! Save your lives!
JER.48.6	Be like a juniper bush
JER.48.7	Because you trust in your works and treasures,
JER.48.7	you will be captured also.
JER.48.7	Chemosh
JER.48.7	with his priests and officials.
JER.48.8	The destroyer
JER.48.8	not one town will escape.
JER.48.8	The valley will perish,
JER.48.8	and the plain will be annihilated,
JER.48.8	as the 
JER.48.9	Make Moab a salt marsh,
JER.48.9	for she will run away;
JER.48.9	her towns will become a desolation,
JER.48.9	without inhabitant.
JER.48.10	The one who does
JER.48.10	the 
JER.48.10	and the one who withholds
JER.48.10	his sword from bloodshed is cursed.
JER.48.11	Moab has been left quiet since his youth,
JER.48.11	settled like wine on its dregs.
JER.48.11	He hasn’t been poured from one container to another
JER.48.11	or gone into exile.
JER.48.11	So his taste has remained the same,
JER.48.11	and his aroma hasn’t changed.
JER.48.12	Therefore look, the days are coming
JER.48.12	this is the 
JER.48.12	when I will send pourers to him, who will pour him out.
JER.48.12	They will empty his containers
JER.48.12	and smash his jars.
JER.48.13	Moab will be put to shame because of Chemosh,
JER.48.13	just as the house of Israel was put to shame
JER.48.13	because of Bethel
JER.48.14	How can you say, “We are warriors —
JER.48.14	valiant men for battle”?
JER.48.15	The destroyer of Moab and its towns
JER.48.15	has come up,
JER.48.15	and the best of its young men
JER.48.15	have gone down to slaughter.
JER.48.15	This is the King’s declaration;
JER.48.15	the 
JER.48.16	Moab’s calamity is near at hand;
JER.48.16	his disaster is rushing swiftly.
JER.48.17	Mourn for him, all you surrounding nations,
JER.48.17	everyone who knows his name.
JER.48.17	Say, “How the mighty scepter
JER.48.17	the glorious staff!”
JER.48.18	Come down from glory; sit on parched ground,
JER.48.18	resident of the daughter of Dibon,
JER.48.18	for the destroyer of Moab has come against you;
JER.48.18	he has destroyed your fortresses.
JER.48.19	Stand by the highway and watch,
JER.48.19	resident of Aroer!
JER.48.19	Ask him who is fleeing or her who is escaping,
JER.48.19	“What happened?”
JER.48.20	Moab is put to shame, indeed dismayed.
JER.48.20	Wail and cry out!
JER.48.20	Declare by the Arnon
JER.48.20	that Moab is destroyed.
JER.48.21	“Judgment has come to the land of the plateau
JER.48.22	Dibon, Nebo, Beth-diblathaim, 
JER.48.23	Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, Beth-meon,
JER.48.24	Kerioth,
JER.48.25	Moab’s horn is chopped off;
JER.48.25	This is the 
JER.48.26	“Make him drunk, because he has exalted himself against the 
JER.48.27	Wasn’t Israel a laughingstock to you?
JER.48.28	Abandon the towns! Live in the cliffs,
JER.48.28	residents of Moab!
JER.48.28	Be like a dove
JER.48.28	that nests inside the mouth of a cave.
JER.48.29	We have heard of Moab’s pride,
JER.48.29	great pride, indeed —
JER.48.29	his insolence, arrogance, pride,
JER.48.29	and haughty heart.
JER.48.30	I know his outburst.
JER.48.30	This is the 
JER.48.30	It is empty.
JER.48.30	His boast is empty.
JER.48.31	Therefore, I will wail over Moab.
JER.48.31	I will cry out for Moab, all of it;
JER.48.31	he will moan for the men of Kir-heres.
JER.48.32	I will weep for you, vine of Sibmah,
JER.48.32	with more than the weeping for Jazer.
JER.48.32	Your tendrils have extended to the sea;
JER.48.32	they have reached to the sea and to Jazer.
JER.48.32	The destroyer has fallen on your summer fruit and grape harvest.
JER.48.33	Gladness and celebration are taken from the fertile field
JER.48.33	and from the land of Moab.
JER.48.33	I have stopped the flow of wine from the winepresses;
JER.48.33	no one will tread with shouts of joy.
JER.48.33	The shouting is not a shout of joy.
JER.48.34	“There is a cry from Heshbon to Elealeh; they make their voices heard as far as Jahaz
JER.48.35	In Moab, I will stop” — this is the 
JER.48.36	Therefore, my heart moans like flutes for Moab,
JER.48.37	Indeed, every head is bald and every beard is chopped short.
JER.48.38	On all the rooftops of Moab and in her public squares, everyone is mourning because I have shattered Moab like a jar no one wants.”
JER.48.39	“How broken it is! They wail! How Moab has turned his back! He is ashamed. Moab will become a laughingstock and a shock to all those around him.”
JER.48.40	For this is what the 
JER.48.40	Look! He will swoop down like an eagle
JER.48.40	and spread his wings against Moab.
JER.48.41	The towns have
JER.48.41	and the strongholds seized.
JER.48.41	In that day the heart of Moab’s warriors
JER.48.41	will be like the heart of a woman with contractions.
JER.48.42	Moab will be destroyed as a people
JER.48.42	because he has exalted himself against the 
JER.48.43	Panic,
JER.48.43	await you, resident of Moab.
JER.48.43	This is the 
JER.48.44	He who flees from the panic will fall in the pit,
JER.48.44	and he who climbs from the pit
JER.48.44	will be captured in the trap,
JER.48.44	for I will bring against Moab
JER.48.44	the year of their punishment.
JER.48.44	This is the 
JER.48.45	Those who flee will stand exhausted in Heshbon’s shadow
JER.48.45	because fire has come out from Heshbon
JER.48.45	and a flame from within Sihon.
JER.48.45	It will devour Moab’s forehead
JER.48.45	and the skull of the noisemakers.
JER.48.46	Woe to you, Moab!
JER.48.46	The people of Chemosh have perished
JER.48.46	because your sons have been taken captive
JER.48.46	and your daughters have gone into captivity.
JER.48.47	Yet, I will restore the fortunes
JER.48.47	This is the 
JER.48.47	The judgment on Moab ends here.
JER.49.1	About the Ammonites,
JER.49.1	Does Israel have no sons?
JER.49.1	Is he without an heir?
JER.49.1	Why then has Milcom
JER.49.1	and his people settled in their cities?
JER.49.2	Therefore look, the days are coming
JER.49.2	this is the 
JER.49.2	when I will make the shout of battle
JER.49.2	against Rabbah
JER.49.2	It will become a desolate mound,
JER.49.2	and its surrounding villages will be set on fire.
JER.49.2	Israel will dispossess their dispossessors,
JER.49.2	says the 
JER.49.3	Wail, Heshbon,
JER.49.3	cry out, daughters of Rabbah!
JER.49.3	Clothe yourselves with sackcloth,
JER.49.3	run back and forth within your walls,
JER.49.3	because Milcom will go into exile
JER.49.3	together with his priests and officials.
JER.49.4	Why do you boast about your valleys,
JER.49.4	your flowing valley,
JER.49.4	you faithless daughter —
JER.49.4	you who trust in your treasures
JER.49.4	and say, “Who can attack me?”
JER.49.5	Look, I am about to bring terror on you
JER.49.5	this is the declaration of the Lord 
JER.49.5	from all those around you.
JER.49.5	You will be banished, each person headlong,
JER.49.5	with no one to gather up the fugitives.
JER.49.6	But after that, I will restore the fortunes
JER.49.6	This is the 
JER.49.7	About Edom,
JER.49.7	Is there no longer wisdom in Teman?
JER.49.7	Has counsel perished from the prudent?
JER.49.7	Has their wisdom rotted away?
JER.49.8	Run! Turn back! Lie low,
JER.49.8	residents of Dedan,
JER.49.8	for I will bring Esau’s calamity on him
JER.49.8	at the time I punish him.
JER.49.9	If grape harvesters came to you,
JER.49.9	wouldn’t they leave some gleanings?
JER.49.9	Were thieves to come in the night,
JER.49.9	they would destroy only what they wanted.
JER.49.10	But I will strip Esau bare;
JER.49.10	I will uncover his secret places.
JER.49.10	He will try to hide,
JER.49.10	His descendants will be destroyed
JER.49.10	along with his relatives and neighbors.
JER.49.10	He will exist no longer.
JER.49.11	Abandon your fatherless; I will preserve them;
JER.49.11	let your widows trust in me.
JER.49.12	For this is what the 
JER.49.13	For by myself I have sworn”
JER.49.14	I have heard an envoy from the 
JER.49.14	a messenger has been sent among the nations:
JER.49.14	Assemble yourselves to come against her.
JER.49.14	Rise up for war!
JER.49.15	I will certainly make you insignificant among the nations,
JER.49.15	despised among humanity.
JER.49.16	As to the terror you cause,
JER.49.16	your arrogant heart has deceived you.
JER.49.16	You who live in the clefts of the rock,
JER.49.16	you who occupy the mountain summit,
JER.49.16	though you elevate your nest like the eagles,
JER.49.16	even from there I will bring you down.
JER.49.16	This is the 
JER.49.17	“Edom will become a desolation. Everyone who passes by her will be appalled and scoff because of all her wounds.
JER.49.18	As when Sodom and Gomorrah were overthrown along with their neighbors,”
JER.49.19	“Look, it will be like a lion coming from the thickets
JER.49.20	Therefore, hear the plans that the 
JER.49.21	At the sound of their fall the earth will quake;
JER.49.22	Look! It will be like an eagle soaring upward, then swooping down and spreading its wings over Bozrah. In that day the hearts of Edom’s warriors will be like the heart of a woman with contractions.
JER.49.23	About Damascus:
JER.49.23	Hamath and Arpad are put to shame,
JER.49.23	for they have heard a bad report and are agitated,
JER.49.23	like
JER.49.24	Damascus has become weak;
JER.49.24	she has turned to run;
JER.49.24	panic has gripped her.
JER.49.24	Distress and labor pains have seized her
JER.49.24	like a woman in labor.
JER.49.25	How can the city of praise not be abandoned,
JER.49.25	the town that brings me joy?
JER.49.26	Therefore, her young men will fall in her public squares;
JER.49.26	all the warriors will perish in that day.
JER.49.26	This is the declaration of the 
JER.49.27	I will set fire to the wall of Damascus;
JER.49.27	it will consume Ben-hadad’s citadels.
JER.49.28	About Kedar
JER.49.28	Rise up, attack Kedar,
JER.49.28	and destroy the people of the east!
JER.49.29	They will take their tents and their flocks
JER.49.29	along with their tent curtains and all their equipment.
JER.49.29	They will take their camels for themselves.
JER.49.29	They will call out to them,
JER.49.29	“Terror is on every side!” 
JER.49.30	Run! Escape quickly! Lie low,
JER.49.30	residents of Hazor —
JER.49.30	this is the 
JER.49.30	for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon
JER.49.30	has drawn up a plan against you;
JER.49.30	he has devised a strategy against you.
JER.49.31	Rise up, attack a nation at ease,
JER.49.31	one living in security.
JER.49.31	This is the 
JER.49.31	They have no doors, not even a gate bar;
JER.49.31	they live alone.
JER.49.32	Their camels will become plunder,
JER.49.32	and their massive herds of cattle will become spoil.
JER.49.32	I will scatter them to the wind in every direction,
JER.49.32	those who clip the hair on their temples;
JER.49.32	I will bring calamity on them across all their borders.
JER.49.32	This is the 
JER.49.33	Hazor will become a jackals’ den,
JER.49.33	a desolation forever.
JER.49.33	No one will live there;
JER.49.33	no human being will stay in it even temporarily.
JER.49.34	This is the word of the 
JER.49.35	This is what the 
JER.49.35	I am about to shatter Elam’s bow,
JER.49.35	the source
JER.49.36	I will bring the four winds against Elam
JER.49.36	from the four corners of the heavens,
JER.49.36	and I will scatter them to all these winds.
JER.49.36	There will not be a nation
JER.49.36	to which Elam’s banished ones will not go.
JER.49.37	I will devastate Elam before their enemies,
JER.49.37	before those who intend to take their lives.
JER.49.37	I will bring disaster on them,
JER.49.37	my burning anger.
JER.49.37	This is the 
JER.49.37	I will send the sword after them
JER.49.37	until I finish them off.
JER.49.38	I will set my throne in Elam,
JER.49.38	and I will destroy the king and officials from there.
JER.49.38	This is the 
JER.49.39	Yet, in the last days,
JER.49.39	I will restore the fortunes of Elam.
JER.49.39	This is the 
JER.50.1	This is the word the 
JER.50.2	Announce to the nations;
JER.50.2	proclaim and raise up a signal flag;
JER.50.2	proclaim, and hide nothing.
JER.50.2	Say, “Babylon is captured;
JER.50.2	Bel
JER.50.2	Marduk is terrified.”
JER.50.2	Her idols are put to shame;
JER.50.2	her false gods, devastated.
JER.50.3	For a nation from the north will attack her;
JER.50.3	it will make her land desolate.
JER.50.3	No one will be living in it —
JER.50.3	both people and animals will escape.
JER.50.4	In those days and at that time —
JER.50.4	this is the 
JER.50.4	the Israelites and Judeans will come together,
JER.50.4	weeping as they come,
JER.50.4	and will seek the 
JER.50.5	They will ask about Zion,
JER.50.5	turning their faces to this road.
JER.50.5	They will come and join themselves
JER.50.5	in a permanent covenant
JER.50.6	My people were lost sheep;
JER.50.6	their shepherds led them astray,
JER.50.6	guiding them the wrong way in the mountains.
JER.50.6	They wandered from mountain to hill;
JER.50.6	they forgot their resting place.
JER.50.7	Whoever found them devoured them.
JER.50.7	Their adversaries said, “We’re not guilty;
JER.50.7	instead, they have sinned against the 
JER.50.7	their righteous grazing land,
JER.50.7	the hope of their ancestors,
JER.50.8	Escape from Babylon;
JER.50.8	depart from the Chaldeans’ land.
JER.50.8	Be like the rams that lead the flock.
JER.50.9	For I will soon stir up and bring against Babylon
JER.50.9	an assembly of great nations from the north country.
JER.50.9	They will line up in battle formation against her;
JER.50.9	from there she will be captured.
JER.50.9	Their arrows will be like a skilled
JER.50.9	who does not return empty-handed.
JER.50.10	The Chaldeans will become plunder;
JER.50.10	all Babylon’s plunderers will be fully satisfied.
JER.50.10	This is the 
JER.50.11	Because you rejoice,
JER.50.11	because you celebrate —
JER.50.11	you who plundered my inheritance —
JER.50.11	because you frolic like a young cow treading grain
JER.50.11	and neigh like stallions,
JER.50.12	your mother
JER.50.12	she who bore you will be put to shame.
JER.50.12	Look! She will lag behind all
JER.50.12	an arid wilderness, a desert.
JER.50.13	Because of the 
JER.50.13	she will not be inhabited;
JER.50.13	she will become a desolation, every bit of her.
JER.50.13	Everyone who passes through Babylon
JER.50.13	will be appalled
JER.50.13	and scoff because of all her wounds.
JER.50.14	Line up in battle formation around Babylon,
JER.50.14	all you archers!
JER.50.14	Shoot at her! Do not spare an arrow,
JER.50.14	for she has sinned against the 
JER.50.15	Raise a war cry against her on every side!
JER.50.15	She has thrown up her hands in surrender;
JER.50.15	her defense towers have fallen;
JER.50.15	her walls are demolished.
JER.50.15	Since this is the 
JER.50.15	take your vengeance on her;
JER.50.15	as she has done, do the same to her.
JER.50.16	Cut off the sower from Babylon
JER.50.16	as well as him who wields the sickle at harvest time.
JER.50.16	Because of the oppressor’s sword,
JER.50.16	each will turn to his own people,
JER.50.16	each will flee to his own land.
JER.50.17	Israel is a stray lamb, chased by lions.
JER.50.17	The first who devoured him was the king of Assyria;
JER.50.17	the last who crushed his bones
JER.50.17	was King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.
JER.50.18	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.50.19	I will return Israel to his grazing land,
JER.50.19	and he will feed on Carmel and Bashan;
JER.50.19	he will be satisfied
JER.50.19	in the hill country of Ephraim and of Gilead.
JER.50.20	In those days and at that time —
JER.50.20	this is the 
JER.50.20	one will search for Israel’s iniquity,
JER.50.20	but there will be none,
JER.50.20	and for Judah’s sins,
JER.50.20	but they will not be found,
JER.50.20	for I will forgive
JER.50.21	Attack the land of Merathaim,
JER.50.21	and those living in Pekod.
JER.50.21	Put them to the sword;
JER.50.21	completely destroy them —
JER.50.21	this is the 
JER.50.21	do everything I have commanded you.
JER.50.22	The sound of war is in the land
JER.50.22	a crushing blow!
JER.50.23	How the hammer of the whole earth
JER.50.23	is cut down and smashed!
JER.50.23	What a horror Babylon has become
JER.50.23	among the nations!
JER.50.24	Babylon, I laid a trap for you, and you were caught,
JER.50.24	but you did not even know it.
JER.50.24	You were found and captured
JER.50.24	because you pitted yourself against the 
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.25	and brought out his weapons of wrath,
JER.50.25	because it is a task of the Lord 
JER.50.25	in the land of the Chaldeans.
JER.50.26	Come against her from the most distant places.
JER.50.26	Open her granaries;
JER.50.26	pile her up like mounds of grain
JER.50.26	and completely destroy her.
JER.50.26	Leave her no survivors.
JER.50.27	Put all her young bulls to the sword;
JER.50.27	let them go down to the slaughter.
JER.50.27	Woe to them because their day has come,
JER.50.27	the time of their punishment.
JER.50.28	There is a voice of fugitives and refugees
JER.50.28	from the land of Babylon.
JER.50.28	The voice announces in Zion the vengeance of the 
JER.50.28	the vengeance for his temple.
JER.50.29	Summon the archers to Babylon,
JER.50.29	all who string the bow;
JER.50.29	camp all around her; let none escape.
JER.50.29	Repay her according to her deeds;
JER.50.29	just as she has done, do the same to her,
JER.50.29	for she has acted arrogantly against the 
JER.50.29	against the Holy One of Israel.
JER.50.30	Therefore, her young men will fall
JER.50.30	in her public squares;
JER.50.30	all the warriors will perish in that day.
JER.50.30	This is the 
JER.50.31	Look, I am against you, you arrogant one —
JER.50.31	this is the declaration of
JER.50.31	the Lord 
JER.50.31	for your day has come,
JER.50.31	the time when I will punish you.
JER.50.32	The arrogant will stumble and fall
JER.50.32	with no one to pick him up.
JER.50.32	I will set fire to his cities,
JER.50.32	and it will consume everything around him.
JER.50.33	This is what the 
JER.50.33	Israelites and Judeans alike have been oppressed.
JER.50.33	All their captors hold them fast;
JER.50.33	they refuse to release them.
JER.50.34	Their Redeemer is strong;
JER.50.34	the 
JER.50.34	He will fervently champion their cause
JER.50.34	so that he might bring rest to the earth
JER.50.34	but turmoil to those who live in Babylon.
JER.50.35	A sword is over the Chaldeans —
JER.50.35	this is the 
JER.50.35	against those who live in Babylon,
JER.50.35	against her officials, and against her sages.
JER.50.36	A sword is against the diviners,
JER.50.36	and they will act foolishly.
JER.50.36	A sword is against her heroic warriors,
JER.50.36	and they will be terrified.
JER.50.37	A sword is against his horses and chariots
JER.50.37	and against all the foreigners among them,
JER.50.37	and they will be like women.
JER.50.37	A sword is against her treasuries,
JER.50.37	and they will be plundered.
JER.50.38	A drought will come on her waters,
JER.50.38	and they will be dried up.
JER.50.38	For it is a land of carved images,
JER.50.38	and they go mad because of terrifying things.
JER.50.39	Therefore, desert creatures
JER.50.39	and ostriches will also live in her.
JER.50.39	It will never again be inhabited
JER.50.39	or lived in through all generations.
JER.50.40	Just as God demolished Sodom and Gomorrah
JER.50.40	and their neighboring towns
JER.50.40	this is the 
JER.50.40	so no one will live there;
JER.50.40	no human being will stay in it even temporarily
JER.50.40	as a temporary resident.
JER.50.41	Look! A people comes from the north.
JER.50.41	A great nation and many kings will be stirred up
JER.50.41	from the remote regions of the earth.
JER.50.42	They grasp bow and javelin.
JER.50.42	They are cruel and show no mercy.
JER.50.42	Their voice roars like the sea,
JER.50.42	and they ride on horses,
JER.50.42	lined up like men in battle formation
JER.50.42	against you, Daughter Babylon.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon has heard about them;
JER.50.43	his hands have become weak.
JER.50.43	Distress has seized him —
JER.50.43	pain, like a woman in labor.
JER.50.44	“Look, it will be like a lion coming from the thickets
JER.50.45	Therefore, hear the plans that the 
JER.50.46	At the sound of Babylon’s conquest the earth will quake; a cry will be heard among the nations.
JER.51.1	This is what the 
JER.51.1	I am about to rouse the spirit of a destroyer
JER.51.1	and against the population of Leb-qamai.
JER.51.2	I will send strangers to Babylon
JER.51.2	who will scatter her and strip her land bare,
JER.51.2	for they will come against her
JER.51.2	from every side in the day of disaster.
JER.51.3	Don’t let the archer string his bow;
JER.51.3	don’t let him put on
JER.51.3	Don’t spare her young men;
JER.51.3	completely destroy her entire army!
JER.51.4	Those who were slain will fall in the land of the Chaldeans,
JER.51.4	those who were pierced through, in her streets.
JER.51.5	For Israel and Judah are not left widowed
JER.51.5	by their God, the 
JER.51.5	though their land is full of guilt
JER.51.5	against the Holy One of Israel.
JER.51.6	Leave Babylon;
JER.51.6	save your lives, each of you!
JER.51.6	Don’t perish because of her guilt.
JER.51.6	For this is the time of the 
JER.51.6	he will pay her what she deserves.
JER.51.7	Babylon was a gold cup in the 
JER.51.7	making the whole earth drunk.
JER.51.7	The nations drank her wine;
JER.51.7	therefore, the nations go mad.
JER.51.8	Suddenly Babylon fell and was shattered.
JER.51.8	Wail for her;
JER.51.8	get balm
JER.51.8	perhaps she can be healed.
JER.51.9	We tried to heal Babylon,
JER.51.9	but she could not be healed.
JER.51.9	Abandon her!
JER.51.9	Let each of us go to his own land,
JER.51.9	for her judgment extends to the sky
JER.51.9	and reaches as far as the clouds.
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.10	come, let’s tell in Zion
JER.51.10	what the 
JER.51.11	Sharpen the arrows!
JER.51.11	Fill the quivers!
JER.51.11	The 
JER.51.11	of the kings of the Medes
JER.51.11	because his plan is aimed at Babylon
JER.51.11	to destroy her,
JER.51.11	for it is the 
JER.51.11	vengeance for his temple.
JER.51.12	Raise up a signal flag
JER.51.12	against the walls of Babylon;
JER.51.12	fortify the watch post;
JER.51.12	set the watchmen in place;
JER.51.12	prepare the ambush.
JER.51.12	For the 
JER.51.12	what he has threatened
JER.51.12	against those who live in Babylon.
JER.51.13	You who reside by abundant water,
JER.51.13	rich in treasures,
JER.51.13	your end has come,
JER.51.13	your life thread is cut.
JER.51.14	The 
JER.51.14	I will fill you up with men as with locusts,
JER.51.14	and they will sing the victory song over you.
JER.51.15	He made the earth by his power,
JER.51.15	established the world
JER.51.15	and spread out the heavens by his understanding.
JER.51.16	When he thunders,
JER.51.16	the waters in the heavens are tumultuous,
JER.51.16	and he causes the clouds
JER.51.16	to rise from the ends of the earth.
JER.51.16	He makes lightning for the rain
JER.51.16	and brings the wind from his storehouses.
JER.51.17	Everyone is stupid and ignorant.
JER.51.17	Every goldsmith is put to shame by his carved image,
JER.51.17	for his cast images are a lie;
JER.51.17	there is no breath in them.
JER.51.18	They are worthless,
JER.51.18	At the time of their punishment they will be destroyed.
JER.51.19	Jacob’s Portion
JER.51.19	because he is the one who formed all things.
JER.51.19	Israel is the tribe of his inheritance;
JER.51.19	the 
JER.51.20	You are my war club,
JER.51.20	my weapons of war.
JER.51.20	With you I will smash nations;
JER.51.20	with you I will bring kingdoms to ruin.
JER.51.21	With you I will smash the horse and its rider;
JER.51.21	with you I will smash the chariot and its rider.
JER.51.22	With you I will smash man and woman;
JER.51.22	with you I will smash the old man and the youth;
JER.51.22	with you I will smash the young man and the young woman.
JER.51.23	With you I will smash the shepherd and his flock;
JER.51.23	with you I will smash the farmer and his ox-team.
JER.51.23	With you I will smash governors and officials.
JER.51.24	“Before your very eyes, I will repay Babylon and all the residents of Chaldea for all their evil they have done in Zion.”
JER.51.24	This is the 
JER.51.25	Look, I am against you, devastating mountain.
JER.51.25	This is the 
JER.51.25	You devastate the whole earth.
JER.51.25	I will stretch out my hand against you,
JER.51.25	roll you down from the cliffs,
JER.51.25	and turn you into a charred mountain.
JER.51.26	No one will be able to retrieve a cornerstone
JER.51.26	or a foundation stone from you,
JER.51.26	because you will become desolate forever.
JER.51.26	This is the 
JER.51.27	Raise a signal flag
JER.51.27	blow a ram’s horn among the nations;
JER.51.27	set apart the nations against her.
JER.51.27	Summon kingdoms against her —
JER.51.27	Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz.
JER.51.27	Appoint a marshal against her;
JER.51.27	bring up horses like a swarm
JER.51.28	Set apart the nations for battle against her —
JER.51.28	the kings of Media,
JER.51.28	her governors and all her officials,
JER.51.28	and all the lands they rule.
JER.51.29	The earth quakes
JER.51.29	because the 
JER.51.29	to make the land of Babylon a desolation, without inhabitant.
JER.51.30	Babylon’s warriors have stopped fighting;
JER.51.30	they sit in their strongholds.
JER.51.30	Their might is exhausted;
JER.51.30	they have become like women.
JER.51.30	Babylon’s homes have been set ablaze,
JER.51.30	her gate bars are shattered.
JER.51.31	Messenger races to meet messenger,
JER.51.31	and herald to meet herald,
JER.51.31	to announce to the king of Babylon
JER.51.31	that his city has been captured
JER.51.31	from end to end.
JER.51.32	The fords have been seized,
JER.51.32	the marshes set on fire,
JER.51.32	and the fighting men are terrified.
JER.51.33	For this is what the 
JER.51.33	Daughter Babylon is like a threshing floor
JER.51.33	at the time it is trampled.
JER.51.33	In just a little while her harvest time will come.
JER.51.34	“King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has devoured me;
JER.51.34	he has crushed me.
JER.51.34	He has set me aside like an empty dish;
JER.51.34	he has swallowed me like a sea monster;
JER.51.34	he filled his belly with my delicacies;
JER.51.34	he has vomited me out.
JER.51.35	Let the violence done to me and my family be done to Babylon,”
JER.51.35	says the inhabitant of Zion.
JER.51.35	“Let my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea,”
JER.51.35	says Jerusalem.
JER.51.36	Therefore, this is what the 
JER.51.36	I am about to champion your cause
JER.51.36	and take vengeance on your behalf;
JER.51.36	I will dry up her sea
JER.51.36	and make her fountain run dry.
JER.51.37	Babylon will become a heap of rubble,
JER.51.37	a jackals’ den,
JER.51.37	a desolation and an object of scorn,
JER.51.37	without inhabitant.
JER.51.38	They will roar together like young lions;
JER.51.38	they will growl like lion cubs.
JER.51.39	While they are flushed with heat, I will serve them a feast,
JER.51.39	and I will make them drunk so that they celebrate.
JER.51.39	Then they will fall asleep forever
JER.51.39	and never wake up.
JER.51.39	This is the 
JER.51.40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter,
JER.51.40	like rams together with male goats.
JER.51.41	How Sheshach
JER.51.41	the praise
JER.51.41	What a horror Babylon has become
JER.51.41	among the nations!
JER.51.42	The sea has risen over Babylon;
JER.51.42	she is covered with its tumultuous waves.
JER.51.43	Her cities have become a desolation,
JER.51.43	an arid desert,
JER.51.43	a land where no one lives,
JER.51.43	where no human being even passes through.
JER.51.44	I will punish Bel
JER.51.44	I will make him vomit what he swallowed.
JER.51.44	The nations will no longer stream to him;
JER.51.44	even Babylon’s wall will fall.
JER.51.45	Come out from among her, my people!
JER.51.45	Save your lives, each of you,
JER.51.45	from the 
JER.51.46	May you not become cowardly and fearful
JER.51.46	when the report is proclaimed in the land,
JER.51.46	for the report will come one year,
JER.51.46	and then another the next year.
JER.51.46	There will be violence in the land
JER.51.46	with ruler against ruler.
JER.51.47	Therefore, look, the days are coming
JER.51.47	when I will punish Babylon’s carved images.
JER.51.47	Her entire land will suffer shame,
JER.51.47	and all her slain will lie fallen within her.
JER.51.48	Heaven and earth and everything in them
JER.51.48	will shout for joy
JER.51.48	because the destroyers from the north
JER.51.48	will come against her.
JER.51.48	This is the 
JER.51.49	Babylon must fall because of the slain of Israel,
JER.51.49	even as the slain of the whole earth fell
JER.51.49	because of Babylon.
JER.51.50	You who have escaped the sword,
JER.51.50	go and do not stand still!
JER.51.50	Remember the 
JER.51.50	and let Jerusalem come to your mind.
JER.51.51	We are ashamed
JER.51.51	because we have heard insults.
JER.51.51	Humiliation covers our faces
JER.51.51	because foreigners have entered
JER.51.51	the holy places of the 
JER.51.52	Therefore, look, the days are coming —
JER.51.52	this is the 
JER.51.52	when I will punish her carved images,
JER.51.52	and the wounded will groan
JER.51.52	throughout her land.
JER.51.53	Even if Babylon should ascend to the heavens
JER.51.53	and fortify her tall fortresses,
JER.51.53	destroyers will come against her from me.
JER.51.53	This is the 
JER.51.54	The sound of a cry from Babylon!
JER.51.54	The sound of terrible destruction
JER.51.54	from the land of the Chaldeans!
JER.51.55	For the 
JER.51.55	he will silence her mighty voice.
JER.51.55	Their waves roar like a huge torrent;
JER.51.55	the tumult of their voice resounds,
JER.51.56	for a destroyer is coming against her,
JER.51.56	against Babylon.
JER.51.56	Her warriors will be captured,
JER.51.56	their bows shattered,
JER.51.56	for the 
JER.51.56	he will certainly repay.
JER.51.57	I will make her princes and sages drunk,
JER.51.57	along with her governors, officials, and warriors.
JER.51.57	Then they will fall asleep forever
JER.51.57	and never wake up.
JER.51.57	This is the King’s declaration;
JER.51.57	the 
JER.51.58	This is what the 
JER.51.58	Babylon’s thick walls will be totally demolished,
JER.51.58	and her high gates set ablaze.
JER.51.58	The peoples will have labored for nothing;
JER.51.58	the nations will weary themselves only to feed the fire.
JER.51.59	This is what the prophet Jeremiah commanded Seraiah son of Neriah son of Mahseiah,
JER.51.60	Jeremiah wrote on one scroll about all the disaster that would come to Babylon;
JER.51.61	Jeremiah told Seraiah, “When you get to Babylon, see that you read all these words aloud. 
JER.51.62	Say, ‘
JER.51.63	When you have finished reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates River.
JER.51.64	Then say, ‘In the same way, Babylon will sink and never rise again because of the disaster I am bringing on her. They will grow weary.’”
JER.51.64	The words of Jeremiah end here.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah; she was from Libnah. 
JER.52.2	Zedekiah did what was evil in the 
JER.52.3	Because of the 
JER.52.4	In the ninth year of Zedekiah’s reign, on the tenth day of the tenth month, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon advanced against Jerusalem with his entire army. They laid siege to the city and built a siege wall against it all around. 
JER.52.5	The city was under siege until King Zedekiah’s eleventh year.
JER.52.6	By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city that the common people had no food. 
JER.52.7	Then the city was broken into, and all the warriors fled. They left the city at night by way of the city gate between the two walls near the king’s garden, though the Chaldeans surrounded the city. They made their way along the route to the Arabah.
JER.52.8	The Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. Zedekiah’s entire army left him and scattered. 
JER.52.9	The Chaldeans seized the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence on him.
JER.52.10	At Riblah the king of Babylon slaughtered Zedekiah’s sons before his eyes, and he also slaughtered the Judean commanders. 
JER.52.11	Then he blinded Zedekiah and bound him with bronze chains. The king of Babylon brought Zedekiah to Babylon, where he kept him in custody
JER.52.12	On the tenth day of the fifth month — which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon — Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guards, entered Jerusalem as the representative of
JER.52.13	He burned the 
JER.52.14	The whole Chaldean army with the captain of the guards tore down all the walls surrounding Jerusalem.
JER.52.15	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guards, deported some of the poorest of the people, as well as the rest of the people who remained in the city, the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen. 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guards, left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.
JER.52.17	Now the Chaldeans broke into pieces the bronze pillars for the 
JER.52.18	They also took the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, sprinkling basins, dishes, and all the bronze articles used in the temple service. 
JER.52.19	The captain of the guards took away the bowls, firepans, sprinkling basins, pots, lampstands, pans, and drink offering bowls
JER.52.20	As for the two pillars, the one basin, with the twelve bronze oxen under it, and the water carts
JER.52.21	One pillar was 27 feet
JER.52.22	and had a bronze capital on top of it.
JER.52.23	Each capital had ninety-six pomegranates all around it. All the pomegranates around the grating numbered one hundred.
JER.52.24	The captain of the guards also took away Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three doorkeepers. 
JER.52.25	From the city he took a court official
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guards, took them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
JER.52.27	The king of Babylon put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile from its land.
JER.52.28	These are the people Nebuchadnezzar deported:
JER.52.29	in his eighteenth year,
JER.52.30	in Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guards, deported 745 Jews. Altogether, 4,600 people were deported.
JER.52.31	On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year of the exile of Judah’s King Jehoiachin, King Evil-merodach of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, pardoned King Jehoiachin of Judah and released him from prison. 
JER.52.32	He spoke kindly to him and set his throne above the thrones of the kings who were with him in Babylon. 
JER.52.33	So Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes, and he dined regularly in the presence of the king of Babylon for the rest of his life. 
JER.52.34	As for his allowance, a regular allowance was given to him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, for the rest of his life.
LAM.1.1	How
LAM.1.1	the city
LAM.1.1	She who was great among the nations
LAM.1.1	has become like a widow.
LAM.1.1	The princess among the provinces
LAM.1.1	has been put to forced labor.
LAM.1.2	She weeps bitterly during the night,
LAM.1.2	with tears on her cheeks.
LAM.1.2	There is no one to offer her comfort,
LAM.1.2	not one from all her lovers.
LAM.1.2	All her friends have betrayed her;
LAM.1.2	they have become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Judah has gone into exile
LAM.1.3	following
LAM.1.3	she lives among the nations
LAM.1.3	but finds no place to rest.
LAM.1.3	All her pursuers have overtaken her
LAM.1.3	in narrow places.
LAM.1.4	The roads to Zion
LAM.1.4	for no one comes to the appointed festivals.
LAM.1.4	All her gates are deserted;
LAM.1.4	her priests groan,
LAM.1.4	her young women grieve,
LAM.1.4	and she herself is bitter.
LAM.1.5	Her adversaries have become her masters;
LAM.1.5	her enemies are at ease,
LAM.1.5	for the 
LAM.1.5	because of her many transgressions.
LAM.1.5	Her children have gone away
LAM.1.5	as captives before the adversary.
LAM.1.6	All the splendor
LAM.1.6	from Daughter Zion.
LAM.1.6	Her leaders are like stags
LAM.1.6	that find no pasture;
LAM.1.6	they stumble away exhausted
LAM.1.6	before the hunter.
LAM.1.7	During the days of her affliction and homelessness
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem remembers all her precious belongings
LAM.1.7	that were hers in days of old.
LAM.1.7	When her people fell into the adversary’s hand,
LAM.1.7	she had no one to help.
LAM.1.7	The adversaries looked at her,
LAM.1.7	laughing over her downfall.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem has sinned grievously;
LAM.1.8	therefore, she has become an object of scorn.
LAM.1.8	All who honored her now despise her,
LAM.1.8	for they have seen her nakedness.
LAM.1.8	She herself groans and turns away.
LAM.1.9	Her uncleanness stains her skirts.
LAM.1.9	She never considered her end.
LAM.1.9	Her downfall was astonishing;
LAM.1.9	there was no one to comfort her.
LAM.1.9	for the enemy boasts.
LAM.1.10	The adversary has seized
LAM.1.10	all her precious belongings.
LAM.1.10	She has even seen the nations
LAM.1.10	enter her sanctuary —
LAM.1.10	those you had forbidden
LAM.1.10	to enter your assembly.
LAM.1.11	All her people groan
LAM.1.11	while they search for bread.
LAM.1.11	They have traded their precious belongings for food
LAM.1.11	in order to stay alive.
LAM.1.11	how I have become despised.
LAM.1.12	Is this nothing to you, all you who pass by?
LAM.1.12	Look and see!
LAM.1.12	Is there any pain like mine,
LAM.1.12	which was dealt out to me,
LAM.1.12	which the 
LAM.1.12	on the day of his burning anger?
LAM.1.13	He sent fire from on high
LAM.1.13	he made it descend.
LAM.1.13	He spread a net for my feet
LAM.1.13	and turned me back.
LAM.1.13	He made me desolate,
LAM.1.13	sick all day long.
LAM.1.14	My transgressions have been formed into a yoke,
LAM.1.14	fastened together by his hand;
LAM.1.14	they have been placed on my neck,
LAM.1.14	and the Lord has broken my strength.
LAM.1.14	He has handed me over
LAM.1.14	to those I cannot withstand.
LAM.1.15	The Lord has rejected
LAM.1.15	all the mighty men within me.
LAM.1.15	He has summoned an army
LAM.1.15	to crush my young warriors.
LAM.1.15	The Lord has trampled Virgin Daughter Judah
LAM.1.15	like grapes in a winepress.
LAM.1.16	I weep because of these things;
LAM.1.16	my eyes flow
LAM.1.16	For there is no one nearby to comfort me,
LAM.1.16	no one to keep me alive.
LAM.1.16	My children are desolate
LAM.1.16	because the enemy has prevailed.
LAM.1.17	Zion stretches out her hands;
LAM.1.17	there is no one to comfort her.
LAM.1.17	The 
LAM.1.17	that his neighbors should be his adversaries.
LAM.1.17	Jerusalem has become
LAM.1.17	something impure
LAM.1.18	The 
LAM.1.18	for I have rebelled against his command.
LAM.1.18	Listen, all you people;
LAM.1.18	look at my pain.
LAM.1.18	My young women and young men
LAM.1.18	have gone into captivity.
LAM.1.19	I called to my lovers,
LAM.1.19	but they betrayed me.
LAM.1.19	My priests and elders
LAM.1.19	perished in the city
LAM.1.19	while searching for food
LAM.1.19	to keep themselves alive.
LAM.1.20	I am churning within;
LAM.1.20	my heart is broken,
LAM.1.20	for I have been very rebellious.
LAM.1.20	Outside, the sword takes the children;
LAM.1.20	inside, there is death.
LAM.1.21	People have heard me groaning,
LAM.1.21	but there is no one to comfort me.
LAM.1.21	All my enemies have heard of my misfortune;
LAM.1.21	they are glad that you have caused it.
LAM.1.21	Bring on the day you have announced,
LAM.1.21	so that they may become like me.
LAM.1.22	Let all their wickedness come before you,
LAM.1.22	and deal with them
LAM.1.22	as you have dealt with me
LAM.1.22	because of all my transgressions.
LAM.1.22	For my groans are many,
LAM.1.22	and I am sick at heart.
LAM.2.1	How the Lord has overshadowed
LAM.2.1	Daughter Zion with his anger!
LAM.2.1	He has thrown down Israel’s glory
LAM.2.1	from heaven to earth.
LAM.2.1	He did not acknowledge his footstool
LAM.2.1	in the day of his anger.
LAM.2.2	Without compassion
LAM.2.2	all the dwellings of Jacob.
LAM.2.2	In his wrath he has demolished
LAM.2.2	the fortified cities
LAM.2.2	He brought them to the ground
LAM.2.2	and defiled the kingdom and its leaders.
LAM.2.3	He has cut off every horn
LAM.2.3	in his burning anger
LAM.2.3	and withdrawn his right hand
LAM.2.3	in the presence of the enemy.
LAM.2.3	He has blazed against Jacob like a flaming fire
LAM.2.3	that consumes everything.
LAM.2.4	He has strung his bow like an enemy;
LAM.2.4	his right hand is positioned like an adversary.
LAM.2.4	He has killed everyone who was the delight to the eye,
LAM.2.4	pouring out his wrath like fire
LAM.2.4	on the tent of Daughter Zion.
LAM.2.5	The Lord is like an enemy;
LAM.2.5	he has swallowed up Israel.
LAM.2.5	He swallowed up all its palaces
LAM.2.5	and destroyed its fortified cities.
LAM.2.5	He has multiplied mourning and lamentation
LAM.2.5	within Daughter Judah.
LAM.2.6	He has wrecked his temple
LAM.2.6	as if it were merely a shack in a field,
LAM.2.6	destroying his place of meeting.
LAM.2.6	The 
LAM.2.6	appointed festivals and Sabbaths in Zion.
LAM.2.6	He has despised king and priest
LAM.2.6	in his fierce anger.
LAM.2.7	The Lord has rejected his altar,
LAM.2.7	repudiated his sanctuary;
LAM.2.7	he has handed the walls of her palaces
LAM.2.7	over to the enemy.
LAM.2.7	They have raised a shout in the house of the 
LAM.2.7	as on the day of an appointed festival.
LAM.2.8	The 
LAM.2.8	the wall of Daughter Zion.
LAM.2.8	He stretched out a measuring line
LAM.2.8	and did not restrain himself from destroying.
LAM.2.8	He made the ramparts and walls grieve;
LAM.2.8	together they waste away.
LAM.2.9	Zion’s gates have fallen to the ground;
LAM.2.9	he has destroyed and shattered the bars on her gates.
LAM.2.9	Her king and her leaders live among the nations,
LAM.2.9	instruction
LAM.2.9	and even her prophets receive
LAM.2.9	no vision from the 
LAM.2.10	The elders of Daughter Zion
LAM.2.10	sit on the ground in silence.
LAM.2.10	They have thrown dust on their heads
LAM.2.10	and put on sackcloth.
LAM.2.10	The young women of Jerusalem
LAM.2.10	have bowed their heads to the ground.
LAM.2.11	My eyes are worn out from weeping;
LAM.2.11	I am churning within.
LAM.2.11	My heart is poured out in grief
LAM.2.11	because of the destruction of my dear people,
LAM.2.11	because infants and nursing babies faint
LAM.2.11	in the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	They cry out to their mothers,
LAM.2.12	“Where is the grain and wine?” 
LAM.2.12	as they faint like the wounded
LAM.2.12	in the streets of the city,
LAM.2.12	as their life pours out
LAM.2.12	in the arms of their mothers.
LAM.2.13	What can I say on your behalf?
LAM.2.13	What can I compare you to, Daughter Jerusalem?
LAM.2.13	What can I liken you to,
LAM.2.13	so that I may console you, Virgin Daughter Zion?
LAM.2.13	For your ruin is as vast as the sea.
LAM.2.13	Who can heal you?
LAM.2.14	Your prophets saw visions for you
LAM.2.14	that were empty and deceptive;
LAM.2.14	they did not reveal your iniquity
LAM.2.14	and so restore your fortunes.
LAM.2.14	They saw pronouncements for you
LAM.2.14	that were empty and misleading.
LAM.2.15	All who pass by
LAM.2.15	scornfully clap their hands
LAM.2.15	They hiss
LAM.2.15	at Daughter Jerusalem:
LAM.2.15	Is this the city that was called
LAM.2.15	the perfection of beauty,
LAM.2.15	the joy of the whole earth?
LAM.2.16	All your enemies
LAM.2.16	open their mouths against you.
LAM.2.16	They hiss and gnash their teeth,
LAM.2.16	saying, “We have swallowed her up.
LAM.2.16	This is the day we have waited for!
LAM.2.16	We have lived to see it.”
LAM.2.17	The 
LAM.2.17	he has accomplished his decree,
LAM.2.17	which he ordained in days of old.
LAM.2.17	He has demolished without compassion,
LAM.2.17	letting the enemy gloat over you
LAM.2.17	and exalting the horn of your adversaries.
LAM.2.18	The hearts of the people cry out to the Lord.
LAM.2.18	Wall of Daughter Zion,
LAM.2.18	let your tears run down like a river
LAM.2.18	day and night.
LAM.2.18	Give yourself no relief
LAM.2.18	and your
LAM.2.19	Arise, cry out in the night
LAM.2.19	from the first watch of the night.
LAM.2.19	Pour out your heart like water
LAM.2.19	before the Lord’s presence.
LAM.2.19	Lift up your hands to him
LAM.2.19	for the lives of your children
LAM.2.19	who are fainting from hunger
LAM.2.19	at the head of every street.
LAM.2.20	to whom you have done this.
LAM.2.20	Should women eat their own children,
LAM.2.20	the infants they have nurtured?
LAM.2.20	Should priests and prophets
LAM.2.20	be killed in the Lord’s sanctuary?
LAM.2.21	Both young and old
LAM.2.21	are lying on the ground in the streets.
LAM.2.21	My young women and young men
LAM.2.21	have fallen by the sword.
LAM.2.21	You have killed them in the day of your anger,
LAM.2.21	slaughtering without compassion.
LAM.2.22	You summon those who terrorize me
LAM.2.22	as if for an appointed festival day;
LAM.2.22	on the day of the 
LAM.2.22	no one escaped or survived.
LAM.2.22	My enemy has destroyed
LAM.2.22	those I nurtured
LAM.3.1	I am the man who has seen affliction
LAM.3.1	under the rod of God’s wrath.
LAM.3.2	He has driven me away and forced me to walk
LAM.3.2	in darkness instead of light.
LAM.3.3	Yes, he repeatedly turns his hand
LAM.3.3	against me all day long.
LAM.3.4	He has worn away my flesh and skin;
LAM.3.4	he has broken my bones.
LAM.3.5	He has laid siege against me,
LAM.3.5	encircling me with bitterness and hardship.
LAM.3.6	He has made me dwell in darkness
LAM.3.6	like those who have been dead for ages.
LAM.3.7	He has walled me in so I cannot get out;
LAM.3.7	he has weighed me down with chains.
LAM.3.8	Even when I cry out and plead for help,
LAM.3.8	he blocks out my prayer.
LAM.3.9	He has walled in my ways with blocks of stone;
LAM.3.9	he has made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	He is
LAM.3.10	a lion in hiding.
LAM.3.11	He forced me off my way and tore me to pieces;
LAM.3.11	he left me desolate.
LAM.3.12	He strung his bow
LAM.3.12	and set me as the target for his arrow.
LAM.3.13	He pierced my kidneys
LAM.3.13	with shafts from his quiver.
LAM.3.14	I am a laughingstock
LAM.3.14	mocked by their songs
LAM.3.15	He filled me with bitterness,
LAM.3.15	satiated me with wormwood.
LAM.3.16	He ground my teeth with gravel
LAM.3.16	and made me cower
LAM.3.17	I have been deprived
LAM.3.17	I have forgotten what prosperity is.
LAM.3.18	Then I thought, “My future
LAM.3.18	as well as my hope from the 
LAM.3.19	Remember
LAM.3.19	the wormwood and the poison.
LAM.3.20	I continually remember them
LAM.3.20	and have become depressed.
LAM.3.21	Yet I call this to mind,
LAM.3.21	and therefore I have hope:
LAM.3.22	Because of the 
LAM.3.22	we do not perish,
LAM.3.22	for his mercies never end.
LAM.3.23	They are new every morning;
LAM.3.23	great is your faithfulness!
LAM.3.24	I say, “The 
LAM.3.24	therefore I will put my hope in him.”
LAM.3.25	The 
LAM.3.25	to the person who seeks him.
LAM.3.26	It is good to wait quietly
LAM.3.26	for salvation from the 
LAM.3.27	It is good for a man to bear the yoke
LAM.3.27	while he is still young.
LAM.3.28	Let him sit alone and be silent,
LAM.3.28	for God has disciplined
LAM.3.29	Let him put his mouth in the dust
LAM.3.29	perhaps there is still hope.
LAM.3.30	Let him offer his cheek
LAM.3.30	to the one who would strike him;
LAM.3.30	let him be filled with disgrace.
LAM.3.31	For the Lord
LAM.3.31	will not reject us forever.
LAM.3.32	Even if he causes suffering,
LAM.3.32	he will show compassion
LAM.3.32	according to the abundance of his faithful love.
LAM.3.33	For he does not enjoy bringing affliction
LAM.3.33	or suffering on mankind.
LAM.3.34	Crushing all the prisoners of the land
LAM.3.34	beneath one’s feet,
LAM.3.35	denying justice to a man
LAM.3.35	in the presence of the Most High,
LAM.3.36	or subverting a person in his lawsuit
LAM.3.36	the Lord does not approve of these things.
LAM.3.37	Who is there who speaks and it happens,
LAM.3.37	unless the Lord has ordained it?
LAM.3.38	Do not both adversity and good
LAM.3.38	come from the mouth of the Most High?
LAM.3.39	Why should any living person complain,
LAM.3.39	any man, because of the punishment for his sins?
LAM.3.40	Let us examine and probe our ways,
LAM.3.40	and turn back to the 
LAM.3.41	Let us lift up our hearts and our hands
LAM.3.41	to God in heaven:
LAM.3.42	“We have sinned and rebelled;
LAM.3.42	you have not forgiven.
LAM.3.43	“You have covered yourself in anger and pursued us;
LAM.3.43	you have killed without compassion.
LAM.3.44	You have covered yourself with a cloud
LAM.3.44	so that no prayer can get through.
LAM.3.45	You have made us disgusting filth
LAM.3.45	among the peoples.
LAM.3.46	“All our enemies
LAM.3.46	open their mouths against us.
LAM.3.47	We have experienced panic and pitfall,
LAM.3.47	devastation and destruction.”
LAM.3.48	My eyes flow with streams of tears
LAM.3.48	because of the destruction of my dear people.
LAM.3.49	My eyes overflow unceasingly,
LAM.3.49	without end,
LAM.3.50	until the 
LAM.3.50	from heaven and sees.
LAM.3.51	My eyes bring me grief
LAM.3.51	because of the fate of all the women in my city.
LAM.3.52	For no reason, my enemies
LAM.3.52	hunted me like a bird.
LAM.3.53	They smothered my life in
LAM.3.53	and threw stones on me.
LAM.3.54	Water flooded over my head,
LAM.3.54	and I thought, “I’m going to die!” 
LAM.3.55	I called on your name, 
LAM.3.55	from the depths of the pit.
LAM.3.56	You heard my plea:
LAM.3.56	Do not ignore my cry for relief.
LAM.3.57	You came near whenever I called you;
LAM.3.57	you said, “Do not be afraid.”
LAM.3.58	You championed my cause, Lord;
LAM.3.58	you redeemed my life.
LAM.3.59	judge my case.
LAM.3.60	You saw all their vengefulness,
LAM.3.60	all their plots against me.
LAM.3.61	all their plots against me.
LAM.3.62	The slander
LAM.3.62	attack me all day long.
LAM.3.63	When they sit and when they rise, look,
LAM.3.63	I am mocked by their songs.
LAM.3.64	You will pay them back what they deserve, 
LAM.3.64	according to the work of their hands.
LAM.3.65	You will give them a heart filled with anguish.
LAM.3.65	May your curse be on them!
LAM.3.66	You will pursue them in anger and destroy them
LAM.3.66	under your heavens.
LAM.4.1	How the gold has become tarnished,
LAM.4.1	the fine gold become dull!
LAM.4.1	The stones of the temple
LAM.4.1	at the head of every street.
LAM.4.2	Zion’s precious children —
LAM.4.2	once worth their weight in pure gold
LAM.4.2	how they are regarded as clay jars,
LAM.4.2	the work of a potter’s hands!
LAM.4.3	Even jackals offer their breasts
LAM.4.3	to nurse their young,
LAM.4.3	but my dear people have become cruel
LAM.4.3	like ostriches
LAM.4.4	The nursing baby’s tongue
LAM.4.4	clings to the roof of his mouth from thirst.
LAM.4.4	Infants beg for food,
LAM.4.4	but no one gives them any.
LAM.4.5	Those who used to eat delicacies
LAM.4.5	are destitute in the streets;
LAM.4.5	those who were reared in purple garments
LAM.4.5	huddle in trash heaps.
LAM.4.6	The punishment of my dear people
LAM.4.6	is greater than that of Sodom,
LAM.4.6	which was overthrown in an instant
LAM.4.6	without a hand laid on it.
LAM.4.7	Her dignitaries were brighter than snow,
LAM.4.7	whiter than milk;
LAM.4.7	their bodies
LAM.4.7	their appearance like lapis lazuli.
LAM.4.8	Now they appear darker than soot;
LAM.4.8	they are not recognized in the streets.
LAM.4.8	Their skin has shriveled on their bones;
LAM.4.8	it has become dry like wood.
LAM.4.9	Those slain by the sword are better off
LAM.4.9	than those slain by hunger,
LAM.4.9	who waste away, pierced with pain
LAM.4.9	because the fields lack produce.
LAM.4.10	The hands of compassionate women
LAM.4.10	have cooked their own children;
LAM.4.10	they became their food
LAM.4.10	during the destruction of my dear people.
LAM.4.11	The 
LAM.4.11	poured out his burning anger;
LAM.4.11	he has ignited a fire in Zion,
LAM.4.11	and it has consumed her foundations.
LAM.4.12	The kings of the earth
LAM.4.12	and all the world’s inhabitants did not believe
LAM.4.12	that an enemy or adversary
LAM.4.12	could enter Jerusalem’s gates.
LAM.4.13	Yet it happened because of the sins of her prophets
LAM.4.13	and the iniquities of her priests,
LAM.4.13	who shed the blood of the righteous within her.
LAM.4.14	Blind, they stumbled in the streets,
LAM.4.14	defiled by this blood,
LAM.4.14	so that no one dared
LAM.4.14	to touch their garments.
LAM.4.15	“Stay away! Unclean!” people shouted at them.
LAM.4.15	“Away, away! Don’t touch us!” 
LAM.4.15	So they wandered aimlessly.
LAM.4.15	It was said among the nations,
LAM.4.15	“They can stay here no longer.”
LAM.4.16	The 
LAM.4.16	he no longer watches over them.
LAM.4.16	The priests are not respected;
LAM.4.16	the elders find no favor.
LAM.4.17	All the while our eyes were failing
LAM.4.17	as we looked in vain for help;
LAM.4.17	we watched from our towers
LAM.4.17	for a nation that would not save us.
LAM.4.18	Our steps were closely followed
LAM.4.18	so that we could not walk in our streets.
LAM.4.18	Our end approached;
LAM.4.18	Our end had come!
LAM.4.19	Those who chased us were swifter
LAM.4.19	than eagles in the sky;
LAM.4.19	they relentlessly pursued us over the mountains
LAM.4.19	and ambushed us in the wilderness.
LAM.4.20	The 
LAM.4.20	was captured in their traps.
LAM.4.20	We had said about him,
LAM.4.20	“We will live under his protection among the nations.”
LAM.4.21	So rejoice and be glad, Daughter Edom,
LAM.4.21	you resident of the land of Uz!
LAM.4.21	Yet the cup
LAM.4.21	you will get drunk and expose yourself.
LAM.4.22	Daughter Zion, your punishment is complete;
LAM.4.22	he will not lengthen your exile.
LAM.4.22	But he will punish your iniquity, Daughter Edom,
LAM.4.22	and will expose your sins.
LAM.5.1	Look, and see our disgrace!
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers,
LAM.5.2	our houses to foreigners.
LAM.5.3	We have become orphans, fatherless;
LAM.5.3	our mothers are widows.
LAM.5.4	We must pay for the water we drink;
LAM.5.4	our wood comes at a price.
LAM.5.5	We are closely pursued;
LAM.5.5	we are tired, and no one offers us rest.
LAM.5.6	We made a treaty with
LAM.5.6	and with Assyria, to get enough food.
LAM.5.7	Our fathers sinned; they no longer exist,
LAM.5.7	but we bear their punishment.
LAM.5.8	Slaves rule over us;
LAM.5.8	no one rescues us from them.
LAM.5.9	We secure our food at the risk of our lives
LAM.5.9	because of the sword in the wilderness.
LAM.5.10	Our skin is as hot
LAM.5.10	from the ravages of hunger.
LAM.5.11	Women have been raped in Zion,
LAM.5.11	virgins in the cities of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes have been hung up by their hands;
LAM.5.12	elders are shown no respect.
LAM.5.13	Young men labor at millstones;
LAM.5.13	boys stumble under loads of wood.
LAM.5.14	The elders have left the city gate,
LAM.5.14	the young men, their music.
LAM.5.15	Joy has left our hearts;
LAM.5.15	our dancing has turned to mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen from our head.
LAM.5.16	Woe to us, for we have sinned.
LAM.5.17	Because of this, our heart is sick;
LAM.5.17	because of these, our eyes grow dim:
LAM.5.18	because of Mount Zion, which lies desolate
LAM.5.18	and has jackals prowling in it.
LAM.5.19	You, 
LAM.5.19	your throne endures from generation to generation.
LAM.5.20	Why do you continually forget us,
LAM.5.20	abandon us for our entire lives?
LAM.5.21	renew our days as in former times,
LAM.5.22	unless you have completely rejected us
LAM.5.22	and are intensely angry with us.
EZK.1.1	In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, while I was among the exiles by the Chebar Canal,
EZK.1.2	On the fifth day of the month — it was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s exile
EZK.1.3	the word of the 
EZK.1.4	I looked, and there was a whirlwind
EZK.1.5	The likeness of four living creatures came from it,
EZK.1.6	but each of them had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf, sparkling like the gleam of polished bronze.
EZK.1.8	They had human hands under their wings on their four sides.
EZK.1.9	Their wings were touching. The creatures did not turn as they moved; each one went straight ahead.
EZK.1.10	Their faces looked something like the face of a human,
EZK.1.11	That is what their faces were like. Their wings were spread upward; each had two wings touching that of another and two wings covering its body.
EZK.1.12	Each creature went straight ahead.
EZK.1.13	The likeness of the living creatures was like the appearance of blazing coals of fire or like torches.
EZK.1.14	The creatures were darting back and forth
EZK.1.15	When I looked at the living creatures, there was one wheel on the ground beside each of the four-faced creatures. 
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels
EZK.1.17	When they moved, they went in any of the four directions, without turning as they moved. 
EZK.1.18	Their rims were tall and awe-inspiring. Each of their four rims were full of eyes
EZK.1.19	When the living creatures moved,
EZK.1.20	Wherever the Spirit wanted to go, the creatures went in the direction the Spirit was moving. The wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
EZK.1.21	When the creatures moved, the wheels moved; when the creatures stopped, the wheels stopped; and when the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose alongside them, for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	Over the heads of the living creatures
EZK.1.23	and under the expanse their wings extended one toward another. They each also had two wings covering their bodies. 
EZK.1.24	When they moved, I heard the sound of their wings like the roar of a huge torrent,
EZK.1.25	A voice came from above the expanse over their heads; when they stopped, they lowered their wings. 
EZK.1.26	Something like a throne with the appearance of lapis lazuli was above the expanse over their heads.
EZK.1.27	From what seemed to be his waist up, I saw a gleam like amber, with what looked like fire enclosing it all around.
EZK.1.28	The appearance of the brilliant light all around was like that of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day.
EZK.2.1	He said to me, “Son of man, stand up on your feet
EZK.2.2	As he spoke to me, the Spirit entered me and set me on my feet,
EZK.2.3	He said to me, “Son of man, I am sending you to the Israelites, to
EZK.2.4	The descendants are obstinate
EZK.2.5	Whether they listen or refuse to listen
EZK.2.6	“But you, son of man, do not be afraid of them and do not be afraid of their words,
EZK.2.7	Speak my words to them whether they listen or refuse to listen,
EZK.2.8	“And you, son of man, listen to what I tell you: Do not be rebellious like that rebellious house. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.”
EZK.2.9	So I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me,
EZK.2.10	When he unrolled it before me, it was written on the front and back; words of lamentation, mourning, and woe were written on it.
EZK.3.1	He said to me: “Son of man, eat what you find here. Eat this scroll,
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll. 
EZK.3.3	“Son of man,” he said to me, “feed your stomach and fill your belly with this scroll I am giving you.” So I ate it,
EZK.3.4	Then he said to me: “Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak my words to them. 
EZK.3.5	For you are not being sent to a people of unintelligible speech or a difficult language but to the house of Israel — 
EZK.3.6	not to the many peoples of unintelligible speech or a difficult language, whose words you cannot understand. No doubt, if I sent you to them, they would listen to you.
EZK.3.7	But the house of Israel will not want to listen to you because they do not want to listen to me.
EZK.3.8	Look, I have made your face as hard as their faces and your forehead as hard as their foreheads.
EZK.3.9	I have made your forehead like a diamond, harder than flint. Don’t be afraid of them or discouraged by the look on their faces, though they are a rebellious house.”
EZK.3.10	Next he said to me: “Son of man, listen carefully to all my words that I speak to you and take them to heart. 
EZK.3.11	Go to your people, the exiles, and speak to them. Tell them, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.3.12	The Spirit then lifted me up,
EZK.3.13	with the
EZK.3.14	The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I left in bitterness and in an angry spirit, and the 
EZK.3.15	I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who were living by the Chebar Canal, and I sat there among them stunned for seven days.
EZK.3.16	Now at the end of seven days the word of the 
EZK.3.17	“Son of man, I have made you a watchman over the house of Israel.
EZK.3.18	If I say to the wicked person,
EZK.3.19	But if you warn a wicked person and he does not turn from his wickedness or his wicked way, he will die for his iniquity, but you will have rescued yourself.
EZK.3.20	Now if a righteous person turns from his righteousness and acts unjustly,
EZK.3.21	But if you warn the righteous person that he should not sin, and he does not sin, he will indeed live because he listened to your warning, and you will have rescued yourself.”
EZK.3.22	The hand of the 
EZK.3.23	So I got up and went out to the plain. The 
EZK.3.24	The Spirit entered me and set me on my feet.
EZK.3.25	As for you, son of man, they will put ropes on you
EZK.3.26	I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth,
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth,
EZK.4.1	“Now you, son of man, take a brick, set it in front of you, and draw the city of Jerusalem on it. 
EZK.4.2	Then lay siege against it:
EZK.4.3	Take an iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between yourself and the city. Face it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This will be a sign for the house of Israel.
EZK.4.4	“Then lie down on your left side and place the iniquity
EZK.4.5	For I have assigned you the years of their iniquity according to the number of days you lie down, 390 days; so you will bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
EZK.4.6	When you have completed these days, lie down again, but on your right side, and bear the iniquity of the house of Judah. I have assigned you forty days, a day for each year. 
EZK.4.7	Face the siege of Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it. 
EZK.4.8	Be aware that I will put cords on you so you cannot turn from side to side until you have finished the days of your siege.
EZK.4.9	“Also take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt. Put them in a single container and make them into bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the number of days you lie on your side, 390 days. 
EZK.4.10	The food you eat each day will weigh eight ounces;
EZK.4.11	You will also drink a ration of water, a sixth of a gallon,
EZK.4.12	You will eat it as you would a barley cake and bake it over dried human excrement in their sight.” 
EZK.4.13	The 
EZK.4.14	But I said, “Oh, Lord 
EZK.4.15	He replied to me, “Look, I will let you use cow dung instead of human excrement, and you can make your bread over that.” 
EZK.4.16	He said to me, “Son of man, I am going to cut off the supply of bread in Jerusalem.
EZK.4.17	for lack of bread and water. Everyone will be devastated and waste away because of their iniquity.
EZK.5.1	“Now you, son of man, take a sharp sword,
EZK.5.2	You are to burn a third of it in the city when the days of the siege have ended;
EZK.5.3	But you are to take a few strands from the hair and secure them in the folds of your robe.
EZK.5.4	Take some more of them, throw them into the fire, and burn them in it.
EZK.5.5	“This is what the Lord 
EZK.5.6	She has rebelled against my ordinances with more wickedness than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that surround her. For her people have rejected my ordinances and have not walked in my statutes.
EZK.5.7	“Therefore, this is what the Lord 
EZK.5.8	therefore, this is what the Lord 
EZK.5.9	Because of all your detestable practices, I will do to you what I have never done before and what I will never do again.
EZK.5.10	As a result, fathers will eat their sons
EZK.5.11	“Therefore, as I live” — this is the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.5.12	A third of your people will die by plague and be consumed by famine within you;
EZK.5.13	When my anger is spent and I have vented my wrath on them, I will be appeased.
EZK.5.14	“I will make you a ruin and a disgrace among the nations around you, in the sight of everyone who passes by. 
EZK.5.15	So you
EZK.5.16	When I shoot deadly arrows of famine at them, arrows for destruction that I will send to destroy you, inhabitants of Jerusalem, I will intensify the famine against you and cut off your supply of bread. 
EZK.5.17	I will send famine and dangerous animals against you. They will leave you childless. Plague and bloodshed will sweep through you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, the 
EZK.6.1	The word of the 
EZK.6.2	“Son of man, face the mountains of Israel
EZK.6.3	You are to say: Mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord 
EZK.6.4	Your altars will be desolated and your shrines
EZK.6.5	I will lay the corpses of the Israelites in front of their idols and scatter your bones around your altars. 
EZK.6.6	Wherever you live the cities will be in ruins and the high places will be desolate, so that your altars will lie in ruins and be desecrated,
EZK.6.7	The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I am the 
EZK.6.8	“Yet I will leave a remnant when you are scattered among the nations, for throughout the countries there will be some of you who will escape the sword.
EZK.6.9	Then your survivors will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive,

EZK.6.13	You will all know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	I will stretch out my hand against them,
EZK.7.1	The word of the 
EZK.7.2	“Son of man, this is what the Lord 
EZK.7.2	An end! The end has come
EZK.7.2	on the four corners of the earth.
EZK.7.3	The end is now upon you;
EZK.7.3	I will send my anger against you
EZK.7.3	and judge you according to your ways.
EZK.7.3	I will punish you for all your detestable practices.
EZK.7.4	I will not look on you with pity or spare you,
EZK.7.4	but I will punish you for your ways
EZK.7.4	and for your detestable practices within you.
EZK.7.4	Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.7.5	This is what the Lord 
EZK.7.5	Look, one disaster after another is coming!
EZK.7.6	An end has come; the end has come!
EZK.7.6	It has awakened against you.
EZK.7.6	Look, it is coming!
EZK.7.7	Doom
EZK.7.7	inhabitants of the land.
EZK.7.7	The time has come; the day is near.
EZK.7.7	There will be panic on the mountains
EZK.7.7	and not celebration.
EZK.7.8	I will pour out my wrath on you very soon;
EZK.7.8	I will exhaust my anger against you
EZK.7.8	and judge you according to your ways.
EZK.7.8	I will punish you for all your detestable practices.
EZK.7.9	I will not look on you with pity or spare you.
EZK.7.9	I will punish you for your ways
EZK.7.9	and for your detestable practices within you.
EZK.7.9	Then you will know
EZK.7.9	that it is I, the 
EZK.7.10	Here is the day! Here it comes!
EZK.7.10	Doom is on its way.
EZK.7.10	The rod has blossomed;
EZK.7.10	arrogance has bloomed.
EZK.7.11	Violence has grown into a rod of wickedness.
EZK.7.11	None of them will remain:
EZK.7.11	none of that crowd,
EZK.7.11	none of their wealth,
EZK.7.11	and none of the eminent
EZK.7.12	The time has come; the day has arrived.
EZK.7.12	Let the buyer not rejoice
EZK.7.12	and the seller not mourn,
EZK.7.12	for wrath is on her whole crowd.
EZK.7.13	The seller will certainly not return
EZK.7.13	to what was sold
EZK.7.13	as long as he and the buyer remain alive.
EZK.7.13	For the vision concerning her whole crowd
EZK.7.13	will not be revoked,
EZK.7.13	and because of the iniquity of each one,
EZK.7.13	none will preserve his life.
EZK.7.14	They have blown the trumpet
EZK.7.14	and prepared everything,
EZK.7.14	but no one goes to war,
EZK.7.14	for my wrath is on her whole crowd.
EZK.7.15	The sword is on the outside;
EZK.7.15	plague and famine are on the inside.
EZK.7.15	Whoever is in the field will die by the sword,
EZK.7.15	and famine and plague will devour
EZK.7.15	whoever is in the city.
EZK.7.16	The survivors among them will escape
EZK.7.16	and live on the mountains.
EZK.7.16	Like doves of the valley,
EZK.7.16	all of them will moan,
EZK.7.16	each over his own iniquity.
EZK.7.17	All their hands will become weak,
EZK.7.17	and all their knees will run with urine.
EZK.7.18	They will put on sackcloth,
EZK.7.18	and horror will overwhelm them.
EZK.7.18	Shame will cover all their faces,
EZK.7.18	and all their heads will be bald.
EZK.7.19	They will throw their silver into the streets,
EZK.7.19	and their gold will seem like something filthy.
EZK.7.19	Their silver and gold will be unable to save them
EZK.7.19	in the day of the 
EZK.7.19	They will not satisfy their appetites
EZK.7.19	or fill their stomachs,
EZK.7.19	for these were the stumbling blocks
EZK.7.19	that brought about their iniquity.
EZK.7.20	He appointed his beautiful ornaments for majesty,
EZK.7.20	but
EZK.7.20	their abhorrent things.
EZK.7.20	Therefore, I have made these
EZK.7.20	into something filthy to them.
EZK.7.21	I will hand these things over
EZK.7.21	to foreigners as plunder
EZK.7.21	and to the wicked of the earth as spoil,
EZK.7.21	and they will profane them.
EZK.7.22	I will turn my face from them
EZK.7.22	as they profane my treasured place.
EZK.7.22	Violent men will enter it and profane it.
EZK.7.23	Forge the chain,
EZK.7.23	for the land is filled with crimes of bloodshed,
EZK.7.23	and the city is filled with violence.
EZK.7.24	So I will bring the most evil of nations
EZK.7.24	to take possession of their houses.
EZK.7.24	I will put an end to the pride of the strong,
EZK.7.24	and their sacred places will be profaned.
EZK.7.25	Anguish is coming!
EZK.7.25	They will look for peace, but there will be none.
EZK.7.26	Disaster after disaster will come,
EZK.7.26	and there will be rumor after rumor.
EZK.7.26	Then they will look for a vision from a prophet,
EZK.7.26	but instruction will perish from the priests
EZK.7.26	and counsel from the elders.
EZK.7.27	The king will mourn;
EZK.7.27	the prince will be clothed in grief;
EZK.7.27	and the hands of the people of the land will tremble.
EZK.7.27	I will deal with them according to their own conduct,
EZK.7.27	and I will judge them by their own standards.
EZK.7.27	Then they will know that I am the 
EZK.8.1	In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, I was sitting in my house and the elders of Judah were sitting in front of me,
EZK.8.2	I looked, and there was someone who looked like a man.
EZK.8.3	He stretched out what appeared to be a hand and took me by the hair of my head. Then the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and carried me in visions of God
EZK.8.4	I saw the glory of the God of Israel
EZK.8.5	The 
EZK.8.6	He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what they are doing here — more detestable acts that the house of Israel is committing
EZK.8.7	Then he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked there was a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	He said to me, “Son of man, dig through the wall.” So I dug through the wall and discovered a doorway. 
EZK.8.9	He said to me, “Go in and see the detestable, wicked acts they are committing here.”
EZK.8.10	I went in and looked, and there engraved all around the wall was every kind of abhorrent thing — crawling creatures and beasts — as well as all the idols of the house of Israel.
EZK.8.11	Seventy elders from the house of Israel were standing before them, with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan
EZK.8.12	He said to me, “Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the darkness, each at the shrine of his idol? For they are saying, ‘The 
EZK.8.13	Again he said to me, “You will see even more detestable acts that they are committing.”
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the 
EZK.8.15	And he said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? You will see even more detestable acts than these.”
EZK.8.16	So he brought me to the inner court of the 
EZK.8.17	And he said to me, “Do you see this, son of man? Is it not enough for the house of Judah to commit the detestable acts they are doing here, that they must also fill the land with violence
EZK.8.18	Therefore I will respond with wrath.
EZK.9.1	Then he called loudly in my hearing, “Come near, executioners of the city, each of you with a destructive weapon in his hand.” 
EZK.9.2	And I saw six men coming from the direction of the Upper Gate,
EZK.9.3	Then the glory of the God of Israel
EZK.9.4	“Pass throughout the city of Jerusalem,” the 
EZK.9.5	He spoke to the others in my hearing: “Pass through the city after him and start killing; do not show pity or spare them!
EZK.9.6	Slaughter the old men, the young men and women, as well as the children and older women,
EZK.9.7	Then he said to them, “Defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain.
EZK.9.8	While they were killing, I was left alone. And I fell facedown and cried out, “Oh, Lord 
EZK.9.9	He answered me, “The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is extremely great; the land is full of bloodshed,
EZK.9.10	But as for me, I will not show pity or spare them.
EZK.9.11	Then the man clothed in linen and carrying writing equipment reported back, “I have done all that you commanded me.”
EZK.10.1	Then I looked, and there above the expanse over the heads
EZK.10.2	The 
EZK.10.3	Now the cherubim were standing to the south of the temple when the man went in, and the cloud
EZK.10.4	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	The sound of the cherubim’s wings could be heard as far as the outer court; it was like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
EZK.10.6	After the 
EZK.10.7	Then the cherub reached out his hand to the fire that was among them. He took some and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out. 
EZK.10.8	The cherubim appeared to have the form of human hands under their wings.
EZK.10.9	I looked, and there were four wheels beside the cherubim,
EZK.10.10	In appearance, all four looked alike, like a wheel within a wheel. 
EZK.10.11	When they moved, they would go in any of the four directions,
EZK.10.12	Their entire bodies,
EZK.10.13	As I listened the wheels were called “the wheelwork.” 
EZK.10.14	Each one had four faces:
EZK.10.15	The cherubim ascended; these were the living creatures I had seen by the Chebar Canal.
EZK.10.16	When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved beside them, and when they lifted their wings to rise from the earth, even then the wheels did not veer away from them. 
EZK.10.17	When the cherubim stopped,
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of the 
EZK.10.19	The cherubim lifted their wings and ascended from the earth right before my eyes;
EZK.10.20	These were the living creatures I had seen
EZK.10.21	Each had four faces and each had four wings,
EZK.10.22	Their faces looked like the same faces I had seen
EZK.11.1	The Spirit then lifted me up
EZK.11.2	The 
EZK.11.3	They are saying, ‘Isn’t the time near to build houses?
EZK.11.4	Therefore, prophesy against them. Prophesy, son of man!”
EZK.11.5	Then the Spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	You have multiplied your slain in this city,
EZK.11.7	“‘Therefore, this is what the Lord 
EZK.11.8	You fear the sword,
EZK.11.9	I will take you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners; I will execute judgments against you.
EZK.11.10	You will fall by the sword,
EZK.11.11	The city will not be a pot for you,
EZK.11.12	so you will know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	Now while I was prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died.
EZK.11.14	The word of the 
EZK.11.15	“Son of man, your own relatives, those who have the right to redeem your property,
EZK.11.16	“Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.11.17	“Therefore say, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.11.18	“When they arrive there, they will remove all its

EZK.11.20	so that they will follow my statutes,
EZK.11.21	But as for those whose hearts pursue their desire for abhorrent acts and detestable practices, I will bring their conduct down on their own heads.”
EZK.11.22	Then the cherubim, with the wheels beside them, lifted their wings,
EZK.11.23	The glory of the 
EZK.11.24	The Spirit lifted me up
EZK.11.25	I spoke to the exiles about all the things the 
EZK.12.1	The word of the 
EZK.12.2	“Son of man, you are living among a rebellious house.
EZK.12.3	“Now you, son of man, get your bags ready for exile and go into exile in their sight during the day. You will go into exile from your place to another place while they watch; perhaps they will understand, though they are a rebellious house. 
EZK.12.4	During the day, bring out your bags like an exile’s bags while they look on. Then in the evening go out in their sight like those going into exile. 
EZK.12.5	As they watch, dig through the wall and take the bags out through it. 
EZK.12.6	And while they look on, lift the bags to your shoulder and take them out in the dark; cover your face so that you cannot see the land. For I have made you a sign to the house of Israel.”
EZK.12.7	So I did just as I was commanded. In the daytime I brought out my bags like an exile’s bags. In the evening I dug through the wall by hand; I took them out in the dark, carrying them on my shoulder in their sight.
EZK.12.8	In the morning the word of the 
EZK.12.9	“Son of man, hasn’t the house of Israel, that rebellious house,
EZK.12.10	Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.12.11	You are to say, ‘I am a sign for you. Just as I have done, it will be done to them; they will go into exile,
EZK.12.12	The prince who is among
EZK.12.13	But I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans, yet he will not see it,
EZK.12.14	I will also scatter all the attendants who surround him and all his troops to every direction of the wind,
EZK.12.15	They will know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	But I will spare a few of them from the sword,
EZK.12.17	The word of the 
EZK.12.18	“Son of man, eat your bread with
EZK.12.19	Then say to the people of the land, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.12.20	The inhabited cities will be destroyed, and the land will become dreadful. Then you will know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	Again the word of the 
EZK.12.22	“Son of man, what is this proverb you people have about the land of Israel,
EZK.12.23	Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.12.24	For there will no longer be any false vision or flattering divination
EZK.12.25	But I, the 
EZK.12.26	The word of the 
EZK.12.27	“Son of man, notice that the house of Israel is saying, ‘The vision that he sees concerns many years from now;
EZK.12.28	Therefore say to them, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.13.1	The word of the 
EZK.13.2	“Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel who
EZK.13.3	This is what the Lord 
EZK.13.4	Your prophets, Israel, are like jackals among ruins. 
EZK.13.5	You did not go up to the gaps
EZK.13.6	They saw false visions and their divinations were a lie.
EZK.13.7	Didn’t you see a false vision and speak a lying divination when you proclaimed, “This is the 
EZK.13.8	“‘Therefore, this is what the Lord 
EZK.13.9	My hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and speak lying divinations.
EZK.13.10	“‘Since they have led my people astray by saying, “Peace,”
EZK.13.11	therefore, tell those plastering it with whitewash that it will fall. Torrential rain will come,
EZK.13.12	When the wall has fallen, will you not be asked, “Where’s the whitewash you plastered on it?”
EZK.13.13	“‘So this is what the Lord 
EZK.13.14	I will demolish the wall you plastered with whitewash and knock it to the ground so that its foundation is exposed.
EZK.13.15	After I exhaust my wrath against the wall and against those who plaster it with whitewash, I will say to you, “The wall is no more and neither are those who plastered it —  
EZK.13.16	those prophets of Israel who prophesied to Jerusalem and saw a vision of peace for her when there was no peace.”
EZK.13.17	“Now you, son of man, face
EZK.13.18	Say, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.13.19	You profane me among my people for handfuls of barley
EZK.13.20	“‘Therefore, this is what the Lord 
EZK.13.21	I will also tear off your veils and rescue my people from your hands,
EZK.13.22	Because you have disheartened the righteous person with lies (when I intended no distress),
EZK.13.23	therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination.
EZK.14.1	Some of the elders of Israel came
EZK.14.2	Then the word of the 
EZK.14.3	“Son of man, these men have set up idols in their hearts and have put their sinful stumbling blocks in front of themselves.
EZK.14.4	“Therefore, speak to them and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.14.5	so that I may take hold of the house of Israel by their hearts. They are all estranged from me because of their idols.’
EZK.14.6	“Therefore, say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.14.7	For when anyone from the house of Israel or from the aliens who reside in Israel separates himself from me, setting up idols in his heart and putting his sinful stumbling block in front of himself, and then comes to the prophet to inquire of me, I, the 
EZK.14.8	I will turn against that one and make him a sign and a proverb; I will cut him off from among my people.
EZK.14.9	“‘But if the prophet is deceived and speaks a message, it was I, the 
EZK.14.10	They will bear their punishment — the punishment of the one who inquires will be the same as that of the prophet —  
EZK.14.11	in order that the house of Israel may no longer stray from following me and no longer defile themselves
EZK.14.12	The word of the 
EZK.14.13	“Son of man, suppose a land sins against me by acting faithlessly, and I stretch out my hand against it to cut off its supply of bread,
EZK.14.14	Even if these three men
EZK.14.15	“Suppose I allow dangerous animals
EZK.14.16	Even if these three men were in it, as I live” — the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.14.17	“Or suppose I bring a sword
EZK.14.18	Even if these three men were in it, as I live” — the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.14.19	“Or suppose I send a plague into that land
EZK.14.20	Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were in it, as I live” — the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.14.21	“For this is what the Lord 
EZK.14.22	Even so, there will be survivors left in it, sons and daughters who will be brought out. Indeed, they will come out to you, and you will observe their conduct and actions.
EZK.14.23	They will bring you consolation when you see their conduct and actions, and you will know that it was not without cause that I have done what I did to it.”
EZK.15.1	Then the word of the 
EZK.15.2	“Son of man, how does the wood of the vine,
EZK.15.3	Can wood be taken from it to make something useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang things on? 
EZK.15.4	In fact, it is put into the fire as fuel.
EZK.15.5	Even when it was whole it could not be made into a useful object. How much less can it ever be made into anything useful when the fire has devoured it and it is charred!”
EZK.15.6	Therefore, this is what the Lord 
EZK.15.7	I will turn against them.
EZK.15.8	I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully.” This is the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.16.1	The word of the 
EZK.16.2	“Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable practices.
EZK.16.3	You are to say, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.16.4	As for your birth, your umbilical cord wasn’t cut on the day you were born,
EZK.16.5	No one cared enough about you to do even one of these things out of compassion for you. But you were thrown out into the open field because you were despised on the day you were born.
EZK.16.6	“‘I passed by you and saw you thrashing around in your blood, and I said to you as you lay in your blood, “Live!” Yes, I said to you as you lay in your blood, “Live!” 
EZK.16.7	I made you thrive
EZK.16.8	“‘Then I passed by you and saw you, and you were indeed at the age for love. So I spread the edge of my garment over you and covered your nakedness.
EZK.16.9	I washed you with water, rinsed off your blood, and anointed you with oil. 
EZK.16.10	I clothed you in embroidered cloth and provided you with fine leather
EZK.16.11	I adorned you with jewelry, putting bracelets on your wrists and a necklace around your neck. 
EZK.16.12	I put a ring in your nose,
EZK.16.13	So you were adorned with gold and silver,
EZK.16.14	Your fame spread among the nations because of your beauty, for it was perfect through my splendor,
EZK.16.15	“‘But you trusted in your beauty and acted like a prostitute because of your fame.
EZK.16.16	You took some of your clothing and made colorful high places for yourself, and you engaged in prostitution on them. These places should not have been built, and this should never have happened!
EZK.16.17	You also took your beautiful jewelry made from the gold and silver I had given you,
EZK.16.18	Then you took your embroidered clothing to cover them and set my oil and incense before them. 
EZK.16.19	The food that I gave you — the fine flour, oil, and honey that I fed you — you set it before them as a pleasing aroma.
EZK.16.20	“‘You even took your sons and daughters you bore to me and sacrificed them to these images as food.
EZK.16.21	You slaughtered my children and gave them up when you passed them through the fire
EZK.16.22	In all your detestable practices and acts of prostitution, you did not remember the days of your youth
EZK.16.23	“‘Then after all your evil — Woe, woe to you! — the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.16.24	you built yourself a mound and made yourself an elevated place in every square.
EZK.16.25	You built your elevated place at the head of every street
EZK.16.26	You engaged in promiscuous acts with Egyptian men, your well-endowed neighbors, and increased your prostitution
EZK.16.27	“‘Therefore, I stretched out my hand against you and reduced your provisions. I gave you over to the desire of those who hate you, the Philistine women,
EZK.16.28	Then you engaged in prostitution with the Assyrian men because you were not satisfied.
EZK.16.29	So you extended your prostitution to Chaldea,
EZK.16.30	“‘How your heart was inflamed with lust
EZK.16.31	building your mound at the head of every street and making your elevated place in every square. But you were unlike a prostitute because you scorned payment.
EZK.16.32	You adulterous wife, who receives strangers instead of her husband! 
EZK.16.33	Men give gifts to all prostitutes, but you gave gifts to all your lovers. You bribed them to come to you from all around for your sexual favors. 
EZK.16.34	So you were the opposite of other women in your acts of prostitution; no one solicited you. When you paid a fee instead of one being paid to you, you were the opposite.
EZK.16.35	“‘Therefore, you prostitute, hear the word of the 
EZK.16.36	This is what the Lord 
EZK.16.37	I am therefore going to gather all the lovers you pleased
EZK.16.38	I will judge you the way adulteresses and those who shed blood are judged.
EZK.16.39	I will hand you over to them, and they will demolish your mounds and tear down your elevated places. They will strip off your clothes,
EZK.16.40	They will bring a mob against you
EZK.16.41	They will burn your houses and execute judgments against you in the sight of many women. I will stop you from being a prostitute,
EZK.16.42	So I will satisfy my wrath against you,
EZK.16.43	Because you did not remember the days
EZK.16.44	“‘Look, everyone who uses proverbs will quote this proverb about you: “Like mother, like daughter.” 
EZK.16.45	You are the daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and children. You are the sister of your sisters,
EZK.16.46	Your older sister was Samaria,
EZK.16.47	Didn’t you walk in their ways and do their detestable practices? It was only a short time before all your ways were more corrupt than theirs.
EZK.16.48	“‘As I live — the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.16.49	Now this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters had pride, plenty of food,
EZK.16.50	They were haughty and did detestable acts before me, so I removed them when I saw this.
EZK.16.51	But Samaria did not commit even half your sins. You have multiplied your detestable practices beyond theirs and made your sisters appear righteous by all the detestable acts you have committed. 
EZK.16.52	You must also bear your disgrace, since you have helped your sisters out.
EZK.16.53	“‘I will restore their fortunes,
EZK.16.54	so you will bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you did when you comforted them.
EZK.16.55	As for your sisters, Sodom and her daughters and Samaria and her daughters will return to their former state. You and your daughters will also return to your former state. 
EZK.16.56	Didn’t you treat your sister Sodom as an object of scorn when you were proud, 
EZK.16.57	before your wickedness was exposed? It was like the time you were scorned by the daughters of Aram
EZK.16.58	You yourself must bear the consequences of your depravity and detestable practices
EZK.16.59	“‘For this is what the Lord 
EZK.16.60	But I will remember the covenant I made with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish a permanent covenant with you.
EZK.16.61	Then you will remember your ways
EZK.16.62	I will establish my covenant with you,
EZK.16.63	so that when I make atonement for all you have done, you will remember and be ashamed,
EZK.17.1	The word of the 
EZK.17.2	“Son of man, pose a riddle and speak a parable to the house of Israel.
EZK.17.3	You are to say, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.17.4	He plucked off its topmost shoot, brought it to the land of merchants, and set it in a city of traders. 
EZK.17.5	Then he took some of the land’s seed and put it in a fertile field;
EZK.17.6	It sprouted and became a spreading vine, low in height with its branches turned toward him,
EZK.17.7	“‘But there was another huge eagle with powerful wings and thick plumage. And this vine bent its roots toward him! It stretched out its branches to him from the plot where it was planted,
EZK.17.8	It had been planted in a good field by abundant water in order to produce branches, bear fruit, and become a splendid vine.’
EZK.17.9	“You are to say, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.17.10	Even though it is planted, will it flourish? Won’t it wither completely when the east wind strikes it?
EZK.17.11	The word of the 
EZK.17.12	“Now say to that rebellious house,
EZK.17.13	He took one of the royal family
EZK.17.14	so that the kingdom would be humble and not exalt itself
EZK.17.15	However, this king revolted against him
EZK.17.16	“‘As I live — this is the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.17.17	Pharaoh with his mighty army and vast company will not help him in battle,
EZK.17.18	He despised the oath by breaking the covenant. He did all these things even though he gave his hand in pledge.
EZK.17.19	“‘Therefore, this is what the Lord 
EZK.17.20	I will spread my net over him,
EZK.17.21	All the fugitives
EZK.17.22	“‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.17.22	I will take a sprig
EZK.17.22	from the lofty top of the cedar and plant it.
EZK.17.22	I will pluck a tender sprig
EZK.17.22	from its topmost shoots,
EZK.17.22	and I will plant it
EZK.17.22	on a high towering mountain.
EZK.17.23	I will plant it on Israel’s high mountain
EZK.17.23	so that it may bear branches, produce fruit,
EZK.17.23	and become a majestic cedar.
EZK.17.23	Birds of every kind will nest under it,
EZK.17.23	taking shelter in the shade of its branches.
EZK.17.24	Then all the trees of the field will know
EZK.17.24	that I am the 
EZK.17.24	I bring down the tall tree,
EZK.17.24	and make the low tree tall.
EZK.17.24	I cause the green tree to wither
EZK.17.24	and make the withered tree thrive.
EZK.17.24	I, the 
EZK.17.24	and I will do it.’”
EZK.18.1	The word of the 
EZK.18.2	“What do you mean by using this proverb concerning the land of Israel:
EZK.18.2	‘The fathers eat sour grapes,
EZK.18.2	and the children’s teeth are set on edge’?
EZK.18.3	As I live” — this is the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.18.4	Look, every life belongs to me.
EZK.18.5	“Suppose a man is righteous and does what is just and right: 
EZK.18.6	He does not eat at the mountain shrines
EZK.18.7	He doesn’t oppress anyone
EZK.18.8	He doesn’t lend at interest or for profit
EZK.18.9	He follows my statutes and keeps my ordinances, acting faithfully. Such a person is righteous; he will certainly live.”
EZK.18.10	“But suppose the man has a violent son, who sheds blood
EZK.18.11	though the father has done none of them. Indeed, when the son eats at the mountain shrines and defiles his neighbor’s wife, 
EZK.18.12	and when he oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, and does not return collateral, and when he looks to the idols, commits detestable acts,
EZK.18.13	and lends at interest or for profit, will he live? He will not live! Since he has committed all these detestable acts, he will certainly die. His death will be his own fault.
EZK.18.14	“Now suppose he has a son who sees all the sins his father has committed, and though he sees them, he does not do likewise. 
EZK.18.15	He does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of Israel. He does not defile his neighbor’s wife. 
EZK.18.16	He doesn’t oppress anyone, hold collateral, or commit robbery. He gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing. 
EZK.18.17	He keeps his hand from harming the poor, not taking interest or profit on a loan. He practices my ordinances and follows my statutes. Such a person will not die for his father’s iniquity. He will certainly live.
EZK.18.18	“As for his father, he will die for his own iniquity because he practiced fraud, robbed his brother, and did among his people what was not good.
EZK.18.19	But you may ask, ‘Why doesn’t the son suffer punishment for the father’s iniquity? ’ 
EZK.18.20	The person who sins is the one who will die.
EZK.18.21	“But if the wicked person turns from all the sins he has committed,
EZK.18.22	None of the transgressions he has committed will be held against him.
EZK.18.23	Do I take any pleasure in the death of the wicked?” 
EZK.18.24	But when a righteous person turns from his righteousness
EZK.18.25	“But you say, ‘The Lord’s way isn’t fair.’
EZK.18.26	When a righteous person turns from his righteousness and acts unjustly, he will die for this. He will die because of the injustice he has committed. 
EZK.18.27	But if a wicked person turns from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right, he will preserve his life. 
EZK.18.28	He will certainly live because he thought it over and turned from all the transgressions he had committed; he will not die. 
EZK.18.29	But the house of Israel says, ‘The Lord’s way isn’t fair.’ Is it my ways that are unfair, house of Israel? Instead, isn’t it your ways that are unfair?
EZK.18.30	“Therefore, house of Israel, I will judge each one of you according to his ways.”
EZK.18.31	Throw off all the transgressions you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit.
EZK.18.32	For I take no pleasure in anyone’s death.” This is the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.19.1	“As for you, take up a lament for the princes of Israel,
EZK.19.2	and say:
EZK.19.2	What was your mother? A lioness!
EZK.19.2	She lay down among the lions;
EZK.19.2	she reared her cubs among the young lions.
EZK.19.3	She brought up one of her cubs,
EZK.19.3	and he became a young lion.
EZK.19.3	After he learned to tear prey,
EZK.19.3	he devoured people.
EZK.19.4	When the nations heard about him,
EZK.19.4	he was caught in their pit.
EZK.19.4	Then they led him away with hooks
EZK.19.4	to the land of Egypt.
EZK.19.5	When she saw that she waited in vain,
EZK.19.5	that her hope was lost,
EZK.19.5	she took another of her cubs
EZK.19.5	and made him a young lion.
EZK.19.6	He prowled among the lions,
EZK.19.6	and he became a young lion.
EZK.19.6	After he learned to tear prey,
EZK.19.6	he devoured people.
EZK.19.7	He devastated their strongholds
EZK.19.7	and destroyed their cities.
EZK.19.7	The land and everything in it shuddered
EZK.19.7	at the sound of his roaring.
EZK.19.8	Then the nations from the surrounding provinces
EZK.19.8	set out against him.
EZK.19.8	They spread their net over him;
EZK.19.8	he was caught in their pit.
EZK.19.9	They put a wooden yoke on him
EZK.19.9	and led him away to the king of Babylon.
EZK.19.9	They brought him into the fortresses
EZK.19.9	so his roar could no longer be heard
EZK.19.9	on the mountains of Israel.
EZK.19.10	Your mother was like a vine in your vineyard,
EZK.19.10	planted by the water;
EZK.19.10	it was fruitful and full of branches
EZK.19.10	because of abundant water.
EZK.19.11	It had strong branches, fit for the scepters of rulers;
EZK.19.11	its height towered among the clouds.
EZK.19.11	So it was conspicuous for its height
EZK.19.11	as well as its many branches.
EZK.19.12	But it was uprooted in fury,
EZK.19.12	thrown to the ground,
EZK.19.12	and the east wind dried up its fruit.
EZK.19.12	Its strong branches were torn off and dried up;
EZK.19.12	fire consumed them.
EZK.19.13	Now it is planted in the wilderness,
EZK.19.13	in a dry and thirsty land.
EZK.19.14	Fire has gone out from its main branch
EZK.19.14	and has devoured its fruit,
EZK.19.14	so that it no longer has a strong branch,
EZK.19.14	a scepter for ruling.
EZK.19.14	This is a lament and should be used as a lament.”
EZK.20.1	In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, some of Israel’s elders came to inquire of the 
EZK.20.2	Then the word of the 
EZK.20.3	“Son of man, speak with the elders of Israel and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.20.4	“Will you pass judgment against them, will you pass judgment, son of man? Explain the detestable practices of their fathers to them.
EZK.20.5	Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.20.6	On that day I swore
EZK.20.7	I also said to them, “Throw away, each of you, the abhorrent things that you prize,
EZK.20.8	“‘But they rebelled against me and were unwilling to listen to me. None of them threw away the abhorrent things that they prized,
EZK.20.9	But I acted for the sake of my name,
EZK.20.10	“‘So I brought them out of the land of Egypt and led them into the wilderness.
EZK.20.11	Then I gave them my statutes and explained my ordinances to them — the person who does them will live by them.
EZK.20.12	I also gave them my Sabbaths to serve as a sign between me and them,
EZK.20.13	“‘But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness.
EZK.20.14	But I acted for the sake of my name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I had brought them out. 
EZK.20.15	However, I swore to them
EZK.20.16	because they rejected my ordinances, profaned my Sabbaths, and did not follow my statutes. For their hearts went after their idols.
EZK.20.17	Yet I spared them from destruction and did not bring them to an end in the wilderness.
EZK.20.18	“‘Then I said to their children in the wilderness, “Don’t follow the statutes of your fathers, defile yourselves with their idols, or keep their ordinances.
EZK.20.19	I am the 
EZK.20.20	Keep my Sabbaths holy,
EZK.20.21	“‘But the children rebelled against me.
EZK.20.22	But I withheld my hand and acted for the sake of my name, so that it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight I brought them out. 
EZK.20.23	However, I swore to them in the wilderness that I would disperse them among the nations and scatter them among the countries.
EZK.20.24	For they did not practice my ordinances but rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths, and their eyes were fixed
EZK.20.25	I also gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances
EZK.20.26	When they sacrificed every firstborn in the fire,
EZK.20.27	“Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel, and tell them, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.20.28	When I brought them into the land that I swore to give them and they saw any high hill or leafy tree,
EZK.20.29	So I asked them, “What is this high place you are going to?” And it is still called Bamah
EZK.20.30	“Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.20.31	When you offer your gifts, sacrificing your children in the fire,
EZK.20.32	“‘When you say, “Let us be like the nations, like the clans of other countries, serving wood and stone,”
EZK.20.33	As I live — the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.20.34	I will bring you from the peoples and gather you from the countries where you were scattered,
EZK.20.35	I will lead you into the wilderness of the peoples
EZK.20.36	Just as I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt,
EZK.20.37	I will make you pass under the rod
EZK.20.38	I will purge you of those who rebel and transgress against me.

EZK.20.42	When I lead you into the land of Israel, the land I swore to give your fathers, you will know that I am the 
EZK.20.43	There you will remember your ways and all your deeds by which you have defiled yourself,

EZK.21.14	“So you, son of man, prophesy and clap your hands together:
EZK.21.14	Let the sword strike two times, even three.

EZK.21.18	The word of the 
EZK.21.19	“Now you, son of man, mark out two roads that the sword of Babylon’s king can take. Both of them should originate from the same land. And make a signpost at the fork in the road to each city. 
EZK.21.20	Mark out a road that the sword can take to Rabbah of the Ammonites
EZK.21.21	For the king of Babylon stands at the split in the road, at the fork of the two roads, to practice divination: he shakes the arrows, consults the idols, and observes the liver. 
EZK.21.22	The answer marked
EZK.21.23	It will seem like false divination to those who have sworn an oath to the Babylonians,

EZK.22.25	The conspiracy of her prophets
EZK.22.26	Her priests do violence to my instruction and profane my holy things.
EZK.22.27	“Her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey, shedding blood, and destroying lives in order to make profit dishonestly. 
EZK.22.28	Her prophets plaster for them with whitewash by seeing false visions and lying divinations,
EZK.22.29	The people of the land have practiced extortion and committed robbery.
EZK.22.30	I searched for a man among them who would repair the wall
EZK.22.31	So I have poured out my indignation on them and consumed them with the fire of my fury. I have brought their conduct down on their own heads.”
EZK.23.1	The word of the 
EZK.23.2	“Son of man, there were two women,
EZK.23.3	who acted like prostitutes in Egypt,
EZK.23.4	The older one was named Oholah,
EZK.23.5	“Oholah acted like a prostitute even though she was mine. She lusted after her lovers, the Assyrians:
EZK.23.6	dressed in blue, governors and prefects, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on steeds. 
EZK.23.7	She offered her sexual favors to them; all of them were the elite of Assyria. She defiled herself with all those she lusted after and with all their idols. 
EZK.23.8	She didn’t give up her promiscuity that began in Egypt,
EZK.23.9	Therefore, I handed her over to her lovers,
EZK.23.10	They exposed her nakedness, seized her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. Since they executed judgment against her, she became notorious among women.
EZK.23.11	“Now her sister Oholibah saw this, but she was even more depraved in her lust than Oholah, and made her promiscuous acts worse than those of her sister.
EZK.23.12	She lusted after the Assyrians:
EZK.23.13	And I saw that she had defiled herself; both of them had taken the same path. 
EZK.23.14	But she increased her promiscuity when she saw male figures carved on the wall,
EZK.23.15	wearing belts on their waists and flowing turbans on their heads; all of them looked like officers, a depiction of the Babylonians in Chaldea, their native land. 
EZK.23.16	At the sight of them
EZK.23.17	Then the Babylonians came to her,
EZK.23.18	When she flaunted her promiscuity and exposed her nakedness, I turned away from her in disgust just as I turned away from her sister.
EZK.23.19	Yet she multiplied her acts of promiscuity, remembering the days of her youth when she acted like a prostitute in the land of Egypt 
EZK.23.20	and lusted after their lovers, whose sexual members
EZK.23.21	So you revisited the depravity of your youth, when the Egyptians caressed your nipples to enjoy your youthful breasts.
EZK.23.22	“Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Lord 
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans; Pekod, Shoa, and Koa;
EZK.23.24	They will come against you with an assembly of peoples and with weapons, chariots, and
EZK.23.25	When I vent my jealous rage on you,
EZK.23.26	They will strip off your clothes and take your beautiful jewelry.
EZK.23.27	So I will put an end to your depravity and sexual immorality, which began in the land of Egypt, and you will not look longingly at them or remember Egypt anymore.
EZK.23.28	“For this is what the Lord 
EZK.23.29	They will treat you with hatred, take all you have worked for, and leave you stark naked,
EZK.23.30	These things will be done to you because you acted like a prostitute with the nations,
EZK.23.31	You have followed the path of your sister, so I will put her cup in your hand.”
EZK.23.32	This is what the Lord 
EZK.23.32	“You will drink your sister’s cup,
EZK.23.32	which is deep and wide.
EZK.23.32	You will be an object of
EZK.23.32	for it holds so much.
EZK.23.33	You will be filled with drunkenness and grief,
EZK.23.33	with a cup of devastation and desolation,
EZK.23.33	the cup of your sister Samaria.
EZK.23.34	You will drink it and drain it;
EZK.23.34	then you will gnaw its broken pieces,
EZK.23.34	and tear your breasts.
EZK.23.34	For I have spoken.”
EZK.23.34	This is the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.23.35	Therefore, this is what the Lord 
EZK.23.36	Then the 
EZK.23.37	For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands; they have committed adultery with their idols. And the children they bore to me they have sacrificed in the fire
EZK.23.38	They also did this to me: they defiled my sanctuary
EZK.23.39	On the same day they slaughtered their children for their idols, they entered my sanctuary to profane it.
EZK.23.40	“In addition, they sent for men who came from far away when a messenger was dispatched to them. And look how they came! You bathed, painted your eyes,
EZK.23.41	You sat on a luxurious couch with a table spread before it,
EZK.23.42	The sound of a carefree crowd was there. Drunkards
EZK.23.43	Then I said concerning this woman worn out by adultery: Will they
EZK.23.44	Yet they had sex with her as one does with a prostitute. This is how they had sex with Oholah and Oholibah, those depraved women.

EZK.31.2	“Son of man, say to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his hordes,
EZK.31.2	‘Who are you like in your greatness?
EZK.31.3	Think of Assyria, a cedar in Lebanon,
EZK.31.3	with beautiful branches and shady foliage
EZK.31.3	and of lofty height.
EZK.31.3	Its top was among the clouds.
EZK.31.4	The waters caused it to grow;
EZK.31.4	the underground springs made it tall,
EZK.31.4	directing their rivers all around
EZK.31.4	the place where the tree was planted
EZK.31.4	and sending their channels
EZK.31.4	to all the trees of the field.
EZK.31.5	Therefore the cedar became greater in height
EZK.31.5	than all the trees of the field.
EZK.31.5	Its branches multiplied,
EZK.31.5	and its boughs grew long
EZK.31.5	as it spread them out
EZK.31.5	because of the abundant water.
EZK.31.6	All the birds of the sky
EZK.31.6	nested in its branches,
EZK.31.6	and all the animals of the field
EZK.31.6	gave birth beneath its boughs;
EZK.31.6	all the great nations lived in its shade.
EZK.31.7	It was beautiful in its size,
EZK.31.7	in the length of its limbs,
EZK.31.7	for its roots extended to abundant water.
EZK.31.8	The cedars in God’s garden could not eclipse it;
EZK.31.8	the pine trees couldn’t compare with its branches,
EZK.31.8	nor could the plane trees match its boughs.
EZK.31.8	No tree in the garden of God
EZK.31.8	could compare with it in beauty.
EZK.31.9	I made it beautiful with its many limbs,
EZK.31.9	and all the trees of Eden,
EZK.31.9	which were in God’s garden, envied it.
EZK.31.10	“‘Therefore, this is what the Lord 
EZK.31.11	I determined to hand it over to a ruler of nations;
EZK.31.12	Foreigners, ruthless men from the nations,
EZK.31.13	All the birds of the sky nested on its fallen trunk, and all the animals of the field were among its boughs. 
EZK.31.14	This happened so that no trees planted beside water would become great in height and set their tops among the clouds, and so that no other well-watered trees would reach them in height. For they have all been consigned to death, to the underworld, among the people
EZK.31.15	“‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.31.16	I made the nations quake at the sound of its downfall, when I threw it down to Sheol to be with those who descend to the Pit. Then all the trees of Eden,

EZK.38.8	After a long time you will be summoned. In the last years you will enter a land that has been restored from war
EZK.38.9	You, all of your troops, and many peoples with you will advance, coming like a thunderstorm; you will be like a cloud covering the land.
EZK.38.10	“‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.38.11	You will say, “I will advance against a land of open villages; I will come against a tranquil people who are living securely,
EZK.38.12	in order to seize spoil and carry off plunder,

EZK.38.14	“Therefore prophesy, son of man, and say to Gog, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.38.15	and come from your place in the remotest parts of the north
EZK.38.16	You will advance against my people Israel like a cloud covering the land. It will happen in the last days, Gog, that I will bring you against my land so that the nations may know me, when I show myself holy through you in their sight.
EZK.38.17	“‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.38.18	Now on that day, the day when Gog comes against the land of Israel — this is the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.38.19	I swear in my zeal and fiery rage:
EZK.38.20	The fish of the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, every creature that crawls on the ground, and every human being on the face of the earth will tremble before me. The mountains will be demolished, the cliffs will collapse, and every wall will fall to the ground. 
EZK.38.21	I will call for a sword against him on all my mountains — this is the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.38.22	I will execute judgment on him with plague and bloodshed. I will pour out torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and burning sulfur on him, as well as his troops and the many peoples who are with him.
EZK.38.23	I will display my greatness and holiness, and will reveal myself in the sight of many nations.
EZK.39.1	“As for you, son of man, prophesy against Gog and say, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.39.2	I will turn you around, drive you on,
EZK.39.3	Then I will knock your bow from your left hand and make your arrows drop from your right hand. 
EZK.39.4	You, all your troops, and the peoples who are with you will fall on the mountains of Israel. I will give you as food to every kind of predatory bird and to the wild animals. 
EZK.39.5	You will fall on the open field,

EZK.39.7	So I will make my holy name known among my people Israel and will no longer allow it to be profaned. Then the nations will know that I am the

EZK.39.9	“‘Then the inhabitants of Israel’s cities will go out, kindle fires, and burn the weapons — the small and large shields, the bows and arrows, the clubs and spears. For seven years they will use them to make fires. 
EZK.39.10	They will not gather wood from the countryside or cut it down from the forests, for they will use the weapons to make fires. They will take the loot from those who looted them and plunder those who plundered them.
EZK.39.11	“‘Now on that day I will give Gog a burial place there in Israel — the Travelers’ Valley
EZK.39.12	The house of Israel will spend seven months burying them in order to cleanse the land.
EZK.39.13	All the people of the land will bury them and their fame will spread
EZK.39.14	“‘They will appoint men on a full-time basis to pass through the land and bury the invaders
EZK.39.15	When they pass through the land and one of them sees a human bone, he will set up a marker next to it until the buriers have buried it in Hordes of Gog Valley.

EZK.39.19	You will eat fat until you are satisfied
EZK.39.20	At my table you will eat your fill of horses and riders, of mighty men and all the warriors. This is the declaration of the Lord

EZK.39.22	From that day forward the house of Israel will know that I am the 
EZK.39.23	And the nations will know that the house of Israel went into exile on account of their iniquity, because they dealt unfaithfully with me.
EZK.39.24	I dealt with them according to their uncleanness and transgressions, and I hid my face from them.
EZK.39.25	“So this is what the Lord 
EZK.39.26	They will feel remorse for
EZK.39.27	When I bring them back from the peoples and gather them from the countries of their enemies, I will demonstrate my holiness through them in the sight of many nations.
EZK.39.28	They will know that I am the

EZK.40.1	In the twenty-fifth year of our exile, at the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month in the fourteenth year after Jerusalem had been captured,
EZK.40.2	In visions of God
EZK.40.3	He brought me there, and I saw a man whose appearance was like bronze,
EZK.40.4	He spoke to me: “Son of man, look with your eyes, listen with your ears,
EZK.40.5	Now there was a wall surrounding the outside of the temple.
EZK.40.6	Then he came to the gate that faced east and climbed its steps.
EZK.40.7	Each recess was 10½ feet long and 10½ feet deep, and there was a space of 8¾ feet
EZK.40.8	Next he measured the gate’s portico; 
EZK.40.9	it
EZK.40.10	There were three recesses on each side of the east gate, each with the same measurements, and the jambs on either side also had the same measurements. 
EZK.40.11	Then he measured the width of the gate’s entrance; it was 17½ feet,
EZK.40.12	There was a barrier of 21 inches
EZK.40.13	Then he measured the gate from the roof of one recess to the roof of the opposite one; the distance was 43¾ feet.
EZK.40.14	Next, he measured the porch — 105 feet.
EZK.40.15	The distance from the front of the gate at the entrance to the front of the gate’s portico on the inside was 87½ feet.
EZK.40.16	The recesses and their jambs had beveled windows all around the inside of the gate.
EZK.40.17	Then he brought me into the outer court,
EZK.40.18	which flanked the courtyard’s gates and corresponded to the length of the gates; this was the lower pavement. 
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the exterior front of the inner court; it was 175 feet.
EZK.40.20	He measured the gate of the outer court facing north, both its length and width. 
EZK.40.21	Its three recesses on each side, its jambs, and its portico had the same measurements as the first gate: 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide. 
EZK.40.22	Its windows, portico, and palm trees had the same measurements as those of the gate that faced east. Seven steps led up to the gate, and its portico was ahead of them. 
EZK.40.23	The inner court had a gate facing the north gate, like the one on the east. He measured the distance from gate to gate; it was 175 feet.
EZK.40.24	He brought me to the south side, and there was also a gate on the south. He measured its jambs and portico; they had the same measurements as the others. 
EZK.40.25	Both the gate and its portico had windows all around, like the other windows. It was 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide. 
EZK.40.26	Its stairway had seven steps, and its portico was ahead of them. It had palm trees on its jambs, one on each side. 
EZK.40.27	The inner court had a gate on the south. He measured from gate to gate on the south; it was 175 feet.
EZK.40.28	Then he brought me to the inner court through the south gate. When he measured the south gate, it had the same measurements as the others. 
EZK.40.29	Its recesses, jambs, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both it and its portico had windows all around. It was 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide. 
EZK.40.30	(There were porticoes all around, 43¾ feet long and 8¾ feet wide.
EZK.40.31	Its portico faced the outer court, and its jambs were decorated with palm trees. Its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.32	Then he brought me to the inner court on the east side. When he measured the gate, it had the same measurements as the others. 
EZK.40.33	Its recesses, jambs, and portico had the same measurements as the others. Both it and its portico had windows all around. It was 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide. 
EZK.40.34	Its portico faced the outer court, and its jambs were decorated with palm trees on each side. Its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.35	Then he brought me to the north gate.
EZK.40.36	as did its recesses, jambs, and portico. It also had windows all around. It was 87½ feet long and 43¾ feet wide. 
EZK.40.37	Its portico
EZK.40.38	There was a chamber whose door opened into the gate’s portico.
EZK.40.39	Inside the gate’s portico there were two tables on each side, on which to slaughter the burnt offering, sin offering,
EZK.40.40	Outside, as one approaches the entrance of the north gate, there were two tables on one side and two more tables on the other side of the gate’s portico. 
EZK.40.41	So there were four tables inside the gate and four outside, eight tables in all on which the slaughtering was to be done. 
EZK.40.42	There were also four tables of cut stone for the burnt offering,
EZK.40.43	There were three-inch
EZK.40.44	Outside the inner gate, within the inner court, there were chambers for the singers:
EZK.40.45	Then the man said to me: “This chamber that faces south is for the priests who keep charge of the temple.
EZK.40.46	The chamber that faces north is for the priests who keep charge of the altar. These are the sons of Zadok,
EZK.40.47	Next he measured the court. It was square, 175 feet long and 175 feet wide. The altar
EZK.40.48	Then he brought me to the portico of the temple and measured the jambs of the portico; they were 8¾ feet thick on each side. The width of the gate was 24½ feet,
EZK.40.49	The portico was 35 feet
EZK.41.1	Next he brought me into the great hall and measured the jambs;
EZK.41.2	The width of the entrance was 17½ feet,
EZK.41.3	He went inside the next room and measured the jambs at the entrance;
EZK.41.4	He then measured the length of the room adjacent to the great hall, 35 feet, and the width, 35 feet.
EZK.41.5	Then he measured the wall of the temple; it was 10½ feet thick. The width of the side rooms all around the temple was 7 feet.
EZK.41.6	The side rooms were arranged one above another in three stories of thirty rooms each.
EZK.41.7	The side rooms surrounding the temple widened at each successive story, for the structure surrounding the temple went up by stages. This was the reason for the temple’s broadness as it rose. And so, one would go up from the lowest story to the highest by means of the middle one.
EZK.41.8	I saw that the temple had a raised platform surrounding it; this foundation for the side rooms was 10½ feet high.
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the outer wall of the side rooms was 8¾ feet. The free space between the side rooms of the temple 
EZK.41.10	and the outer chambers was 35 feet wide all around the temple.
EZK.41.11	The side rooms opened into the free space, one entrance toward the north and another to the south. The area of free space was 8¾ feet wide all around.
EZK.41.12	Now the building that faced the temple yard toward the west was 122½ feet
EZK.41.13	Then the man measured the temple; it was 175 feet
EZK.41.14	The width of the front of the temple along with the temple yard to the east was 175 feet. 
EZK.41.15	Next he measured the length of the building facing the temple yard to the west, with its galleries
EZK.41.15	The interior of the great hall and the porticoes of the court —  
EZK.41.16	the thresholds, the beveled windows,
EZK.41.17	reaching to the top of the entrance, and as far as the inner temple and on the outside. On every wall all around, on the inside and outside, was a pattern 
EZK.41.18	carved with cherubim and palm trees.
EZK.41.19	a human face turned toward the palm tree on one side,
EZK.41.20	Cherubim and palm trees were carved from the ground to the top of the entrance and on the wall of the great hall.
EZK.41.21	The doorposts of the great hall were square,
EZK.41.22	The altar was
EZK.41.23	The great hall and the sanctuary each had a double door,
EZK.41.24	and each of the doors had two swinging panels.
EZK.41.25	Cherubim and palm trees were carved on the doors of the great hall like those carved on the walls. There was a wooden canopy
EZK.41.26	There were beveled windows and palm trees on both sides,
EZK.42.1	Then the man led me out by way of the north gate into the outer court.
EZK.42.2	Along the length of the chambers, which was 175 feet,
EZK.42.3	Opposite the 35 foot space
EZK.42.4	In front of the chambers was a walkway toward the inside,
EZK.42.5	The upper chambers were narrower because the galleries took away more space from them than from the lower and middle stories of the building. 
EZK.42.6	For they were arranged in three stories and had no pillars like the pillars of the courts;
EZK.42.7	A wall on the outside ran in front of the chambers, parallel to them, toward the outer court; it was 87½ feet long. 
EZK.42.8	For the chambers on the outer court were 87½ feet long, while those facing the great hall were 175 feet long.
EZK.42.9	At the base of these chambers there was an entryway on the east side as one enters them from the outer court.
EZK.42.10	In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the south,
EZK.42.11	with a passageway in front of them, just like the chambers that faced north.
EZK.42.12	The entrance at the beginning of the passageway, the way in front of the corresponding
EZK.42.13	Then the man said to me, “The northern and southern chambers that face the courtyard are the holy chambers where the priests who approach the 
EZK.42.14	Once the priests have entered, they are not to go out from the holy area to the outer court until they have removed the clothes they minister in, for these are holy.
EZK.42.15	When he finished measuring inside the temple complex, he led me out by way of the gate that faced east and measured all around the complex.
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with a measuring rod;
EZK.42.16	it was 875 feet
EZK.42.17	He
EZK.42.17	it was 875 feet by the measuring rod.
EZK.42.18	He
EZK.42.18	it was 875 feet by the measuring rod.
EZK.42.19	Then he turned to the west side
EZK.42.19	and measured 875 feet by the measuring rod.
EZK.42.20	He measured the temple complex on all four sides. It had a wall all around it,
EZK.43.1	He led me to the gate,
EZK.43.2	and I saw the glory of the God of Israel
EZK.43.3	The vision I saw
EZK.43.4	The glory of the 
EZK.43.5	Then the Spirit lifted me up
EZK.43.6	While the man was standing beside me, I heard someone speaking to me from the temple.
EZK.43.7	He said to me: “Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place for the soles of my feet,
EZK.43.8	Whenever they placed their threshold next to my threshold and their doorposts beside my doorposts, with only a wall between me and them, they were defiling my holy name by the detestable acts they committed.
EZK.43.9	Now let them remove their prostitution and the corpses
EZK.43.10	“As for you, son of man, describe the temple to the house of Israel,
EZK.43.11	and they will be ashamed of all that they have done. Reveal
EZK.43.12	This is the law of the temple: All its surrounding territory on top of the mountain
EZK.43.13	“These are the measurements of the altar
EZK.43.14	The distance from the gutter on the ground to the lower ledge is 3½ feet,
EZK.43.15	The altar hearth
EZK.43.16	The hearth is square, 21 feet
EZK.43.17	The ledge is 24½ feet
EZK.43.18	Then he said to me: “Son of man,
EZK.43.19	You are to give a bull from the herd
EZK.43.20	“You are to take some of its blood and apply it to the four horns
EZK.43.21	Then you are to take away the bull for the sin offering, and it must be burned outside the sanctuary in the place appointed for the temple.
EZK.43.22	“On the second day you are to present an unblemished male goat as a sin offering. They will purify the altar just as they did with the bull. 
EZK.43.23	When you have finished the purification, you are to present a young, unblemished bull
EZK.43.24	You are to present them before the 
EZK.43.25	You will offer a goat for a sin offering each day for seven days.
EZK.43.26	For seven days the priests are to make atonement for the altar and cleanse it. In this way they will consecrate it
EZK.43.27	and complete the days of purification. Then on the eighth day
EZK.44.1	The man then brought me back toward the sanctuary’s outer gate that faced east, and it was closed. 
EZK.44.2	The 
EZK.44.3	The prince himself will sit in the gate to eat a meal before the 
EZK.44.4	Then the man brought me by way of the north gate to the front of the temple. I looked, and the glory of the 
EZK.44.5	The 
EZK.44.6	“Say to the rebellious people,
EZK.44.7	When you brought in foreigners,
EZK.44.8	You have not kept charge of my holy things
EZK.44.9	“This is what the Lord 
EZK.44.10	Surely the Levites who wandered away from me when Israel went astray, and who strayed from me after their idols,
EZK.44.11	Yet they will occupy my sanctuary, serving as guards at the temple gates
EZK.44.12	Because they ministered to the house of Israel before their idols and became a sinful stumbling block to them, therefore I swore an oath
EZK.44.13	They must not approach me to serve me as priests
EZK.44.14	Yet I will make them responsible for the duties of the temple
EZK.44.15	“But the Levitical priests descended from Zadok,
EZK.44.16	“They are the ones who may enter my sanctuary
EZK.44.17	When they enter the gates of the inner court they are to wear linen garments;
EZK.44.18	They are to wear linen turbans on their heads and linen undergarments around their waists.
EZK.44.19	Before they go out to the outer court,
EZK.44.20	“They may not shave their heads
EZK.44.21	No priest may drink wine before he enters the inner court.
EZK.44.22	He is not to marry a widow or a divorced woman, but may marry only a virgin from the offspring of the house of Israel,
EZK.44.23	They are to teach my people the difference between the holy and the common, and explain to them the difference between the clean and the unclean.
EZK.44.24	“In a dispute, they will officiate as judges and decide the case according to my ordinances.
EZK.44.25	A priest may not come near a dead person so that he becomes defiled.
EZK.44.26	After he is cleansed, he is to count off seven days for himself.
EZK.44.27	On the day he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court
EZK.44.28	“This will be their inheritance: I am their inheritance.
EZK.44.29	They will eat the grain offering, the sin offering,
EZK.44.30	The best of all the firstfruits of every kind and contribution of every kind from all your gifts will belong to the priests.
EZK.44.31	The priests may not eat any bird or animal that died naturally or was mauled by wild beasts.
EZK.45.1	“When you divide the land by lot as an inheritance,
EZK.45.2	In this area there will be a square section
EZK.45.3	From this holy portion,
EZK.45.4	It will be a holy area of the land to be used by the priests who minister in the sanctuary, who approach to serve the 
EZK.45.5	There will be another area 8⅓ miles long and 3⅓ miles wide for the Levites who minister in the temple;
EZK.45.6	“As the property of the city, set aside an area 1⅔ miles
EZK.45.7	And the prince will have the area on each side of the holy donation of land and the city’s property, adjacent to the holy donation and the city’s property, stretching to the west on the west side and to the east on the east side.
EZK.45.8	This will be his land as a possession in Israel. My princes will no longer oppress my people
EZK.45.9	“This is what the Lord 
EZK.45.10	“You are to have honest scales, an honest dry measure,
EZK.45.11	The dry measure
EZK.45.12	The shekel
EZK.45.13	“This is the contribution you are to offer: Three quarts
EZK.45.14	The quota of oil in liquid measures
EZK.45.15	And the quota from the flock is one animal out of every two hundred from the well-watered pastures of Israel. These are for the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and fellowship offerings, to make atonement for the people.”
EZK.45.16	“All the people of the land must take part in this contribution for the prince in Israel. 
EZK.45.17	Then the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings for the festivals, New Moons, and Sabbaths — for all the appointed times of the house of Israel — will be the prince’s responsibility. He will provide the sin offerings, grain offerings, burnt offerings, and fellowship offerings to make atonement on behalf of the house of Israel.
EZK.45.18	“This is what the Lord 
EZK.45.19	The priest is to take some of the blood from the sin offering and apply it to the temple doorposts, the four corners of the altar’s ledge, and the doorposts of the gate of the inner court.
EZK.45.20	You are to do the same thing on the seventh day of the month for everyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance.
EZK.45.21	“In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you are to celebrate the Passover, a festival of seven days during which unleavened bread will be eaten.
EZK.45.22	On that day the prince will provide a bull as a sin offering on behalf of himself and all the people of the land. 
EZK.45.23	During the seven days of the festival, he will provide seven bulls and seven rams without blemish as a burnt offering to the 
EZK.45.24	He will also provide a grain offering of half a bushel
EZK.45.25	At the festival that begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month,
EZK.46.1	“This is what the Lord 
EZK.46.2	The prince should enter from the outside by way of the gate’s portico and stand at the gate’s doorpost while the priests sacrifice his burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. He will bow in worship at the gate’s threshold and then depart, but the gate is not to be closed until evening. 
EZK.46.3	The people of the land will also bow in worship before the 
EZK.46.4	“The burnt offering that the prince presents to the 
EZK.46.5	The grain offering will be half a bushel
EZK.46.6	On the day of the New Moon, the burnt offering is to be a young, unblemished bull, as well as six lambs and a ram without blemish. 
EZK.46.7	He will provide a grain offering of half a bushel with the bull, half a bushel with the ram, and whatever he can afford with the lambs, together with a gallon of oil for every half bushel. 
EZK.46.8	When the prince enters,
EZK.46.9	“When the people of the land come before the 
EZK.46.10	When the people enter, the prince will enter with them, and when they leave, he will leave. 
EZK.46.11	At the festivals and appointed times, the grain offering will be half a bushel with the bull, half a bushel with the ram, and whatever he wants to give with the lambs, along with a gallon of oil for every half bushel.
EZK.46.12	“When the prince makes a freewill offering, whether a burnt offering or a fellowship offering as a freewill offering to the 
EZK.46.13	“You are to offer an unblemished year-old male lamb as a daily burnt offering to the 
EZK.46.14	You are also to prepare a grain offering every morning along with it: three quarts,
EZK.46.15	They will offer the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil every morning as a regular burnt offering.
EZK.46.16	“This is what the Lord 
EZK.46.17	But if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, it will belong to that servant until the year of freedom,
EZK.46.18	The prince must not take any of the people’s inheritance, evicting them from their property.
EZK.46.19	Then he brought me through the entrance
EZK.46.20	He said to me, “This is the place where the priests will boil the guilt offering and the sin offering,
EZK.46.21	Next he brought me into the outer court and led me past its four corners. There was a separate court in each of its corners. 
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the outer court there were enclosed
EZK.46.23	There was a stone wall
EZK.46.24	He said to me: “These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple will cook the people’s sacrifices.”
EZK.47.1	Then he brought me back to the entrance of the temple and there was water flowing from under the threshold of the temple toward the east, for the temple faced east. The water was coming down from under the south side of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar.
EZK.47.2	Next he brought me out by way of the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate that faced east; there the water was trickling from the south side. 
EZK.47.3	As the man went out east with a measuring line in his hand,
EZK.47.4	Then he measured off a third of a mile and led me through the water. It came up to my knees. He measured off another third of a mile and led me through the water. It came up to my waist. 
EZK.47.5	Again he measured off a third of a mile, and it was a river that I could not cross on foot. For the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be crossed on foot.
EZK.47.6	He asked me, “Do you see this, son of man?” Then he led me back to the bank of the river. 
EZK.47.7	When I had returned, I saw a very large number of trees along both sides of the riverbank.
EZK.47.8	He said to me, “This water flows out to the eastern region and goes down to the Arabah. When it enters the sea, the sea of foul water,
EZK.47.9	Every kind of living creature that swarms will live wherever the river flows,
EZK.47.10	Fishermen will stand beside it from En-gedi to En-eglaim.
EZK.47.11	Yet its swamps and marshes will not be healed; they will be left for salt. 
EZK.47.12	All kinds of trees providing food will grow along both banks of the river. Their leaves will not wither, and their fruit will not fail.
EZK.47.13	This is what the Lord 
EZK.47.14	You will inherit it in equal portions, since I swore
EZK.47.15	This is to be the border of the land:
EZK.47.15	On the north side
EZK.47.16	Berothah, and Sibraim (which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), as far as Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran. 
EZK.47.17	So the border will run from the sea to Hazar-enon at the border
EZK.47.18	On the east side it will run between Hauran and Damascus, along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; you will measure from the northern border to the eastern sea.
EZK.47.19	On the south side it will run from Tamar to the Waters of Meribath-kadesh,
EZK.47.20	On the west side the Mediterranean Sea will be the border, from the southern border up to a point opposite Lebo-hamath. This will be the western side.
EZK.47.21	“You are to divide this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel.
EZK.47.22	You will allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens residing among you,
EZK.47.23	In whatever tribe the alien resides, you will assign his inheritance there.” This is the declaration of the Lord 
EZK.48.1	“Now these are the names of the tribes:
EZK.48.1	From the northern end, along the road of Hethlon, to Lebo-hamath as far as Hazar-enon, at the northern border of Damascus, alongside Hamath and extending from the eastern side to the sea, will be Dan — one portion.
EZK.48.2	Next to the territory of Dan, from the east side to the west, will be Asher — one portion.
EZK.48.3	Next to the territory of Asher, from the east side to the west, will be Naphtali — one portion.

EZK.48.10	This holy donation will be set apart for the priests alone. It will be 8⅓ miles long on the northern side, 3⅓ miles wide on the western side, 3⅓ miles wide on the eastern side, and 8⅓ miles long on the southern side. The 
EZK.48.11	It is for the consecrated priests, the sons of Zadok, who kept my charge
EZK.48.12	It will be a special donation for them out of the holy donation of the land, a most holy place adjacent to the territory of the Levites.
EZK.48.13	“Next to the territory of the priests, the Levites will have an area 8⅓ miles long and 3⅓ miles wide. The total length will be 8⅓ miles and the width 3⅓ miles.
EZK.48.14	They must not sell or exchange any of it, and they must not transfer this choice part of the land, for it is holy to the

EZK.48.16	These are the city’s measurements:
EZK.48.16	1½ miles
EZK.48.16	1½ miles on the south side;
EZK.48.16	1½ miles on the east side;

EZK.48.17	and 425 feet to the west.
EZK.48.18	“The remainder of the length alongside the holy donation will be 3⅓ miles to the east and 3⅓ miles to the west. It will run alongside the holy donation. Its produce will be food for the workers of the city. 
EZK.48.19	The city’s workers from all the tribes of Israel will cultivate it.
EZK.48.20	The entire donation will be 8⅓ miles by 8⅓ miles; you are to set apart the holy donation along with the city property as a square area.
EZK.48.21	“The remaining area on both sides of the holy donation and the city property will belong to the prince.
EZK.48.22	Except for the Levitical property and the city property in the middle of the area belonging to the prince, the area between the territory of Judah and that of Benjamin will belong to the prince.
EZK.48.23	“As for the rest of the tribes:
EZK.48.23	From the east side to the west, will be Benjamin — one portion.
EZK.48.24	Next to the territory of Benjamin, from the east side to the west, will be Simeon — one portion.

EZK.48.27	Next to the territory of Zebulun, from the east side to the west, will be Gad — one portion.
EZK.48.28	Next to the territory of Gad toward the south side, the border will run from Tamar to the Waters
EZK.48.29	This is the land you are to allot as an inheritance to Israel’s tribes,
EZK.48.30	“These are the exits of the city:
EZK.48.30	On the north side, which measures 1½ miles, 
EZK.48.31	there will be three gates facing north, the gates of the city being named for the tribes of Israel: one, the gate of Reuben; one, the gate of Judah; and one, the gate of Levi.
EZK.48.32	On the east side, which is 1½ miles, there will be three gates: one, the gate of Joseph; one, the gate of Benjamin; and one, the gate of Dan.
EZK.48.33	On the south side, which measures 1½ miles, there will be three gates: one, the gate of Simeon; one, the gate of Issachar; and one, the gate of Zebulun.

DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim
DAN.1.2	The Lord handed King Jehoiakim of Judah over to him, along with some of the vessels from the house of God.
DAN.1.3	The king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief eunuch,
DAN.1.4	young men without any physical defect, good-looking, suitable for instruction in all wisdom,
DAN.1.5	The king assigned them daily provisions from the royal food and from the wine that he drank.
DAN.1.6	Among them, from the Judahites, were Daniel,
DAN.1.7	The chief eunuch gave them names; he gave the name Belteshazzar to Daniel, Shadrach to Hananiah, Meshach to Mishael, and Abednego to Azariah.
DAN.1.8	Daniel determined that he would not defile himself with the king’s food
DAN.1.9	God had granted Daniel kindness and compassion from the chief eunuch,
DAN.1.10	yet he said to Daniel, “I fear my lord the king, who assigned your food and drink. What if he sees your faces looking thinner than the other young men your age? You would endanger my life
DAN.1.11	So Daniel said to the guard whom the chief eunuch had assigned to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, 
DAN.1.12	“Please test your servants for ten days. Let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	Then examine our appearance and the appearance of the young men who are eating the king’s food, and deal with your servants based on what you see.” 
DAN.1.14	He agreed with them about this and tested them for ten days. 
DAN.1.15	At the end of ten days they looked better and healthier
DAN.1.16	So the guard continued to remove their food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables.
DAN.1.17	God gave these four young men knowledge and understanding
DAN.1.18	At the end of the time that the king had said to present them, the chief eunuch presented them to Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	The king interviewed them, and among all of them, no one was found equal to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
DAN.1.20	In every matter of wisdom and understanding that the king consulted them about, he found them ten times
DAN.1.21	Daniel remained there until the first year of King Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	In the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams
DAN.2.2	So the king gave orders to summon the magicians, mediums, sorcerers, and Chaldeans
DAN.2.3	he said to them, “I have had a dream and am anxious to understand it.”
DAN.2.4	The Chaldeans spoke to the king (Aramaic
DAN.2.5	The king replied to the Chaldeans, “My word is final: If you don’t tell me the dream and its interpretation, you will be torn limb from limb,
DAN.2.6	But if you make the dream and its interpretation known to me, you’ll receive gifts, a reward, and great honor from me.
DAN.2.7	They answered a second time, “May the king tell the dream to his servants, and we will make known the interpretation.”
DAN.2.8	The king replied, “I know for certain you are trying to gain some time, because you see that my word is final. 
DAN.2.9	If you don’t tell me the dream, there is one decree for you.
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered the king, “No one on earth can make known what the king requests.
DAN.2.11	What the king is asking is so difficult that no one can make it known to him except the gods, whose dwelling is not with mortals.”
DAN.2.12	Because of this, the king became violently angry
DAN.2.13	The decree was issued that the wise men were to be executed, and they searched for Daniel and his friends, to execute them.
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel responded with tact and discretion to Arioch, the captain of the king’s guard,
DAN.2.15	He asked Arioch, the king’s officer, “Why is the decree from the king so harsh?” 
DAN.2.16	So Daniel went and asked the king to give him some time, so that he could give the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about the matter, 
DAN.2.18	urging them to ask the God of the heavens
DAN.2.19	The mystery was then revealed to Daniel in a vision
DAN.2.20	and declared:
DAN.2.20	May the name of God
DAN.2.20	be praised forever and ever,
DAN.2.20	for wisdom
DAN.2.21	He changes the times and seasons;
DAN.2.21	he removes kings and establishes kings.
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to the wise
DAN.2.21	and knowledge to those
DAN.2.21	who have understanding.
DAN.2.22	He reveals the deep and hidden things;
DAN.2.22	he knows what is in the darkness,
DAN.2.22	and light dwells with him.
DAN.2.23	I offer thanks and praise to you,
DAN.2.23	God of my fathers,
DAN.2.23	because you have given me
DAN.2.23	wisdom and power.
DAN.2.23	And now you have let me know
DAN.2.23	what we asked of you,
DAN.2.23	for you have let us know
DAN.2.23	the king’s mystery.
DAN.2.24	Therefore Daniel went to Arioch,
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said to him, “I have found a man among the Judean exiles
DAN.2.26	The king said in reply to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered the king: “No wise man, medium, magician, or diviner
DAN.2.28	But there is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries, and he has let King Nebuchadnezzar know what will happen in the last days.
DAN.2.29	Your Majesty, while you were in your bed, thoughts came to your mind about what will happen in the future.
DAN.2.30	As for me, this mystery has been revealed to me,
DAN.2.31	“Your Majesty, as you were watching, suddenly a colossal statue appeared. That statue, tall and dazzling, was standing in front of you, and its appearance was terrifying. 
DAN.2.32	The head of the statue was pure gold, its chest and arms were silver, its stomach and thighs were bronze, 
DAN.2.33	its legs were iron, and its feet were partly iron and partly fired clay. 
DAN.2.34	As you were watching, a stone broke off without a hand touching it,
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, the fired clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were shattered and became like chaff
DAN.2.36	“This was the dream; now we will tell the king its interpretation. 
DAN.2.37	Your Majesty, you are king of kings.
DAN.2.38	Wherever people live — or wild animals, or birds of the sky — he has handed them over to you and made you ruler over them all.
DAN.2.39	“After you, there will arise another kingdom, inferior to yours, and then another, a third kingdom, of bronze, which will rule the whole earth.
DAN.2.40	A fourth kingdom will be as strong as iron; for iron crushes and shatters everything, and like iron that smashes, it will crush and smash all the others.
DAN.2.41	You saw the feet and toes, partly of a potter’s fired clay and partly of iron — it will be a divided kingdom, though some of the strength of iron will be in it. You saw the iron mixed with clay, 
DAN.2.42	and that the toes of the feet were partly iron and partly fired clay — part of the kingdom will be strong, and part will be brittle. 
DAN.2.43	You saw the iron mixed with clay — the peoples will mix with one another
DAN.2.44	“In the days of those kings, the God of the heavens will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed,
DAN.2.45	You saw a stone
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell facedown, worshiped Daniel, and gave orders to present an offering and incense to him.
DAN.2.47	The king said to Daniel, “Your God is indeed God of gods, Lord of kings,
DAN.2.48	Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many generous gifts. He made him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief governor over all the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.49	At Daniel’s request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
DAN.3.1	King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue,
DAN.3.2	King Nebuchadnezzar sent word to assemble the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers
DAN.3.3	So the satraps, prefects, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the rulers of the provinces assembled for the dedication of the statue the king had set up. Then they stood before the statue Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
DAN.3.4	A herald loudly proclaimed, “People of every nation and language, you are commanded: 
DAN.3.5	When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither,
DAN.3.6	But whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire.”
DAN.3.7	Therefore, when all the people heard the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and every kind of music, people of every nation and language fell down and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
DAN.3.8	Some Chaldeans
DAN.3.9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “May the king live forever. 
DAN.3.10	You as king have issued a decree
DAN.3.11	Whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.12	There are some Jews you have appointed to manage the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
DAN.3.13	Then in a furious rage
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar asked them, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you don’t serve my gods or worship the gold statue
DAN.3.15	Now if you’re ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, drum, and every kind of music, fall down and worship the statue I made. But if you don’t worship it, you will immediately be thrown into a furnace of blazing fire — and who is the god who can rescue you from my power?” 
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied to the king, “Nebuchadnezzar, we don’t need to give you an answer to this question. 
DAN.3.17	If the God we serve exists,
DAN.3.18	But even if he does not rescue us,
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was filled with rage,
DAN.3.20	and he commanded some of the best soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the furnace of blazing fire. 
DAN.3.21	So these men, in their trousers, robes, head coverings,
DAN.3.22	Since the king’s command was so urgent
DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell, bound, into the furnace of blazing fire.
DAN.3.24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in alarm.
DAN.3.24	“Yes, of course, Your Majesty,” they replied to the king.
DAN.3.25	He exclaimed, “Look! I see four men, not tied, walking around in the fire unharmed;
DAN.3.26	Nebuchadnezzar then approached the door of the furnace of blazing fire and called: “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God — come out!” So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.
DAN.3.27	When the satraps, prefects, governors, and the king’s advisers gathered around, they saw that the fire had no effect
DAN.3.28	Nebuchadnezzar exclaimed, “Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel
DAN.3.29	Therefore I issue a decree
DAN.3.30	Then the king rewarded Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	King Nebuchadnezzar,
DAN.4.1	To those of every people, nation, and language, who live on the whole earth:
DAN.4.1	May your prosperity increase.
DAN.4.2	I am pleased to tell you about the miracles and wonders
DAN.4.3	How great are his miracles,
DAN.4.3	and how mighty his wonders!
DAN.4.3	His kingdom is an eternal kingdom,
DAN.4.3	and his dominion is from generation to generation.
DAN.4.4	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at ease in my house and flourishing in my palace.
DAN.4.5	I had a dream, and it frightened me; while in my bed, the images and visions in my mind alarmed me.
DAN.4.6	So I issued a decree
DAN.4.7	When the magicians, mediums, Chaldeans, and diviners came in, I told them the dream, but they could not make its interpretation known to me.
DAN.4.8	Finally Daniel, named Belteshazzar
DAN.4.9	“Belteshazzar, head of the magicians, because I know that you have the spirit of the holy gods
DAN.4.10	In the visions of my mind as I was lying in bed, I saw this:
DAN.4.10	There was a tree in the middle of the earth,
DAN.4.10	and it was very tall.
DAN.4.11	The tree grew large and strong;
DAN.4.11	its top reached to the sky,
DAN.4.11	and it was visible to the ends of the
DAN.4.12	Its leaves were beautiful, its fruit was abundant,
DAN.4.12	and on it was food for all.
DAN.4.12	Wild animals found shelter under it,
DAN.4.12	the birds of the sky
DAN.4.12	and every creature was fed from it.
DAN.4.13	“As I was lying in my bed, I also saw in the visions of my mind a watcher, a holy one,
DAN.4.14	He called out loudly:
DAN.4.14	Cut down the tree and chop off its branches;
DAN.4.14	strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit.
DAN.4.14	Let the animals flee from under it,
DAN.4.14	and the birds from its branches.
DAN.4.15	But leave the stump with its roots in the ground
DAN.4.15	and with a band of iron and bronze around it
DAN.4.15	in the tender grass of the field.
DAN.4.15	Let him be drenched with dew from the sky
DAN.4.15	and share the plants of the earth
DAN.4.15	with the animals.
DAN.4.16	Let his mind be changed from that of a human,
DAN.4.16	and let him be given the mind of an animal
DAN.4.16	for seven periods of time.
DAN.4.17	This word is by decree of the watchers,
DAN.4.17	and the decision is by command from the holy ones.
DAN.4.17	This is so that the living will know
DAN.4.17	that the Most High is ruler
DAN.4.17	over human kingdoms.
DAN.4.17	He gives them to anyone he wants
DAN.4.17	and sets the lowliest of people over them.
DAN.4.18	This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now, Belteshazzar, tell me the interpretation, because none of the wise men of my kingdom can make the interpretation known to me.
DAN.4.19	Then Daniel, whose name is Belteshazzar, was stunned for a moment, and his thoughts alarmed him. The king said, “Belteshazzar, don’t let the dream or its interpretation alarm you.”
DAN.4.19	Belteshazzar answered, “My lord, may the dream apply to those who hate you, and its interpretation to your enemies!
DAN.4.20	The tree you saw, which grew large and strong, whose top reached to the sky and was visible to the whole earth, 
DAN.4.21	and whose leaves were beautiful and its fruit abundant — and on it was food for all, under it the wild animals lived, and in its branches the birds of the sky lived —  
DAN.4.22	that tree is you, Your Majesty. For you have become great and strong: your greatness has grown and even reaches the sky, and your dominion extends to the ends of the earth.
DAN.4.23	“The king saw a watcher, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump with its roots in the ground and with a band of iron and bronze around it in the tender grass of the field. Let him be drenched with dew from the sky and share food with the wild animals for seven periods of time.’ 
DAN.4.24	This is the interpretation, Your Majesty, and this is the decree of the Most High that has been issued against my lord the king:
DAN.4.25	You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals. You will feed on grass like cattle
DAN.4.26	As for the command to leave the tree’s stump with its roots, your kingdom will be restored
DAN.4.27	Therefore, may my advice seem good to you my king. Separate yourself from your sins by doing what is right,
DAN.4.28	All this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
DAN.4.29	At the end of twelve months, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace in Babylon, 
DAN.4.30	the king exclaimed, “Is this not Babylon the Great that I have built to be a royal residence by my vast power and for my majestic glory?” 
DAN.4.31	While the words were still in the king’s mouth, a voice came from heaven: “King Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is declared that the kingdom has departed from you.
DAN.4.32	You will be driven away from people to live with the wild animals, and you will feed on grass like cattle for seven periods of time, until you acknowledge that the Most High is ruler over human kingdoms, and he gives them to anyone he wants.”
DAN.4.33	At that moment the message against Nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled. He was driven away from people. He ate grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky, until his hair grew like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.
DAN.4.34	But at the end of those days, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven, and my sanity returned to me. Then I praised the Most High and honored and glorified him who lives forever:
DAN.4.34	For his dominion is an everlasting dominion,
DAN.4.34	and his kingdom is from generation to generation.
DAN.4.35	All the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing,
DAN.4.35	and he does what he wants
DAN.4.35	and the inhabitants of the earth.
DAN.4.35	There is no one who can block his hand
DAN.4.35	or say to him, “What have you done?” 
DAN.4.36	At that time my sanity returned to me, and my majesty and splendor returned to me for the glory of my kingdom. My advisers and my nobles sought me out, I was reestablished over my kingdom, and even more greatness came to me.
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, exalt, and glorify the King of the heavens, because all his works are true and his ways are just.
DAN.5.1	King Belshazzar
DAN.5.2	Under the influence of
DAN.5.3	So they brought in the gold
DAN.5.4	They drank the wine and praised their gods made of gold and silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
DAN.5.5	At that moment the fingers of a man’s hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the king’s palace wall next to the lampstand. As the king watched the hand
DAN.5.6	his face turned pale,
DAN.5.7	The king shouted to bring in the mediums, Chaldeans, and diviners. He said to these wise men of Babylon, “Whoever reads this inscription and gives me its interpretation will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around his neck,
DAN.5.8	So all the king’s wise men came in, but none could read the inscription or make its interpretation known to him. 
DAN.5.9	Then King Belshazzar became even more terrified, his face turned pale,
DAN.5.10	Because of the outcry of the king and his nobles, the queen
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom who has a spirit of the holy gods in him.
DAN.5.12	did this because Daniel, the one the king named Belteshazzar, was found to have an extraordinary spirit, knowledge and intelligence, and the ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve problems.
DAN.5.13	Then Daniel was brought before the king. The king said to him, “Are you Daniel, one of the Judean exiles that my predecessor the king brought from Judah?
DAN.5.14	I’ve heard that you have a spirit of the gods in you, and that insight, intelligence, and extraordinary wisdom are found in you. 
DAN.5.15	Now the wise men and mediums were brought before me to read this inscription and make its interpretation known to me, but they could not give its interpretation. 
DAN.5.16	However, I have heard about you that you can give interpretations and solve problems. Therefore, if you can read this inscription and give me its interpretation, you will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain around your neck, and have the third highest position in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts and give your rewards to someone else;
DAN.5.18	Your Majesty, the Most High God gave sovereignty,
DAN.5.19	Because of the greatness he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages
DAN.5.20	But when his heart was exalted and his spirit became arrogant,
DAN.5.21	He was driven away from people,
DAN.5.22	“But you his successor, Belshazzar, have not humbled your heart,
DAN.5.23	Instead, you have exalted yourself against the Lord of the heavens. The vessels from his house were brought to you, and as you and your nobles, wives, and concubines drank wine from them,
DAN.5.24	Therefore, he sent the hand, and this writing was inscribed.
DAN.5.25	“This is the writing that was inscribed: M
DAN.5.26	This is the interpretation of the message:
DAN.5.26	‘Mene’
DAN.5.27	‘Tekel’
DAN.5.28	‘Peres’
DAN.5.29	Then Belshazzar gave an order, and they clothed Daniel in purple, placed a gold chain around his neck,
DAN.5.30	That very night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was killed, 
DAN.5.31	and Darius the Mede
DAN.6.1	Darius decided
DAN.6.2	and over them three administrators, including Daniel.
DAN.6.3	Daniel
DAN.6.4	The administrators and satraps, therefore, kept trying to find a charge against Daniel
DAN.6.5	Then these men said, “We will never find any charge against this Daniel unless we find something against him concerning the law of his God.”
DAN.6.6	So the administrators and satraps went together to the king and said to him, “May King Darius live forever.
DAN.6.7	All the administrators of the kingdom,
DAN.6.8	Therefore, Your Majesty, establish the edict
DAN.6.9	So King Darius signed the written edict.
DAN.6.10	When Daniel learned that the document had been signed, he went into his house. The windows in its upstairs room opened toward Jerusalem,
DAN.6.11	Then these men went as a group and found
DAN.6.12	So they approached the king
DAN.6.12	The king answered, “As a law of the Medes and Persians, the order stands
DAN.6.13	Then they replied to the king, “Daniel, one of the Judean exiles, has ignored you,
DAN.6.14	As soon as the king heard this, he was very displeased; he set his mind on rescuing Daniel
DAN.6.15	Then these men went together to the king and said to him, “You know, Your Majesty, that it is a law of the Medes and Persians that no edict or ordinance the king establishes can be changed.”
DAN.6.16	So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions’ den.
DAN.6.17	A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den.
DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace and spent the night fasting.
DAN.6.19	At the first light of dawn the king got up and hurried to the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.20	When he reached the den, he cried out in anguish to Daniel. “Daniel, servant of the living God,” the king said,
DAN.6.21	Then Daniel spoke with the king: “May the king live forever. 
DAN.6.22	My God sent his angel
DAN.6.23	The king was overjoyed and gave orders to take Daniel out of the den. When Daniel was brought up from the den, he was found to be unharmed, for he trusted in his God.
DAN.6.24	The king then gave the command, and those men who had maliciously accused Daniel
DAN.6.25	Then King Darius wrote to those of every people, nation, and language who live on the whole earth: “May your prosperity abound.
DAN.6.26	I issue a decree
DAN.6.26	For he is the living God,
DAN.6.26	and he endures forever;
DAN.6.26	his kingdom will never be destroyed,
DAN.6.26	and his dominion has no end.
DAN.6.27	He rescues and delivers;
DAN.6.27	he performs signs and wonders
DAN.6.27	in the heavens and on the earth,
DAN.6.27	for he has rescued Daniel
DAN.6.27	from the power of the lions.”
DAN.6.28	So Daniel prospered
DAN.7.1	In the first year of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel had a dream with visions in his mind
DAN.7.2	Daniel said, “In my vision at night I was watching, and suddenly the four winds of heaven
DAN.7.3	Four huge beasts
DAN.7.4	“The first was like a lion
DAN.7.5	“Suddenly, another beast appeared, a second one, that looked like a bear.
DAN.7.6	“After this, while I was watching, suddenly another beast appeared. It was like a leopard
DAN.7.7	“After this, while I was watching in the night visions, suddenly a fourth beast
DAN.7.8	“While I was considering the horns, suddenly another horn,
DAN.7.9	“As I kept watching,
DAN.7.9	thrones were set in place,
DAN.7.9	and the Ancient of Days took his seat.
DAN.7.9	His clothing was white like snow,
DAN.7.9	and the hair of his head like whitest wool.
DAN.7.9	His throne was flaming fire;
DAN.7.9	its wheels were blazing fire.
DAN.7.10	A river of fire was flowing,
DAN.7.10	coming out from his presence.
DAN.7.10	Thousands upon thousands
DAN.7.10	ten thousand times ten thousand
DAN.7.10	The court was convened,
DAN.7.10	and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	“I watched, then, because of the sound of the arrogant words the horn was speaking. As I continued watching, the beast was killed and its body destroyed and given over to the burning fire.
DAN.7.12	As for the rest of the beasts, their dominion was removed, but an extension of life was granted to them for a certain period of time.
DAN.7.13	I continued watching in the night visions,
DAN.7.13	and suddenly one like a son of man
DAN.7.13	was coming with the clouds of heaven.
DAN.7.13	He approached the Ancient of Days
DAN.7.13	and was escorted before him.
DAN.7.14	He was given dominion,
DAN.7.14	and glory, and a kingdom;
DAN.7.14	so that those of every people,
DAN.7.14	nation, and language
DAN.7.14	should serve
DAN.7.14	His dominion is an everlasting
DAN.7.14	that will not pass away,
DAN.7.14	and his kingdom is one
DAN.7.14	that will not be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	“As for me, Daniel, my spirit was deeply distressed within me,
DAN.7.16	I approached one of those who were standing by and asked him
DAN.7.17	‘These huge beasts, four in number, are four kings who will rise from the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the holy ones of the Most High will receive the kingdom and possess it forever, yes, forever and ever.’
DAN.7.19	“Then I wanted to be clear about the fourth beast,
DAN.7.20	I also wanted to know about the ten horns
DAN.7.21	As I was watching, this horn waged war
DAN.7.22	until the Ancient of Days arrived and a judgment
DAN.7.23	“This is what he said: ‘The fourth beast will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, different from all the other kingdoms. It will devour the whole earth, trample it down, and crush it. 
DAN.7.24	The ten horns
DAN.7.25	He will speak words against the Most High
DAN.7.26	But the court will convene,
DAN.7.27	The kingdom, dominion, and greatness of the kingdoms under all of heaven will be given to the people, the holy ones of the Most High. His kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom,
DAN.7.28	“This is the end of the account. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts terrified me greatly,
DAN.8.1	In the third year of King Belshazzar’s
DAN.8.2	I saw the vision, and as I watched, I was in the fortress city of Susa,
DAN.8.3	I looked up,
DAN.8.4	I saw the ram charging to the west, the north, and the south.
DAN.8.5	As I was observing, a male goat appeared, coming from the west across the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground. The goat had a conspicuous horn
DAN.8.6	He came toward the two-horned ram I had seen standing beside the canal and rushed at him with savage fury. 
DAN.8.7	I saw him approaching the ram, and infuriated with him, he struck the ram, breaking his two horns, and the ram was not strong enough to stand against him. The goat threw him to the ground and trampled him, and there was no one to rescue the ram from his power. 
DAN.8.8	Then the male goat acted even more arrogantly,
DAN.8.9	From one of them a little horn
DAN.8.10	It grew as high as the heavenly army, made some of the army and some of the stars
DAN.8.11	It acted arrogantly
DAN.8.12	In the rebellion, the army was given up, together with the regular sacrifice. The horn threw truth to the ground and was successful
DAN.8.13	Then I heard a holy one speaking,
DAN.8.14	He said to me,
DAN.8.15	While I, Daniel, was watching the vision and trying to understand it, there stood before me someone who appeared to be a man.
DAN.8.16	I heard a human voice calling from the middle of the Ulai: “Gabriel,
DAN.8.17	So he approached where I was standing; when he came near, I was terrified and fell facedown.
DAN.8.18	While he was speaking to me, I fell into a deep sleep,
DAN.8.19	and said, “I am here to tell you what will happen at the conclusion of the time of wrath, because it refers to the appointed time of the end.
DAN.8.20	The two-horned ram
DAN.8.21	The shaggy goat represents the king of Greece, and the large horn between his eyes represents the first king.
DAN.8.22	The four horns that took the place of the broken horn represent four kingdoms. They will rise from that nation, but without its power.
DAN.8.23	Near the end of their kingdoms,
DAN.8.23	when the rebels have reached
DAN.8.23	the full measure of their sin,
DAN.8.23	a ruthless
DAN.8.23	will come to the throne.
DAN.8.24	His power will be great,
DAN.8.24	but it will not be his own.
DAN.8.24	He will cause outrageous destruction
DAN.8.24	and succeed in whatever he does.
DAN.8.24	He will destroy the powerful
DAN.8.24	along with the holy people.
DAN.8.25	He will cause deceit to prosper
DAN.8.25	through his cunning and by his influence,
DAN.8.25	and in his own mind he will exalt himself.
DAN.8.25	He will destroy many in a time of peace;
DAN.8.25	he will even stand against the Prince of princes.
DAN.8.25	Yet he will be broken — not by human hands.
DAN.8.26	The vision of the evenings and the mornings
DAN.8.26	that has been told is true.
DAN.8.26	Now you are to seal up the vision
DAN.8.26	because it refers to many days in the future.”
DAN.8.27	I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for days.
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius,
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, understood from the books according to the word of the 
DAN.9.3	So I turned my attention to the Lord God to seek him by prayer and petitions, with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the 
DAN.9.4	Ah, Lord — the great and awe-inspiring God
DAN.9.5	we have sinned,
DAN.9.6	We have not listened to your servants the prophets,
DAN.9.7	Lord, righteousness belongs to you,
DAN.9.8	, public shame
DAN.9.9	Compassion and forgiveness belong to the Lord our God, though we have rebelled against him 
DAN.9.10	and have not obeyed the 
DAN.9.11	All Israel has broken your law and turned away,
DAN.9.12	He has carried out his words
DAN.9.13	Just as it is written in the law of Moses,
DAN.9.14	So the 
DAN.9.15	Now, Lord our God, who brought your people out of the land of Egypt with a strong hand
DAN.9.16	Lord, in keeping with all your righteous acts, may your anger and wrath
DAN.9.17	Therefore, our God, hear the prayer and the petitions of your servant. Make your face shine
DAN.9.18	Listen closely,
DAN.9.19	Lord, hear! Lord, forgive! Lord, listen and act! My God, for your own sake, do not delay,
DAN.9.20	While I was speaking, praying, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel,
DAN.9.21	while I was praying, Gabriel,
DAN.9.22	He gave me this explanation: “Daniel, I’ve come now to give you understanding.
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of your petitions an answer went out, and I have come to give it, for you are treasured by God.
DAN.9.24	Seventy weeks are decreed
DAN.9.24	about your people and your holy city —
DAN.9.24	to bring the rebellion to an end,
DAN.9.24	to put a stop to sin,
DAN.9.24	to atone for iniquity,
DAN.9.24	to bring in everlasting righteousness,
DAN.9.24	to seal up vision and prophecy,
DAN.9.24	and to anoint the most holy place.
DAN.9.25	Know and understand this:
DAN.9.25	From the issuing of the decree
DAN.9.25	to restore and rebuild Jerusalem
DAN.9.25	until an Anointed One,
DAN.9.25	will be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.
DAN.9.25	It will be rebuilt with a plaza and a moat,
DAN.9.25	but in difficult times.
DAN.9.26	After those sixty-two weeks
DAN.9.26	the Anointed One will be cut off
DAN.9.26	and will have nothing.
DAN.9.26	The people of the coming ruler
DAN.9.26	will destroy the city
DAN.9.26	The
DAN.9.26	and until the end there will be
DAN.9.26	desolations are decreed.
DAN.9.27	He will make a firm covenant
DAN.9.27	with many for one week,
DAN.9.27	but in the middle of the week
DAN.9.27	he will put a stop to sacrifice and offering.
DAN.9.27	And the abomination of desolation
DAN.9.27	will be on a wing
DAN.9.27	until the decreed destruction
DAN.9.27	is poured out on the desolator.”
DAN.10.1	In the third year of King Cyrus of Persia,
DAN.10.2	In those days I, Daniel, was mourning for three full weeks.
DAN.10.3	I didn’t eat any rich food,
DAN.10.4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month,
DAN.10.5	I looked up, and there was a man dressed in linen,
DAN.10.6	His body was like beryl,
DAN.10.7	Only I, Daniel, saw the vision.
DAN.10.8	I was left alone, looking at this great vision.
DAN.10.9	I heard the words he said, and when I heard them I fell into a deep sleep,
DAN.10.10	Suddenly, a hand touched me and set me shaking on my hands and knees. 
DAN.10.11	He said to me, “Daniel, you are a man treasured by God.
DAN.10.12	“Don’t be afraid,
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael,
DAN.10.14	Now I have come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the last days,
DAN.10.15	While he was saying these words to me, I turned my face toward the ground and was speechless.
DAN.10.16	Suddenly one with human likeness
DAN.10.17	How can someone like me,
DAN.10.18	Then the one with a human appearance touched me again and strengthened me.
DAN.10.19	He said, “Don’t be afraid,
DAN.10.19	As he spoke to me, I was strengthened and said, “Let my lord speak, for you have strengthened me.”
DAN.10.20	He said, “Do you know why I’ve come to you? I must return at once to fight against the prince of Persia, and when I leave, the prince of Greece will come.
DAN.10.21	However, I will tell you what is recorded in the book of truth. (No one has the courage to support me against those princes except Michael,
DAN.11.1	In the first year of Darius the Mede,
DAN.11.2	Now I will tell you the truth.
DAN.11.2	“Three more kings will arise in Persia, and the fourth will be far richer than the others. By the power he gains through his riches, he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece.
DAN.11.3	Then a warrior king will arise; he will rule a vast realm and do whatever he wants.
DAN.11.4	But as soon as he is established, his kingdom will be broken up and divided to the four winds of heaven,
DAN.11.5	“The king of the South
DAN.11.6	After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will go to the king of the North
DAN.11.7	In the place of the king of the South, one from her family
DAN.11.8	He will take even their gods captive to Egypt, with their metal images and their precious articles of silver and gold.
DAN.11.9	who will enter the kingdom of the king of the South and then return to his own land.
DAN.11.10	“His sons will mobilize for war and assemble a large number of armed forces. They will advance, sweeping through like a flood,
DAN.11.11	Infuriated, the king of the South will march out to fight with the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but they will be handed over to his enemy. 
DAN.11.12	When the army is carried off, he will become arrogant and cause tens of thousands to fall, but he will not triumph. 
DAN.11.13	The king of the North will again raise a multitude larger than the first. After some years
DAN.11.14	“In those times many will rise up against the king of the South. Violent ones among your own people will assert themselves to fulfill a vision, but they will fail. 
DAN.11.15	Then the king of the North will come, build up a siege ramp,
DAN.11.16	The king of the North who comes against him will do whatever he wants,
DAN.11.17	He will resolve
DAN.11.18	Then he will turn his attention to the coasts and islands
DAN.11.19	He will turn his attention back to the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble, fall,
DAN.11.20	“In his place one will arise who will send out a tax collector
DAN.11.21	“In his place a despised
DAN.11.22	A flood of forces will be swept away before him; they will be broken, as well as the covenant prince. 
DAN.11.23	After an alliance is made with him, he will act deceitfully. He will rise to power with a small nation.
DAN.11.24	During a time of peace,
DAN.11.25	“With a large army he will stir up his power and his courage against the king of the South. The king of the South will prepare for battle with an extremely large and powerful army, but he will not succeed, because plots will be made against him. 
DAN.11.26	Those who eat his provisions
DAN.11.27	The two kings, whose hearts are bent on evil, will speak lies
DAN.11.28	The king of the North will return to his land with great wealth, but his heart will be set against the holy covenant;
DAN.11.29	“At the appointed time he will come again to the South, but this time
DAN.11.30	Ships of Kittim
DAN.11.31	His forces will rise up and desecrate the temple fortress. They will abolish the regular sacrifice
DAN.11.32	With flattery he will corrupt those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will be strong and take action.
DAN.11.33	Those who have insight among the people
DAN.11.34	When they fall, they will be helped by some, but many others will join them insincerely.
DAN.11.35	Some of those who have insight will fall so that they may be refined,
DAN.11.36	“Then the king will do whatever he wants.
DAN.11.37	He will not show regard for the gods
DAN.11.38	Instead, he will honor a god of fortresses — a god his fathers did not know — with gold, silver, precious stones, and riches. 
DAN.11.39	He will deal with the strongest fortresses with the help of a foreign god. He will greatly honor those who acknowledge him,
DAN.11.40	“At the time of the end, the king of the South will engage him in battle, but the king of the North will storm against him
DAN.11.41	He will also invade the beautiful land,
DAN.11.42	He will extend his power against the countries, and not even the land of Egypt will escape. 
DAN.11.43	He will get control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the riches of Egypt. The Libyans and Cushites will also be in submission.
DAN.11.44	But reports from the east
DAN.11.45	He will pitch his royal tents between the sea and
DAN.12.1	At that time
DAN.12.1	Michael,
DAN.12.1	who stands watch over your people, will rise up.
DAN.12.1	There will be a time of distress
DAN.12.1	such as never has occurred
DAN.12.1	since nations came into being until that time.
DAN.12.1	But at that time all your people
DAN.12.1	who are found written in the book
DAN.12.2	Many who sleep in the dust
DAN.12.2	of the earth will awake,
DAN.12.2	some to eternal life,
DAN.12.2	and some to disgrace and eternal contempt.
DAN.12.3	Those who have insight will shine
DAN.12.3	like the bright expanse of the heavens,
DAN.12.3	and those who lead many to righteousness,
DAN.12.3	like the stars forever and ever.
DAN.12.4	“But you, Daniel, keep these words secret
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked, and two others were standing there, one on this bank of the river and one on the other. 
DAN.12.6	One of them said to the man dressed in linen,
DAN.12.7	Then I heard the man dressed in linen, who was above the water of the river. He raised both his hands
DAN.12.8	I heard but did not understand. So I asked, “My lord, what will be the outcome of these things?” 
DAN.12.9	He said, “Go on your way, Daniel, for the words are secret
DAN.12.10	Many will be purified,
DAN.12.11	From the time the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination of desolation
DAN.12.12	Happy is the one who waits
DAN.12.13	But as for you, go on your way to the end;
HOS.1.1	The word of the 
HOS.1.2	When the 
HOS.1.2	Go and marry a woman of promiscuity,
HOS.1.2	and have children of promiscuity,
HOS.1.2	for the land is committing blatant acts of promiscuity
HOS.1.2	by abandoning the 
HOS.1.3	So he went and married Gomer daughter of Diblaim, and she conceived and bore him a son.
HOS.1.4	Then the 
HOS.1.4	Name him Jezreel,
HOS.1.4	I will bring the bloodshed of Jezreel
HOS.1.4	on the house of Jehu
HOS.1.4	and put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
HOS.1.5	On that day I will break the bow of Israel
HOS.1.5	in the Valley of Jezreel.
HOS.1.6	She conceived again and gave birth to a daughter, and the 
HOS.1.6	Name her Lo-ruhamah,
HOS.1.6	for I will no longer have compassion
HOS.1.6	on the house of Israel.
HOS.1.6	I will certainly take them away.
HOS.1.7	But I will have compassion on the house of Judah,
HOS.1.7	and I will deliver them by the 
HOS.1.7	I will not deliver them by bow, sword, or war,
HOS.1.7	or by horses and cavalry.
HOS.1.8	After Gomer had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she conceived and gave birth to a son. 
HOS.1.9	Then the 
HOS.1.9	Name him Lo-ammi,
HOS.1.9	for you are not my people,
HOS.1.9	and I will not be your God.
HOS.1.10	Yet the number of the Israelites
HOS.1.10	will be like the sand of the sea,
HOS.1.10	which cannot be measured or counted.
HOS.1.10	And in the place where they were told:
HOS.1.10	You are not my people,
HOS.1.10	they will be called: Sons of the living God.
HOS.1.11	And the Judeans and the Israelites
HOS.1.11	will be gathered together.
HOS.1.11	They will appoint for themselves a single ruler
HOS.1.11	and go up from
HOS.1.11	For the day of Jezreel
HOS.2.1	Call
HOS.2.1	and your sisters: Compassion.
HOS.2.2	Rebuke your mother; rebuke her.
HOS.2.2	For she is not my wife and I am not her husband.
HOS.2.2	Let her remove the promiscuous look from her face
HOS.2.2	and her adultery from between her breasts.
HOS.2.3	Otherwise, I will strip her naked
HOS.2.3	and expose her as she was on the day of her birth.
HOS.2.3	I will make her like a desert
HOS.2.3	and like a parched land,
HOS.2.3	and I will let her die of thirst.
HOS.2.4	I will have no compassion on her children
HOS.2.4	because they are the children of promiscuity.
HOS.2.5	Yes, their mother is promiscuous;
HOS.2.5	she conceived them and acted shamefully.
HOS.2.5	For she thought, “I will follow my lovers,
HOS.2.5	the men who give me my food and water,
HOS.2.5	my wool and flax, my oil and drink.”
HOS.2.6	Therefore, this is what I will do:
HOS.2.6	I will block her
HOS.2.6	I will enclose her with a wall,
HOS.2.6	so that she cannot find her paths.
HOS.2.7	She will pursue her lovers but not catch them;
HOS.2.7	she will look for them but not find them.
HOS.2.7	Then she will think,
HOS.2.7	“I will go back to my former husband,
HOS.2.7	for then it was better for me than now.”
HOS.2.8	She does not recognize
HOS.2.8	that it is I who gave her the grain,
HOS.2.8	the new wine, and the fresh oil.
HOS.2.8	I lavished silver and gold on her,
HOS.2.8	which they used for Baal.
HOS.2.9	Therefore, I will take back my grain in its time
HOS.2.9	and my new wine in its season;
HOS.2.9	I will take away my wool and linen,
HOS.2.9	which were to cover her nakedness.
HOS.2.10	Now I will expose her shame
HOS.2.10	in the sight of her lovers,
HOS.2.10	and no one will rescue her from my power.
HOS.2.11	I will put an end to all her celebrations:
HOS.2.11	her feasts,
HOS.2.11	all her festivals.
HOS.2.12	I will devastate her vines and fig trees.
HOS.2.12	She thinks that these are her wages
HOS.2.12	that her lovers have given her.
HOS.2.12	I will turn them into a thicket,
HOS.2.12	and the wild animals will eat them.
HOS.2.13	And I will punish her for the days of the Baals,
HOS.2.13	to which she burned incense.
HOS.2.13	She put on her rings and her jewelry
HOS.2.13	and followed her lovers,
HOS.2.13	but she forgot me.
HOS.2.13	This is the 
HOS.2.14	Therefore, I am going to persuade her,
HOS.2.14	lead her to the wilderness,
HOS.2.14	and speak tenderly to her.
HOS.2.15	There I will give her vineyards back to her
HOS.2.15	and make the Valley of Achor
HOS.2.15	into a gateway of hope.
HOS.2.15	There she will respond as she did
HOS.2.15	in the days of her youth,
HOS.2.15	as in the day she came out of the land of Egypt.
HOS.2.16	In that day —
HOS.2.16	this is the 
HOS.2.16	you will call me, “My husband,”
HOS.2.16	and no longer call me, “My Baal.”
HOS.2.17	For I will remove the names of the Baals
HOS.2.17	from her mouth;
HOS.2.17	they will no longer be remembered by their names.
HOS.2.18	On that day I will make a covenant for them
HOS.2.18	with the wild animals, the birds of the sky,
HOS.2.18	and the creatures that crawl on the ground.
HOS.2.18	I will shatter bow, sword,
HOS.2.18	and weapons of war in the land
HOS.2.18	and will enable the people to rest securely.
HOS.2.19	I will take you to be my wife forever.
HOS.2.19	I will take you to be my wife in righteousness,
HOS.2.19	justice, love, and compassion.
HOS.2.20	I will take you to be my wife in faithfulness,
HOS.2.20	and you will know the 
HOS.2.21	On that day I will respond
HOS.2.21	this is the 
HOS.2.21	I will respond to the sky,
HOS.2.21	and it will respond to the earth.
HOS.2.22	The earth will respond to the grain,
HOS.2.22	the new wine, and the fresh oil,
HOS.2.22	and they will respond to Jezreel.
HOS.2.23	I will sow her
HOS.2.23	and I will have compassion
HOS.2.23	on Lo-ruhamah;
HOS.2.23	I will say to Lo-ammi:
HOS.2.23	You are my people,
HOS.2.23	and he will say, “You are my God.”
HOS.3.1	Then the 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and five bushels of barley.
HOS.3.3	I said to her, “You are to live with me many days. You must not be promiscuous or belong to any man, and I will act the same way toward you.”
HOS.3.4	For the Israelites must live many days without king or prince,
HOS.3.5	Afterward, the people of Israel will return
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the 
HOS.4.1	for the 
HOS.4.1	against the inhabitants of the land:
HOS.4.1	There is no truth,
HOS.4.1	and no knowledge of God
HOS.4.2	Cursing,
HOS.4.2	and adultery
HOS.4.2	one act of bloodshed follows another.
HOS.4.3	For this reason the land mourns,
HOS.4.3	and everyone who lives in it languishes,
HOS.4.3	along with the wild animals
HOS.4.3	even the fish of the sea disappear.
HOS.4.4	But let no one dispute;
HOS.4.4	for my case is against you priests.
HOS.4.5	You will stumble by day;
HOS.4.5	the prophet will also stumble with you by night.
HOS.4.5	And I will destroy your mother.
HOS.4.6	My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
HOS.4.6	Because you have rejected knowledge,
HOS.4.6	I will reject you
HOS.4.6	Since you have forgotten the law of your God,
HOS.4.6	I will also forget your sons.
HOS.4.7	The more they multiplied,
HOS.4.7	the more they sinned against me.
HOS.4.7	I
HOS.4.8	They feed on the sin
HOS.4.8	they have an appetite for their iniquity.
HOS.4.9	The same judgment will happen
HOS.4.9	to both people and priests.
HOS.4.9	I will punish them for their ways
HOS.4.9	and repay them for their deeds.
HOS.4.10	They will eat but not be satisfied;
HOS.4.10	they will be promiscuous
HOS.4.10	For they have abandoned their devotion to the 
HOS.4.11	Promiscuity,
HOS.4.11	take away one’s understanding.
HOS.4.12	My people consult their wooden idols,
HOS.4.12	and their divining rods inform them.
HOS.4.12	For a spirit of promiscuity leads them astray;
HOS.4.12	they act promiscuously
HOS.4.12	in disobedience to
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice on the mountaintops,
HOS.4.13	and they burn offerings on the hills,
HOS.4.13	and under oaks, poplars, and terebinths,
HOS.4.13	because their shade is pleasant.
HOS.4.13	And so your daughters act promiscuously
HOS.4.13	and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
HOS.4.14	I will not punish your daughters
HOS.4.14	when they act promiscuously
HOS.4.14	or your daughters-in-law
HOS.4.14	when they commit adultery,
HOS.4.14	for the men themselves go off with prostitutes
HOS.4.14	and make sacrifices with cult prostitutes.
HOS.4.14	People without discernment are doomed.
HOS.4.15	Israel, if you act promiscuously,
HOS.4.15	don’t let Judah become guilty!
HOS.4.15	Do not go to Gilgal
HOS.4.15	or make a pilgrimage to Beth-aven,
HOS.4.15	and do not swear an oath: As the 
HOS.4.16	For Israel is as obstinate as a stubborn cow.
HOS.4.16	Can the 
HOS.4.16	like a lamb in an open meadow?
HOS.4.17	Ephraim is attached to idols;
HOS.4.17	leave him alone!
HOS.4.18	When their drinking is over,
HOS.4.18	they turn to promiscuity.
HOS.4.18	Israel’s leaders
HOS.4.19	A wind with its wings will carry them off,
HOS.4.19	and they will be ashamed of their sacrifices.
HOS.5.1	Hear this, priests!
HOS.5.1	Pay attention, house of Israel!
HOS.5.1	Listen, royal house!
HOS.5.1	For the judgment applies to you
HOS.5.1	because you have been a snare at Mizpah
HOS.5.1	and a net spread out on Tabor.
HOS.5.2	Rebels
HOS.5.2	I will be a punishment for all of them.
HOS.5.3	I know Ephraim,
HOS.5.3	and Israel is not hidden from me.
HOS.5.3	For now, Ephraim,
HOS.5.3	you have acted promiscuously;
HOS.5.3	Israel is defiled.
HOS.5.4	Their actions do not allow them
HOS.5.4	to return to their God,
HOS.5.4	for a spirit of promiscuity is among them,
HOS.5.4	and they do not know the 
HOS.5.5	Israel’s arrogance testifies against them.
HOS.5.5	Both Israel and Ephraim stumble
HOS.5.5	because of their iniquity;
HOS.5.5	even Judah will stumble with them.
HOS.5.6	They go with their flocks and herds
HOS.5.6	to seek the 
HOS.5.6	but do not find him;
HOS.5.6	he has withdrawn from them.
HOS.5.7	They betrayed the 
HOS.5.7	indeed, they gave birth to illegitimate children.
HOS.5.7	Now the New Moon
HOS.5.7	along with their fields.
HOS.5.8	Blow the horn in Gibeah,
HOS.5.8	the trumpet in Ramah;
HOS.5.8	raise the war cry in Beth-aven:
HOS.5.8	Look behind you,
HOS.5.9	Ephraim will become a desolation
HOS.5.9	on the day of punishment;
HOS.5.9	I announce what is certain
HOS.5.9	among the tribes of Israel.
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah are like those
HOS.5.10	who move boundary markers;
HOS.5.10	I will pour out my fury
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed, crushed in judgment,
HOS.5.11	for he is determined to follow what is worthless.
HOS.5.12	So I am like rot to Ephraim
HOS.5.12	and like decay to the house of Judah.
HOS.5.13	When Ephraim saw his sickness
HOS.5.13	and Judah his wound,
HOS.5.13	Ephraim went to Assyria
HOS.5.13	and sent a delegation to the great king.
HOS.5.13	But he cannot cure you or heal your wound.
HOS.5.14	For I am like a lion to Ephraim
HOS.5.14	and like a young lion to the house of Judah.
HOS.5.14	Yes, I will tear them to pieces and depart.
HOS.5.14	I will carry them off,
HOS.5.14	and no one can rescue them.
HOS.5.15	I will depart and return to my place
HOS.5.15	until they recognize their guilt and seek my face;
HOS.5.15	they will search for me in their distress.
HOS.6.1	Come, let us return to the 
HOS.6.1	For he has torn us,
HOS.6.1	and he will heal us;
HOS.6.1	he has wounded us,
HOS.6.1	and he will bind up our wounds.
HOS.6.2	He will revive us after two days,
HOS.6.2	and on the third day he will raise us up
HOS.6.2	so we can live in his presence.
HOS.6.3	Let us strive to know the 
HOS.6.3	His appearance is as sure as the dawn.
HOS.6.3	He will come to us like the rain,
HOS.6.3	like the spring showers that water the land.
HOS.6.4	What am I going to do with you, Ephraim?
HOS.6.4	What am I going to do with you, Judah?
HOS.6.4	Your love is like the morning mist
HOS.6.4	and like the early dew that vanishes.
HOS.6.5	This is why I have used the prophets
HOS.6.5	to cut them down;
HOS.6.5	I have killed them with the words from my mouth.
HOS.6.5	My judgment strikes like lightning.
HOS.6.6	For I desire faithful love and not sacrifice,
HOS.6.6	the knowledge of God
HOS.6.7	But they, like Adam,
HOS.6.7	there they have betrayed me.
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of evildoers,
HOS.6.8	tracked with bloody footprints.
HOS.6.9	Like raiders who wait in ambush for someone,
HOS.6.9	a band of priests murders on the road to Shechem.
HOS.6.9	They commit atrocities.
HOS.6.10	I have seen something horrible
HOS.6.10	Ephraim’s promiscuity is there;
HOS.6.11	A harvest is also appointed for you, Judah.
HOS.6.11	When I
HOS.7.1	when I heal Israel,
HOS.7.1	the iniquity of Ephraim
HOS.7.1	will be exposed.
HOS.7.1	For they practice fraud;
HOS.7.1	a thief breaks in;
HOS.7.1	a raiding party pillages outside.
HOS.7.2	But they never consider that I remember all their evil.
HOS.7.2	Now their actions are all around them;
HOS.7.2	they are right in front of my face.
HOS.7.3	They please the king with their evil,
HOS.7.3	the princes with their lies.
HOS.7.4	All of them commit adultery;
HOS.7.4	they are like an oven heated by a baker
HOS.7.4	who stops stirring the fire
HOS.7.4	from the kneading of the dough until it is leavened.
HOS.7.5	On the day of our king,
HOS.7.5	the princes are sick with the heat of wine
HOS.7.5	there is a conspiracy with traitors.
HOS.7.6	For they — their hearts like an oven —
HOS.7.6	draw him into their oven.
HOS.7.6	Their anger smolders all night;
HOS.7.6	in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	All of them are as hot as an oven,
HOS.7.7	and they consume their rulers.
HOS.7.7	All their kings fall;
HOS.7.7	not one of them calls on me.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim has allowed himself to get mixed up with the nations.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim is unturned bread baked on a griddle.
HOS.7.9	Foreigners consume his strength,
HOS.7.9	but he does not notice.
HOS.7.9	Even his hair is streaked with gray,
HOS.7.9	but he does not notice.
HOS.7.10	Israel’s arrogance testifies against them,
HOS.7.10	yet they do not return to the 
HOS.7.10	and for all this, they do not seek him.
HOS.7.11	So Ephraim has become like a silly, senseless dove;
HOS.7.11	they call to Egypt,
HOS.7.12	As they are going, I will spread my net over them;
HOS.7.12	I will bring them down like birds of the sky.
HOS.7.12	I will discipline them in accordance
HOS.7.12	with the news that reaches
HOS.7.13	Woe to them,
HOS.7.13	destruction to them, for they rebelled against me!
HOS.7.13	Though I want to redeem them,
HOS.7.13	they speak lies against me.
HOS.7.14	They do not cry to me from their hearts;
HOS.7.14	rather, they wail on their beds.
HOS.7.14	They slash themselves
HOS.7.14	they turn away from me.
HOS.7.15	I trained and strengthened their arms,
HOS.7.15	but they plot evil against me.
HOS.7.16	They turn, but not to what is above;
HOS.7.16	they are like a faulty bow.
HOS.7.16	Their leaders will fall by the sword
HOS.7.16	because of their insolent tongue.
HOS.7.16	They will be ridiculed for this in the land of Egypt.
HOS.8.1	Put the horn to your mouth!
HOS.8.1	One like an eagle comes
HOS.8.1	against the house of the 
HOS.8.1	because they transgress my covenant
HOS.8.1	and rebel against my law.
HOS.8.2	Israel cries out to me,
HOS.8.2	“My God, we know you!”
HOS.8.3	Israel has rejected what is good;
HOS.8.3	an enemy will pursue him.
HOS.8.4	They have installed kings,
HOS.8.4	but not through me.
HOS.8.4	They have appointed leaders,
HOS.8.4	but without my approval.
HOS.8.4	They make their silver and gold
HOS.8.4	into idols for themselves
HOS.8.4	for their own destruction.
HOS.8.5	Your calf-idol
HOS.8.5	My anger burns against them.
HOS.8.5	How long will they be incapable of innocence?
HOS.8.6	For this thing is from Israel —
HOS.8.6	a craftsman made it,
HOS.8.6	The calf of Samaria will be smashed to bits!
HOS.8.7	Indeed, they sow the wind
HOS.8.7	and reap the whirlwind.
HOS.8.7	There is no standing grain;
HOS.8.7	what sprouts fails to yield flour.
HOS.8.7	Even if they did,
HOS.8.7	foreigners would swallow it up.
HOS.8.8	Israel is swallowed up!
HOS.8.8	Now they are among the nations
HOS.8.8	like discarded pottery.
HOS.8.9	For they have gone up to Assyria
HOS.8.9	like a wild donkey going off on its own.
HOS.8.9	Ephraim has paid for love.
HOS.8.10	Even though they hire lovers among the nations,
HOS.8.10	I will now round them up,
HOS.8.10	and they will begin to decrease in number
HOS.8.10	under the burden of the king and leaders.
HOS.8.11	When Ephraim multiplied his altars for sin,
HOS.8.11	they became his altars for sinning.
HOS.8.12	Though I were to write out for him
HOS.8.12	ten thousand points of my instruction,
HOS.8.12	they would be
HOS.8.13	Though they offer sacrificial gifts
HOS.8.13	and eat the flesh,
HOS.8.13	the 
HOS.8.13	Now he will remember their guilt
HOS.8.13	and punish their sins;
HOS.8.13	they will return to Egypt.
HOS.8.14	Israel has forgotten his Maker
HOS.8.14	Judah has also multiplied fortified cities.
HOS.8.14	I will send fire on their cities,
HOS.8.14	and it will consume their citadels.
HOS.9.1	Israel, do not rejoice jubilantly as the nations do,
HOS.9.1	for you have acted promiscuously,
HOS.9.1	You love the wages of a prostitute
HOS.9.1	on every grain-threshing floor.
HOS.9.2	Threshing floor and wine vat will not sustain them,
HOS.9.2	and the new wine will fail them.
HOS.9.3	They will not stay in the land of the 
HOS.9.3	Instead, Ephraim will return to Egypt,
HOS.9.3	and they will eat unclean food
HOS.9.4	They will not pour out
HOS.9.4	their wine offerings to the 
HOS.9.4	and their sacrifices will not please him.
HOS.9.4	Their food will be like the bread of mourners;
HOS.9.4	all who eat it become defiled.
HOS.9.4	For their bread will be for their appetites alone;
HOS.9.4	it will not enter the house of the 
HOS.9.5	What will you do on a festival day,
HOS.9.5	on the day of the 
HOS.9.6	For even if they flee from devastation,
HOS.9.6	Egypt will gather them, and Memphis will bury them.
HOS.9.6	Thistles will take possession of their precious silver;
HOS.9.6	thorns will invade their tents.
HOS.9.7	The days of punishment have come;
HOS.9.7	the days of retribution have come.
HOS.9.7	Let Israel recognize it!
HOS.9.7	The prophet is a fool,
HOS.9.7	and the inspired man is insane,
HOS.9.7	because of the magnitude
HOS.9.7	of your iniquity and hostility.
HOS.9.8	Ephraim’s watchman is with my God.
HOS.9.8	Yet the prophet encounters a bird trap
HOS.9.8	on all his pathways.
HOS.9.8	Hostility is in the house of his God!
HOS.9.9	They have deeply corrupted themselves
HOS.9.9	as in the days of Gibeah.
HOS.9.9	He will remember their iniquity;
HOS.9.9	he will punish their sins.
HOS.9.10	I discovered Israel
HOS.9.10	like grapes in the wilderness.
HOS.9.10	I saw your fathers
HOS.9.10	like the first fruit of the fig tree in its first season.
HOS.9.10	But they went to Baal-peor,
HOS.9.10	consecrated themselves to Shame,
HOS.9.10	and became abhorrent,
HOS.9.10	like the thing they loved.
HOS.9.11	Ephraim’s glory will fly away like a bird:
HOS.9.11	no birth, no pregnancy, no conception.
HOS.9.12	Even if they raise children,
HOS.9.12	I will bereave them of each one.
HOS.9.12	Yes, woe to them when I depart from them!
HOS.9.13	I have seen Ephraim like Tyre,
HOS.9.13	planted in a meadow,
HOS.9.13	so Ephraim will bring out his children
HOS.9.13	to the executioner.
HOS.9.14	Give them, 
HOS.9.14	What should you give?
HOS.9.14	Give them a womb that miscarries
HOS.9.14	and breasts that are dry!
HOS.9.15	All their evil appears at Gilgal,
HOS.9.15	for there I began to hate them.
HOS.9.15	I will drive them from my house
HOS.9.15	because of their evil, wicked actions.
HOS.9.15	I will no longer love them;
HOS.9.15	all their leaders are rebellious.
HOS.9.16	Ephraim
HOS.9.16	their roots are withered;
HOS.9.16	they cannot bear fruit.
HOS.9.16	Even if they bear children,
HOS.9.16	I will kill the precious offspring of their wombs.
HOS.9.17	My God will reject them
HOS.9.17	because they have not listened to him;
HOS.9.17	they will become wanderers among the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel is a lush
HOS.10.1	it yields fruit for itself.
HOS.10.1	The more his fruit increased,
HOS.10.1	the more he increased the altars.
HOS.10.1	The better his land produced,
HOS.10.1	the better they made the sacred pillars.
HOS.10.2	Their hearts are devious;
HOS.10.2	now they must bear their guilt.
HOS.10.2	The 
HOS.10.2	and demolish their sacred pillars.
HOS.10.3	In fact, they are now saying,
HOS.10.3	“We have no king!
HOS.10.3	For we do not fear the 
HOS.10.3	What can a king do for us?”
HOS.10.4	They speak mere words,
HOS.10.4	taking false oaths while making covenants.
HOS.10.4	So lawsuits break out
HOS.10.4	like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.
HOS.10.5	The residents of Samaria
HOS.10.5	over the calf
HOS.10.5	Indeed, its idolatrous priests rejoiced over it;
HOS.10.5	the people will mourn over it,
HOS.10.5	over its glory.
HOS.10.5	It will certainly go into exile.
HOS.10.6	The calf itself will be taken to Assyria
HOS.10.6	as an offering to the great king.
HOS.10.6	Ephraim will experience shame;
HOS.10.6	Israel will be ashamed of its counsel.
HOS.10.7	Samaria’s king will disappear
HOS.10.7	like foam
HOS.10.8	The high places
HOS.10.8	will be destroyed;
HOS.10.8	thorns and thistles will grow over their altars.
HOS.10.8	They will say to the mountains,
HOS.10.8	and to the hills, “Fall on us!” 
HOS.10.9	Israel, you have sinned
HOS.10.9	since the days of Gibeah;
HOS.10.9	they have taken their stand there.
HOS.10.9	Will not war against the unjust
HOS.10.9	overtake them in Gibeah?
HOS.10.10	I will discipline
HOS.10.10	nations will be gathered against them
HOS.10.10	to put them in bondage
HOS.10.10	for their double iniquity.
HOS.10.11	Ephraim is a well-trained calf
HOS.10.11	that loves to thresh,
HOS.10.11	but I will place a yoke on
HOS.10.11	I will harness Ephraim;
HOS.10.11	Judah will plow;
HOS.10.11	Jacob will do the final plowing.
HOS.10.12	Sow righteousness for yourselves
HOS.10.12	and reap faithful love;
HOS.10.12	break up your unplowed ground.
HOS.10.12	It is time to seek the 
HOS.10.12	until he comes
HOS.10.12	on you like the rain.
HOS.10.13	You have plowed wickedness and reaped injustice;
HOS.10.13	you have eaten the fruit of lies.
HOS.10.13	Because you have trusted in your own way
HOS.10.13	and in your large number of soldiers,
HOS.10.14	the roar of battle will rise against your people,
HOS.10.14	and all your fortifications will be demolished
HOS.10.14	in a day of war,
HOS.10.14	like Shalman’s destruction of Beth-arbel.
HOS.10.14	Mothers will be dashed to pieces
HOS.10.14	along with their children.
HOS.10.15	So it will be done to you, Bethel,
HOS.10.15	because of your extreme evil.
HOS.10.15	At dawn the king of Israel will be totally destroyed.
HOS.11.1	When Israel was a child, I loved him,
HOS.11.1	and out of Egypt I called my son.
HOS.11.2	Israel called to the Egyptians
HOS.11.2	even as Israel was leaving them.
HOS.11.2	They kept sacrificing to the Baals
HOS.11.2	and burning offerings to idols.
HOS.11.3	It was I who taught Ephraim to walk,
HOS.11.3	taking them
HOS.11.3	but they never knew that I healed them.
HOS.11.4	I led them with human cords,
HOS.11.4	with ropes of love.
HOS.11.4	To them I was like one
HOS.11.4	who eases the yoke from their jaws;
HOS.11.4	I bent down to give them food.
HOS.11.5	Israel will not return to the land of Egypt
HOS.11.5	and Assyria will be his king,
HOS.11.5	because they refused to repent.
HOS.11.6	A sword will whirl through his cities;
HOS.11.6	it will destroy and devour the bars of his gates,
HOS.11.6	because of their schemes.
HOS.11.7	My people are bent on turning from me.
HOS.11.7	Though they call to him on high,
HOS.11.7	he will not exalt them at all.
HOS.11.8	How can I give you up, Ephraim?
HOS.11.8	How can I surrender you, Israel?
HOS.11.8	How can I make you like Admah?
HOS.11.8	How can I treat you like Zeboiim?
HOS.11.8	I have had a change of heart;
HOS.11.8	my compassion is stirred!
HOS.11.9	I will not vent the full fury of my anger;
HOS.11.9	I will not turn back to destroy Ephraim.
HOS.11.9	For I am God and not man,
HOS.11.9	the Holy One among you;
HOS.11.9	I will not come in rage.
HOS.11.10	They will follow the 
HOS.11.10	he will roar like a lion.
HOS.11.10	When he roars,
HOS.11.10	his children will come trembling from the west.
HOS.11.11	They will be roused like birds from Egypt
HOS.11.11	and like doves
HOS.11.11	Then I will settle them in their homes.
HOS.11.11	This is the 
HOS.11.12	Ephraim surrounds me with lies,
HOS.11.12	the house of Israel, with deceit.
HOS.11.12	Judah still wanders with God
HOS.11.12	and is faithful to the holy ones.
HOS.12.1	Ephraim chases
HOS.12.1	and pursues the east wind.
HOS.12.1	He continually multiplies lies and violence.
HOS.12.1	He makes a covenant with Assyria,
HOS.12.1	and olive oil is carried to Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.2	He is about to punish Jacob according to his conduct;
HOS.12.2	he will repay him based on his actions.
HOS.12.3	In the womb he grasped his brother’s heel,
HOS.12.3	and as an adult he wrestled with God.
HOS.12.4	Jacob struggled with the angel and prevailed;
HOS.12.4	he wept and sought his favor.
HOS.12.4	He found him at Bethel,
HOS.12.4	and there he spoke with him.
HOS.12.5	The 
HOS.12.5	the 
HOS.12.6	But you must return to your God.
HOS.12.6	Maintain love and justice,
HOS.12.6	and always put your hope in God.
HOS.12.7	A merchant loves to extort
HOS.12.7	with dishonest scales in his hands.
HOS.12.8	But Ephraim thinks,
HOS.12.8	“How rich I have become;
HOS.12.8	I made it all myself.
HOS.12.8	In all my earnings,
HOS.12.8	no one can find any iniquity in me
HOS.12.8	that I can be punished for!” 
HOS.12.9	I have been the 
HOS.12.9	ever since
HOS.12.9	I will make you live in tents again,
HOS.12.9	as in the festival days.
HOS.12.10	I will speak through the prophets
HOS.12.10	and grant many visions;
HOS.12.10	I will give parables through the prophets.
HOS.12.11	Since Gilead is full of evil,
HOS.12.11	they will certainly come to nothing.
HOS.12.11	They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal;
HOS.12.11	even their altars will be like piles of rocks
HOS.12.11	on the furrows of a field.
HOS.12.12	Jacob fled to the territory of Aram.
HOS.12.12	Israel worked to earn a wife;
HOS.12.12	he tended flocks for a wife.
HOS.12.13	The 
HOS.12.13	and Israel was tended by a prophet.
HOS.12.14	Ephraim has provoked bitter anger,
HOS.12.14	so his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him
HOS.12.14	and repay him for his contempt.
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spoke,
HOS.13.1	he was exalted in Israel.
HOS.13.1	But he incurred guilt through Baal
HOS.13.2	Now they continue to sin
HOS.13.2	and make themselves a cast image,
HOS.13.2	idols skillfully made from their silver,
HOS.13.2	all of them the work of craftsmen.
HOS.13.2	People say about them,
HOS.13.2	“Let the men who sacrifice
HOS.13.3	Therefore, they will be like the morning mist,
HOS.13.3	like the early dew that vanishes,
HOS.13.3	like chaff blown from a threshing floor,
HOS.13.3	or like smoke from a window.
HOS.13.4	I have been the 
HOS.13.4	ever since
HOS.13.4	you know no God but me,
HOS.13.4	and no Savior exists besides me.
HOS.13.5	I knew
HOS.13.5	in the land of drought.
HOS.13.6	When they had pasture,
HOS.13.6	they became satisfied;
HOS.13.6	they were satisfied,
HOS.13.6	and their hearts became proud.
HOS.13.6	Therefore they forgot me.
HOS.13.7	So I will be like a lion
HOS.13.7	I will lurk like a leopard
HOS.13.8	I will attack them
HOS.13.8	like a bear robbed of her cubs
HOS.13.8	and tear open the rib cage over their hearts.
HOS.13.8	I will devour them there like a lioness,
HOS.13.8	like a wild beast that would rip them open.
HOS.13.9	I will destroy you, Israel;
HOS.13.9	you have no help but me.
HOS.13.10	Where now is your king,
HOS.13.10	that he may save you in all your cities,
HOS.13.10	and the
HOS.13.10	“Give me a king and leaders”?
HOS.13.11	I give you a king in my anger
HOS.13.11	and take away a king in my wrath.
HOS.13.12	Ephraim’s guilt is preserved;
HOS.13.12	his sin is stored up.
HOS.13.13	Labor pains come on him.
HOS.13.13	He is not a wise son;
HOS.13.13	when the time comes,
HOS.13.13	he will not be born.
HOS.13.14	I will ransom them from the power of Sheol.
HOS.13.14	I will redeem
HOS.13.14	Death, where are your barbs?
HOS.13.14	Sheol, where is your sting?
HOS.13.14	Compassion is hidden from my eyes.
HOS.13.15	Although he flourishes among his brothers,
HOS.13.15	an east wind will come,
HOS.13.15	a wind from the 
HOS.13.15	His water source will fail,
HOS.13.15	and his spring will run dry.
HOS.13.15	The wind
HOS.13.15	of every precious item.
HOS.13.16	Samaria
HOS.13.16	because she has rebelled against her God.
HOS.13.16	They will fall by the sword;
HOS.13.16	their children will be dashed to pieces,
HOS.13.16	and their pregnant women ripped open.
HOS.14.1	Israel, return to the 
HOS.14.1	for you have stumbled in your iniquity.
HOS.14.2	Take words of repentance with you
HOS.14.2	and return to the 
HOS.14.2	Say to him: “Forgive all our iniquity
HOS.14.2	and accept what is good,
HOS.14.2	so that we may repay you
HOS.14.2	with praise
HOS.14.3	Assyria will not save us,
HOS.14.3	we will not ride on horses,
HOS.14.3	and we will no longer proclaim, ‘Our gods! ’ 
HOS.14.3	to the work of our hands.
HOS.14.3	For the fatherless receives compassion in you.”
HOS.14.4	I will heal their apostasy;
HOS.14.4	I will freely love them,
HOS.14.4	for my anger will have turned from him.
HOS.14.5	I will be like the dew to Israel;
HOS.14.5	he will blossom like the lily
HOS.14.5	and take root like the cedars of Lebanon.
HOS.14.6	His new branches will spread,
HOS.14.6	and his splendor will be like the olive tree,
HOS.14.6	his fragrance, like the forest of Lebanon.
HOS.14.7	The people will return and live beneath his shade.
HOS.14.7	They will grow grain
HOS.14.7	and blossom like the vine.
HOS.14.7	His renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.
HOS.14.8	Ephraim, why should I
HOS.14.8	to do with idols?
HOS.14.8	It is I who answer and watch over him.
HOS.14.8	I am like a flourishing pine tree;
HOS.14.8	your fruit comes from me.
HOS.14.9	Let whoever is wise
HOS.14.9	and whoever is insightful recognize them.
HOS.14.9	For the ways of the 
HOS.14.9	and the righteous walk in them,
HOS.14.9	but the rebellious stumble in them.
JOL.1.1	The word of the 
JOL.1.2	Hear this,

JOL.1.2	Has anything like this ever happened in your days
JOL.1.2	or in the days of your ancestors?
JOL.1.3	Tell your children about it,
JOL.1.3	and let your children tell their children,
JOL.1.3	and their children the next generation.
JOL.1.4	What the devouring locust
JOL.1.4	the swarming locust has eaten;
JOL.1.4	what the swarming locust has left,
JOL.1.4	the young locust
JOL.1.4	and what the young locust has left,
JOL.1.4	the destroying locust
JOL.1.5	Wake up, you drunkards,
JOL.1.5	wail, all you wine drinkers,
JOL.1.5	because of the sweet wine,
JOL.1.5	for it has been taken from your mouth.
JOL.1.6	For a nation has invaded my land,
JOL.1.6	powerful and without number;
JOL.1.6	its teeth are the teeth of a lion,
JOL.1.6	and it has the fangs of a lioness.
JOL.1.7	It has devastated my grapevine
JOL.1.7	and splintered my fig tree.
JOL.1.7	It has stripped off its bark and thrown it away;
JOL.1.7	its branches have turned white.
JOL.1.8	Grieve like a young woman dressed in sackcloth,
JOL.1.8	mourning for the husband of her youth.
JOL.1.9	Grain and drink offerings have been cut off
JOL.1.9	from the house of the 
JOL.1.9	the priests, who are ministers of the 
JOL.1.10	The fields are destroyed;
JOL.1.10	the land grieves;
JOL.1.10	indeed, the grain is destroyed;
JOL.1.10	the new wine is dried up;
JOL.1.10	and the fresh oil fails.
JOL.1.11	Be ashamed, you farmers,
JOL.1.11	wail, you vinedressers,
JOL.1.11	over the wheat and the barley,
JOL.1.11	because the harvest of the field has perished.
JOL.1.12	The grapevine is dried up,
JOL.1.12	and the fig tree is withered;
JOL.1.12	the pomegranate,
JOL.1.12	all the trees of the orchard — have withered.
JOL.1.12	Indeed, human joy has dried up.
JOL.1.13	Dress in sackcloth and lament,
JOL.1.13	wail,
JOL.1.13	Come and spend the night in sackcloth,
JOL.1.13	you ministers of my God,
JOL.1.13	because grain and drink offerings
JOL.1.13	are withheld from the house of your God.
JOL.1.14	Announce a sacred fast;
JOL.1.14	proclaim an assembly!
JOL.1.14	Gather the elders
JOL.1.14	and all the residents of the land
JOL.1.14	at the house of the 
JOL.1.14	and cry out to the 
JOL.1.15	Woe because of that day!
JOL.1.15	For the day of the 
JOL.1.15	and will come as devastation from the Almighty.
JOL.1.16	Hasn’t the food been cut off
JOL.1.16	before our eyes,
JOL.1.16	joy and gladness
JOL.1.16	from the house of our God?
JOL.1.17	The seeds lie shriveled in their casings.
JOL.1.17	The storehouses are in ruin,
JOL.1.17	and the granaries are broken down,
JOL.1.17	because the grain has withered away.
JOL.1.18	How the animals groan!
JOL.1.18	The herds of cattle wander in confusion
JOL.1.18	since they have no pasture.
JOL.1.18	Even the flocks of sheep and goats suffer punishment.
JOL.1.19	I call to you, 
JOL.1.19	for fire has consumed
JOL.1.19	the pastures of the wilderness,
JOL.1.19	and flames have devoured
JOL.1.19	all the trees of the orchard.
JOL.1.20	Even the wild animals cry out to
JOL.1.20	for the river beds are dried up,
JOL.1.20	and fire has consumed
JOL.1.20	the pastures of the wilderness.
JOL.2.1	Blow the horn in Zion;
JOL.2.1	sound the alarm on my holy mountain!
JOL.2.1	Let all the residents of the land tremble,
JOL.2.1	for the day of the 
JOL.2.1	in fact, it is near —
JOL.2.2	a day of darkness and gloom,
JOL.2.2	a day of clouds and total darkness,
JOL.2.2	like the dawn spreading over the mountains;
JOL.2.2	a great and strong people
JOL.2.2	such as never existed in ages past
JOL.2.2	and never will again
JOL.2.2	in all the generations to come.
JOL.2.3	A fire devours in front of them,
JOL.2.3	and behind them a flame blazes.
JOL.2.3	The land in front of them
JOL.2.3	is like the garden of Eden,
JOL.2.3	but behind them,
JOL.2.3	it is like a desert wasteland;
JOL.2.3	there is no escape from them.
JOL.2.4	Their appearance is like that of horses,
JOL.2.4	and they gallop like war horses.
JOL.2.5	They bound on the tops of the mountains.
JOL.2.5	Their sound is like the sound of chariots,
JOL.2.5	like the sound of fiery flames consuming stubble,
JOL.2.5	like a mighty army deployed for war.
JOL.2.6	Nations writhe in horror before them;
JOL.2.6	all faces turn pale.
JOL.2.7	They attack as warriors attack;
JOL.2.7	they scale walls as men of war do.
JOL.2.7	Each goes on his own path,
JOL.2.7	and they do not change their course.
JOL.2.8	They do not push each other;
JOL.2.8	each proceeds on his own path.
JOL.2.8	They dodge the arrows, never stopping.
JOL.2.9	They storm the city;
JOL.2.9	they run on the wall;
JOL.2.9	they climb into the houses;
JOL.2.9	they enter through the windows like thieves.
JOL.2.10	The earth quakes before them;
JOL.2.10	the sky shakes.
JOL.2.10	The sun and moon grow dark,
JOL.2.10	and the stars cease their shining.
JOL.2.11	The 
JOL.2.11	in the presence of his army.
JOL.2.11	His camp is very large;
JOL.2.11	those who carry out his command are powerful.
JOL.2.11	Indeed, the day of the 
JOL.2.11	who can endure it?
JOL.2.12	Even now —
JOL.2.12	this is the 
JOL.2.12	turn to me with all your heart,
JOL.2.12	with fasting, weeping, and mourning.
JOL.2.13	Tear your hearts,
JOL.2.13	not just your clothes,
JOL.2.13	and return to the 
JOL.2.13	For he is gracious and compassionate,
JOL.2.13	slow to anger, abounding in faithful love,
JOL.2.13	and he relents from sending disaster.
JOL.2.14	Who knows? He may turn and relent
JOL.2.14	and leave a blessing behind him,
JOL.2.14	so you can offer grain and wine
JOL.2.14	to the 
JOL.2.15	Blow the horn in Zion!
JOL.2.15	Announce a sacred fast;
JOL.2.15	proclaim an assembly.
JOL.2.16	Gather the people;
JOL.2.16	sanctify the congregation;
JOL.2.16	assemble the aged;
JOL.2.16	gather the infants,
JOL.2.16	even babies nursing at the breast.
JOL.2.16	Let the groom leave his bedroom,
JOL.2.16	and the bride her honeymoon chamber.
JOL.2.17	Let the priests,
JOL.2.17	weep between the portico and the altar.
JOL.2.17	Let them say:
JOL.2.17	“Have pity on your people, 
JOL.2.17	and do not make your inheritance a disgrace,
JOL.2.17	an object of scorn among the nations.
JOL.2.17	Why should it be said among the peoples,
JOL.2.17	‘Where is their God?’” 
JOL.2.18	Then the 
JOL.2.19	The 
JOL.2.19	Look, I am about to send you
JOL.2.19	grain, new wine, and fresh oil.
JOL.2.19	You will be satiated with them,
JOL.2.19	and I will no longer make you
JOL.2.19	a disgrace among the nations.
JOL.2.20	I will drive the northerner far from you
JOL.2.20	and banish him to a dry and desolate land,
JOL.2.20	his front ranks into the Dead Sea,
JOL.2.20	and his rear guard into the Mediterranean Sea.
JOL.2.20	His stench will rise;
JOL.2.20	yes, his rotten smell will rise,
JOL.2.20	for he has done astonishing things.
JOL.2.21	Don’t be afraid, land;
JOL.2.21	rejoice and be glad,
JOL.2.21	for the 
JOL.2.22	Don’t be afraid, wild animals,
JOL.2.22	for the wilderness pastures have turned green,
JOL.2.22	the trees bear their fruit,
JOL.2.22	and the fig tree and grapevine yield their riches.
JOL.2.23	Children of Zion,
JOL.2.23	in the 
JOL.2.23	because he gives you the autumn rain
JOL.2.23	for your vindication.
JOL.2.23	He sends showers for you,
JOL.2.23	both autumn and spring rain
JOL.2.24	The threshing floors will be full of grain,
JOL.2.24	and the vats will overflow
JOL.2.24	with new wine and fresh oil.
JOL.2.25	I will repay you for the years
JOL.2.25	that the swarming locust ate,
JOL.2.25	the young locust, the destroying locust,
JOL.2.25	and the devouring locust —
JOL.2.25	my great army that I sent against you.
JOL.2.26	You will have plenty to eat and be satisfied.
JOL.2.26	You will praise the name of the 
JOL.2.26	who has dealt wondrously with you.
JOL.2.26	My people will never again be put to shame.
JOL.2.27	You will know that I am present in Israel
JOL.2.27	and that I am the 
JOL.2.27	and there is no other.
JOL.2.27	My people will never again be put to shame.
JOL.2.28	After this
JOL.2.28	I will pour out my Spirit
JOL.2.28	then your sons and your daughters will prophesy,
JOL.2.28	your old men will have dreams,
JOL.2.28	and your young men will see visions.
JOL.2.29	I will even pour out my Spirit
JOL.2.29	on the male and female slaves in those days.
JOL.2.30	I will display wonders
JOL.2.30	in the heavens and on the earth:
JOL.2.30	blood, fire, and columns of smoke.
JOL.2.31	The sun will be turned to darkness
JOL.2.31	and the moon to blood
JOL.2.31	before the great and terrible day of the 
JOL.2.32	Then everyone who calls
JOL.2.32	on the name of the 
JOL.2.32	for there will be an escape
JOL.2.32	for those on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
JOL.2.32	as the 
JOL.2.32	among the survivors the 
JOL.3.1	Yes, in those days and at that time,
JOL.3.1	when I restore the fortunes of Judah and Jerusalem,
JOL.3.2	I will gather all the nations
JOL.3.2	and take them to the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
JOL.3.2	I will enter into judgment with them there
JOL.3.2	because of my people, my inheritance Israel.
JOL.3.2	The nations have scattered the Israelites
JOL.3.2	in foreign countries
JOL.3.2	and divided up my land.
JOL.3.3	They cast lots for my people;
JOL.3.3	they bartered a boy for a prostitute
JOL.3.3	and sold a girl for wine to drink.
JOL.3.4	And also: Tyre,
JOL.3.5	For you took my silver and gold and carried my finest treasures
JOL.3.6	You sold the people of Judah and Jerusalem to the Greeks
JOL.3.7	Look, I am about to rouse them up from the place where you sold them;
JOL.3.8	I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah,
JOL.3.9	Proclaim this among the nations:
JOL.3.9	Prepare for holy war;
JOL.3.9	rouse the warriors;
JOL.3.9	let all the men of war advance and attack!
JOL.3.10	Beat your plows into swords
JOL.3.10	and your pruning knives into spears.
JOL.3.10	Let even the weakling say, “I am a warrior.”
JOL.3.11	Come quickly,
JOL.3.11	gather yourselves.
JOL.3.11	Bring down your warriors there, 
JOL.3.12	Let the nations be roused
JOL.3.12	and come to the Valley of Jehoshaphat,
JOL.3.12	for there I will sit down
JOL.3.12	to judge all the surrounding nations.
JOL.3.13	Swing the sickle
JOL.3.13	because the harvest is ripe.
JOL.3.13	Come and trample the grapes
JOL.3.13	because the winepress is full;
JOL.3.13	the wine vats overflow
JOL.3.13	because the wickedness of the nations is extreme.
JOL.3.14	Multitudes, multitudes
JOL.3.14	in the valley of decision!
JOL.3.14	For the day of the 
JOL.3.14	in the valley of decision.
JOL.3.15	The sun and moon will grow dark,
JOL.3.15	and the stars will cease their shining.
JOL.3.16	The 
JOL.3.16	and make his voice heard from Jerusalem;
JOL.3.16	heaven and earth will shake.
JOL.3.16	But the 
JOL.3.16	a stronghold for the Israelites.
JOL.3.17	Then you will know
JOL.3.17	that I am the 
JOL.3.17	who dwells in Zion, my holy mountain.
JOL.3.17	Jerusalem will be holy,
JOL.3.17	and foreigners will never overrun it again.
JOL.3.18	In that day
JOL.3.18	the mountains will drip with sweet wine,
JOL.3.18	and the hills will flow with milk.
JOL.3.18	All the streams of Judah will flow with water,
JOL.3.18	and a spring will issue from the 
JOL.3.18	watering the Valley of Acacias.
JOL.3.19	Egypt will become desolate,
JOL.3.19	and Edom a desert wasteland,
JOL.3.19	because of the violence done to the people of Judah
JOL.3.19	in whose land they shed innocent blood.
JOL.3.20	But Judah will be inhabited forever,
JOL.3.20	and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
JOL.3.21	I will pardon their bloodguilt,
JOL.3.21	which I have not pardoned,
JOL.3.21	for the 
AMO.1.1	The words of Amos, who was one of the sheep breeders
AMO.1.2	He said:
AMO.1.2	The 
AMO.1.2	and makes his voice heard from Jerusalem;
AMO.1.2	the pastures of the shepherds mourn,
AMO.1.2	and the summit of Carmel
AMO.1.3	The 
AMO.1.3	I will not relent from punishing Damascus
AMO.1.3	for three crimes, even four,
AMO.1.3	because they threshed Gilead with iron sledges.
AMO.1.4	Therefore, I will send fire against Hazael’s palace,
AMO.1.4	and it will consume Ben-hadad’s
AMO.1.5	I will break down the gates
AMO.1.5	I will cut off the ruler from the Valley of Aven,
AMO.1.5	and the one who wields the scepter from Beth-eden.
AMO.1.5	The people of Aram will be exiled to Kir.
AMO.1.5	The 
AMO.1.6	The 
AMO.1.6	I will not relent from punishing Gaza
AMO.1.6	for three crimes, even four,
AMO.1.6	because they exiled a whole community,
AMO.1.6	handing them over to Edom.
AMO.1.7	Therefore, I will send fire against the walls of Gaza,
AMO.1.7	and it will consume its citadels.
AMO.1.8	I will cut off the ruler from Ashdod,
AMO.1.8	and the one who wields the scepter from Ashkelon.
AMO.1.8	I will also turn my hand against Ekron,
AMO.1.8	and the remainder of the Philistines
AMO.1.8	The Lord 
AMO.1.9	The 
AMO.1.9	I will not relent from punishing Tyre
AMO.1.9	for three crimes, even four,
AMO.1.9	because they handed over
AMO.1.9	a whole community of exiles to Edom
AMO.1.9	and broke
AMO.1.10	Therefore, I will send fire
AMO.1.10	and it will consume its citadels.
AMO.1.11	The 
AMO.1.11	I will not relent from punishing Edom
AMO.1.11	for three crimes, even four,
AMO.1.11	because he pursued his brother with the sword.
AMO.1.11	He stifled his compassion,
AMO.1.11	his anger tore at him
AMO.1.11	and he harbored his rage incessantly.
AMO.1.12	Therefore, I will send fire against Teman,
AMO.1.12	and it will consume the citadels of Bozrah.
AMO.1.13	The 
AMO.1.13	I will not relent from punishing the Ammonites
AMO.1.13	for three crimes, even four,
AMO.1.13	because they ripped open
AMO.1.13	the pregnant women of Gilead
AMO.1.13	in order to enlarge their territory.
AMO.1.14	Therefore, I will set fire to the walls of Rabbah,
AMO.1.14	and it will consume its citadels.
AMO.1.14	There will be shouting on the day of battle
AMO.1.14	and a violent wind on the day of the storm.
AMO.1.15	Their king and his princes
AMO.1.15	will go into exile together.
AMO.1.15	The 
AMO.2.1	The 
AMO.2.1	I will not relent from punishing Moab
AMO.2.1	for three crimes, even four,
AMO.2.1	because he burned the bones
AMO.2.1	of the king of Edom to lime.
AMO.2.2	Therefore, I will send fire against Moab,
AMO.2.2	and it will consume the citadels of Kerioth.
AMO.2.2	Moab will die with a tumult,
AMO.2.2	with shouting and the sound of the ram’s horn.

AMO.2.4	have led them astray.

AMO.2.6	The 
AMO.2.6	I will not relent from punishing Israel
AMO.2.6	for three crimes, even four,
AMO.2.6	because they sell a righteous person for silver
AMO.2.6	and a needy person for a pair of sandals.
AMO.2.7	They trample the heads of the poor
AMO.2.7	on the dust of the ground
AMO.2.7	and obstruct the path of the needy.
AMO.2.7	A man and his father have sexual relations
AMO.2.7	with the same girl,
AMO.2.7	profaning my holy name.
AMO.2.8	They stretch out beside every altar
AMO.2.8	on garments taken as collateral,
AMO.2.8	and in the house of their God
AMO.2.8	they drink wine obtained through fines.
AMO.2.9	Yet I destroyed the Amorite
AMO.2.9	his height
AMO.2.9	and he was as sturdy as the oaks;
AMO.2.9	I destroyed his fruit
AMO.2.10	And I brought you from the land of Egypt
AMO.2.10	and led you forty years in the wilderness
AMO.2.10	in order to possess the land of the Amorite.
AMO.2.11	I raised up some of your sons as prophets
AMO.2.11	and some of your young men as Nazirites.
AMO.2.11	Is this not the case, Israelites?
AMO.2.11	This is the 
AMO.2.12	But you made the Nazirites drink wine
AMO.2.12	and commanded the prophets,
AMO.2.12	“Do not prophesy.”
AMO.2.13	Look, I am about to crush
AMO.2.13	as a wagon crushes when full of grain.
AMO.2.14	Escape will fail the swift,
AMO.2.14	the strong one will not maintain his strength,
AMO.2.14	and the warrior will not save his life.
AMO.2.15	The archer will not stand his ground,
AMO.2.15	the one who is swift of foot
AMO.2.15	will not save himself,
AMO.2.15	and the one riding a horse will not save his life.
AMO.2.16	Even the most courageous of the warriors
AMO.2.16	will flee naked on that day
AMO.2.16	this is the 
AMO.3.1	Listen to this message that the 
AMO.3.2	I have known only you
AMO.3.2	out of all the clans of the earth;
AMO.3.2	therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities.
AMO.3.3	Can two walk together
AMO.3.3	without agreeing to meet?
AMO.3.4	Does a lion roar
AMO.3.4	when it has no prey?
AMO.3.4	Does a young lion growl from its lair
AMO.3.4	unless it has captured something?
AMO.3.5	Does a bird land in a trap on the ground
AMO.3.5	if there is no bait for it?
AMO.3.5	Does a trap spring from the ground
AMO.3.5	when it has caught nothing?
AMO.3.6	If a ram’s horn
AMO.3.6	aren’t people afraid?
AMO.3.6	If a disaster
AMO.3.6	hasn’t the 
AMO.3.7	Indeed, the Lord 
AMO.3.7	without revealing his counsel
AMO.3.7	to his servants the prophets.
AMO.3.8	A lion has roared;
AMO.3.8	who will not fear?
AMO.3.8	The Lord 
AMO.3.8	who will not prophesy?
AMO.3.9	Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod
AMO.3.9	and on the citadels in the land of Egypt:
AMO.3.9	Assemble on the mountains of Samaria,
AMO.3.9	and see the great turmoil in the city
AMO.3.9	and the acts of oppression within it.
AMO.3.10	The people are incapable of doing right
AMO.3.10	this is the 
AMO.3.10	those who store up violence and destruction
AMO.3.10	in their citadels.
AMO.3.11	Therefore, the Lord 
AMO.3.11	An enemy
AMO.3.11	he will destroy
AMO.3.11	and plunder your citadels.
AMO.3.12	The 
AMO.3.12	As the shepherd snatches two legs
AMO.3.12	or a piece of an ear
AMO.3.12	from the lion’s mouth,
AMO.3.12	so the Israelites who live in Samaria
AMO.3.12	will be rescued
AMO.3.12	with only the corner of a bed
AMO.3.12	or the
AMO.3.13	Listen and testify
AMO.3.13	this is the declaration of the Lord 
AMO.3.13	the God of Armies.
AMO.3.14	I will punish the altars of Bethel
AMO.3.14	on the day I punish Israel for its crimes;
AMO.3.14	the horns of the altar
AMO.3.14	and fall to the ground.
AMO.3.15	I will demolish the winter house
AMO.3.15	and the summer house;
AMO.3.15	the houses inlaid with ivory
AMO.3.15	and the great houses
AMO.3.15	This is the 
AMO.4.1	Listen to this message, you cows of Bashan
AMO.4.1	who are on the hill of Samaria,
AMO.4.1	women who oppress the poor
AMO.4.1	and crush the needy,
AMO.4.1	who say to their husbands,
AMO.4.1	“Bring us something to drink.”
AMO.4.2	The Lord 
AMO.4.2	Look, the days are coming
AMO.4.2	when you will be taken away with hooks,
AMO.4.2	every last one of you with fishhooks.
AMO.4.3	You will go through breaches in the wall,
AMO.4.3	each woman straight ahead,
AMO.4.3	and you will be driven along toward Harmon.
AMO.4.3	This is the 
AMO.4.4	Come to Bethel and rebel;
AMO.4.4	rebel even more at Gilgal!
AMO.4.4	Bring your sacrifices every morning,
AMO.4.4	your tenths every three days.
AMO.4.5	Offer leavened bread as a thank offering,
AMO.4.5	and loudly proclaim your freewill offerings,
AMO.4.5	for that is what you Israelites love to do!
AMO.4.5	This is the declaration of the Lord 
AMO.4.6	I gave you absolutely nothing to eat
AMO.4.6	in all your cities,
AMO.4.6	a shortage of food in all your communities,
AMO.4.6	yet you did not return to me.
AMO.4.6	This is the 
AMO.4.7	I also withheld the rain from you
AMO.4.7	while there were still three months until harvest.
AMO.4.7	I sent rain on one city
AMO.4.7	but no rain on another.
AMO.4.7	One field received rain
AMO.4.7	while a field with no rain withered.
AMO.4.8	Two or three cities staggered
AMO.4.8	to another city to drink water
AMO.4.8	but were not satisfied,
AMO.4.8	yet you did not return
AMO.4.8	This is the 
AMO.4.9	I struck you with blight and mildew;
AMO.4.9	the locust devoured
AMO.4.9	your many gardens and vineyards,
AMO.4.9	your fig trees and olive trees,
AMO.4.9	yet you did not return to me.
AMO.4.9	This is the 
AMO.4.10	I sent plagues like those of Egypt;
AMO.4.10	I killed your young men with the sword,
AMO.4.10	along with your captured horses.
AMO.4.10	I caused the stench of your camp
AMO.4.10	to fill your nostrils,
AMO.4.10	yet you did not return to me.
AMO.4.10	This is the 
AMO.4.11	I overthrew some of you
AMO.4.11	as I
AMO.4.11	and you were like a burning stick
AMO.4.11	snatched from a fire,
AMO.4.11	yet you did not return to me
AMO.4.11	This is the 
AMO.4.12	Therefore, Israel, that is what I will do to you,
AMO.4.12	and since I will do that to you,
AMO.4.12	Israel, prepare to meet your God!
AMO.4.13	He is here:
AMO.4.13	the one who forms the mountains,
AMO.4.13	creates the wind,
AMO.4.13	and reveals his thoughts to man,
AMO.4.13	the one who makes the dawn out of darkness
AMO.4.13	and strides on the heights of the earth.
AMO.4.13	The 
AMO.5.1	Listen to this message that I am singing for you, a lament,
AMO.5.2	She has fallen;
AMO.5.2	Virgin Israel
AMO.5.2	She lies abandoned on her land
AMO.5.2	with no one to raise her up.
AMO.5.3	For the Lord 
AMO.5.3	The city that marches out a thousand strong
AMO.5.3	will have only a hundred left,
AMO.5.3	and the one that marches out a hundred strong
AMO.5.3	will have only ten left
AMO.5.4	For the 
AMO.5.4	Seek me and live!
AMO.5.5	Do not seek Bethel
AMO.5.5	or go to Gilgal
AMO.5.5	or journey to Beer-sheba,
AMO.5.5	for Gilgal will certainly go into exile,
AMO.5.5	and Bethel will come to nothing.
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.6	or he will spread like fire
AMO.5.6	throughout the house of Joseph;
AMO.5.6	it will consume everything
AMO.5.6	with no one at Bethel to extinguish it.
AMO.5.7	Those who turn justice into wormwood
AMO.5.7	also throw righteousness to the ground.
AMO.5.8	The one who made the Pleiades and Orion,
AMO.5.8	who turns darkness
AMO.5.8	and darkens day into night,
AMO.5.8	who summons the water of the sea
AMO.5.8	and pours it out over the surface of the earth
AMO.5.8	the 
AMO.5.9	He brings destruction
AMO.5.9	and it falls on the fortress.
AMO.5.10	They hate the one who convicts the guilty
AMO.5.10	at the city gate,
AMO.5.10	and they despise
AMO.5.11	Therefore, because you trample on the poor
AMO.5.11	and exact a grain tax from him,
AMO.5.11	you will never live in the houses of cut stone
AMO.5.11	you have built;
AMO.5.11	you will never drink the wine
AMO.5.11	from the lush vineyards
AMO.5.11	you have planted.
AMO.5.12	For I know your crimes are many
AMO.5.12	and your sins innumerable.
AMO.5.12	They oppress the righteous,
AMO.5.12	and deprive the poor of justice
AMO.5.13	Therefore, those who have insight will keep silent
AMO.5.13	at such a time,
AMO.5.13	for the days are evil.
AMO.5.14	Pursue good and not evil
AMO.5.14	so that you may live,
AMO.5.14	and the 
AMO.5.14	will be with you
AMO.5.14	as you have claimed.
AMO.5.15	Hate evil and love good;
AMO.5.15	establish justice in the city gate.
AMO.5.15	Perhaps the 
AMO.5.15	to the remnant of Joseph.
AMO.5.16	Therefore the 
AMO.5.16	There will be wailing in all the public squares;
AMO.5.16	they will cry out in anguish
AMO.5.16	The farmer will be called on to mourn,
AMO.5.16	and professional mourners
AMO.5.17	There will be wailing in all the vineyards,
AMO.5.17	for I will pass among you.
AMO.5.17	The 
AMO.5.18	Woe to you who long for the day of the 
AMO.5.18	What will the day of the 
AMO.5.18	It will be darkness and not light.
AMO.5.19	It will be like a man who flees from a lion
AMO.5.19	only to have a bear confront him.
AMO.5.19	He goes home and rests his hand against the wall
AMO.5.19	only to have a snake bite him.
AMO.5.20	Won’t the day of the 
AMO.5.20	be darkness rather than light,
AMO.5.20	even gloom without any brightness in it?
AMO.5.21	I hate, I despise, your feasts!
AMO.5.21	I can’t stand the stench
AMO.5.21	of your solemn assemblies.
AMO.5.22	Even if you offer me
AMO.5.22	your burnt offerings and grain offerings,
AMO.5.22	I will not accept them;
AMO.5.22	I will have no regard
AMO.5.22	for your fellowship offerings of fattened cattle.
AMO.5.23	Take away from me the noise of your songs!
AMO.5.23	I will not listen to the music of your harps.
AMO.5.24	But let justice flow like water,
AMO.5.24	and righteousness, like an unfailing stream.
AMO.5.25	“House of Israel, was it sacrifices and grain offerings that you presented to me during the forty years in the wilderness?
AMO.5.26	But you have taken up
AMO.5.27	So I will send you into exile beyond Damascus.”
AMO.6.1	Woe to those who are at ease in Zion
AMO.6.1	and to those who feel secure on the hill of Samaria —
AMO.6.1	the notable people in this first of the nations,
AMO.6.1	those the house of Israel comes to.
AMO.6.2	Cross over to Calneh
AMO.6.2	go from there to great Hamath;
AMO.6.2	then go down to Gath
AMO.6.2	Are you better than these kingdoms?
AMO.6.2	Is their territory larger than yours?
AMO.6.3	You dismiss any thought of the evil day
AMO.6.3	and bring in a reign of violence.
AMO.6.4	They lie on beds inlaid with ivory,
AMO.6.4	sprawled out on their couches,
AMO.6.4	and dine on lambs from the flock
AMO.6.4	and calves from the stall.
AMO.6.5	They improvise songs
AMO.6.5	and invent
AMO.6.6	They drink wine by the bowlful
AMO.6.6	and anoint themselves with the finest oils
AMO.6.6	but do not grieve over the ruin of Joseph.
AMO.6.7	Therefore, they will now go into exile
AMO.6.7	as the first of the captives,
AMO.6.7	and the feasting
AMO.6.7	will come to an end.
AMO.6.8	The Lord 
AMO.6.8	I loathe Jacob’s pride
AMO.6.8	and hate his citadels,
AMO.6.8	so I will hand over the city
AMO.6.9	And if there are ten men left in one house, they will die.
AMO.6.10	A close relative
AMO.6.10	That person will reply, “None.”
AMO.6.10	Then he will say, “Silence, because the 
AMO.6.11	For the 
AMO.6.11	The large house will be smashed to pieces,
AMO.6.11	and the small house to rubble.
AMO.6.12	Do horses gallop on the cliffs?
AMO.6.12	Does anyone plow there with oxen?
AMO.6.12	Yet you have turned justice into poison
AMO.6.12	and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood
AMO.6.13	you who rejoice over Lo-debar
AMO.6.13	and say, “Didn’t we capture Karnaim
AMO.6.13	for ourselves by our own strength?” 
AMO.6.14	But look, I am raising up a nation
AMO.6.14	against you, house of Israel
AMO.6.14	this is the declaration of the Lord,
AMO.6.14	the 
AMO.6.14	and they will oppress you
AMO.6.14	from the entrance of Hamath
AMO.6.14	to the Brook of the Arabah.
AMO.7.1	The Lord 
AMO.7.2	When the locusts finished eating the vegetation of the land,
AMO.7.3	The 
AMO.7.4	The Lord 
AMO.7.5	Then I said, “Lord 
AMO.7.6	The 
AMO.7.7	He showed me this: The Lord was standing there by a vertical wall with a plumb line in his hand. 
AMO.7.8	The 
AMO.7.8	I replied, “A plumb line.”
AMO.7.8	Then the Lord said, “I am setting a plumb line among my people Israel;
AMO.7.9	Isaac’s high places
AMO.7.9	and Israel’s sanctuaries will be in ruins;
AMO.7.9	I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam
AMO.7.9	with a sword.”
AMO.7.10	Amaziah the priest
AMO.7.11	for Amos has said this: ‘Jeroboam will die by the sword, and Israel will certainly go into exile from its homeland.’”
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Go away, you seer!
AMO.7.13	but don’t ever prophesy
AMO.7.14	So Amos answered Amaziah, “I was
AMO.7.15	But the 
AMO.7.16	Now hear the word of the 
AMO.7.16	Do not prophesy
AMO.7.16	do not preach
AMO.7.17	Therefore, this is what the 
AMO.7.17	Your wife will be a prostitute in the city,
AMO.7.17	your sons and daughters will fall by the sword,
AMO.7.17	and your land will be divided up
AMO.7.17	with a measuring line.
AMO.7.17	You yourself will die on pagan
AMO.7.17	and Israel will certainly go into exile
AMO.7.17	from its homeland.
AMO.8.1	The Lord 
AMO.8.2	He asked me, “What do you see, Amos?” 
AMO.8.2	I replied, “A basket of summer fruit.”
AMO.8.2	The 
AMO.8.3	In that day the temple
AMO.8.4	Hear this, you who trample on the needy
AMO.8.4	and do away with the poor of the land,
AMO.8.5	asking, “When will the New Moon be over
AMO.8.5	so we may sell grain,
AMO.8.5	and the Sabbath,
AMO.8.5	so we may market wheat?
AMO.8.5	We can reduce the measure
AMO.8.5	while increasing the price
AMO.8.5	and cheat with dishonest scales.
AMO.8.6	We can buy the poor with silver
AMO.8.6	and the needy for a pair of sandals
AMO.8.6	and even sell the chaff!”
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.7	I will never forget all their deeds.
AMO.8.8	Because of this, won’t the land quake
AMO.8.8	and all who dwell in it mourn?
AMO.8.8	All of it will rise like the Nile;
AMO.8.8	it will surge and then subside
AMO.8.8	like the Nile in Egypt.
AMO.8.9	And in that day —
AMO.8.9	this is the declaration of the Lord 
AMO.8.9	I will make the sun go down at noon;
AMO.8.9	I will darken the land in the daytime.
AMO.8.10	I will turn your feasts into mourning
AMO.8.10	and all your songs into lamentation;
AMO.8.10	I will cause everyone
AMO.8.10	and every head to be shaved.
AMO.8.10	I will make that grief
AMO.8.10	like mourning for an only son
AMO.8.10	and its outcome like a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	Look, the days are coming —
AMO.8.11	this is the declaration of the Lord 
AMO.8.11	when I will send a famine through the land:
AMO.8.11	not a famine of bread or a thirst for water,
AMO.8.11	but of hearing the words of the 
AMO.8.12	People will stagger from sea to sea
AMO.8.12	and roam from north to east
AMO.8.12	seeking the word of the 
AMO.8.12	but they will not find it.
AMO.8.13	In that day the beautiful young women,
AMO.8.13	the young men also, will faint from thirst.
AMO.8.14	Those who swear by the guilt of Samaria
AMO.8.14	and say, “As your god lives, Dan,”
AMO.8.14	or, “As the way
AMO.8.14	they will fall, never to rise again.
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing beside the altar,
AMO.9.1	Strike the capitals of the pillars
AMO.9.1	so that the thresholds shake;
AMO.9.1	knock them down on the heads of all the people.
AMO.9.1	Then I will kill the rest of them with the sword.
AMO.9.1	None of those who flee will get away;
AMO.9.1	none of the fugitives will escape.
AMO.9.2	If they dig down to Sheol,
AMO.9.2	from there my hand will take them;
AMO.9.2	if they climb up to heaven,
AMO.9.2	from there I will bring them down.
AMO.9.3	If they hide
AMO.9.3	on the top of Carmel,
AMO.9.3	from there I will track them down
AMO.9.3	and seize them;
AMO.9.3	if they conceal themselves
AMO.9.3	from my sight on the sea floor,
AMO.9.3	from there I will command
AMO.9.3	the sea serpent to bite them.
AMO.9.4	And if they are driven
AMO.9.4	by their enemies into captivity,
AMO.9.4	from there I will command
AMO.9.4	the sword to kill them.
AMO.9.4	I will keep my eye on them
AMO.9.4	for harm and not for good.
AMO.9.5	The Lord, the 
AMO.9.5	he touches the earth;
AMO.9.5	it melts, and all who dwell in it mourn;
AMO.9.5	all of it rises like the Nile
AMO.9.5	and subsides like the Nile of Egypt.
AMO.9.6	He builds his upper chambers
AMO.9.6	in the heavens
AMO.9.6	and lays the foundation of his vault
AMO.9.6	on the earth.
AMO.9.6	He summons the water of the sea
AMO.9.6	and pours it out over the surface of the earth.
AMO.9.6	The 
AMO.9.7	Israelites, are you not like the Cushites to me?
AMO.9.7	This is the 
AMO.9.7	Didn’t I bring Israel from the land of Egypt,
AMO.9.7	the Philistines from Caphtor,
AMO.9.7	and the Arameans from Kir?
AMO.9.8	Look, the eyes of the Lord 
AMO.9.8	are on the sinful kingdom,
AMO.9.8	and I will obliterate it
AMO.9.8	from the face of the earth.
AMO.9.8	However, I will not totally destroy
AMO.9.8	the house of Jacob
AMO.9.8	this is the 
AMO.9.9	for I am about to give the command,
AMO.9.9	and I will shake the house of Israel
AMO.9.9	among all the nations,
AMO.9.9	as one shakes a sieve,
AMO.9.9	but not a pebble will fall to the ground.
AMO.9.10	All the sinners among my people
AMO.9.10	who say: “Disaster will never overtake
AMO.9.10	or confront us,”
AMO.9.10	will die by the sword.
AMO.9.11	In that day
AMO.9.11	I will restore the fallen shelter
AMO.9.11	I will repair its gaps,
AMO.9.11	restore its ruins,
AMO.9.11	and rebuild it as in the days of old,
AMO.9.12	so that they may possess
AMO.9.12	the remnant of Edom
AMO.9.12	and all the nations
AMO.9.12	that bear my name
AMO.9.12	this is the declaration of the 
AMO.9.13	Look, the days are coming —
AMO.9.13	this is the 
AMO.9.13	when the plowman will overtake the reaper
AMO.9.13	and the one who treads grapes,
AMO.9.13	the sower of seed.
AMO.9.13	The mountains will drip with sweet wine,
AMO.9.13	and all the hills will flow with it.
AMO.9.14	I will restore the fortunes of my people Israel.
AMO.9.14	They will rebuild and occupy ruined cities,
AMO.9.14	plant vineyards and drink their wine,
AMO.9.14	make gardens and eat their produce.
AMO.9.15	I will plant them on their land,
AMO.9.15	and they will never again be uprooted
AMO.9.15	from the land I have given them.
AMO.9.15	The 
OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah.
OBA.1.1	This is what the Lord 
OBA.1.1	We have heard a message from the 
OBA.1.1	an envoy has been sent
OBA.1.1	“Rise up,
OBA.1.2	Look, I will make you insignificant
OBA.1.2	among the nations;
OBA.1.2	you will be deeply despised.
OBA.1.3	Your arrogant heart has deceived you,
OBA.1.3	you who live in clefts of the rock
OBA.1.3	in your home on the heights,
OBA.1.3	who say to yourself,
OBA.1.3	“Who can bring me down to the ground?” 
OBA.1.4	Though you seem to soar
OBA.1.4	and make your nest among the stars,
OBA.1.4	even from there I will bring you down.
OBA.1.4	This is the 
OBA.1.5	If thieves came to you,
OBA.1.5	if marauders by night —
OBA.1.5	how ravaged you would be! —
OBA.1.5	wouldn’t they steal only what they wanted?
OBA.1.5	If grape pickers came to you,
OBA.1.5	wouldn’t they leave some grapes?
OBA.1.6	How Esau will be pillaged,
OBA.1.6	his hidden treasures searched out!
OBA.1.7	Everyone who has a treaty with you
OBA.1.7	will drive you to the border;
OBA.1.7	everyone at peace with you
OBA.1.7	will deceive and conquer you.
OBA.1.7	Those who eat your bread
OBA.1.7	will set
OBA.1.7	He will be unaware of it.
OBA.1.8	In that day —
OBA.1.8	this is the 
OBA.1.8	will I not eliminate the wise ones of Edom
OBA.1.8	and those who understand
OBA.1.8	from the hill country of Esau?
OBA.1.9	Teman,
OBA.1.9	so that everyone from the hill country of Esau
OBA.1.9	will be destroyed by slaughter.
OBA.1.10	You will be covered with shame
OBA.1.10	and destroyed forever
OBA.1.10	because of violence done to your brother Jacob.
OBA.1.11	On the day you stood aloof,
OBA.1.11	on the day strangers captured his wealth,
OBA.1.11	while foreigners entered his city gate
OBA.1.11	and cast lots for Jerusalem,
OBA.1.11	you were just like one of them.
OBA.1.12	Do not
OBA.1.12	in the day of his calamity;
OBA.1.12	do not rejoice over the people of Judah
OBA.1.12	in the day of their destruction;
OBA.1.12	do not boastfully mock
OBA.1.12	in the day of distress.
OBA.1.13	Do not enter my people’s city gate
OBA.1.13	in the day of their disaster.
OBA.1.13	Yes, you — do not gloat over their misery
OBA.1.13	in the day of their disaster,
OBA.1.13	and do not appropriate their possessions
OBA.1.13	in the day of their disaster.
OBA.1.14	Do not stand at the crossroads
OBA.1.14	to cut off their fugitives,
OBA.1.14	and do not hand over their survivors
OBA.1.14	in the day of distress.
OBA.1.15	For the day of the 
OBA.1.15	against all the nations.
OBA.1.15	As you have done,
OBA.1.15	what you deserve will return on your own head.
OBA.1.16	As you have drunk on my holy mountain,
OBA.1.16	so all the nations will drink continually.
OBA.1.16	They will drink and gulp down
OBA.1.16	and be as though they had never been.
OBA.1.17	But there will be a deliverance on Mount Zion,
OBA.1.17	and it will be holy;
OBA.1.17	the house of Jacob will dispossess
OBA.1.17	those who dispossessed them.
OBA.1.18	Then the house of Jacob will be a blazing fire,
OBA.1.18	and the house of Joseph, a burning flame,
OBA.1.18	but the house of Esau will be stubble;
OBA.1.18	Jacob
OBA.1.18	Therefore no survivor will remain
OBA.1.18	of the house of Esau,
OBA.1.18	for the 
OBA.1.19	People from the Negev will possess
OBA.1.19	the hill country of Esau;
OBA.1.19	those from the Judean foothills will possess
OBA.1.19	the land of the Philistines.
OBA.1.19	They
OBA.1.19	the territories of Ephraim and Samaria,
OBA.1.19	while Benjamin will possess Gilead.
OBA.1.20	The exiles of the Israelites who are in Halah
OBA.1.20	and who are among the Canaanites as far as Zarephath
OBA.1.20	as well as the exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad
OBA.1.20	will possess the cities of the Negev.
OBA.1.21	Saviors
OBA.1.21	to rule over the hill country of Esau,
OBA.1.21	but the kingdom will be the 
JON.1.1	The word of the 
JON.1.2	“Get up!
JON.1.3	Jonah got up to flee to Tarshish
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	The sailors were afraid, and each cried out to his god.
JON.1.6	The captain approached him and said, “What are you doing sound asleep? Get up! Call to your god.
JON.1.7	“Come on!” the sailors said to each other. “Let’s cast lots.
JON.1.8	Then they said to him, “Tell us who is to blame for this trouble we’re in.
JON.1.9	He answered them, “I’m a Hebrew.
JON.1.10	Then the men were seized by a great fear and said to him, “What is this you’ve done?” The men knew he was fleeing from the 
JON.1.11	So they said to him, “What should we do to you so that the sea will calm down for us?” For the sea was getting worse and worse.
JON.1.12	He answered them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea so that it will calm down for you, for I know that I’m to blame
JON.1.13	Nevertheless, the men rowed hard to get back to dry land, but they couldn’t because the sea was raging against them more and more.
JON.1.14	So they called out to the 
JON.1.15	Then they picked up Jonah and threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging.
JON.1.16	The men were seized by great fear of the 
JON.1.17	The 
JON.2.1	Jonah prayed to the 
JON.2.2	I called to the 
JON.2.2	and he answered me.
JON.2.2	I cried out for help from deep inside
JON.2.2	you heard my voice.
JON.2.3	You threw me into the depths,
JON.2.3	into the heart of the seas,
JON.2.3	and the current
JON.2.3	All your breakers and your billows swept over me.
JON.2.4	But I said, “I have been banished
JON.2.4	from your sight,
JON.2.4	yet I will look once more
JON.2.4	toward your holy temple.
JON.2.5	The water engulfed me up to the neck;
JON.2.5	the watery depths overcame me;
JON.2.5	seaweed was wrapped around my head.
JON.2.6	I sank to the foundations of the mountains,
JON.2.6	the earth’s gates shut behind me forever!
JON.2.6	Then you raised my life
JON.2.7	As my life was fading away,
JON.2.7	I remembered the 
JON.2.7	and my prayer came to you,
JON.2.7	to your holy temple.
JON.2.8	Those who cherish worthless idols
JON.2.8	abandon their faithful love,
JON.2.9	but as for me, I will sacrifice
JON.2.9	with a voice of thanksgiving.
JON.2.9	I will fulfill
JON.2.9	Salvation
JON.2.10	Then the 
JON.3.1	The word of the 
JON.3.2	“Get up! Go to the great city of Nineveh
JON.3.3	Jonah got up and went to Nineveh according to the 
JON.3.3	Now Nineveh was an extremely great city,
JON.3.4	Jonah set out on the first day of his walk in the city and proclaimed,
JON.3.5	Then the people of Nineveh believed God. They proclaimed a fast
JON.3.6	When word reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, took off his royal robe, put on sackcloth,
JON.3.7	Then he issued a decree
JON.3.7	By order of the king and his nobles: No person or animal, herd or flock, is to taste anything at all. They must not eat or drink water. 
JON.3.8	Furthermore, both people and animals must be covered with sackcloth, and everyone must call out earnestly to God.
JON.3.9	Who knows?
JON.3.10	God saw their actions — that they had turned from their evil ways
JON.4.1	Jonah was greatly displeased and became furious.
JON.4.2	He prayed to the 
JON.4.3	And now, 
JON.4.4	The 
JON.4.5	Jonah left the city and found a place east of it.
JON.4.6	Then the 
JON.4.7	When dawn came the next day, God appointed a worm that attacked the plant, and it withered.
JON.4.8	As the sun was rising, God appointed a scorching east wind.
JON.4.9	Then God asked Jonah, “Is it right for you to be angry about the plant?”
JON.4.9	“Yes, it’s right!” he replied. “I’m angry enough to die!”
JON.4.10	So the 
JON.4.11	But may I not care about the great city of Nineveh,
MIC.1.1	The word of the 
MIC.1.2	Listen, all you peoples;
MIC.1.2	pay attention, earth
MIC.1.2	The Lord 
MIC.1.2	the Lord, from his holy temple.
MIC.1.3	Look, the 
MIC.1.3	and coming down to trample
MIC.1.3	the heights
MIC.1.4	The mountains will melt beneath him,
MIC.1.4	and the valleys will split apart,
MIC.1.4	like wax near a fire,
MIC.1.4	like water cascading down a mountainside.
MIC.1.5	All this will happen because of Jacob’s rebellion
MIC.1.5	and the sins of the house of Israel.
MIC.1.5	What is the rebellion of Jacob?
MIC.1.5	Isn’t it Samaria?
MIC.1.5	And what is the high place of Judah?
MIC.1.5	Isn’t it Jerusalem?
MIC.1.6	Therefore, I will make Samaria
MIC.1.6	a heap of ruins
MIC.1.6	a planting area
MIC.1.6	I will roll her stones
MIC.1.6	and expose her foundations.
MIC.1.7	All her carved images will be smashed
MIC.1.7	all her wages
MIC.1.7	and I will destroy all her idols.
MIC.1.7	Since she collected the wages of a prostitute,
MIC.1.7	they will be used again for a prostitute.
MIC.1.8	Because of this I will lament and wail;
MIC.1.8	I will walk barefoot and naked.
MIC.1.8	I will howl like the jackals
MIC.1.8	and mourn like ostriches.
MIC.1.9	For her wound is incurable
MIC.1.9	and has reached even Judah;
MIC.1.9	it has approached my people’s city gate,
MIC.1.9	as far as Jerusalem.
MIC.1.10	Don’t announce it in Gath,
MIC.1.10	don’t weep at all.
MIC.1.10	Roll in the dust in Beth-leaphrah.
MIC.1.11	Depart in shameful nakedness,
MIC.1.11	you residents of Shaphir;
MIC.1.11	the residents of Zaanan
MIC.1.11	Beth-ezel is lamenting;
MIC.1.11	its support
MIC.1.12	Though the residents of Maroth
MIC.1.12	anxiously wait for something good,
MIC.1.12	disaster has come from the 
MIC.1.12	to the gate of Jerusalem.
MIC.1.13	Harness the horses to the chariot,
MIC.1.13	you residents of Lachish.
MIC.1.13	This was the beginning of sin for Daughter Zion
MIC.1.13	because Israel’s acts of rebellion
MIC.1.14	Therefore, send farewell gifts
MIC.1.14	the houses of Achzib
MIC.1.14	to the kings of Israel.
MIC.1.15	I will again bring a conqueror
MIC.1.15	against you who live in Mareshah.
MIC.1.15	The nobility
MIC.1.16	Shave yourselves bald and cut off your hair
MIC.1.16	in sorrow for your precious children;
MIC.1.16	make yourselves as bald as an eagle,
MIC.1.16	for they have been taken from you into exile.
MIC.2.1	Woe to those who dream up wickedness
MIC.2.1	and prepare evil plans
MIC.2.1	At morning light
MIC.2.1	because the power is in their hands.
MIC.2.2	They covet fields
MIC.2.2	they also take houses.
MIC.2.2	They deprive a man of his home,
MIC.2.2	a person of his inheritance.
MIC.2.3	Therefore, the 
MIC.2.3	I am now planning
MIC.2.3	against this nation;
MIC.2.3	you cannot free your necks from it.
MIC.2.3	Then you will not walk so proudly
MIC.2.3	because it will be an evil time.
MIC.2.4	In that day one will take up
MIC.2.4	and lament mournfully,
MIC.2.4	“We are totally ruined!
MIC.2.4	He measures out the allotted land of my people.
MIC.2.4	How he removes it from me!
MIC.2.4	He allots our fields
MIC.2.5	Therefore, there will be no one
MIC.2.5	in the assembly of the 
MIC.2.5	to divide the land by casting lots.
MIC.2.6	“Quit your preaching,”
MIC.2.6	“They should not preach these things;
MIC.2.6	shame will not overtake us.”
MIC.2.7	House of Jacob, should it be asked,
MIC.2.7	“Is the Spirit of the 
MIC.2.7	Are these the things he does?”
MIC.2.7	Don’t my words bring good
MIC.2.7	to the one who walks uprightly?
MIC.2.8	But recently my people have risen up
MIC.2.8	like an enemy:
MIC.2.8	You strip off the splendid robe
MIC.2.8	from those who are passing through confidently,
MIC.2.8	like those returning from war.
MIC.2.9	You force
MIC.2.9	out of their comfortable homes,
MIC.2.9	and you take my blessing
MIC.2.9	from their children forever.
MIC.2.10	Get up and leave,
MIC.2.10	for this is not your place of rest
MIC.2.10	because defilement
MIC.2.10	a grievous destruction!
MIC.2.11	If a man comes
MIC.2.11	and utters empty lies
MIC.2.11	“I will preach to you about wine and beer”
MIC.2.11	he would be just the preacher for this people!
MIC.2.12	I will indeed gather
MIC.2.12	I will collect the remnant of Israel.
MIC.2.12	I will bring them together like sheep in a pen,
MIC.2.12	like a flock in the middle of its pasture.
MIC.2.12	It will be noisy with people.
MIC.2.13	One who breaks open the way
MIC.2.13	will advance before them;
MIC.2.13	they will break out, pass through the city gate,
MIC.2.13	and leave by it.
MIC.2.13	Their King will pass through before them,
MIC.2.13	the 
MIC.3.1	Then I said, “Now listen,
MIC.3.1	you rulers of the house of Israel.
MIC.3.1	Aren’t you supposed to know what is just?
MIC.3.2	You hate good and love evil.
MIC.3.2	You tear off people’s skin
MIC.3.2	and strip their flesh from their bones.
MIC.3.3	You eat the flesh
MIC.3.3	after you strip their skin from them
MIC.3.3	and break their bones.
MIC.3.3	You chop them up
MIC.3.3	like flesh for the cooking pot,
MIC.3.3	like meat in a cauldron.”
MIC.3.4	Then they will cry out
MIC.3.4	but he will not answer them.
MIC.3.4	He will hide his face from them at that time
MIC.3.4	because of the crimes they have committed.
MIC.3.5	This is what the 
MIC.3.5	concerning the prophets
MIC.3.5	who lead my people astray,
MIC.3.5	who proclaim
MIC.3.5	when they have food to sink their teeth into
MIC.3.5	but declare war against the one
MIC.3.5	who puts nothing in their mouths.
MIC.3.6	Therefore, it will be night
MIC.3.6	without visions;
MIC.3.6	it will grow dark for you —
MIC.3.6	without divination.
MIC.3.6	The sun will set
MIC.3.6	and the daylight will turn black over them.
MIC.3.7	Then the seers will be ashamed
MIC.3.7	and the diviners disappointed.
MIC.3.7	They will all cover their mouths
MIC.3.7	because there will be no answer from God.
MIC.3.8	As for me, however, I am filled with power
MIC.3.8	by the Spirit of the 
MIC.3.8	with justice and courage,
MIC.3.8	to proclaim to Jacob his rebellion
MIC.3.8	and to Israel his sin.
MIC.3.9	Listen to this, leaders of the house of Jacob,
MIC.3.9	you rulers of the house of Israel,
MIC.3.9	who abhor justice
MIC.3.9	and pervert everything that is right,
MIC.3.10	who build Zion with bloodshed
MIC.3.10	and Jerusalem with injustice.
MIC.3.11	Her leaders issue rulings for a bribe,
MIC.3.11	her priests teach for payment,
MIC.3.11	and her prophets practice divination for silver.
MIC.3.11	Yet they lean on the 
MIC.3.11	“Isn’t the 
MIC.3.11	No disaster will overtake us.”
MIC.3.12	Therefore, because of you,
MIC.3.12	Zion will be plowed like a field,
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem will become ruins,
MIC.3.12	and the temple’s mountain
MIC.3.12	will be a high thicket.
MIC.4.1	In the last days
MIC.4.1	the mountain of the 
MIC.4.1	will be established
MIC.4.1	at the top of the mountains
MIC.4.1	and will be raised above the hills.
MIC.4.1	Peoples will stream to it,
MIC.4.2	and many nations will come and say,
MIC.4.2	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.2	to the house of the God of Jacob.
MIC.4.2	He will teach us about his ways
MIC.4.2	so we may walk in his paths.”
MIC.4.2	For instruction will go out of Zion
MIC.4.2	and the word of the 
MIC.4.3	He will settle disputes among many peoples
MIC.4.3	and provide arbitration for strong nations
MIC.4.3	that are far away.
MIC.4.3	They will beat their swords into plows
MIC.4.3	and their spears into pruning knives.
MIC.4.3	Nation will not take up the sword against nation,
MIC.4.3	and they will never again train for war.
MIC.4.4	But each person will sit under his grapevine
MIC.4.4	and under his fig tree
MIC.4.4	with no one to frighten him.
MIC.4.4	For the mouth of the 
MIC.4.4	has spoken.
MIC.4.5	Though all the peoples each walk
MIC.4.5	in the name of their gods,
MIC.4.5	we will walk
MIC.4.5	forever and ever.
MIC.4.6	On that day —
MIC.4.6	this is the 
MIC.4.6	I will assemble the lame
MIC.4.6	and gather the scattered,
MIC.4.6	those I have injured.
MIC.4.7	I will make the lame into a remnant,
MIC.4.7	those far removed into a strong nation.
MIC.4.7	Then the 
MIC.4.7	from this time on and forever.
MIC.4.8	And you, watchtower for the flock,
MIC.4.8	fortified hill
MIC.4.8	the former rule
MIC.4.8	sovereignty will come to Daughter Jerusalem.
MIC.4.9	Now, why are you shouting loudly?
MIC.4.9	Is there no king with you?
MIC.4.9	Has your counselor perished
MIC.4.9	so that anguish grips you like a woman in labor?
MIC.4.10	Writhe and cry out,
MIC.4.10	like a woman in labor,
MIC.4.10	for now you will leave the city
MIC.4.10	and camp in the open fields.
MIC.4.10	You will go to Babylon;
MIC.4.10	there you will be rescued;
MIC.4.10	there the 
MIC.4.10	from the grasp of your enemies!
MIC.4.11	Many nations have now assembled against you;
MIC.4.11	they say, “Let her be defiled,
MIC.4.11	and let us feast our eyes on Zion.”
MIC.4.12	But they do not know the 
MIC.4.12	or understand his plan,
MIC.4.12	that he has gathered them
MIC.4.12	like sheaves to the threshing floor.
MIC.4.13	Rise and thresh,
MIC.4.13	for I will make your horns iron
MIC.4.13	and your hooves bronze
MIC.4.13	so you can crush many peoples.
MIC.4.13	Then you
MIC.4.13	for the 
MIC.4.13	their wealth for the Lord of the whole earth.
MIC.5.1	Now, daughter who is under attack,
MIC.5.1	you slash yourself in grief;
MIC.5.1	a siege is set against us!
MIC.5.1	They are striking the judge
MIC.5.1	on the cheek with a rod.
MIC.5.2	Bethlehem Ephrathah,
MIC.5.2	you are small among the clans of Judah;
MIC.5.2	one will come from you
MIC.5.2	to be ruler over Israel for me.
MIC.5.2	His origin
MIC.5.2	from ancient times.
MIC.5.3	Therefore, Israel will be abandoned
MIC.5.3	when she who is in labor
MIC.5.3	then the rest of the ruler’s brothers
MIC.5.3	to the people of Israel.
MIC.5.4	He will stand and shepherd them
MIC.5.4	in the strength of the 
MIC.5.4	in the majestic name of the 
MIC.5.4	They will live securely,
MIC.5.4	for then his greatness will extend
MIC.5.4	to the ends of the earth.
MIC.5.5	He will be their peace.
MIC.5.5	When Assyria invades our land,
MIC.5.5	when it marches against our fortresses,
MIC.5.5	we will raise against it seven shepherds,
MIC.5.5	even eight leaders of men.
MIC.5.6	They will shepherd
MIC.5.6	the land of Nimrod
MIC.5.6	So he will rescue us
MIC.5.6	when it invades our land,
MIC.5.6	when it marches against our territory.
MIC.5.7	Then the remnant of Jacob
MIC.5.7	will be among many peoples
MIC.5.7	like dew from the 
MIC.5.7	like showers on the grass,
MIC.5.7	which do not wait for anyone
MIC.5.7	or linger for mankind.
MIC.5.8	Then the remnant of Jacob
MIC.5.8	will be among the nations, among many peoples,
MIC.5.8	like a lion among animals of the forest,
MIC.5.8	like a young lion among flocks of sheep,
MIC.5.8	which tramples
MIC.5.8	and there is no one to rescue them.
MIC.5.9	Your hand will be lifted up against your adversaries,
MIC.5.9	and all your enemies will be destroyed.
MIC.5.10	In that day —
MIC.5.10	this is the 
MIC.5.10	I will remove your horses from you
MIC.5.10	and wreck your chariots.
MIC.5.11	I will remove the cities of your land
MIC.5.11	and tear down all your fortresses.
MIC.5.12	I will remove sorceries from your hands,
MIC.5.12	and you will not have any more fortune-tellers.
MIC.5.13	I will remove your carved images
MIC.5.13	and sacred pillars from you
MIC.5.13	so that you will no longer worship
MIC.5.13	the work of your hands.
MIC.5.14	I will pull up the Asherah poles
MIC.5.14	and demolish your cities.
MIC.5.15	I will take vengeance in anger and wrath
MIC.5.15	against the nations that have not obeyed me.
MIC.6.1	Now listen to what the 
MIC.6.1	Rise, plead your case before the mountains,
MIC.6.1	and let the hills hear your complaint.
MIC.6.2	Listen to the 
MIC.6.2	you mountains and enduring foundations of the earth,
MIC.6.2	because the 
MIC.6.2	and he will argue it against Israel.
MIC.6.3	My people,
MIC.6.3	or how have I wearied you?
MIC.6.3	Testify against me!
MIC.6.4	Indeed, I brought you up
MIC.6.4	and redeemed you
MIC.6.4	I sent Moses,
MIC.6.5	My people,
MIC.6.5	remember what King Balak of Moab
MIC.6.5	what Balaam son of Beor answered him,
MIC.6.5	and what happened from the Acacia Grove
MIC.6.5	so that you may acknowledge
MIC.6.5	the 
MIC.6.6	What should I bring before the 
MIC.6.6	when I come to bow before God on high?
MIC.6.6	Should I come before him with burnt offerings,
MIC.6.6	with year-old calves?
MIC.6.7	Would the 
MIC.6.7	or with ten thousand streams of oil?
MIC.6.7	Should I give my firstborn for my transgression,
MIC.6.7	the offspring of my body for my own sin?
MIC.6.8	Mankind, he has told each of you what is good
MIC.6.8	and what it is the 
MIC.6.8	to act justly,
MIC.6.8	to love faithfulness,
MIC.6.8	and to walk humbly with your God.
MIC.6.9	The voice of the 
MIC.6.9	(and it is wise to fear your name):
MIC.6.9	“Pay attention to the rod
MIC.6.9	and the one who ordained it.
MIC.6.10	Are there still
MIC.6.10	and the accursed short measure
MIC.6.10	in the house of the wicked?
MIC.6.11	Can I excuse wicked scales
MIC.6.11	or bags of deceptive weights?
MIC.6.12	For the wealthy of the city are full of violence,
MIC.6.12	and its residents speak lies;
MIC.6.12	the tongues in their mouths are deceitful.
MIC.6.13	“As a result, I have begun to strike you severely,
MIC.6.13	bringing desolation because of your sins.
MIC.6.14	You will eat but not be satisfied,
MIC.6.14	for there will be hunger within you.
MIC.6.14	What you acquire, you cannot save,
MIC.6.14	and what you do save,
MIC.6.14	I will give to the sword.
MIC.6.15	You will sow but not reap;
MIC.6.15	you will press olives
MIC.6.15	but not anoint yourself with oil;
MIC.6.15	and you will tread grapes
MIC.6.15	but not drink the wine.
MIC.6.16	The statutes of Omri
MIC.6.16	and all the practices of Ahab’s house
MIC.6.16	have been observed;
MIC.6.16	you have followed their policies.
MIC.6.16	Therefore, I will make you a desolate place
MIC.6.16	and the city’s
MIC.6.16	you will bear the scorn of my people.”
MIC.7.1	How sad for me!
MIC.7.1	For I am like one who —
MIC.7.1	when the summer fruit has been gathered
MIC.7.1	after the gleaning of the grape harvest
MIC.7.1	finds no grape cluster to eat,
MIC.7.1	no early fig, which I crave.
MIC.7.2	Faithful people have vanished from the land;
MIC.7.2	there is no one upright among the people.
MIC.7.2	All of them wait in ambush to shed blood;
MIC.7.2	they hunt each other with a net.
MIC.7.3	Both hands are good
MIC.7.3	the official and the judge demand a bribe;
MIC.7.3	when the powerful man communicates his evil desire,
MIC.7.3	they plot it together.
MIC.7.4	The best of them is like a brier;
MIC.7.4	the most upright is worse than a hedge of thorns.
MIC.7.4	The day of your watchmen,
MIC.7.4	the day of your punishment, is coming;
MIC.7.4	at this time their panic is here.
MIC.7.5	Do not rely on a friend;
MIC.7.5	don’t trust in a close companion.
MIC.7.5	Seal your mouth
MIC.7.5	from the woman who lies in your arms.
MIC.7.6	Surely a son considers his father a fool,
MIC.7.6	a daughter opposes her mother,
MIC.7.6	and a daughter-in-law is against her mother-in-law;
MIC.7.6	a man’s enemies are the men of his own household.
MIC.7.7	But I will look to the 
MIC.7.7	I will wait for the God of my salvation.
MIC.7.7	My God will hear me.
MIC.7.8	Do not rejoice over me,
MIC.7.8	Though I have fallen, I will stand up;
MIC.7.8	though I sit in darkness,
MIC.7.8	the 
MIC.7.9	Because I have sinned against him,
MIC.7.9	I must endure the 
MIC.7.9	until he champions my cause
MIC.7.9	and establishes justice for me.
MIC.7.9	He will bring me into the light;
MIC.7.9	I will see his salvation.
MIC.7.10	Then my enemy will see,
MIC.7.10	and she will be covered with shame,
MIC.7.10	the one who said to me,
MIC.7.10	“Where is the 
MIC.7.10	My eyes will look at her in triumph;
MIC.7.10	at that time she will be trampled
MIC.7.10	like mud in the streets.
MIC.7.11	A day will come for rebuilding your walls;
MIC.7.11	on that day your boundary will be extended.
MIC.7.12	On that day people will come to you
MIC.7.12	from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
MIC.7.12	even from Egypt to the Euphrates River
MIC.7.12	and from sea to sea
MIC.7.12	and mountain to mountain.
MIC.7.13	Then the earth will become a wasteland
MIC.7.13	because of its inhabitants
MIC.7.13	and as a result of their actions.
MIC.7.14	Shepherd your people
MIC.7.14	the flock that is your possession.
MIC.7.14	They live alone
MIC.7.14	surrounded by pastures.
MIC.7.14	Let them graze in Bashan and Gilead
MIC.7.14	as in ancient times.
MIC.7.15	I will perform miracles for them
MIC.7.15	as in the days of your exodus
MIC.7.15	from the land of Egypt.
MIC.7.16	Nations will see and be ashamed
MIC.7.16	of
MIC.7.16	They will put their hands over their mouths,
MIC.7.16	and their ears will become deaf.
MIC.7.17	They will lick the dust like a snake;
MIC.7.17	they will come trembling out of their hiding places
MIC.7.17	like reptiles slithering on the ground.
MIC.7.17	They will tremble in the presence of the 
MIC.7.17	they will stand in awe of you.
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like you,
MIC.7.18	forgiving iniquity and passing over rebellion
MIC.7.18	for the remnant of his inheritance?
MIC.7.18	He does not hold on to his anger forever
MIC.7.18	because he delights in faithful love.
MIC.7.19	He will again have compassion on us;
MIC.7.19	he will vanquish our iniquities.
MIC.7.19	You will cast all our
MIC.7.19	into the depths of the sea.
MIC.7.20	You will show loyalty to Jacob
MIC.7.20	and faithful love to Abraham,
MIC.7.20	as you swore to our fathers
MIC.7.20	from days long ago.
NAM.1.1	The pronouncement
NAM.1.2	The 
NAM.1.2	the 
NAM.1.2	and is fierce in
NAM.1.2	The 
NAM.1.2	he is furious with his enemies.
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.3	the 
NAM.1.3	His path is in the whirlwind and storm,
NAM.1.3	and clouds are the dust beneath his feet.
NAM.1.4	He rebukes the sea and dries it up,
NAM.1.4	and he makes all the rivers run dry.
NAM.1.4	Bashan and Carmel wither;
NAM.1.4	even the flower of Lebanon withers.
NAM.1.5	The mountains quake before him,
NAM.1.5	and the hills melt;
NAM.1.5	the earth trembles
NAM.1.5	the world and all who live in it.
NAM.1.6	Who can withstand his indignation?
NAM.1.6	Who can endure his burning anger?
NAM.1.6	His wrath is poured out like fire;
NAM.1.6	even rocks are shattered before him.
NAM.1.7	The 
NAM.1.7	a stronghold in a day of distress;
NAM.1.7	he cares for those who take refuge
NAM.1.8	But he will completely destroy Nineveh
NAM.1.8	with an overwhelming flood,
NAM.1.8	and he will chase his enemies into darkness.
NAM.1.9	Whatever you
NAM.1.9	he will bring it to complete destruction;
NAM.1.9	oppression will not rise up a second time.
NAM.1.10	For they will be consumed
NAM.1.10	like entangled thorns,
NAM.1.10	like the drink of a drunkard
NAM.1.10	and like straw that is fully dry.
NAM.1.11	One has gone out from you,
NAM.1.11	who plots evil against the 
NAM.1.11	and is a wicked counselor.
NAM.1.12	This is what the 
NAM.1.12	Though they are strong
NAM.1.12	they will still be mowed down,
NAM.1.12	and he
NAM.1.12	Though I have punished you,
NAM.1.12	I will punish you no longer.
NAM.1.13	For I will now break off his yoke from you
NAM.1.13	and tear off your shackles.
NAM.1.14	The 
NAM.1.14	There will be no offspring
NAM.1.14	to carry on your name.
NAM.1.14	I will eliminate the carved idol and cast image
NAM.1.14	from the house of your gods;
NAM.1.14	I will prepare your grave,
NAM.1.14	for you are contemptible.
NAM.1.15	Look to the mountains —
NAM.1.15	the feet of the herald,
NAM.1.15	who proclaims peace.
NAM.1.15	Celebrate your festivals, Judah;
NAM.1.15	fulfill your vows.
NAM.1.15	For the wicked one will never again
NAM.1.15	march through you;
NAM.1.15	he will be entirely wiped out.
NAM.2.1	One who scatters is coming up against you.
NAM.2.1	Man the fortifications!
NAM.2.1	Watch the road!
NAM.2.1	Brace
NAM.2.1	Summon all your strength!
NAM.2.2	For the 
NAM.2.2	yes,
NAM.2.2	though ravagers have ravaged them
NAM.2.2	and ruined their vine branches.
NAM.2.3	The shields of his
NAM.2.3	the valiant men are dressed in scarlet.
NAM.2.3	The fittings of the chariot flash like fire
NAM.2.3	on the day of its battle preparations,
NAM.2.3	and the spears are brandished.
NAM.2.4	The chariots dash madly through the streets;
NAM.2.4	they rush around in the plazas.
NAM.2.4	They look like torches;
NAM.2.4	they dart back and forth like lightning.
NAM.2.5	He gives orders to his officers;
NAM.2.5	they stumble as they advance.
NAM.2.5	They race to its wall;
NAM.2.5	the protective shield is set in place.
NAM.2.6	The river gates are opened,
NAM.2.6	and the palace erodes away.
NAM.2.7	Beauty
NAM.2.7	she is carried away;
NAM.2.7	her ladies-in-waiting moan
NAM.2.7	like the sound of doves
NAM.2.7	and beat their breasts.
NAM.2.8	Nineveh has been like a pool of water
NAM.2.8	from her first days,
NAM.2.8	but they are fleeing.
NAM.2.8	“Stop! Stop!” they cry,
NAM.2.8	but no one turns back.
NAM.2.9	“Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold!” 
NAM.2.9	There is no end to the treasure,
NAM.2.9	an abundance of every precious thing.
NAM.2.10	Desolation, decimation, devastation!
NAM.2.10	Hearts melt,
NAM.2.10	knees tremble,
NAM.2.10	insides churn,
NAM.2.10	every face grows pale!
NAM.2.11	Where is the lions’ lair,
NAM.2.11	or the feeding ground of the young lions,
NAM.2.11	where the lion and lioness prowled,
NAM.2.11	and the lion’s cub,
NAM.2.11	with nothing to frighten them away?
NAM.2.12	The lion mauled whatever its cubs needed
NAM.2.12	and strangled prey for its lionesses.
NAM.2.12	It filled up its dens with the kill,
NAM.2.12	and its lairs with mauled prey.
NAM.2.13	Beware, I am against you.
NAM.2.13	This is the declaration of the 
NAM.2.13	I will make your chariots go up in smoke,
NAM.2.13	and the sword will devour your young lions.
NAM.2.13	I will cut off your prey from the earth,
NAM.2.13	and the sound of your messengers
NAM.2.13	will never be heard again.
NAM.3.1	Woe to the city of blood,
NAM.3.1	totally deceitful,
NAM.3.1	full of plunder,
NAM.3.1	never without prey.
NAM.3.2	The crack of the whip
NAM.3.2	and rumble of the wheel,
NAM.3.2	galloping horse
NAM.3.2	and jolting chariot!
NAM.3.3	Charging horseman,
NAM.3.3	flashing sword,
NAM.3.3	shining spear;
NAM.3.3	heaps of slain,
NAM.3.3	mounds of corpses,
NAM.3.3	dead bodies without end
NAM.3.3	they stumble over their dead.
NAM.3.4	Because of the continual prostitution of the prostitute,
NAM.3.4	the attractive mistress of sorcery,
NAM.3.4	who treats nations and clans like merchandise
NAM.3.4	by her prostitution and sorcery,
NAM.3.5	I am against you.
NAM.3.5	This is the declaration of the 
NAM.3.5	I will lift your skirts over your face
NAM.3.5	and display your nakedness to nations,
NAM.3.5	your shame to kingdoms.
NAM.3.6	I will throw filth on you
NAM.3.6	and treat you with contempt;
NAM.3.6	I will make a spectacle of you.
NAM.3.7	Then all who see you will recoil from you, saying,
NAM.3.7	“Nineveh is devastated;
NAM.3.7	who will show sympathy to her?”
NAM.3.7	Where can I find anyone to comfort you?
NAM.3.8	Are you better than Thebes
NAM.3.8	that sat along the Nile
NAM.3.8	with water surrounding her,
NAM.3.8	whose rampart was the sea,
NAM.3.8	the river
NAM.3.9	Cush and Egypt were her endless source of strength;
NAM.3.9	Put and Libya were among her
NAM.3.10	Yet she became an exile;
NAM.3.10	she went into captivity.
NAM.3.10	Her children were also dashed to pieces
NAM.3.10	at the head of every street.
NAM.3.10	They cast lots for her dignitaries,
NAM.3.10	and all her nobles were bound in chains.
NAM.3.11	You
NAM.3.11	you will hide.
NAM.3.11	You also will seek refuge from the enemy.
NAM.3.12	All your fortresses are fig trees
NAM.3.12	with figs that ripened first;
NAM.3.12	when shaken, they fall —
NAM.3.12	right into the mouth of the eater!
NAM.3.13	Look, your troops are like women among you;
NAM.3.13	your land’s city gates
NAM.3.13	are wide open to your enemies.
NAM.3.13	Fire will devour the bars of your gates.
NAM.3.14	Draw water for the siege;
NAM.3.14	strengthen your fortresses.
NAM.3.14	Step into the clay and tread the mortar;
NAM.3.14	take hold of the brick-mold!
NAM.3.15	The fire will devour you there;
NAM.3.15	the sword will cut you down.
NAM.3.15	It will devour you like the young locust.
NAM.3.15	Multiply yourselves like the young locust;
NAM.3.15	multiply like the swarming locust!
NAM.3.16	You have made your merchants
NAM.3.16	more numerous than the stars of the sky.
NAM.3.16	The young locust strips
NAM.3.16	and flies away.
NAM.3.17	Your court officials are like the swarming locust,
NAM.3.17	and your scribes like clouds of locusts,
NAM.3.17	which settle on the walls on a cold day;
NAM.3.17	when the sun rises, they take off,
NAM.3.17	and no one knows where they are.
NAM.3.18	King of Assyria, your shepherds slumber;
NAM.3.18	your officers sleep.
NAM.3.18	Your people are scattered across the mountains
NAM.3.18	with no one to gather them together.
NAM.3.19	There is no remedy for your injury;
NAM.3.19	your wound is severe.
NAM.3.19	All who hear the news about you
NAM.3.19	will clap their hands because of you,
NAM.3.19	for who has not experienced
NAM.3.19	your constant cruelty?
HAB.1.1	The pronouncement
HAB.1.2	How long,
HAB.1.2	and you do not listen
HAB.1.2	or cry out to you about violence
HAB.1.2	and you do not save?
HAB.1.3	Why do you force me to look at injustice?
HAB.1.3	Why do you tolerate
HAB.1.3	Oppression and violence are right in front of me.
HAB.1.3	Strife is ongoing, and conflict escalates.
HAB.1.4	This is why the law is ineffective
HAB.1.4	and justice never emerges.
HAB.1.4	For the wicked restrict
HAB.1.4	therefore, justice
HAB.1.5	Look at the nations
HAB.1.5	be utterly astounded!
HAB.1.5	For I am doing something in your days
HAB.1.5	that you will not believe
HAB.1.5	when you hear about it.
HAB.1.6	Look! I am raising up
HAB.1.6	that bitter,
HAB.1.6	that marches across the earth’s open spaces
HAB.1.6	to seize territories not its own.
HAB.1.7	They are fierce
HAB.1.7	their views of justice and sovereignty
HAB.1.7	stem from themselves.
HAB.1.8	Their horses are swifter
HAB.1.8	and more fierce
HAB.1.8	Their horsemen charge ahead;
HAB.1.8	their horsemen come from distant lands.
HAB.1.8	They fly like eagles, swooping to devour.
HAB.1.9	All of them come to do violence;
HAB.1.9	their faces
HAB.1.9	They gather
HAB.1.10	They mock
HAB.1.10	and rulers are a joke to them.
HAB.1.10	They laugh
HAB.1.10	and build siege ramps to capture
HAB.1.11	Then they sweep
HAB.1.11	and pass through.
HAB.1.11	They are guilty;
HAB.1.12	Are you not from eternity, 
HAB.1.12	My Holy One,
HAB.1.12	my Rock,
HAB.1.13	Your eyes
HAB.1.13	and you cannot tolerate wrongdoing.
HAB.1.13	So why do you tolerate those who are treacherous?
HAB.1.13	Why are you silent
HAB.1.13	while one
HAB.1.13	one
HAB.1.14	You have made mankind
HAB.1.14	like the fish of the sea,
HAB.1.14	like marine creatures that have no ruler.
HAB.1.15	The Chaldeans pull them all up with a hook,
HAB.1.15	catch them in their dragnet,
HAB.1.15	and gather them in their fishing net;
HAB.1.15	that is why they are glad and rejoice.
HAB.1.16	That is why they sacrifice to their dragnet
HAB.1.16	and burn incense to their fishing net,
HAB.1.16	for by these things their portion is rich
HAB.1.16	and their food plentiful.
HAB.1.17	Will they therefore empty their net
HAB.1.17	and continually slaughter nations without mercy?
HAB.2.1	I will stand at my guard post
HAB.2.1	and station myself on the lookout tower.
HAB.2.1	I will watch to see what he will say to me
HAB.2.1	and what I should
HAB.2.2	The 
HAB.2.2	Write down this vision;
HAB.2.2	clearly inscribe it on tablets
HAB.2.2	so one may easily read it.
HAB.2.3	For the vision is yet for the appointed time;
HAB.2.3	it testifies about the end and will not lie.
HAB.2.3	Though it delays, wait for it,
HAB.2.3	since it will certainly come and not be late.
HAB.2.4	Look, his ego is inflated;
HAB.2.4	he is without integrity.
HAB.2.4	But the righteous one will live by his faith.
HAB.2.5	Moreover, wine
HAB.2.5	an arrogant man is never at rest.
HAB.2.5	He enlarges his appetite like Sheol,
HAB.2.5	and like Death he is never satisfied.
HAB.2.5	He gathers all the nations to himself;
HAB.2.5	he collects all the peoples for himself.
HAB.2.6	Won’t all of these take up a taunt against him,
HAB.2.6	with mockery and riddles about him?
HAB.2.6	They will say:
HAB.2.6	Woe to him who amasses what is not his —
HAB.2.6	how much longer?
HAB.2.6	and loads himself with goods taken in pledge.
HAB.2.7	Won’t your creditors suddenly arise,
HAB.2.7	and those who disturb you wake up?
HAB.2.7	Then you will become spoil for them.
HAB.2.8	Since you have plundered many nations,
HAB.2.8	all the peoples who remain will plunder you
HAB.2.8	because of human bloodshed
HAB.2.8	and violence
HAB.2.8	and all who live in them.
HAB.2.9	Woe to him who dishonestly makes
HAB.2.9	wealth for his house
HAB.2.9	to place his nest on high,
HAB.2.9	to escape the grasp of disaster!
HAB.2.10	You have planned shame for your house
HAB.2.10	by wiping out many peoples
HAB.2.10	and sinning against your own self.
HAB.2.11	For the stones will cry out
HAB.2.11	and the rafters will answer them
HAB.2.11	from the woodwork.
HAB.2.12	Woe to him who builds a city with bloodshed
HAB.2.12	and founds a town with injustice!
HAB.2.13	Is it not from the 
HAB.2.13	that the peoples labor only to fuel the fire
HAB.2.13	and countries exhaust themselves for nothing?
HAB.2.14	For the earth will be filled
HAB.2.14	with the knowledge of the 
HAB.2.14	as the water covers the sea.
HAB.2.15	Woe to him who gives his neighbors drink,
HAB.2.15	pouring out your wrath
HAB.2.15	and even making them drunk,
HAB.2.15	in order to look at their nakedness!
HAB.2.16	You will be filled with disgrace instead of glory.
HAB.2.16	You also — drink,
HAB.2.16	and expose your uncircumcision!
HAB.2.16	The cup in the 
HAB.2.16	will come around to you,
HAB.2.16	and utter disgrace will cover your glory.
HAB.2.17	For your violence against Lebanon
HAB.2.17	will overwhelm you;
HAB.2.17	the destruction of animals will terrify you
HAB.2.17	because of your human bloodshed and violence
HAB.2.17	against lands, cities, and all who live in them.
HAB.2.18	What use is a carved idol
HAB.2.18	after its craftsman carves it?
HAB.2.18	It is only a cast image, a teacher of lies.
HAB.2.18	For the one who crafts its shape trusts in it
HAB.2.18	and makes idols that cannot speak.
HAB.2.19	Woe to him who says to wood: Wake up!
HAB.2.19	or to mute stone: Come alive!
HAB.2.19	Can it teach?
HAB.2.19	Look! It may be plated with gold and silver,
HAB.2.19	yet there is no breath
HAB.2.20	But the 
HAB.2.20	let the whole earth
HAB.2.20	be silent in his presence.
HAB.3.1	A prayer of the prophet Habakkuk. According to 
HAB.3.2	Revive your work in these years;
HAB.3.2	make it known in these years.
HAB.3.2	In your wrath remember mercy!
HAB.3.3	God comes from Teman,
HAB.3.3	the Holy One from Mount Paran.
HAB.3.3	His splendor covers the heavens,
HAB.3.3	and the earth is full of his praise.
HAB.3.4	His brilliance is like light;
HAB.3.4	rays are flashing from his hand.
HAB.3.4	This is where his power is hidden.
HAB.3.5	Plague goes before him,
HAB.3.5	and pestilence follows in his steps.
HAB.3.6	He stands and shakes
HAB.3.6	he looks and startles the nations.
HAB.3.6	The age-old mountains break apart;
HAB.3.6	the ancient hills sink down.
HAB.3.6	His pathways are ancient.
HAB.3.7	I see the tents of Cushan
HAB.3.7	the tent curtains of the land of Midian tremble.
HAB.3.8	Are you angry at the rivers, 
HAB.3.8	Is your wrath against the rivers?
HAB.3.8	Or is your rage against the sea
HAB.3.8	when you ride on your horses,
HAB.3.8	your victorious chariot?
HAB.3.9	You took the sheath from your bow;
HAB.3.9	the arrows are ready
HAB.3.9	You split the earth with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains see you and shudder;
HAB.3.10	a downpour of water sweeps by.
HAB.3.10	The deep roars with its voice
HAB.3.10	and lifts its waves
HAB.3.11	Sun and moon stand still in their lofty residence,
HAB.3.11	at the flash of your flying arrows,
HAB.3.11	at the brightness of your shining spear.
HAB.3.12	You march across the earth with indignation;
HAB.3.12	you trample down the nations in wrath.
HAB.3.13	You come out to save your people,
HAB.3.13	to save your anointed.
HAB.3.13	You crush the leader of the house of the wicked
HAB.3.13	and strip him from foot
HAB.3.14	You pierce his head
HAB.3.14	with his own spears;
HAB.3.14	his warriors storm out to scatter us,
HAB.3.14	gloating as if ready to secretly devour the weak.
HAB.3.15	You tread the sea with your horses,
HAB.3.15	stirring up the vast water.
HAB.3.16	I heard, and I trembled within;
HAB.3.16	my lips quivered at the sound.
HAB.3.16	Rottenness entered my bones;
HAB.3.16	I trembled where I stood.
HAB.3.16	Now I must quietly wait for the day of distress
HAB.3.16	to come against the people invading us.
HAB.3.17	Though the fig tree does not bud
HAB.3.17	and there is no fruit on the vines,
HAB.3.17	though the olive crop fails
HAB.3.17	and the fields produce no food,
HAB.3.17	though the flocks disappear from the pen
HAB.3.17	and there are no herds in the stalls,
HAB.3.18	yet I will celebrate in the 
HAB.3.18	I will rejoice in the God of my salvation!
HAB.3.19	The 
HAB.3.19	he makes my feet like those of a deer
HAB.3.19	and enables me to walk on mountain heights!
HAB.3.19	For the choir director: on
ZEP.1.1	The word of the 
ZEP.1.2	I will completely sweep away everything
ZEP.1.2	from the face of the earth
ZEP.1.2	this is the 
ZEP.1.3	I will sweep away people and animals;
ZEP.1.3	I will sweep away the birds of the sky
ZEP.1.3	and the fish of the sea,
ZEP.1.3	and the ruins
ZEP.1.3	I will cut off mankind
ZEP.1.3	from the face of the earth.
ZEP.1.3	This is the 
ZEP.1.4	I will stretch out my hand
ZEP.1.4	and against all the residents of Jerusalem.
ZEP.1.4	I will cut off every vestige of Baal
ZEP.1.4	from this place,
ZEP.1.4	the names of the pagan priests
ZEP.1.4	along with the priests;
ZEP.1.5	those who bow in worship on the rooftops
ZEP.1.5	to the stars in the sky;
ZEP.1.5	those who bow and pledge loyalty to the 
ZEP.1.5	but also pledge loyalty to Milcom;
ZEP.1.6	and those who turn back from following the 
ZEP.1.6	who do not seek the 
ZEP.1.7	Be silent in the presence of the Lord 
ZEP.1.7	for the day of the 
ZEP.1.7	Indeed, the 
ZEP.1.7	he has consecrated his guests.
ZEP.1.8	On the day of the 
ZEP.1.8	I will punish the officials, the king’s sons,
ZEP.1.8	and all who are dressed in foreign clothing.
ZEP.1.9	On that day
ZEP.1.9	all who skip over the threshold,
ZEP.1.9	who fill their master’s house
ZEP.1.9	with violence and deceit.
ZEP.1.10	On that day —
ZEP.1.10	this is the 
ZEP.1.10	there will be an outcry from the Fish Gate,
ZEP.1.10	a wailing from the Second District,
ZEP.1.10	and a loud crashing from the hills.
ZEP.1.11	Wail, you residents of the Hollow,
ZEP.1.11	for all the merchants
ZEP.1.11	all those loaded with silver will be cut off.
ZEP.1.12	And at that time I will search Jerusalem with lamps
ZEP.1.12	and punish those who settle down comfortably,
ZEP.1.12	who say to themselves:
ZEP.1.12	The 
ZEP.1.13	Their wealth will become plunder
ZEP.1.13	and their houses a ruin.
ZEP.1.13	They will build houses but never live in them,
ZEP.1.13	plant vineyards but never drink their wine.
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.14	near and rapidly approaching.
ZEP.1.14	Listen, the day of the 
ZEP.1.14	then the warrior’s cry is bitter.
ZEP.1.15	That day is a day of wrath,
ZEP.1.15	a day of trouble and distress,
ZEP.1.15	a day of destruction and desolation,
ZEP.1.15	a day of darkness
ZEP.1.15	a day of clouds and total darkness,
ZEP.1.16	a day of trumpet blast and battle cry
ZEP.1.16	against the fortified cities,
ZEP.1.16	and against the high corner towers.
ZEP.1.17	I will bring distress on mankind,
ZEP.1.17	and they will walk like the blind
ZEP.1.17	because they have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.17	Their blood will be poured out like dust
ZEP.1.17	and their flesh like dung.
ZEP.1.18	Their silver and their gold
ZEP.1.18	will be unable to rescue them
ZEP.1.18	on the day of the 
ZEP.1.18	The whole earth will be consumed
ZEP.1.18	by the fire of his jealousy,
ZEP.1.18	for he will make a complete,
ZEP.1.18	yes, a horrifying end
ZEP.1.18	of all the inhabitants of the earth.
ZEP.2.1	Gather yourselves together;
ZEP.2.1	gather together, undesirable
ZEP.2.2	before the decree
ZEP.2.2	and the day passes like chaff,
ZEP.2.2	before the burning of the 
ZEP.2.2	before the day of the 
ZEP.2.3	Seek the 
ZEP.2.3	who carry out what he commands.
ZEP.2.3	Seek righteousness, seek humility;
ZEP.2.3	perhaps you will be concealed
ZEP.2.3	on the day of the 
ZEP.2.4	For Gaza will be abandoned,
ZEP.2.4	and Ashkelon will become a ruin.
ZEP.2.4	Ashdod will be driven out at noon,
ZEP.2.4	and Ekron will be uprooted.
ZEP.2.5	Woe, inhabitants of the seacoast,
ZEP.2.5	nation of the Cherethites!
ZEP.2.5	The word of the 
ZEP.2.5	Canaan, land of the Philistines:
ZEP.2.5	I will destroy you until there is no one left.
ZEP.2.6	The seacoast will become pasturelands
ZEP.2.6	with caves for shepherds and pens for sheep.
ZEP.2.7	The coastland will belong
ZEP.2.7	to the remnant of the house of Judah;
ZEP.2.7	they will find pasture there.
ZEP.2.7	They will lie down in the evening
ZEP.2.7	among the houses of Ashkelon,
ZEP.2.7	for the 
ZEP.2.7	and restore their fortunes.
ZEP.2.8	I have heard the taunting
ZEP.2.8	and the insults of the Ammonites,
ZEP.2.8	who have taunted my people
ZEP.2.8	and threatened their territory.
ZEP.2.9	Therefore, as I live —
ZEP.2.9	this is the declaration of the 
ZEP.2.9	Moab will be like Sodom
ZEP.2.9	and the Ammonites like Gomorrah:
ZEP.2.9	a place overgrown with weeds,
ZEP.2.9	a salt pit, and a perpetual wasteland.
ZEP.2.9	The remnant of my people will plunder them;
ZEP.2.9	the remainder of my nation will dispossess them.
ZEP.2.10	This is what they get for their pride,
ZEP.2.10	because they have taunted and acted arrogantly
ZEP.2.10	against the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.11	when he starves all the gods of the earth.
ZEP.2.11	Then all the distant coasts and islands of the nations
ZEP.2.11	will bow in worship to him,
ZEP.2.11	each in its own place.
ZEP.2.12	You Cushites will also be slain by my sword.
ZEP.2.13	He will also stretch out his hand against the north
ZEP.2.13	and destroy Assyria;
ZEP.2.13	he will make Nineveh a desolate ruin,
ZEP.2.13	dry as the desert.
ZEP.2.14	Herds will lie down in the middle of it,
ZEP.2.14	every kind of wild animal.
ZEP.2.14	Both eagle owls
ZEP.2.14	will roost in the capitals of its pillars.
ZEP.2.14	Their calls will sound
ZEP.2.14	but devastation
ZEP.2.14	for he will expose the cedar work.
ZEP.2.15	This is the jubilant
ZEP.2.15	that lives in security,
ZEP.2.15	that thinks to herself:
ZEP.2.15	I exist, and there is no one else.
ZEP.2.15	What a desolation she has become,
ZEP.2.15	a place for wild animals to lie down!
ZEP.2.15	Everyone who passes by her
ZEP.2.15	scoffs
ZEP.3.1	Woe to the city that is rebellious
ZEP.3.1	the oppressive city!
ZEP.3.2	She has not obeyed;
ZEP.3.2	she has not accepted discipline.
ZEP.3.2	She has not trusted
ZEP.3.2	she has not drawn near to her God.
ZEP.3.3	The
ZEP.3.3	her judges are wolves of the night,
ZEP.3.3	which leave nothing for
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets are reckless
ZEP.3.4	treacherous men.
ZEP.3.4	Her priests profane the sanctuary;
ZEP.3.4	they do violence to instruction.
ZEP.3.5	The righteous 
ZEP.3.5	he does no wrong.
ZEP.3.5	He applies his justice morning by morning;
ZEP.3.5	he does not fail at dawn,
ZEP.3.5	yet the one who does wrong knows no shame.
ZEP.3.6	I have cut off nations;
ZEP.3.6	their corner towers
ZEP.3.6	I have laid waste their streets,
ZEP.3.6	with no one to pass through.
ZEP.3.6	Their cities lie devastated,
ZEP.3.6	without a person, without an inhabitant.
ZEP.3.7	I thought: You will certainly fear me
ZEP.3.7	and accept correction.
ZEP.3.7	Then her dwelling place
ZEP.3.7	would not be cut off
ZEP.3.7	based on all that I had allocated to her.
ZEP.3.7	However, they became more corrupt
ZEP.3.7	in all their actions.
ZEP.3.8	Therefore, wait for me
ZEP.3.8	this is the 
ZEP.3.8	until the day I rise up for plunder.
ZEP.3.8	For my decision is to gather nations,
ZEP.3.8	to assemble kingdoms,
ZEP.3.8	in order to pour out my indignation
ZEP.3.8	all my burning anger;
ZEP.3.8	for the whole earth will be consumed
ZEP.3.8	by the fire of my jealousy.
ZEP.3.9	For I will then restore
ZEP.3.9	pure
ZEP.3.9	so that all of them may call
ZEP.3.9	on the name of the 
ZEP.3.9	and serve him with a single purpose.
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Cush
ZEP.3.10	my supplicants, my dispersed people,
ZEP.3.10	will bring an offering to me.
ZEP.3.11	On that day you
ZEP.3.11	because of everything you have done
ZEP.3.11	in rebelling
ZEP.3.11	For then I will remove
ZEP.3.11	from among you your jubilant,
ZEP.3.11	and you will never again be haughty
ZEP.3.11	on my holy mountain.
ZEP.3.12	I will leave
ZEP.3.12	a meek and humble people
ZEP.3.12	and they will take refuge in the name of the 
ZEP.3.13	The remnant
ZEP.3.13	do wrong or tell lies;
ZEP.3.13	a deceitful tongue will not be found
ZEP.3.13	in their mouths.
ZEP.3.13	They will pasture and lie down,
ZEP.3.13	with nothing to make them afraid.
ZEP.3.14	Sing for joy, Daughter Zion;
ZEP.3.14	shout loudly, Israel!
ZEP.3.14	Be glad and celebrate with all your heart,
ZEP.3.14	Daughter Jerusalem!
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.15	he has turned back your enemy.
ZEP.3.15	The King of Israel, the 
ZEP.3.15	you need no longer fear harm.
ZEP.3.16	On that day it will be said to Jerusalem:
ZEP.3.16	“Do not fear;
ZEP.3.16	Zion, do not let your hands grow weak.
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.17	a warrior
ZEP.3.17	He will rejoice over you
ZEP.3.17	He will be quiet
ZEP.3.17	He will delight in you with singing.”
ZEP.3.18	I will gather those who have been driven
ZEP.3.18	from the appointed festivals;
ZEP.3.18	they will be a tribute from you
ZEP.3.18	and a reproach on her.
ZEP.3.19	Yes, at that time
ZEP.3.19	I will deal with all who oppress you.
ZEP.3.19	I will save the lame
ZEP.3.19	I will make those who were disgraced
ZEP.3.19	throughout the earth
ZEP.3.19	receive praise and fame.
ZEP.3.20	At that time I will bring you
ZEP.3.20	yes, at the time I will gather you.
ZEP.3.20	I will give you fame and praise
ZEP.3.20	among all the peoples of the earth,
ZEP.3.20	when I restore your fortunes
ZEP.3.20	The 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of King Darius,
HAG.1.2	“The 
HAG.1.3	The word of the 
HAG.1.4	“Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses,
HAG.1.5	Now, the 
HAG.1.6	You have planted much
HAG.1.6	but harvested little.
HAG.1.6	You eat
HAG.1.6	but never have enough to be satisfied.
HAG.1.6	You drink
HAG.1.6	but never have enough to be happy.
HAG.1.6	You put on clothes
HAG.1.6	but never have enough to get warm.
HAG.1.6	The wage earner puts his wages
HAG.1.6	into a bag with a hole in it.”
HAG.1.7	The 
HAG.1.8	Go up into the hills, bring down lumber, and build the house; and I will be pleased with it and be glorified,” says the 
HAG.1.9	“You expected much, but then it amounted to little. When you brought the harvest to your house, I ruined
HAG.1.10	So on your account,
HAG.1.10	the skies have withheld the dew
HAG.1.10	and the land its crops.
HAG.1.11	I have summoned a drought
HAG.1.11	on the fields and the hills,
HAG.1.11	on the grain, new wine, fresh oil,
HAG.1.11	and whatever the ground yields,
HAG.1.11	on man and animal,
HAG.1.11	and on all that your hands produce.”
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel
HAG.1.13	Then Haggai, the 
HAG.1.14	The 
HAG.1.15	on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.
HAG.2.1	On the twenty-first day of the seventh month,
HAG.2.2	“Speak to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, to the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and to the remnant of the people: 
HAG.2.3	‘Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Doesn’t it seem to you like nothing by comparison?
HAG.2.4	Even so, be strong, Zerubbabel — this is the 
HAG.2.5	This is the promise I made to you when you came out of Egypt,
HAG.2.6	For the 
HAG.2.7	I will shake all the nations so that the treasures of all the nations will come, and I will fill this house with glory,”
HAG.2.8	“The silver and gold belong to me” — this is the declaration of the 
HAG.2.9	“The final glory of this house
HAG.2.10	On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
HAG.2.11	“This is what the 
HAG.2.12	If a man is carrying consecrated meat in the fold of his garment, and it touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other food, does it become holy?” 
HAG.2.12	The priests answered, “No.”
HAG.2.13	Then Haggai asked, “If someone defiled by contact with a corpse touches any of these, does it become defiled?” 
HAG.2.13	The priests answered, “It becomes defiled.”
HAG.2.14	Then Haggai replied, “So is this people, and so is this nation before me — this is the 
HAG.2.15	“Now from this day on, think carefully: Before one stone was placed on another in the 
HAG.2.16	what state were you in?
HAG.2.17	I struck you — all the work of your hands — with blight, mildew,
HAG.2.18	“From this day on, think carefully;
HAG.2.19	Is there still seed left in the granary? The vine, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not yet produced. But from this day on I will bless you.”
HAG.2.20	The word of the 
HAG.2.21	“Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah: I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.
HAG.2.22	I will overturn royal thrones and destroy the power of the Gentile kingdoms.
HAG.2.23	On that day” — this is the declaration of the 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius,
ZEC.1.2	“The 
ZEC.1.3	So tell the people, ‘This is what the 
ZEC.1.4	Do not be like your ancestors;
ZEC.1.5	Where are your ancestors now? And do the prophets live forever? 
ZEC.1.6	But didn’t my words and my statutes that I commanded my servants the prophets overtake your ancestors? ’”
ZEC.1.6	So the people repented and said, “As the 
ZEC.1.7	On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
ZEC.1.8	I looked out in the night and saw a man riding on a chestnut
ZEC.1.9	I asked, “What are these, my lord?”
ZEC.1.9	The angel who was talking to me replied, “I will show you what they are.”
ZEC.1.10	Then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained, “They are the ones the 
ZEC.1.11	They reported to the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	The 
ZEC.1.14	So the angel who was speaking with me said, “Proclaim: The 
ZEC.1.15	I am fiercely angry with the nations that are at ease,
ZEC.1.16	Therefore, this is what the 
ZEC.1.17	“Proclaim further: This is what the 
ZEC.1.18	Then I looked up and saw four horns.
ZEC.1.19	So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these?”
ZEC.1.19	And he said to me, “These are the horns that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
ZEC.1.20	Then the 
ZEC.1.21	I asked, “What are they coming to do?”
ZEC.1.21	He replied, “These are the horns that scattered Judah so no one could raise his head. These craftsmen have come to terrify them, to cut off
ZEC.2.1	I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
ZEC.2.2	I asked, “Where are you going?”
ZEC.2.2	He answered me, “To measure Jerusalem to determine its width and length.”
ZEC.2.3	Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him. 
ZEC.2.4	He said to him, “Run and tell this young man: Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the number of people and livestock in it.”
ZEC.2.5	The declaration of the 
ZEC.2.6	“Listen! Listen! Flee from the land of the north”
ZEC.2.7	“Listen, Zion! Escape, you who are living with Daughter Babylon.” 
ZEC.2.8	For the 
ZEC.2.9	For look, I am raising my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their own servants.
ZEC.2.10	“Daughter Zion, shout for joy and be glad, for I am coming to dwell among you” — this is the 
ZEC.2.11	“Many nations will join themselves to the 
ZEC.2.12	The 
ZEC.2.13	Let all people be silent
ZEC.3.1	Then he showed me the high priest Joshua
ZEC.3.2	The 
ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was dressed with filthy
ZEC.3.4	So the angel of the 
ZEC.3.5	Then I said, “Let them put a clean turban
ZEC.3.6	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	“This is what the 
ZEC.3.8	“Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and your colleagues sitting before you; indeed, these men are a sign that I am about to bring my servant, the Branch.
ZEC.3.9	Notice the stone
ZEC.3.10	On that day, each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and fig tree.”
ZEC.4.1	The angel who was speaking with me then returned and roused me as one awakened out of sleep. 
ZEC.4.2	He asked me, “What do you see?”
ZEC.4.2	I replied, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top. The lampstand also has seven lamps at the top with seven spouts for each of
ZEC.4.3	There are also two olive trees beside it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left.”
ZEC.4.4	Then I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”
ZEC.4.5	“Don’t you know what they are?” replied the angel who was speaking with me.
ZEC.4.5	I said, “No, my lord.”
ZEC.4.6	So he answered me, “This is the word of the 
ZEC.4.7	‘What are you, great mountain?
ZEC.4.8	Then the word of the 
ZEC.4.9	“Zerubbabel’s hands have laid the foundation of this house,
ZEC.4.10	For who despises the day of small things?
ZEC.4.11	I asked him, “What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?” 
ZEC.4.12	And I questioned him further, “What are the two streams
ZEC.4.13	Then he inquired of me, “Don’t you know what these are?”
ZEC.4.13	“No, my lord,” I replied.
ZEC.4.14	“These are the two anointed ones,”
ZEC.5.1	I looked up again and saw a flying scroll.
ZEC.5.2	“What do you see?” he asked me.
ZEC.5.2	“I see a flying scroll,” I replied, “thirty feet
ZEC.5.3	Then he said to me, “This is the curse
ZEC.5.4	I will send it out,”
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel who was speaking with me came forward and told me, “Look up and see what this is that is approaching.”
ZEC.5.6	So I asked, “What is it?”
ZEC.5.6	He responded, “It’s a measuring basket
ZEC.5.7	Then a lead cover was lifted, and there was a woman
ZEC.5.8	“This is Wickedness,” he said. He shoved her down into the basket and pushed the lead weight over its opening. 
ZEC.5.9	Then I looked up and saw two women approaching with the wind in their wings. Their wings were like those of a stork,
ZEC.5.10	So I asked the angel who was speaking with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”
ZEC.5.11	“To build a shrine for it in the land of Shinar,”
ZEC.6.1	Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two mountains. The mountains were made of bronze. 
ZEC.6.2	The first chariot had chestnut
ZEC.6.3	the third chariot white horses,
ZEC.6.4	So I inquired of the angel who was speaking with me, “What are these, my lord?”
ZEC.6.5	The angel told me, “These are the four spirits
ZEC.6.6	The one with the black horses is going to the land of the north, the white horses are going after them, but the dappled horses are going to the land of the south.” 
ZEC.6.7	As the strong horses went out, they wanted to go patrol the earth, and the 
ZEC.6.8	Then he summoned me saying, “See, those going to the land of the north have pacified my Spirit in the northern land.”
ZEC.6.9	The word of the 
ZEC.6.10	“Take an offering from the exiles, from Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go that same day to the house of Josiah son of Zephaniah. 
ZEC.6.11	Take silver and gold, make a crown,
ZEC.6.12	You are to tell him: This is what the 
ZEC.6.13	Yes, he will build the 
ZEC.6.14	The crown will reside in the 
ZEC.6.15	People who are far off will come and build the 
ZEC.7.1	In the fourth year of King Darius,
ZEC.7.2	Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer, Regem-melech, and their men to plead for the 
ZEC.7.3	by asking the priests who were at the house of the 
ZEC.7.4	Then the word of the 
ZEC.7.5	“Ask all the people of the land and the priests: When you fasted and lamented in the fifth and in the seventh months for these seventy years, did you really fast for me?
ZEC.7.6	When you eat and drink, don’t you eat and drink simply for yourselves?
ZEC.7.7	Aren’t these the words that the 
ZEC.7.8	The word of the 
ZEC.7.9	“The 
ZEC.7.10	Do not oppress the widow or the fatherless, the resident alien or the poor,
ZEC.7.11	But they refused to pay attention
ZEC.7.12	They made their hearts like a rock so as not to obey the law or the words that the 
ZEC.7.13	Just as he had called, and they would not listen, so when they called, I would not listen, says the 
ZEC.7.14	I scattered them with a windstorm over all the nations that had not known them, and the land was left desolate behind them, with no one coming or going. They turned a pleasant land into a desolation.”
ZEC.8.1	The word of the 
ZEC.8.2	The 
ZEC.8.3	The 
ZEC.8.4	The 
ZEC.8.5	The streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls playing in them.” 
ZEC.8.6	The 
ZEC.8.7	The 
ZEC.8.8	I will bring them back
ZEC.8.9	The 
ZEC.8.10	For prior to those days neither man nor animal had wages. There was no safety from the enemy for anyone who came or went, for I turned everyone against his neighbor. 
ZEC.8.11	But now, I will not treat the remnant of this people as in the former days” — this is the declaration of the 
ZEC.8.12	“For they will sow in peace: the vine will yield its fruit, the land will yield its produce, and the skies will yield their dew. I will give the remnant of this people all these things as an inheritance.
ZEC.8.13	As you have been a curse among the nations,
ZEC.8.14	For the 
ZEC.8.15	“so I have resolved again in these days to do what is good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah.
ZEC.8.16	These are the things you must do: Speak truth to one another; make true and sound decisions within your city gates. 
ZEC.8.17	Do not plot evil
ZEC.8.18	Then the word of the 
ZEC.8.19	The 
ZEC.8.20	The 
ZEC.8.21	the residents of one city will go to another, saying: Let’s go at once to plead for the 
ZEC.8.22	Many peoples and strong nations will come to seek the 
ZEC.8.23	The 
ZEC.9.1	A pronouncement:
ZEC.9.1	The word of the 
ZEC.9.1	is against the land of Hadrach,
ZEC.9.1	and Damascus
ZEC.9.1	for the eyes of humanity
ZEC.9.1	and all the tribes of Israel
ZEC.9.1	are on the 
ZEC.9.2	and also against Hamath,
ZEC.9.2	as well as Tyre
ZEC.9.2	though they are very shrewd.
ZEC.9.3	Tyre has built herself a fortress;
ZEC.9.3	she has heaped up silver like dust
ZEC.9.3	and gold like the dirt of the streets.
ZEC.9.4	Listen! The Lord will impoverish her
ZEC.9.4	and cast her wealth into the sea;
ZEC.9.4	she herself will be consumed by fire.
ZEC.9.5	Ashkelon will see it and be afraid;
ZEC.9.5	Gaza too, and will writhe in great pain,
ZEC.9.5	as will Ekron, for her hope will fail.
ZEC.9.5	There will cease to be a king in Gaza,
ZEC.9.5	and Ashkelon will become uninhabited.
ZEC.9.6	A mongrel people will live in Ashdod,
ZEC.9.6	and I will destroy the pride of the Philistines.
ZEC.9.7	I will remove the blood from their mouths
ZEC.9.7	and the abhorrent things
ZEC.9.7	from between their teeth.
ZEC.9.7	Then they too will become a remnant for our God;
ZEC.9.7	they will become like a clan in Judah
ZEC.9.7	and Ekron like the Jebusites.
ZEC.9.8	I will encamp at my house as a guard,
ZEC.9.8	against those who march back and forth,
ZEC.9.8	and no oppressor will march against them again,
ZEC.9.8	for now I have seen with my own eyes.
ZEC.9.9	Rejoice greatly, Daughter Zion!
ZEC.9.9	Shout in triumph, Daughter Jerusalem!
ZEC.9.9	Look, your King is coming to you;
ZEC.9.9	he is righteous and victorious,
ZEC.9.9	humble and riding on a donkey,
ZEC.9.9	on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
ZEC.9.10	I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim
ZEC.9.10	and the horse from Jerusalem.
ZEC.9.10	The bow of war will be removed,
ZEC.9.10	and he will proclaim peace to the nations.
ZEC.9.10	His dominion will extend from sea to sea,
ZEC.9.10	from the Euphrates River
ZEC.9.10	to the ends of the earth.
ZEC.9.11	As for you,
ZEC.9.11	because of the blood of your covenant,
ZEC.9.11	I will release your prisoners
ZEC.9.11	from the waterless cistern.
ZEC.9.12	Return to a stronghold,
ZEC.9.12	you prisoners who have hope;
ZEC.9.12	today I declare that I will restore double to you.
ZEC.9.13	For I will bend Judah as my bow;
ZEC.9.13	I will fill that bow with Ephraim.
ZEC.9.13	I will rouse your sons, Zion,
ZEC.9.13	against your sons, Greece.
ZEC.9.13	I will make you like a warrior’s sword.
ZEC.9.14	Then the 
ZEC.9.14	and his arrow will fly like lightning.
ZEC.9.14	The Lord 
ZEC.9.14	and advance with the southern storms.
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.15	They will consume and conquer with slingstones;
ZEC.9.15	they will drink and be rowdy as if with wine.
ZEC.9.15	They will be as full as the sprinkling basin,
ZEC.9.15	like those at the corners of the altar.
ZEC.9.16	The 
ZEC.9.16	as the flock of his people;
ZEC.9.16	for they are like jewels in a crown,
ZEC.9.16	sparkling over his land.
ZEC.9.17	How lovely and beautiful!
ZEC.9.17	Grain will make the young men flourish,
ZEC.9.17	and new wine, the young women.
ZEC.10.1	Ask the 
ZEC.10.1	in the season of spring rain.
ZEC.10.1	The 
ZEC.10.1	and he will give them showers of rain
ZEC.10.1	and crops in the field for everyone.
ZEC.10.2	For the idols speak falsehood,
ZEC.10.2	and the diviners
ZEC.10.2	they relate empty dreams
ZEC.10.2	and offer empty comfort.
ZEC.10.2	Therefore the people wander like sheep;
ZEC.10.2	they suffer affliction because there is no shepherd.
ZEC.10.3	My anger burns against the shepherds,
ZEC.10.3	so I will punish the leaders.
ZEC.10.3	For the 
ZEC.10.3	the house of Judah;
ZEC.10.3	he will make them like his majestic steed in battle.
ZEC.10.4	The cornerstone
ZEC.10.4	The tent peg
ZEC.10.4	and also the battle bow
ZEC.10.4	Together

ZEC.10.6	and deliver the house of Joseph.
ZEC.10.6	I will restore
ZEC.10.6	because I have compassion on them,
ZEC.10.6	and they will be

ZEC.10.8	because I have redeemed
ZEC.10.8	they will be as numerous as they once were.
ZEC.10.9	Though I sow
ZEC.10.9	they will remember
ZEC.10.9	they and their children will live and return.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them back from the land of Egypt
ZEC.10.10	and gather them from Assyria.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them to the land of Gilead
ZEC.10.10	and to Lebanon,
ZEC.10.10	but it will not be enough for them.
ZEC.10.11	The 
ZEC.10.11	and strike the waves of the sea;

ZEC.10.11	The pride of Assyria will be brought down,

ZEC.10.12	I will strengthen

ZEC.11.2	the glorious trees are destroyed!
ZEC.11.2	Wail, oaks of Bashan,

ZEC.11.3	Listen to the wail
ZEC.11.3	for their glory is destroyed.

ZEC.11.5	Those who buy them slaughter them but are not punished.
ZEC.11.6	Indeed, I will no longer have compassion on the inhabitants of the land” — this is the 
ZEC.11.7	So I shepherded the flock intended for slaughter, the oppressed of the flock.
ZEC.11.8	In one month I got rid of three shepherds. I became impatient with them, and they also detested me. 
ZEC.11.9	Then I said, “I will no longer shepherd you. Let what is dying die, and let what is perishing perish; let the rest devour each other’s flesh.” 
ZEC.11.10	Next I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, annulling the covenant I had made with all the peoples. 
ZEC.11.11	It was annulled on that day, and so the oppressed of the flock
ZEC.11.12	Then I said to them, “If it seems right to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them.” So they weighed my wages, thirty pieces of silver.
ZEC.11.13	“Throw it to the potter,”
ZEC.11.14	Then I cut in two my second staff, Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
ZEC.11.15	The 
ZEC.11.16	I am about to raise up a shepherd in the land who will not care for those who are perishing, and he will not seek the lost
ZEC.11.17	Woe to the worthless shepherd
ZEC.11.17	who deserts the flock!
ZEC.11.17	May a sword strike
ZEC.11.17	and his right eye!
ZEC.11.17	May his arm wither away
ZEC.11.17	and his right eye go completely blind!”
ZEC.12.1	A pronouncement:
ZEC.12.1	The word of the 
ZEC.12.1	A declaration of the 
ZEC.12.1	who stretched out the heavens,
ZEC.12.1	laid the foundation of the earth,
ZEC.12.1	and formed the spirit of man within him.
ZEC.12.2	“Look, I will make Jerusalem a cup that causes staggering
ZEC.12.3	On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples; all who try to lift it will injure themselves severely when all the nations of the earth gather against her.
ZEC.12.4	On that day” — this is the 
ZEC.12.5	Then each of the leaders of Judah will think to himself: The residents of Jerusalem are my strength through the 
ZEC.12.6	On that day I will make the leaders of Judah like a firepot in a woodpile,
ZEC.12.7	The 
ZEC.12.8	On that day the 
ZEC.12.9	On that day I will set out to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.10	“Then I will pour out a spirit
ZEC.12.11	On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. 
ZEC.12.12	The land will mourn, every family by itself: the family of David’s house by itself and their women by themselves; the family of Nathan’s
ZEC.12.13	the family of Levi’s house by itself and their women by themselves; the family of Shimei
ZEC.12.14	all the remaining families, every family by itself, and their women by themselves.
ZEC.13.1	“On that day a fountain
ZEC.13.2	On that day” — this is the declaration of the 
ZEC.13.3	If a man still prophesies, his father and his mother who bore him will say to him: You cannot remain alive because you have spoken a lie in the name of the 
ZEC.13.4	On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; they will not put on a hairy cloak
ZEC.13.5	He will say: I am not a prophet; I work the land, for a man purchased
ZEC.13.6	If someone asks him: What are these wounds
ZEC.13.7	Sword, awake against my shepherd,
ZEC.13.7	against the man who is my associate —
ZEC.13.7	this is the declaration of the 
ZEC.13.7	Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered;
ZEC.13.7	I will turn my hand against the little ones.
ZEC.13.8	In the whole land —
ZEC.13.8	this is the 
ZEC.13.8	two-thirds
ZEC.13.8	but a third will be left in it.
ZEC.13.9	I will put this third through the fire;
ZEC.13.9	I will refine them as silver is refined
ZEC.13.9	and test them as gold is tested.
ZEC.13.9	They will call on my name,
ZEC.13.9	and I will answer them.
ZEC.13.9	I will say: They are my people,
ZEC.13.9	and they will say: The 
ZEC.14.1	Look, a day belonging to the 
ZEC.14.2	I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem for battle.
ZEC.14.3	Then the 
ZEC.14.4	On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives,
ZEC.14.5	You will flee by my mountain valley,
ZEC.14.6	On that day there will be no light; the sunlight and moonlight will diminish.
ZEC.14.7	It will be a unique day known only to the 
ZEC.14.8	On that day living water will flow out from Jerusalem,
ZEC.14.9	On that day the 
ZEC.14.10	All the land from Geba
ZEC.14.11	People will live there, and never again will there be a curse of complete destruction. So Jerusalem will dwell in security.
ZEC.14.12	This will be the plague with which the 
ZEC.14.13	On that day a great panic from the 
ZEC.14.14	Judah will also fight at Jerusalem, and the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected: gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance.
ZEC.14.15	The same plague as the previous one will strike
ZEC.14.16	Then all the survivors from the nations that came against Jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.17	Should any of the families of the earth not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.18	And if the people
ZEC.14.19	This will be the punishment of Egypt and all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.
ZEC.14.20	On that day, the words H
ZEC.14.21	Every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be holy to the

MAT.1.10	Amon fathered Josiah,
MAT.1.11	and Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers
MAT.1.11	at the time of the exile to Babylon.
MAT.1.12	After the exile to Babylon
MAT.1.12	Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel,
MAT.1.12	Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel,
MAT.1.13	Zerubbabel fathered Abiud,

MAT.1.15	Eliud fathered Eleazar,
MAT.1.15	Eleazar fathered Matthan,
MAT.1.15	Matthan fathered Jacob,
MAT.1.16	and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary,
MAT.1.16	who gave birth to Jesus who is called the Christ.
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations; and from David until the exile to Babylon, fourteen generations; and from the exile to Babylon until the Christ, fourteen generations.
MAT.1.18	The birth of Jesus Christ came about this way: After his mother Mary had been engaged
MAT.1.19	So her husband Joseph, being a righteous man,
MAT.1.20	But after he had considered these things, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
MAT.1.21	She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus,
MAT.1.22	Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet:
MAT.1.23	which is translated “God is with us.”
MAT.1.24	When Joseph woke up, he did as the Lord’s angel had commanded him. He married her
MAT.1.25	but did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to a son.
MAT.2.1	After Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
MAT.2.2	saying, “Where is he who has been born king of the Jews?
MAT.2.3	When King Herod heard this, he was deeply disturbed, and all Jerusalem with him. 
MAT.2.4	So he assembled all the chief priests and scribes
MAT.2.5	“In Bethlehem of Judea,” they told him, “because this is what was written by the prophet:
MAT.2.6	are by no means 
MAT.2.7	Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and asked them the exact time the star appeared. 
MAT.2.8	He sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go and search carefully for the child. When you find him, report back to me so that I too can go and worship him.”
MAT.2.9	After hearing the king, they went on their way. And there it was — the star they had seen at its rising. It led them until it came and stopped above the place where the child was. 
MAT.2.10	When they saw the star, they were overwhelmed with joy. 
MAT.2.11	Entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and falling to their knees, they worshiped him.
MAT.2.12	And being warned
MAT.2.13	After they were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, “Get up! Take the child and his mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to search for the child to kill him.”
MAT.2.14	So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and escaped to Egypt. 
MAT.2.15	He stayed there until Herod’s death, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled: 
MAT.2.16	Then Herod, when he realized that he had been outwitted by the wise men, flew into a rage. He gave orders to massacre all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, in keeping with the time he had learned from the wise men.
MAT.2.17	Then what was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled:
MAT.2.19	After Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
MAT.2.20	saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, because those who intended to kill the child are dead.” 
MAT.2.21	So he got up, took the child and his mother, and entered the land of Israel. 
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee.
MAT.2.23	Then he went and settled in a town called Nazareth to fulfill what was spoken through the prophets, that he would be called a Nazarene.
MAT.3.1	In those days John the Baptist came,
MAT.3.2	and saying, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has come near!” 
MAT.3.3	For he is the one spoken of through the prophet Isaiah, who said:
MAT.3.4	Now John had a camel-hair garment with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. 
MAT.3.5	Then people from Jerusalem, all Judea, and all the vicinity of the Jordan were going out to him, 
MAT.3.6	and they were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
MAT.3.7	When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees
MAT.3.8	Therefore produce fruit
MAT.3.9	And don’t presume to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’
MAT.3.10	The ax is already at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
MAT.3.11	“I baptize you with
MAT.3.12	His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn. But the chaff he will burn with fire that never goes out.”
MAT.3.13	Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him.
MAT.3.14	But John tried to stop him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?”
MAT.3.15	Jesus answered him, 
MAT.3.16	When Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water. The heavens
MAT.3.17	And a voice from heaven said: “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well-pleased.”
MAT.4.1	Then
MAT.4.2	After he had fasted forty days and forty nights,
MAT.4.3	Then the tempter approached him and said, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.”
MAT.4.4	He answered, 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil took him to the holy city, had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple,
MAT.4.6	and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written:
MAT.4.6	and 
MAT.4.7	Jesus told him, 
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. 
MAT.4.9	And he said to him, “I will give you all these things if you will fall down and worship me.”
MAT.4.10	Then Jesus told him, 
MAT.4.11	Then the devil left him, and angels came and began to serve him.
MAT.4.12	When he heard that John had been arrested,
MAT.4.13	He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum
MAT.4.14	This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah:
MAT.4.17	From then on Jesus began to preach, 
MAT.4.18	As
MAT.4.19	 he told them, 
MAT.4.20	Immediately they left their nets and followed him.
MAT.4.21	Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with Zebedee their father, preparing their nets, and he called them. 
MAT.4.22	Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.
MAT.4.23	Now Jesus began to go all over Galilee,
MAT.4.24	Then the news about him spread throughout Syria.
MAT.4.25	Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
MAT.5.1	When he saw the crowds, he went up on the mountain,
MAT.5.2	Then
MAT.7.28	When Jesus had finished saying these things,
MAT.7.29	because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like their scribes.
MAT.8.1	When he came down from the mountain, large crowds
MAT.8.2	Right away
MAT.8.3	Reaching out his hand, Jesus touched him, saying, 
MAT.8.4	Then Jesus told him, 
MAT.8.5	When he entered Capernaum,
MAT.8.6	“Lord, my servant is lying at home paralyzed, in terrible agony.”
MAT.8.7	He said to him, 
MAT.8.8	“Lord,” the centurion replied, “I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.
MAT.8.9	For I too am a man under authority, having soldiers under my command.
MAT.8.10	Hearing this, Jesus was amazed and said to those following him, 
MAT.8.13	Then Jesus told the centurion, 
MAT.8.14	Jesus went into Peter’s house
MAT.8.15	So he touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began to serve him. 
MAT.8.16	When evening came, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed. He drove out the spirits
MAT.8.17	so that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
MAT.8.18	When Jesus saw a large crowd
MAT.8.19	A scribe approached him and said,
MAT.8.20	Jesus told him, 
MAT.8.21	“Lord,” another of his disciples said, “first let me go bury my father.”
MAT.8.22	But Jesus told him, 
MAT.8.23	As he got into the boat,
MAT.8.24	Suddenly, a violent storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves — but Jesus kept sleeping. 
MAT.8.25	So the disciples came and woke him up, saying, “Lord, save us! We’re going to die!”
MAT.8.26	He said to them, 
MAT.8.27	The men were amazed and asked, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey
MAT.8.28	When he had come to the other side,
MAT.8.29	Suddenly they shouted, “What do you have to do with us,
MAT.8.30	A long way off from them, a large herd of pigs was feeding. 
MAT.8.31	“If you drive us out,” the demons begged him, “send us into the herd of pigs.”
MAT.8.33	Then the men who tended them fled. They went into the city and reported everything, especially what had happened to those who were demon-possessed. 
MAT.8.34	At that, the whole town went out to meet Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.
MAT.9.1	So he got into a boat, crossed over, and came to his own town.
MAT.9.2	Just then
MAT.9.3	At this, some of the scribes said to themselves, “He’s blaspheming!” 
MAT.9.4	Perceiving their thoughts,
MAT.9.6	  — then he told the paralytic, 
MAT.9.7	So he got up and went home. 
MAT.9.8	When the crowds saw this, they were awestruck
MAT.9.9	As Jesus went on from there,
MAT.9.10	While he was reclining at the table in the house, many tax collectors and sinners came to eat with Jesus and his disciples.
MAT.9.11	When the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 
MAT.9.12	Now when he heard this, he said, 
MAT.9.14	Then John’s disciples came to him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?” 
MAT.9.15	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.9.18	As he was telling them these things,
MAT.9.19	So Jesus and his disciples got up and followed
MAT.9.20	Just then, a woman who had suffered from bleeding for twelve years approached from behind and touched the end of his robe,
MAT.9.21	for she said to herself, “If I can just touch his robe, I’ll be made well.”
MAT.9.22	Jesus turned and saw her. 
MAT.9.23	When Jesus came to the leader’s house, he saw the flute players and a crowd lamenting loudly.
MAT.9.24	 he said, 
MAT.9.25	After the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl got up.
MAT.9.26	Then news of this spread throughout that whole area.
MAT.9.27	As Jesus went on from there, two blind men followed him, calling out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!” 
MAT.9.28	When he entered the house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, 
MAT.9.28	They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”
MAT.9.29	Then he touched their eyes, saying, 
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus warned them sternly, 
MAT.9.31	But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that whole area.
MAT.9.32	Just as they were going out, a demon-possessed man who was unable to speak was brought to him.
MAT.9.33	When the demon had been driven out, the man who had been mute spoke, and the crowds were amazed, saying, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, “He drives out demons by the ruler of the demons.”
MAT.9.35	Jesus continued going around to all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom,
MAT.9.36	When he saw the crowds, he felt compassion for them, because they were distressed and dejected,
MAT.9.37	Then he said to his disciples,
MAT.10.1	Summoning his twelve disciples,
MAT.10.2	These are the names of the twelve apostles:
MAT.10.3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
MAT.10.4	Simon the Zealot,
MAT.10.5	Jesus sent out these twelve after giving them instructions: 
MAT.11.1	When Jesus had finished giving instructions to his twelve disciples, he moved on from there to teach and preach in their towns.
MAT.11.2	Now when John heard in prison what the Christ was doing, he sent a message through his disciples
MAT.11.3	and asked him, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?” 
MAT.11.4	Jesus replied to them, 
MAT.11.7	As these men were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John: 
MAT.11.20	Then he proceeded to denounce the towns where most of his miracles were done, because they did not repent: 
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus said,
MAT.12.1	At that time Jesus passed through the grainfields on the Sabbath.
MAT.12.2	When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, “See, your disciples are doing what is not lawful
MAT.12.3	He said to them, 
MAT.12.9	Moving on from there, he entered their synagogue.
MAT.12.10	There he saw a man who had a shriveled hand, and in order to accuse him they asked him, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” 
MAT.12.11	He replied to them, 
MAT.12.13	Then he told the man, 
MAT.12.14	But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, how they might kill him.
MAT.12.15	Jesus was aware of this and withdrew. Large crowds
MAT.12.16	He warned them not to make him known,
MAT.12.17	so that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
MAT.12.22	Then a demon-possessed man
MAT.12.23	All the crowds were astounded and said, “Could this be the Son of David?” 
MAT.12.24	When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons.”
MAT.12.25	Knowing their thoughts,
MAT.12.38	Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to him, “Teacher, we want to see a sign from you.”
MAT.12.39	He answered them,
MAT.12.46	While he
MAT.12.47	Someone told him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to speak to you.”
MAT.12.48	He replied to the one who was speaking to him, 
MAT.12.49	Stretching out his hand toward his disciples,
MAT.13.1	On that day Jesus went out of the house and was sitting by the sea.
MAT.13.2	Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down, while the whole crowd stood on the shore.
MAT.13.3	Then he told them many things in parables,
MAT.13.10	Then the disciples
MAT.13.11	He answered, 
MAT.13.24	He presented another parable to them: 
MAT.13.31	He
MAT.13.33	He told them another parable: 
MAT.13.34	Jesus told the crowds all these things in parables, and he did not tell them anything without a parable,
MAT.13.35	so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled:
MAT.13.36	Then he left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples approached him and said, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.”
MAT.13.37	He replied: 
MAT.13.51	They answered him, “Yes.”
MAT.13.53	When Jesus had finished these parables, he left there. 
MAT.13.54	He went to his hometown
MAT.13.55	Isn’t this the carpenter’s son?
MAT.13.56	And his sisters, aren’t they all with us? So where does he get all these things?” 
MAT.13.57	And they were offended by him.
MAT.13.57	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.13.58	And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	At that time
MAT.14.2	“This is John the Baptist,” he told his servants. “He has been raised from the dead, and that’s why miraculous powers are at work in him.”
MAT.14.3	For Herod had arrested John, chained
MAT.14.4	since John had been telling him, “It’s not lawful
MAT.14.5	Though Herod wanted to kill John, he feared the crowd since they regarded John as a prophet.
MAT.14.6	When Herod’s birthday celebration came, Herodias’s daughter danced before them
MAT.14.7	So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 
MAT.14.8	Prompted by her mother, she answered, “Give me John the Baptist’s head here on a platter.” 
MAT.14.9	Although the king regretted it, he commanded that it be granted because of his oaths and his guests. 
MAT.14.10	So he sent orders and had John beheaded in the prison. 
MAT.14.11	His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, who carried it to her mother. 
MAT.14.12	Then his disciples came, removed the corpse,
MAT.14.13	When Jesus heard about it,
MAT.14.14	When he went ashore,
MAT.14.15	When evening came, the disciples
MAT.14.17	“But we only have five loaves and two fish here,” they said to him.
MAT.14.19	Then he commanded the crowds to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them. He broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
MAT.14.20	Everyone ate and was satisfied. They picked up twelve baskets full of leftover pieces.
MAT.14.21	Now those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children.
MAT.14.22	Immediately
MAT.14.23	After dismissing the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. Well into the night, he was there alone.
MAT.14.24	Meanwhile, the boat was already some distance
MAT.14.25	Jesus came toward them walking on the sea
MAT.14.26	When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified. “It’s a ghost!” they said, and they cried out in fear.
MAT.14.27	Immediately Jesus spoke to them. 
MAT.14.28	“Lord, if it’s you,” Peter answered him, “command me to come to you on the water.”
MAT.14.29	He said, 
MAT.14.29	And climbing out of the boat, Peter started walking on the water and came toward Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	But when he saw the strength of the wind,
MAT.14.31	Immediately Jesus reached out his hand, caught hold of him, and said to him, 
MAT.14.32	When they got into the boat, the wind ceased. 
MAT.14.33	Then those in the boat worshiped him and said, “Truly you are the Son of God.”
MAT.14.34	When they had crossed over,
MAT.14.35	When the men of that place recognized him, they alerted the whole vicinity and brought to him all who were sick. 
MAT.14.36	They begged him that they might only touch the end of his robe, and as many as touched it were healed.
MAT.15.1	Then
MAT.15.2	“Why do your disciples
MAT.15.3	He answered them, 
MAT.15.10	Summoning the crowd, he told them, 
MAT.15.12	Then the disciples came up and told him, “Do you know that the Pharisees took offense when they heard what you said?”
MAT.15.13	He replied, 
MAT.15.15	Then Peter said, “Explain this parable to us.”
MAT.15.21	When Jesus left there,
MAT.15.22	Just then a Canaanite woman from that region came and kept crying out,
MAT.15.23	Jesus did not say a word to her. His disciples
MAT.15.24	He replied, 
MAT.15.25	But she came, knelt before him, and said, “Lord, help me!”
MAT.15.26	He answered, 
MAT.15.27	“Yes, Lord,” she said, “yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus replied to her, 
MAT.15.29	Moving on from there,
MAT.15.30	and large crowds came to him, including the lame, the blind, the crippled, those unable to speak, and many others. They put them at his feet, and he healed them. 
MAT.15.31	So the crowd was amazed when they saw those unable to speak talking, the crippled restored, the lame walking, and the blind seeing,
MAT.15.32	Jesus called his disciples and said,
MAT.15.33	The disciples said to him, “Where could we get enough bread in this desolate place
MAT.15.34	“Seven,” they said, “and a few small fish.”
MAT.15.35	After commanding the crowd to sit down on the ground, 
MAT.15.36	he took the seven loaves and the fish, gave thanks, broke them, and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
MAT.15.37	They all ate and were satisfied. They collected the leftover pieces — seven large baskets full. 
MAT.15.38	Now there were four thousand men who had eaten, besides women and children. 
MAT.15.39	After dismissing the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.
MAT.16.1	The Pharisees and Sadducees approached,
MAT.16.2	He replied, 
MAT.16.5	The disciples reached the other shore,
MAT.16.6	Then Jesus told them, 
MAT.16.7	They were discussing among themselves, “We didn’t bring any bread.”
MAT.16.8	Aware of this, Jesus said, 
MAT.16.12	Then they understood that he had not told them to beware of the leaven in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi,
MAT.16.14	They replied, “Some say John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter answered, “You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.”
MAT.16.17	Jesus responded, 
MAT.16.20	Then he gave the disciples orders to tell no one that he was
MAT.16.21	From
MAT.16.22	Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, “Oh no,
MAT.16.23	Jesus turned and told Peter, 
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to his disciples, 
MAT.17.1	After six days
MAT.17.2	He was transfigured in front of them, and his face shone like the sun; his clothes became as white as the light.
MAT.17.3	Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with him. 
MAT.17.4	Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it’s good for us to be here. If you want, I will set up
MAT.17.5	While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud covered
MAT.17.6	When the disciples
MAT.17.7	Jesus came up, touched them, and said, 
MAT.17.8	When they looked up they saw no one except Jesus alone.
MAT.17.9	As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them,
MAT.17.10	So the disciples asked him, “Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?” 
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that he had spoken to them about John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	When they reached the crowd,
MAT.17.15	“Lord,” he said, “have mercy on my son, because he has seizures
MAT.17.16	I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn’t heal him.”
MAT.17.17	Jesus replied, 
MAT.17.18	Then Jesus rebuked the demon,
MAT.17.19	Then the disciples approached Jesus privately and said, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
MAT.17.22	As
MAT.17.23	 And they were deeply distressed.
MAT.17.24	When they came to Capernaum, those who collected the temple tax approached Peter and said, “Doesn’t your teacher pay the temple tax?” 
MAT.17.25	“Yes,” he said.
MAT.17.25	When he went into the house, Jesus spoke to him first,
MAT.17.26	“From strangers,” he said.
MAT.18.1	At that time
MAT.18.2	He called a child and had him stand among them. 
MAT.18.3	 he said, 
MAT.18.21	Then Peter approached him and asked, “Lord, how many times shall I forgive my brother or sister who sins against me? As many as seven times?” 
MAT.19.1	When Jesus had finished saying these things,
MAT.19.2	Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	Some Pharisees approached him to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife on any grounds?” 
MAT.19.7	“Why then,” they asked him, “did Moses command us to give divorce papers
MAT.19.8	He told them, 
MAT.19.10	His disciples
MAT.19.11	He responded, 
MAT.19.13	Then children were brought to Jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
MAT.19.14	Jesus said, 
MAT.19.15	After placing his hands on them, he went on from there.
MAT.19.16	Just then someone came up and asked him,
MAT.19.18	“Which ones?” he asked him.
MAT.19.18	Jesus answered: 
MAT.19.20	“I have kept all these,”
MAT.19.22	When the young man heard that, he went away grieving, because he had many possessions.
MAT.19.23	Jesus said to his disciples, 
MAT.19.25	When the disciples heard this, they were utterly astonished and asked, “Then who can be saved?”
MAT.19.26	Jesus looked at them and said, 
MAT.19.27	Then Peter responded to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you. So what will there be for us?”
MAT.19.28	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.20.17	While going up to Jerusalem,
MAT.20.20	Then the mother of Zebedee’s sons approached him with her sons.
MAT.20.21	 he asked her.
MAT.20.21	“Promise,”
MAT.20.22	Jesus answered, 
MAT.20.22	“We are able,” they said to him.
MAT.20.23	He told them, 
MAT.20.24	When the ten disciples heard this, they became indignant with the two brothers. 
MAT.20.25	Jesus called them over and said, 
MAT.20.29	As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed him.
MAT.20.30	There were two blind men sitting by the road. When they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 
MAT.20.31	The crowd demanded that they keep quiet, but they cried out all the more, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!” 
MAT.20.32	Jesus stopped, called them, and said, 
MAT.20.33	“Lord,” they said to him, “open our eyes.” 
MAT.20.34	Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. Immediately they could see, and they followed him.
MAT.21.1	When they approached Jerusalem
MAT.21.2	telling them, 
MAT.21.4	This took place so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled:
MAT.21.6	The disciples went and did just as Jesus directed them. 
MAT.21.7	They brought the donkey and its colt; then they laid their clothes on them, and he sat on them. 
MAT.21.8	A very large crowd spread their clothes on the road; others were cutting branches from the trees and spreading them on the road. 
MAT.21.9	Then the crowds who went ahead of him and those who followed shouted:
MAT.21.10	When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar, saying, “Who is this?” 
MAT.21.11	The crowds were saying, “This is the prophet Jesus
MAT.21.12	Jesus went into the temple
MAT.21.13	He said to them, 
MAT.21.14	The blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. 
MAT.21.15	When the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonders that he did and the children shouting in the temple,” 
MAT.21.16	and said to him, “Do you hear what these children are saying?”
MAT.21.16	Jesus replied, 
MAT.21.17	Then he left them, went out of the city to Bethany,
MAT.21.18	Early in the morning,
MAT.21.19	Seeing a lone fig tree by the road, he went up to it and found nothing on it except leaves. And he said to it, 
MAT.21.20	When the disciples saw it, they were amazed and said, “How did the fig tree wither so quickly?”
MAT.21.21	Jesus answered them, 
MAT.21.23	When he entered the temple,
MAT.21.24	Jesus answered them, 
MAT.21.25	They discussed it among themselves, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him? ’ 
MAT.21.26	But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ we’re afraid of the crowd,
MAT.21.27	So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
MAT.21.27	And he said to them, 
MAT.21.31	They said, “The first.”
MAT.21.31	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.41	“He will completely destroy those terrible men,” they told him, “and lease his vineyard to other farmers who will give him his fruit at the harvest.”
MAT.21.42	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables,
MAT.21.46	Although they were looking for a way to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because the people regarded him as a prophet.
MAT.22.1	Once more Jesus spoke to them in parables: 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to trap him by what he said.
MAT.22.16	So they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians.
MAT.22.17	Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar
MAT.22.18	Perceiving their malicious intent, Jesus said, 
MAT.22.19	 They brought him a denarius.
MAT.22.20	 he asked them.
MAT.22.21	“Caesar’s,” they said to him.
MAT.22.21	Then he said to them, 
MAT.22.22	When they heard this, they were amazed. So they left him and went away.
MAT.22.23	That same day some Sadducees,
MAT.22.24	“Teacher, Moses said, 
MAT.22.25	Now there were seven brothers among us. The first got married and died. Having no offspring, he left his wife to his brother. 
MAT.22.26	The same thing happened to the second also, and the third, and so on to all seven. 
MAT.22.27	Last of all, the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	In the resurrection, then, whose wife will she be of the seven? For they all had married her.”
MAT.22.29	Jesus answered them, 
MAT.22.33	And when the crowds heard this, they were astonished at his teaching.
MAT.22.34	When
MAT.22.35	And one of them, an expert in the law, asked a question to test him:
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which command in the law is the greatest?”
MAT.22.37	He said to him, 
MAT.22.41	While the Pharisees were together, Jesus questioned them,
MAT.22.42	They replied, “David’s.”
MAT.22.43	He asked them, 
MAT.22.46	No one was able to answer him at all,
MAT.23.1	Then
MAT.24.1	As Jesus left and was going out of the temple,
MAT.24.2	He replied to them, 
MAT.24.3	While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him privately and said, “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what is the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” 
MAT.24.4	Jesus replied to them: 
MAT.26.1	When Jesus had finished saying all these things,
MAT.26.3	Then the chief priests
MAT.26.4	and they conspired to arrest Jesus in a treacherous way and kill him.
MAT.26.5	“Not during the festival,” they said, “so there won’t be rioting among the people.”
MAT.26.6	While Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon
MAT.26.7	a woman approached him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on his head as he was reclining at the table. 
MAT.26.8	When the disciples
MAT.26.9	“This might have been sold for a great deal and given to the poor.”
MAT.26.10	Aware of this, Jesus said to them, 
MAT.26.14	Then
MAT.26.15	and said, “What are you willing to give me if I hand him over to you?” So they weighed out thirty pieces of silver for him.
MAT.26.16	And from that time he started looking for a good opportunity to betray him.
MAT.26.17	On the first day of Unleavened Bread
MAT.26.19	So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them and prepared the Passover. 
MAT.26.20	When evening came, he was reclining at the table with the Twelve. 
MAT.26.21	While they were eating, he said, 
MAT.26.22	Deeply distressed, each one began to say to him, “Surely not I, Lord?”
MAT.26.23	He replied, 
MAT.26.25	Judas, his betrayer, replied, “Surely not I, Rabbi?” 
MAT.26.26	As they were eating,
MAT.26.27	Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks, he gave it to them and said, 
MAT.26.30	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.26.33	Peter told him, “Even if everyone falls away because of you, I will never fall away.”
MAT.26.35	“Even if I have to die with you,” Peter told him, “I will never deny you,” and all the disciples said the same thing.
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane,
MAT.26.37	Taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
MAT.26.38	He said to them, 
MAT.26.39	Going a little farther,
MAT.26.40	Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He asked Peter, 
MAT.26.42	Again, a second time, he went away and prayed, 
MAT.26.43	And he came again and found them sleeping, because they could not keep their eyes open.
MAT.26.44	After leaving them, he went away again and prayed a third time, saying the same thing once more. 
MAT.26.45	Then he came to the disciples and said to them, 
MAT.26.47	While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, suddenly arrived.
MAT.26.48	His betrayer had given them a sign: “The one I kiss, he’s the one; arrest him.” 
MAT.26.49	So immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Rabbi!” and kissed him.
MAT.26.50	Then they came up, took hold of Jesus, and arrested him. 
MAT.26.51	At that moment one of those with Jesus reached out his hand and drew his sword. He struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his ear.
MAT.26.52	Then Jesus told him, 
MAT.26.55	At that time Jesus said to the crowds, 
MAT.26.57	Those
MAT.26.58	Peter was following him at a distance right to the high priest’s courtyard. He went in and was sitting with the servants to see the outcome.
MAT.26.59	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death,
MAT.26.60	but they could not find any, even though many false witnesses
MAT.26.61	stated, “This man said, ‘I can destroy the temple of God
MAT.26.62	The high priest stood up and said to him, “Don’t you have an answer to what these men are testifying against you?” 
MAT.26.63	But
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has blasphemed!
MAT.26.66	What is your decision?”
MAT.26.66	They answered, “He deserves death!” 
MAT.26.67	Then they spat in his face
MAT.26.68	and said, “Prophesy to us, Messiah! Who was it that hit you?” 
MAT.26.69	Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard.
MAT.26.70	But he denied it in front of everyone: “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
MAT.26.71	When he had gone out to the gateway, another woman saw him and told those who were there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene!” 
MAT.26.72	And again he denied it with an oath:
MAT.26.73	After a little while those standing there approached and said to Peter, “You really are one of them, since even your accent
MAT.26.74	Then he started to curse and to swear with an oath, “I don’t know the man!” Immediately a rooster crowed, 
MAT.26.75	and Peter remembered the words Jesus had spoken, 
MAT.27.1	When daybreak came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to put him to death.
MAT.27.2	After tying him up, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate,
MAT.27.3	Then Judas, his betrayer, seeing that Jesus had been condemned, was full of remorse and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders.
MAT.27.4	“I have sinned by betraying innocent blood,” he said.
MAT.27.4	“What’s that to us?” they said. “See to it yourself!” 
MAT.27.5	So he threw the silver into the temple
MAT.27.6	The chief priests took the silver and said, “It’s not permitted
MAT.27.7	They conferred together and bought the potter’s field with it as a burial place for foreigners. 
MAT.27.8	Therefore that field has been called “Blood Field” to this day. 
MAT.27.9	Then what was spoken through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:
MAT.27.11	Now Jesus stood before the governor.
MAT.27.11	Jesus answered, 
MAT.27.12	While he was being accused by the chief priests and elders, he didn’t answer.
MAT.27.13	Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how much they are testifying against you?” 
MAT.27.14	But he didn’t answer him on even one charge, so that the governor was quite amazed.
MAT.27.15	At the festival
MAT.27.16	At that time they had a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.
MAT.27.17	So when they had gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Who is it you want me to release for you — Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?” 
MAT.27.18	For he knew it was because of envy that they had handed him over.
MAT.27.19	While he was sitting on the judge’s bench, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for today I’ve suffered terribly in a dream because of him.”
MAT.27.20	The chief priests and the elders, however, persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to execute Jesus. 
MAT.27.21	The governor asked them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?”
MAT.27.21	“Barabbas!” they answered.
MAT.27.22	Pilate asked them, “What should I do then with Jesus, who is called Christ?”
MAT.27.22	They all answered, “Crucify him!” 
MAT.27.23	Then he said, “Why? What has he done wrong?”
MAT.27.23	But they kept shouting all the more, “Crucify him!” 
MAT.27.24	When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was starting instead, he took some water, washed his hands in front of the crowd, and said, “I am innocent of this man’s blood.
MAT.27.25	All the people answered, “His blood be on us
MAT.27.26	Then he released Barabbas to them and, after having Jesus flogged, handed him over to be crucified.
MAT.27.27	Then
MAT.27.28	They stripped him and dressed him in a scarlet robe.
MAT.27.29	They twisted together a crown of thorns, put it on his head, and placed a staff in his right hand. And they knelt down before him and mocked him: “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MAT.27.30	Then they spat on him, took the staff, and kept hitting him on the head. 
MAT.27.31	After they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.
MAT.27.32	As they were going out, they found a Cyrenian man named Simon. They forced him to carry his cross.
MAT.27.33	When they came to a place called 
MAT.27.34	they gave him wine
MAT.27.35	After crucifying him, they divided his clothes by casting lots.
MAT.27.36	Then they sat down and were guarding him there. 
MAT.27.37	Above his head they put up the charge against him in writing: T
MAT.27.38	Then two criminals
MAT.27.39	Those who passed by were yelling insults at
MAT.27.40	and saying, “You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!” 
MAT.27.41	In the same way the chief priests, with the scribes and elders,
MAT.27.42	“He saved others, but he cannot save himself! He is the King of Israel!
MAT.27.43	He trusts in God; let God rescue him now — if he takes pleasure in him!
MAT.27.44	In the same way even the criminals who were crucified with him taunted him.
MAT.27.45	From noon until three in the afternoon
MAT.27.46	About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 
MAT.27.47	When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “He’s calling for Elijah.”
MAT.27.48	Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and offered him a drink.
MAT.27.49	But the rest said, “Let’s see if Elijah comes to save him.”
MAT.27.50	But Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.
MAT.27.51	Suddenly, the curtain of the sanctuary
MAT.27.52	The tombs were also opened
MAT.27.53	And they came out of the tombs after his resurrection, entered the holy city, and appeared to many.
MAT.27.54	When the centurion and those with him, who were keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were terrified and said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!” 
MAT.27.55	Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and looked after him were there, watching from a distance.
MAT.27.56	Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee’s sons.
MAT.27.57	When it was evening,
MAT.27.58	He approached Pilate and asked for Jesus’s body. Then Pilate ordered that it
MAT.27.59	So Joseph took the body, wrapped it in clean, fine linen, 
MAT.27.60	and placed it in his new tomb, which he had cut into the rock. He left after rolling a great stone against the entrance of the tomb.
MAT.27.61	Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were seated there, facing the tomb.
MAT.27.62	The next day, which followed the preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate
MAT.27.63	and said, “Sir, we remember that while this deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise again.’
MAT.27.64	So give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples
MAT.27.65	“You have
MAT.27.66	They went and secured the tomb by setting a seal on the stone and placing the guard.
MAT.28.1	After the Sabbath,
MAT.28.2	There was a violent earthquake, because an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and approached the tomb. He rolled back the stone and was sitting on it.
MAT.28.3	His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.
MAT.28.4	The guards were so shaken by fear of him that they became like dead men.
MAT.28.5	The angel told the women, “Don’t be afraid, because I know you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.
MAT.28.6	He is not here. For he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay.
MAT.28.7	Then go quickly and tell his disciples,
MAT.28.8	So, departing quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to tell his disciples the news. 
MAT.28.9	Just then
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus told them, 
MAT.28.11	As they were on their way, some of the guards came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened. 
MAT.28.12	After the priests
MAT.28.13	and told them, “Say this, ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’ 
MAT.28.14	If this reaches the governor’s ears, we will deal with
MAT.28.15	They took the money and did as they were instructed, and this story has been spread among Jewish people to this day.
MAT.28.16	The eleven disciples traveled to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
MAT.28.17	When they saw him, they worshiped,
MAT.28.18	Jesus came near and said to them, 
MRK.1.1	The beginning
MRK.1.2	As it is written in Isaiah
MRK.1.4	John came baptizing
MRK.1.5	The whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem
MRK.1.6	John wore a camel-hair garment with a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts
MRK.1.7	He proclaimed, “One who is more powerful
MRK.1.8	I baptize you with
MRK.1.9	In
MRK.1.10	As soon as he came up out of the water, he saw the heavens
MRK.1.11	And a voice
MRK.1.12	Immediately
MRK.1.13	He was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted
MRK.1.14	After
MRK.1.16	As
MRK.1.18	Immediately they left their nets and followed
MRK.1.19	Going on a little farther, he saw James
MRK.1.20	Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
MRK.1.21	They
MRK.1.22	They were astonished
MRK.1.23	Just then a man with an unclean
MRK.1.24	“What do you have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?
MRK.1.25	Jesus rebuked
MRK.1.26	And the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions,
MRK.1.27	They were all amazed,
MRK.1.28	At once the news about him spread throughout the entire vicinity of Galilee.
MRK.1.29	As
MRK.1.30	Simon’s mother-in-law was lying in bed with a fever, and they told him about her at once. 
MRK.1.31	So he went to her, took her by the hand, and raised her up.
MRK.1.32	When
MRK.1.33	The whole town was assembled at the door, 
MRK.1.34	and he healed
MRK.1.35	Very
MRK.1.36	Simon
MRK.1.37	and when they found him they said, “Everyone is looking for you.”
MRK.1.38	And he said to them, 
MRK.1.39	He went into all of Galilee,
MRK.1.40	Then
MRK.1.41	Moved with compassion,
MRK.1.42	Immediately the leprosy
MRK.1.43	Then he sternly warned
MRK.1.44	telling him, 
MRK.1.45	Yet he went out and began to proclaim
MRK.2.1	When
MRK.2.2	So many people gathered together that there was no more room, not even in the doorway, and he was speaking the word
MRK.2.3	They came to him bringing a paralytic,
MRK.2.4	Since they were not able to bring him to
MRK.2.5	Seeing their faith,
MRK.2.6	But some of the scribes
MRK.2.7	“Why does he speak like this? He’s blaspheming!
MRK.2.8	Right away
MRK.2.12	Immediately he got up, took the mat, and went out in front of everyone. As a result, they were all astounded
MRK.2.13	Jesus
MRK.2.14	Then, passing by, he saw Levi
MRK.2.15	While he was reclining at the table in Levi’s house, many tax collectors
MRK.2.16	When the scribes
MRK.2.17	When Jesus heard this, he told them, 
MRK.2.18	Now
MRK.2.19	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.2.23	On
MRK.2.24	The Pharisees
MRK.2.25	He said to them, 
MRK.2.27	Then he told them, 
MRK.3.1	Jesus
MRK.3.2	In order to accuse
MRK.3.3	He told the man with the shriveled hand, 
MRK.3.4	Then he said to them, 
MRK.3.5	After looking around at them with anger,
MRK.3.6	Immediately the Pharisees
MRK.3.7	Jesus
MRK.3.8	Jerusalem,
MRK.3.9	Then he told his disciples to have a small boat
MRK.3.10	Since he had healed
MRK.3.11	Whenever the unclean
MRK.3.12	And he would strongly warn
MRK.3.13	Jesus
MRK.3.14	He appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles,
MRK.3.15	and to have authority to
MRK.3.16	He appointed the Twelve:
MRK.3.17	and to James
MRK.3.18	Andrew;
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot,
MRK.3.20	Jesus entered a house, and the crowd gathered again so that they were not even able to eat.
MRK.3.21	When his family
MRK.3.22	The scribes
MRK.3.23	So he summoned
MRK.3.30	because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”
MRK.3.31	His
MRK.3.32	A crowd was sitting around him and told him, “Look, your mother, your brothers,
MRK.3.33	He replied to them, 
MRK.3.34	Looking at those sitting in a circle around him, he said, 
MRK.4.1	Again
MRK.4.2	He taught them many things in parables,
MRK.4.9	Then he said, 
MRK.4.10	When he was alone, those around him with the Twelve,
MRK.4.11	He answered them, 
MRK.4.13	Then
MRK.4.21	He
MRK.4.24	And he said to them, 
MRK.4.30	And
MRK.4.33	He was speaking the word
MRK.4.34	He did not speak to them without a parable. Privately, however, he explained everything to his own disciples.
MRK.4.35	On
MRK.4.36	So they left the crowd and took him along since he was in the boat. And other boats were with him. 
MRK.4.37	A great windstorm
MRK.4.38	He was in the stern, sleeping
MRK.4.39	He got up, rebuked
MRK.4.40	Then he said to them, 
MRK.4.41	And they were terrified
MRK.5.1	They
MRK.5.2	As soon as he got out of the boat, a man with an unclean
MRK.5.3	He lived in the tombs,
MRK.5.4	because he often had been bound with shackles and chains, but had torn the chains apart and smashed
MRK.5.5	Night
MRK.5.6	When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him. 
MRK.5.7	And he cried out with a loud voice, “What do you have to do with me, Jesus, Son
MRK.5.8	For he had told him, 
MRK.5.9	“My name is Legion,”
MRK.5.10	And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the region.
MRK.5.11	A large herd of pigs
MRK.5.12	The demons
MRK.5.13	So he gave them permission, and the unclean
MRK.5.14	The men who tended them
MRK.5.15	They came to Jesus and saw the man who had been demon-possessed,
MRK.5.16	Those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed
MRK.5.17	Then they began to beg him to leave their region.
MRK.5.18	As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged him earnestly that he might remain with him. 
MRK.5.19	Jesus did not let him but told him, 
MRK.5.20	So he went out and began to proclaim
MRK.5.21	When
MRK.5.22	One of the synagogue leaders, named Jairus,
MRK.5.23	and begged him earnestly, “My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on
MRK.5.24	So Jesus went with him, and a large crowd was following and pressing against him.
MRK.5.25	Now a woman suffering from bleeding
MRK.5.26	had endured
MRK.5.27	Having heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched
MRK.5.28	For she said, “If I just touch his clothes, I’ll be made well.”
MRK.5.29	Instantly her flow of blood ceased, and she sensed in her body that she was healed
MRK.5.30	At once Jesus realized in himself that power
MRK.5.31	His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing against you, and yet you say, 
MRK.5.32	But he was looking around to see who had done this. 
MRK.5.33	The woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down
MRK.5.34	 he said to her, 
MRK.5.35	While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue leader’s house and said, “Your daughter is dead. Why bother the teacher
MRK.5.36	When Jesus overheard
MRK.5.37	He did not let anyone accompany him except Peter,
MRK.5.38	They came to the leader’s house, and he saw a commotion — people weeping and wailing loudly. 
MRK.5.39	He went in and said to them, 
MRK.5.40	They laughed at him, but he put them all outside. He took the child’s father,
MRK.5.41	Then he took the child
MRK.5.42	Immediately the girl got up
MRK.5.43	Then he gave them strict orders that no one should know about this
MRK.6.1	He
MRK.6.2	When the Sabbath
MRK.6.3	Isn’t this the carpenter,
MRK.6.4	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.6.5	He was not able to do a miracle
MRK.6.6	And he was amazed
MRK.6.7	He
MRK.6.8	He instructed them to take nothing for the road except a staff — no bread, no traveling bag,
MRK.6.9	but to wear sandals and not put on an extra shirt.
MRK.6.10	He said to them, 
MRK.6.12	So they went out and preached
MRK.6.13	They drove out many demons,
MRK.6.14	King
MRK.6.15	But others said, “He’s Elijah.”
MRK.6.16	When Herod
MRK.6.17	For
MRK.6.18	John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful
MRK.6.19	So Herodias held a grudge against him and wanted to kill
MRK.6.20	because Herod feared
MRK.6.21	An opportune time came on his birthday, when Herod gave a banquet
MRK.6.22	When Herodias’s own daughter
MRK.6.23	He promised her with an
MRK.6.24	She went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?”
MRK.6.24	“John the Baptist’s
MRK.6.25	At once she hurried to the king and said, “I want you to give me John the Baptist’s
MRK.6.26	Although the king was deeply distressed,
MRK.6.27	The king immediately sent for an executioner and commanded him to bring John’s head. So he went and beheaded him in prison, 
MRK.6.28	brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	When John’s disciples
MRK.6.30	The
MRK.6.31	He said to them, 
MRK.6.32	So they went away in the boat by themselves to a remote place, 
MRK.6.33	but many saw them leaving and recognized them, and they ran on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.
MRK.6.34	When he went ashore, he saw a large crowd and had compassion
MRK.6.35	When it grew late, his disciples
MRK.6.36	Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages to buy themselves something to eat.”
MRK.6.37	They said to him, “Should we go and buy two hundred denarii
MRK.6.38	He asked them, 
MRK.6.38	When they found out they said, “Five, and two fish.” 
MRK.6.39	Then he instructed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties. 
MRK.6.41	He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves. He kept giving them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all. 
MRK.6.42	Everyone ate and was satisfied.
MRK.6.43	They picked up twelve baskets full of pieces of bread and fish. 
MRK.6.44	Now those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.
MRK.6.45	Immediately
MRK.6.46	After he said good-bye to them, he went away to the mountain
MRK.6.47	Well into the night, the boat was in the middle of the sea, and he was alone on the land. 
MRK.6.48	He saw them straining
MRK.6.49	When they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost
MRK.6.50	because they all saw him and were terrified.
MRK.6.51	Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. They were completely astounded, 
MRK.6.52	because they had not understood about the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.
MRK.6.53	When they had crossed over, they came to shore at Gennesaret
MRK.6.54	As they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized him. 
MRK.6.55	They hurried throughout that region and began to carry the sick
MRK.6.56	Wherever he went, into villages, towns, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and begged him that they might touch just the end
MRK.7.1	The
MRK.7.2	They observed that some of his disciples were eating bread with unclean
MRK.7.3	(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing, keeping the tradition of the elders. 
MRK.7.4	When they come from the marketplace,
MRK.7.5	So the Pharisees
MRK.7.6	He answered them, 
MRK.7.9	He also said to them, 
MRK.7.14	Summoning
MRK.7.17	When he went into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable. 
MRK.7.18	He said to them, 
MRK.7.20	And he said, 
MRK.7.24	He got up and departed from
MRK.7.25	Instead, immediately after hearing about him, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit
MRK.7.26	The woman was a Gentile,
MRK.7.27	He said to her, 
MRK.7.28	But she replied to him, “Lord,
MRK.7.29	Then he told her, 
MRK.7.30	When she went back to her home, she found her child lying on the bed, and the demon was gone.
MRK.7.31	Again, leaving the region of Tyre,
MRK.7.32	They brought to him a deaf
MRK.7.33	So he took him away from the crowd in private. After putting his fingers in the man’s ears and spitting,
MRK.7.34	Looking up to heaven,
MRK.7.35	Immediately his ears were opened,
MRK.7.36	He ordered them to tell no one,
MRK.7.37	They were extremely astonished and said, “He has done everything well.
MRK.8.1	In
MRK.8.4	His disciples answered him, “Where can anyone get enough bread here in this desolate place to feed
MRK.8.5	“Seven,” they said. 
MRK.8.6	He commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground. Taking the seven loaves, he gave thanks, broke
MRK.8.7	They also had a few small fish, and after he had blessed them, he said these were to be served as well. 
MRK.8.8	They ate and were satisfied. Then they collected seven large baskets of leftover pieces. 
MRK.8.9	About four thousand were there. He dismissed them. 
MRK.8.10	And he immediately got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	The
MRK.8.12	Sighing deeply in his spirit,
MRK.8.13	Then he left them, got back into the boat, and went to the other side.
MRK.8.14	The disciples had forgotten to take bread and had only one loaf with them in the boat. 
MRK.8.15	Then
MRK.8.16	They were discussing among themselves that they did not have any bread. 
MRK.8.17	Aware of this, he said to them, 
MRK.8.19	“Twelve,” they told him.
MRK.8.20	“Seven,” they said.
MRK.8.21	And he said to them, 
MRK.8.22	They came to Bethsaida.
MRK.8.23	He took the blind man by the hand and brought him out of the village. Spitting
MRK.8.24	He looked up and said, “I see people — they look like trees walking.”
MRK.8.25	Again Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes. The man looked intently and his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly. 
MRK.8.26	Then he sent
MRK.8.27	Jesus
MRK.8.28	They answered him, “John the Baptist;
MRK.8.29	Peter
MRK.8.30	And he strictly warned
MRK.8.31	Then
MRK.8.32	He spoke openly about this. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. 
MRK.8.33	But turning around and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, 
MRK.8.34	Calling the crowd along with his disciples, he said to them, 
MRK.9.1	Then he said to them, 
MRK.9.2	After
MRK.9.3	and his clothes
MRK.9.4	Elijah
MRK.9.5	Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi,
MRK.9.6	because he did not know what to say,
MRK.9.7	A cloud
MRK.9.8	Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
MRK.9.9	As
MRK.9.10	They kept this word
MRK.9.11	Then they asked him, “Why do the scribes
MRK.9.14	When
MRK.9.15	When the whole crowd saw him, they were amazed and ran to greet him. 
MRK.9.16	He asked them, 
MRK.9.17	Someone from the crowd answered him, “Teacher,
MRK.9.18	Whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn’t.”
MRK.9.19	He replied to them, 
MRK.9.20	So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw him, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. He fell to the ground and rolled around, foaming at the mouth. 
MRK.9.21	 Jesus asked his father.
MRK.9.21	“From childhood,” he said. 
MRK.9.22	“And many times it has thrown him into fire or water to destroy
MRK.9.23	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.9.24	Immediately the father of the boy cried out, “I do believe; help my unbelief!”
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he rebuked
MRK.9.26	Then it came out, shrieking and throwing him
MRK.9.27	But Jesus, taking him by the hand, raised him,
MRK.9.28	After he had gone into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why couldn’t we drive it out?”
MRK.9.29	And he told them, 
MRK.9.30	Then
MRK.9.31	For he was teaching
MRK.9.32	But they did not understand this statement, and they were afraid to ask him.
MRK.9.33	They
MRK.9.34	But they were silent,
MRK.9.35	Sitting down, he called the Twelve
MRK.9.36	He took a child,
MRK.9.38	John
MRK.10.1	He
MRK.10.2	Some Pharisees
MRK.10.3	He replied to them, 
MRK.10.4	They said, “Moses permitted us to write divorce papers
MRK.10.5	But Jesus told them, 
MRK.10.10	When they were in the house again, the disciples questioned him about this matter. 
MRK.10.11	He said to them, 
MRK.10.13	People
MRK.10.14	When Jesus saw it, he was indignant
MRK.10.16	After taking them in his arms, he laid his hands on
MRK.10.17	As
MRK.10.20	He said to him, “Teacher,
MRK.10.21	Looking at him, Jesus loved him
MRK.10.22	But he was dismayed by this demand, and he went away grieving,
MRK.10.23	Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, 
MRK.10.24	The disciples were astonished at his words. Again Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.26	They were even more astonished, saying to one another, “Then who can be saved?” 
MRK.10.27	Looking at them, Jesus said, 
MRK.10.28	Peter
MRK.10.32	They
MRK.10.35	James
MRK.10.37	They answered him, “Allow us to sit at your right and at your left in your glory.”
MRK.10.38	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.39	“We are able,” they told him.
MRK.10.39	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.41	When the ten disciples heard this, they began to be indignant with James and John.
MRK.10.42	Jesus called them over and said to them, 
MRK.10.46	They
MRK.10.47	When he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth,
MRK.10.48	Many warned him to keep quiet, but he was crying out all the more, “Have mercy on me,
MRK.10.49	Jesus stopped and said, 
MRK.10.49	So they called the blind man and said to him, “Have courage!
MRK.10.50	He threw off his coat,
MRK.10.51	Then Jesus answered him, 
MRK.10.52	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.11.1	When
MRK.11.2	and told them, 
MRK.11.4	So they went and found a colt outside in the street, tied by a door. They untied it, 
MRK.11.5	and some of those standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying the colt?” 
MRK.11.6	They answered them just as Jesus had said; so they let them go.
MRK.11.7	They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their clothes on it, and he sat on it. 
MRK.11.8	Many people spread their clothes on the road,
MRK.11.9	Those who went ahead and those who followed shouted:
MRK.11.10	Blessed is the coming kingdom
MRK.11.10	of our father David!
MRK.11.11	He went into Jerusalem
MRK.11.12	The
MRK.11.13	Seeing in the distance a fig
MRK.11.14	He said to it, 
MRK.11.15	They came to Jerusalem,
MRK.11.16	and would not permit anyone to carry goods through the temple. 
MRK.11.17	He was teaching them: 
MRK.11.18	The chief priests and the scribes
MRK.11.19	Whenever evening came, they would go out of the city.
MRK.11.20	Early
MRK.11.21	Then Peter
MRK.11.22	Jesus replied to them, 
MRK.11.27	They
MRK.11.28	and asked him, “By what authority
MRK.11.29	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.11.31	They discussed it among themselves: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe
MRK.11.32	But if we say, ‘Of human origin’” — they were afraid of the crowd, because everyone thought that John was truly a prophet.
MRK.11.33	So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
MRK.11.33	And Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.1	He
MRK.12.12	They were looking for a way to arrest him but feared the crowd because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. So they left him and went away.
MRK.12.13	Then
MRK.12.14	When they came, they said to him, “Teacher, we know you are truthful and don’t care what anyone thinks, nor do you show partiality
MRK.12.15	But knowing their hypocrisy,
MRK.12.16	They brought a coin. 
MRK.12.16	“Caesar’s,” they replied.
MRK.12.17	Jesus told them, 
MRK.12.18	Sadducees,
MRK.12.19	“Teacher,
MRK.12.20	There were seven brothers. The first married a woman, and dying, left no offspring. 
MRK.12.21	The second also took her, and he died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise. 
MRK.12.22	None of the seven
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection, when they rise,
MRK.12.24	Jesus spoke to them, 
MRK.12.28	One
MRK.12.29	Jesus answered, 
MRK.12.32	Then the scribe said to him, “You are right, teacher. You have correctly said that he is one, and there is no one
MRK.12.33	And to love
MRK.12.34	When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, 
MRK.12.35	While
MRK.12.38	He
MRK.12.41	Sitting
MRK.12.42	Then a poor
MRK.12.43	Summoning his disciples,
MRK.13.1	As
MRK.13.2	Jesus said to him, 
MRK.13.3	While he was sitting on the Mount of Olives
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished?”
MRK.13.5	Jesus told them, 
MRK.14.1	It
MRK.14.2	“Not during the festival,” they said, “so that there won’t be a riot among the people.”
MRK.14.3	While
MRK.14.4	But some were expressing indignation to one another: “Why has this perfume been wasted? 
MRK.14.5	For this perfume might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii
MRK.14.6	Jesus replied, 
MRK.14.10	Then
MRK.14.11	And when they heard this, they were glad and promised to give him money.
MRK.14.12	On
MRK.14.13	So he sent two of his disciples and told them, 
MRK.14.16	So the disciples
MRK.14.17	When
MRK.14.18	While they were reclining and eating, Jesus said, 
MRK.14.19	They began to be distressed and to say to him one by one, “Surely not I?”
MRK.14.20	He said to them, 
MRK.14.22	As
MRK.14.23	Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks,
MRK.14.24	He said to them, 
MRK.14.26	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	Then
MRK.14.29	Peter
MRK.14.31	But he kept insisting, “If I have to die with you, I will never deny you.” And they all said the same thing.
MRK.14.32	Then
MRK.14.33	He took Peter,
MRK.14.34	He said to them, 
MRK.14.35	He went a little farther, fell to the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour
MRK.14.36	And he said, 
MRK.14.37	Then he came and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, 
MRK.14.39	Once again he went away and prayed, saying the same thing. 
MRK.14.40	And again he came and found them sleeping, because they could not keep their eyes open. They did not know what to say to him.
MRK.14.41	Then he came a third time and said to them, 
MRK.14.43	While
MRK.14.44	His betrayer had given them a signal. “The one I kiss,” he said, “he’s the one; arrest him and take him away under guard.” 
MRK.14.45	So when he came, immediately he went up to Jesus and said, “Rabbi!” 
MRK.14.46	They took hold of him and arrested him. 
MRK.14.47	One of those who stood by drew his sword, struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his ear.
MRK.14.48	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.14.50	Then they all deserted him and ran away.
MRK.14.51	Now a certain young man, wearing nothing but a linen cloth, was following him. They caught hold of him, 
MRK.14.52	but he left the linen cloth behind and ran away naked.
MRK.14.53	They
MRK.14.54	Peter
MRK.14.55	The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin
MRK.14.56	For many were giving false testimony
MRK.14.57	Some stood up and gave false testimony against him, stating, 
MRK.14.58	“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with human hands,
MRK.14.59	Yet their testimony did not agree
MRK.14.60	Then the high priest stood up before them all and questioned Jesus, “Don’t you have an answer to what these men are testifying against you?” 
MRK.14.61	But he kept silent and did not answer.
MRK.14.63	Then the high priest
MRK.14.64	You have heard the blasphemy.
MRK.14.65	Then some began to spit on him, to blindfold him, and to beat him, saying, “Prophesy!” 
MRK.14.66	While
MRK.14.67	When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, “You also were with Jesus, the man from Nazareth.”
MRK.14.68	But he denied it: “I don’t know or understand what you’re talking about.” Then he went out to the entryway,
MRK.14.69	When the maidservant saw him again, she began to tell those standing nearby, “This man is one of them.”
MRK.14.70	But again he denied it. After a little while those standing there said to Peter again, “You certainly are one of them, since you’re also a Galilean.”
MRK.14.71	Then he started to curse and swear,
MRK.14.72	Immediately a rooster crowed a second time,
MRK.15.1	As
MRK.15.2	So Pilate asked him, “Are you the King
MRK.15.2	He answered him, 
MRK.15.3	And the chief priests accused him of many things. 
MRK.15.4	Pilate
MRK.15.5	But Jesus still did not answer, and so Pilate was amazed.
MRK.15.6	At
MRK.15.7	There was one named Barabbas, who was in prison with rebels who had committed murder
MRK.15.8	The crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do for them as was his custom. 
MRK.15.9	Pilate answered them, “Do you want me to release the King
MRK.15.10	For he knew it was because of envy
MRK.15.11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd so that he would release Barabbas to them instead. 
MRK.15.12	Pilate asked them again, “Then what do you want me to do with the one you call the King of the Jews?”
MRK.15.13	Again they shouted, “Crucify him!”
MRK.15.14	Pilate said to them, “Why? What has he done wrong?”
MRK.15.14	But they shouted all the more, “Crucify him!”
MRK.15.15	Wanting to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them; and after having Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.
MRK.15.16	The
MRK.15.17	They dressed him in a purple
MRK.15.18	And they began to salute him, “Hail,
MRK.15.19	They were hitting him on the head with a stick and spitting on him. Getting down on their knees,
MRK.15.20	After they had mocked
MRK.15.20	They led him out to crucify him. 
MRK.15.21	They
MRK.15.22	They
MRK.15.23	They tried to give him wine
MRK.15.24	Then they crucified him and divided his clothes, casting lots
MRK.15.25	Now it was nine in the morning
MRK.15.26	The inscription of the charge written against him was: T
MRK.15.27	They
MRK.15.29	Those
MRK.15.30	save yourself by coming down from the cross!”
MRK.15.31	In the same way, the chief priests with the scribes
MRK.15.32	Let the Messiah,
MRK.15.33	When
MRK.15.34	And at three Jesus cried out with a loud voice, 
MRK.15.35	When some of those standing there heard this, they said, “See, he’s calling for Elijah.”
MRK.15.36	Someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, fixed it on a stick, offered him a drink,
MRK.15.37	Jesus let out a loud cry and breathed his last. 
MRK.15.38	Then the curtain
MRK.15.39	When the centurion, who was standing opposite him, saw the way he
MRK.15.40	There
MRK.15.41	In Galilee
MRK.15.42	When
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the Sanhedrin who was himself looking forward
MRK.15.44	Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. Summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he had already died. 
MRK.15.45	When he found out from the centurion, he gave the corpse to Joseph. 
MRK.15.46	After he bought some linen cloth, Joseph took him down and wrapped him in the linen. Then he laid him in a tomb
MRK.15.47	Mary Magdalene
MRK.16.1	When
MRK.16.2	Very early in the morning, on the first day of the week,
MRK.16.3	They were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone from the entrance to the tomb for us?” 
MRK.16.4	Looking up, they noticed that the stone — which was very large — had been rolled away.
MRK.16.5	When
MRK.16.6	“Don’t be alarmed,” he told them. “You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth,
MRK.16.7	But go, tell his disciples and Peter,
MRK.16.8	They went out and ran from the tomb,
MRK.16.8	[Some of the earliest mss conclude with 16:8.]
MRK.16.8	[ 
MRK.16.9	Early
MRK.16.10	She went and reported to those who had been with him, as they were mourning and weeping. 
MRK.16.11	Yet, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.
MRK.16.12	After this, he appeared
MRK.16.13	And they went and reported it to the rest, who did not believe them either.
MRK.16.14	Later he appeared to the Eleven
MRK.16.15	Then
MRK.16.19	So the Lord Jesus, after speaking to them,
MRK.16.20	And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the accompanying signs.]
LUK.1.1	Many have undertaken to compile a narrative about the events that have been fulfilled
LUK.1.2	just as the original eyewitnesses
LUK.1.3	It also seemed good to me, since I have carefully investigated everything from the very first, to write to you in an orderly sequence, most honorable
LUK.1.4	so that you may know the certainty of the things about which you have been instructed.
LUK.1.5	In the days of King Herod
LUK.1.6	Both were righteous in God’s sight,
LUK.1.7	But they had no children because Elizabeth could not conceive, and both of them were well along in years.
LUK.1.8	When his division was on duty
LUK.1.9	it happened that he was chosen by lot,
LUK.1.10	At the hour of incense the whole assembly of the people was praying outside. 
LUK.1.11	An angel of the Lord
LUK.1.12	When Zechariah saw him, he was terrified and overcome with fear.
LUK.1.13	But the angel said to him: “Do not be afraid,
LUK.1.14	There will be joy and delight for you, and many will rejoice at his birth. 
LUK.1.15	For he will be great in the sight of the Lord and will never drink wine or beer.
LUK.1.16	He will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God.
LUK.1.17	And he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of fathers to their children,
LUK.1.18	“How can I know this?” Zechariah asked the angel. “For I am an old man, and my wife is well along in years.”
LUK.1.19	The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel,
LUK.1.20	Now listen. You will become silent and unable to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their proper time.”
LUK.1.21	Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah, amazed that he stayed so long in the sanctuary. 
LUK.1.22	When he did come out, he could not speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He was making signs to them
LUK.1.23	When the days of his ministry were completed, he went back home.
LUK.1.24	After these days his wife Elizabeth conceived and kept herself in seclusion for five months. She said, 
LUK.1.25	“The Lord has done this for me. He has looked with favor in these days to take away my disgrace
LUK.1.26	In the sixth month, the angel Gabriel
LUK.1.27	to a virgin engaged
LUK.1.28	And the angel came to her and said, “Greetings, favored woman! The Lord is with you.”
LUK.1.29	But she was deeply troubled
LUK.1.30	Then the angel told her: “Do not be afraid, Mary,
LUK.1.31	Now listen: You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.
LUK.1.32	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High,
LUK.1.33	He will reign over the house of Jacob
LUK.1.34	Mary asked the angel, “How can this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?” 
LUK.1.35	The angel replied to her: “The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
LUK.1.36	And consider your relative Elizabeth — even she has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called childless. 
LUK.1.37	For nothing will be impossible with God.”
LUK.1.38	“I am the Lord’s servant,” said Mary. “May it be done to me according to your word.” Then the angel left her.
LUK.1.39	In those days Mary set out and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judah 
LUK.1.40	where she entered Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped inside her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
LUK.1.42	Then she exclaimed with a loud cry: “Blessed are you among women, and your child will be blessed!
LUK.1.43	How could this happen to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? 
LUK.1.44	For you see, when the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby leaped for joy inside me. 
LUK.1.45	Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill what he has spoken to her!”
LUK.1.46	And Mary said:
LUK.1.46	My soul praises the greatness of
LUK.1.47	and my spirit rejoices
LUK.1.48	because he has looked with favor
LUK.1.48	on the humble condition of his servant.
LUK.1.48	Surely, from now on all generations
LUK.1.48	will call me blessed,
LUK.1.49	because the Mighty One
LUK.1.49	has done great things for me,
LUK.1.49	and his name
LUK.1.50	His mercy is from generation to generation
LUK.1.50	on those who fear him.
LUK.1.51	He has done a mighty deed with his arm;
LUK.1.51	he has scattered the proud
LUK.1.51	because of the thoughts of their hearts;
LUK.1.52	he has toppled the mighty from their thrones
LUK.1.52	and exalted the lowly.
LUK.1.53	He has satisfied the hungry with good things
LUK.1.53	and sent the rich away empty.
LUK.1.54	He has helped his servant Israel,
LUK.1.54	remembering his mercy
LUK.1.55	to Abraham and his descendants
LUK.1.55	just as he spoke to our ancestors.
LUK.1.56	And Mary stayed with her about three months; then she returned to her home.
LUK.1.57	Now the time had come for Elizabeth to give birth, and she had a son. 
LUK.1.58	Then her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown her his great mercy,
LUK.1.59	When they came to circumcise the child on the eighth day,
LUK.1.60	But his mother responded, “No. He will be called John.”
LUK.1.61	Then they said to her, “None of your relatives has that name.” 
LUK.1.62	So they motioned to his father
LUK.1.63	He asked for a writing tablet and wrote: “His name is John.” And they were all amazed. 
LUK.1.64	Immediately his mouth was opened
LUK.1.65	Fear came on all those who lived around them, and all these things were being talked about throughout the hill country of Judea. 
LUK.1.66	All who heard about him
LUK.1.67	Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit
LUK.1.68	Blessed is the Lord, the God of Israel,
LUK.1.68	because he has visited
LUK.1.68	and provided redemption for his people.
LUK.1.69	He has raised up a horn of salvation for us
LUK.1.69	in the house of his servant David,
LUK.1.70	just as he spoke by the mouth
LUK.1.70	of his holy prophets in ancient times;
LUK.1.71	salvation from our enemies
LUK.1.71	and from the hand of those who hate us.
LUK.1.72	He has dealt mercifully with our fathers
LUK.1.72	and remembered his holy covenant
LUK.1.73	the oath that he swore to our father Abraham.
LUK.1.73	He has given us the privilege,
LUK.1.74	since we have been rescued
LUK.1.74	from the hand of our enemies,
LUK.1.74	to serve him without fear
LUK.1.75	in holiness and righteousness
LUK.1.75	in his presence all our days.
LUK.1.76	And you, child, will be called
LUK.1.76	a prophet of the Most High,
LUK.1.76	for you will go before the Lord
LUK.1.76	to prepare his ways,
LUK.1.77	to give his people knowledge of salvation
LUK.1.77	through the forgiveness of their sins.
LUK.1.78	Because of our God’s merciful compassion,
LUK.1.78	the dawn from on high
LUK.1.79	to shine on those who live in darkness
LUK.1.79	and the shadow of death,
LUK.1.79	to guide our feet into the way of peace.
LUK.1.80	The child grew up and became spiritually strong,
LUK.2.1	In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus
LUK.2.2	This first registration took place while
LUK.2.3	So everyone went to be registered, each to his own town.
LUK.2.4	Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth
LUK.2.5	to be registered along with Mary, who was engaged to him
LUK.2.6	While they were there, the time came for her to give birth. 
LUK.2.7	Then she gave birth to her firstborn son, and she wrapped him tightly in cloth and laid him in a manger,
LUK.2.8	In the same region, shepherds were staying out in the fields and keeping watch at night over their flock. 
LUK.2.9	Then an angel of the Lord
LUK.2.10	But the angel said to them, “Don’t be afraid,
LUK.2.11	Today in the city of David a Savior
LUK.2.12	This will be the sign for you:
LUK.2.13	Suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host
LUK.2.14	Glory to God in the highest heaven,
LUK.2.14	and peace on earth
LUK.2.15	When the angels had left them and returned to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go straight to Bethlehem and see what has happened, which the Lord has made known to us.”
LUK.2.16	They hurried off and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby who was lying in the manger. 
LUK.2.17	After seeing them, they reported the message they were told about this child, 
LUK.2.18	and all who heard it were amazed
LUK.2.19	But Mary was treasuring up all these things in her heart
LUK.2.20	The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God
LUK.2.21	When the eight days were completed for his circumcision,
LUK.2.22	And when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were finished,
LUK.2.23	(just as it is written in the law of the Lord, 
LUK.2.24	and to offer a sacrifice (according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, 
LUK.2.25	There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout,
LUK.2.26	It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
LUK.2.27	Guided by the Spirit, he entered the temple. When the parents brought in the child Jesus to perform for him what was customary under the law, 
LUK.2.28	Simeon took him up in his arms, praised God, and said,
LUK.2.29	Now, Master,
LUK.2.29	you can dismiss your servant in peace,
LUK.2.29	as you promised.
LUK.2.30	For my eyes have seen your salvation.
LUK.2.31	You have prepared it
LUK.2.31	in the presence of all peoples —
LUK.2.32	a light for revelation to the Gentiles
LUK.2.32	and glory to your people Israel.
LUK.2.33	His father and mother
LUK.2.34	Then Simeon blessed them and told his mother Mary: “Indeed, this child is destined to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel
LUK.2.35	and a sword will pierce your own soul — that the thoughts
LUK.2.36	There was also a prophetess,
LUK.2.37	and was a widow for eighty-four years.
LUK.2.38	At that very moment,
LUK.2.39	When they had completed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.
LUK.2.40	The boy grew up and became strong, filled with wisdom, and God’s grace was on him.
LUK.2.41	Every year his parents traveled to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival.
LUK.2.42	When he was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the festival.
LUK.2.43	After those days were over,
LUK.2.44	Assuming he was in the traveling party, they went a day’s journey. Then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends. 
LUK.2.45	When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him. 
LUK.2.46	After three days, they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 
LUK.2.47	And all those who heard him were astounded at his understanding and his answers. 
LUK.2.48	When his parents saw him, they were astonished, and his mother said to him,
LUK.2.50	But they did not understand what he said to them.
LUK.2.51	Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was obedient to them. His mother kept all these things in her heart.
LUK.2.52	And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and with people.
LUK.3.1	In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea,
LUK.3.2	during the high priesthood of Annas
LUK.3.3	He went into all the vicinity of the Jordan,
LUK.3.4	as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah:
LUK.3.7	He then said to the crowds who came out to be baptized by him, “Brood of vipers!
LUK.3.8	Therefore produce fruit
LUK.3.9	The ax is already at the root of the trees. Therefore, every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”
LUK.3.10	“What then should we do?” 
LUK.3.11	He replied to them, “The one who has two shirts must share with someone who has none, and the one who has food must do the same.”
LUK.3.12	Tax collectors
LUK.3.13	He told them, “Don’t collect any more than what you have been authorized.”
LUK.3.14	Some soldiers also questioned him, “What should we do?”
LUK.3.14	He said to them, “Don’t take money from anyone by force or false accusation, and be satisfied with your wages.”
LUK.3.15	Now the people were waiting expectantly, and all of them were questioning in their hearts whether John might be the Messiah.
LUK.3.16	John answered them all,
LUK.3.17	His winnowing shovel
LUK.3.18	Then, along with many other exhortations, he proclaimed good news to the people. 
LUK.3.19	But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch
LUK.3.20	Herod added this to everything else — he locked up John in prison.
LUK.3.21	When all the people were baptized,
LUK.3.22	and the Holy Spirit descended on him in a physical appearance like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well-pleased.”

LUK.4.1	Then Jesus
LUK.4.2	for forty days
LUK.4.3	The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.”
LUK.4.4	But Jesus answered him, 
LUK.4.5	So he took him up
LUK.4.6	The devil said to him, “I will give you their splendor and all this authority, because it has been given over to me,
LUK.4.7	If you, then, will worship me,
LUK.4.8	And Jesus answered him,
LUK.4.9	So he took him to Jerusalem, had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. 
LUK.4.10	For it is written:
LUK.4.11	and
LUK.4.12	And Jesus answered him, 
LUK.4.13	After the devil had finished every temptation, he departed from him for a time.
LUK.4.14	Then Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Spirit,
LUK.4.15	He was teaching in their synagogues,
LUK.4.16	He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up.
LUK.4.17	The scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him, and unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written:
LUK.4.20	He then rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down.
LUK.4.21	He began by saying to them, 
LUK.4.22	They were all speaking well of him
LUK.4.23	Then he said to them, 
LUK.4.24	He also said, 
LUK.4.28	When they heard this, everyone in the synagogue was enraged. 
LUK.4.29	They got up, drove him out of town,
LUK.4.30	But he passed right through the crowd and went on his way.
LUK.4.31	Then he went down to Capernaum,
LUK.4.32	They were astonished at his teaching because his message had authority.
LUK.4.33	In the synagogue there was a man with an unclean demonic spirit who cried out with a loud voice,
LUK.4.34	“Leave us alone! What do you have to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are — the Holy One of God!” 
LUK.4.35	But Jesus rebuked him
LUK.4.36	Amazement came over them all, and they were saying to one another, “What is this message? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out!” 
LUK.4.37	And news about him began to go out to every place in the vicinity.
LUK.4.38	After he left the synagogue, he entered Simon’s house.
LUK.4.39	So he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up immediately
LUK.4.40	When the sun was setting, all those who had anyone sick with various diseases brought them to him. As he laid his hands on each one of them, he healed them.
LUK.4.41	Also, demons were coming out of many, shouting and saying, “You are the Son of God!” 
LUK.4.42	When it was day, he went out and made his way to a deserted place.
LUK.4.43	But he said to them, 
LUK.4.44	And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
LUK.5.1	As the crowd was pressing in on Jesus to hear God’s word,
LUK.5.2	He saw two boats at the edge of the lake; the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	He got into one of the boats,
LUK.5.4	When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, 
LUK.5.5	“Master,”
LUK.5.6	When they did this, they caught a great number of fish, and their nets
LUK.5.7	So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them; they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink.
LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter saw this, he fell at Jesus’s knees and said, “Go away from me, because I’m a sinful man, Lord!” 
LUK.5.9	For he and all those with him were amazed
LUK.5.10	and so were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s partners.
LUK.5.11	Then they brought the boats to land, left everything, and followed him.
LUK.5.12	While he was in one of the towns, a man was there who had leprosy
LUK.5.13	Reaching out his hand, Jesus touched him,
LUK.5.14	Then he ordered him to tell no one:
LUK.5.15	But the news
LUK.5.16	Yet he often withdrew to deserted places and prayed.
LUK.5.17	On one of those days while he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law
LUK.5.18	Just then some men came,
LUK.5.19	Since they could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and lowered him on the stretcher through the roof tiles into the middle of the crowd before Jesus.
LUK.5.20	Seeing their faith he said, 
LUK.5.21	Then the scribes and the Pharisees
LUK.5.22	But perceiving their thoughts, Jesus replied to them, 
LUK.5.24	  — he told the paralyzed man, 
LUK.5.25	Immediately he got up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went home glorifying God.
LUK.5.26	Then everyone was astounded, and they were giving glory to God. And they were filled with awe
LUK.5.27	After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax office,
LUK.5.28	So, leaving everything behind, he got up and began to follow him.
LUK.5.29	Then Levi hosted a grand banquet for him at his house. Now there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were guests
LUK.5.30	But the Pharisees and their scribes
LUK.5.31	Jesus replied to them, 
LUK.5.33	Then they said to him, “John’s disciples fast often and say prayers, and those of the Pharisees do the same, but yours eat and drink.”
LUK.5.34	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.5.36	He also told them a parable: 
LUK.6.1	On a Sabbath, he passed through the grainfields.
LUK.6.2	But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?” 
LUK.6.3	Jesus answered them, 
LUK.6.5	Then he told them, 
LUK.6.6	On another Sabbath
LUK.6.7	The scribes and Pharisees were watching him closely,
LUK.6.8	But he knew their thoughts
LUK.6.9	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.6.10	After looking around at them all,
LUK.6.11	They, however, were filled with rage and started discussing with one another what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	During those days he went out to the mountain to pray
LUK.6.13	When daylight came, he summoned his disciples,
LUK.6.14	Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew; 
LUK.6.15	Matthew and Thomas;
LUK.6.16	Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.
LUK.6.17	After coming down with them, he stood on a level place with a large crowd of his disciples and a great number of people from all Judea and Jerusalem and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.
LUK.6.18	They came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those tormented by unclean spirits were made well. 
LUK.6.19	The whole crowd was trying to touch him,
LUK.6.20	Then looking up at his disciples, he said:
LUK.6.39	He also told them a parable: 
LUK.7.1	When he had concluded saying all this to the people who were listening, he entered Capernaum.
LUK.7.2	A centurion’s servant, who was highly valued by him, was sick and about to die. 
LUK.7.3	When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him, requesting him to come and save the life of his servant. 
LUK.7.4	When they reached Jesus, they pleaded with him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy for you to grant this, 
LUK.7.5	because he loves our nation and has built us a synagogue.”
LUK.7.6	Jesus went with them, and when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to tell him, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, since I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. 
LUK.7.7	That is why I didn’t even consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word, and my servant will be healed.
LUK.7.8	For I too am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under my command. I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does it.”
LUK.7.9	Jesus heard this and was amazed at him, and turning to the crowd following him, he said, 
LUK.7.10	When those who had been sent returned to the house, they found the servant in good health.
LUK.7.11	Afterward he was on his way to a town called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd were traveling with him. 
LUK.7.12	Just as he neared the gate of the town, a dead man was being carried out. He was his mother’s only son, and she was a widow.
LUK.7.13	When the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her
LUK.7.14	Then he came up and touched the open coffin, and the pallbearers stopped. And he said, 
LUK.7.15	The dead man sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him to his mother.
LUK.7.16	Then fear
LUK.7.17	This report about him went throughout Judea and all the vicinity.
LUK.7.18	Then John’s disciples told him about all these things.
LUK.7.19	and sent them to the Lord, asking, “Are you the one
LUK.7.20	When the men reached him, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to ask you, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we expect someone else?’”
LUK.7.21	At that time Jesus healed many people of diseases,
LUK.7.22	He replied to them, 
LUK.7.24	After John’s messengers left, he began to speak to the crowds about John: 
LUK.7.29	(And when all the people, including the tax collectors, heard this, they acknowledged God’s way of righteousness, because they had been baptized with John’s baptism.
LUK.7.30	But since the Pharisees and experts in the law
LUK.7.36	Then one of the Pharisees invited him to eat with him. He entered the Pharisee’s house and reclined at the table.
LUK.7.37	And a woman in the town who was a sinner found out that Jesus was reclining at the table in the Pharisee’s house.
LUK.7.38	and stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to wash his feet with her tears. She wiped his feet with her hair, kissing them and anointing them with the perfume.
LUK.7.39	When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, “This man, if he were a prophet, would know who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him — she’s a sinner!” 
LUK.7.40	Jesus replied to him, 
LUK.7.40	He said, “Say it, teacher.”
LUK.7.43	Simon answered, “I suppose the one he forgave more.”
LUK.7.44	Turning to the woman, he said to Simon, 
LUK.7.48	Then he said to her, 
LUK.7.49	Those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this man who even forgives sins?” 
LUK.7.50	And he said to the woman, 
LUK.8.1	Afterward he was traveling from one town and village to another,
LUK.8.2	and also some women who had been healed of evil spirits and sicknesses:
LUK.8.3	Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward; Susanna; and many others who were supporting them from their possessions.
LUK.8.4	As a large crowd was gathering, and people were coming to Jesus from every town, he said in a parable:
LUK.8.8	 As he said this, he called out, 
LUK.8.9	Then his disciples asked him, “What does this parable mean?” 
LUK.8.10	So he said, 
LUK.8.19	Then his mother and brothers
LUK.8.20	He was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
LUK.8.21	But he replied to them, 
LUK.8.22	One day he and his disciples got into a boat,
LUK.8.23	and as they were sailing he fell asleep. Then a fierce windstorm came down on the lake; they were being swamped and were in danger. 
LUK.8.24	They came and woke him up, saying, “Master, Master, we’re going to die!”
LUK.8.24	Then he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves. So they ceased, and there was a calm.
LUK.8.25	He said to them, 
LUK.8.25	They were fearful and amazed, asking one another, “Who then is this?
LUK.8.26	Then they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes,
LUK.8.27	When he got out on land, a demon-possessed man from the town met him. For a long time he had worn no clothes and did not stay in a house but in the tombs. 
LUK.8.28	When he saw Jesus, he cried out,
LUK.8.29	For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had seized him, and though he was guarded, bound by chains and shackles, he would snap the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.
LUK.8.30	“Legion,”
LUK.8.31	And they begged him not to banish them to the abyss.
LUK.8.32	A large herd of pigs was there, feeding on the hillside. The demons begged him to permit them to enter the pigs, and he gave them permission. 
LUK.8.33	The demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
LUK.8.34	When the men who tended them saw what had happened, they ran off and reported it in the town and in the countryside. 
LUK.8.35	Then people went out to see what had happened. They came to Jesus and found the man the demons had departed from, sitting at Jesus’s feet,
LUK.8.36	Meanwhile, the eyewitnesses reported to them how the demon-possessed man was delivered.
LUK.8.37	Then all the people of the Gerasene region
LUK.8.38	The man from whom the demons had departed begged him earnestly to be with him. But he sent him away and said, 
LUK.8.39	 And off he went, proclaiming throughout the town how much Jesus had done for him.
LUK.8.40	When Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him,
LUK.8.41	Just then, a man named Jairus came. He was a leader of the synagogue.
LUK.8.42	because he had an only daughter
LUK.8.42	While he was going, the crowds were nearly crushing him.
LUK.8.43	A woman suffering from bleeding
LUK.8.44	approached from behind and touched the end of his robe.
LUK.8.45	When they all denied it, Peter
LUK.8.47	When the woman saw that she was discovered, she came trembling and fell down before him. In the presence of all the people, she declared the reason she had touched him and how she was instantly healed. 
LUK.8.48	 he said to her, 
LUK.8.49	While he was still speaking,
LUK.8.50	When Jesus heard it, he answered him, 
LUK.8.51	After he came to the house, he let no one enter with him except Peter, John, James,
LUK.8.52	Everyone was crying
LUK.8.53	They laughed at him, because they knew she was dead. 
LUK.8.54	So he
LUK.8.55	Her spirit returned,
LUK.8.56	Her parents were astounded, but he instructed them to tell no one what had happened.
LUK.9.1	Summoning the Twelve,
LUK.9.2	Then he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
LUK.9.6	So they went out and traveled from village to village, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.
LUK.9.7	Herod the tetrarch
LUK.9.8	some that Elijah had appeared,
LUK.9.9	“I beheaded John,” Herod said, “but who is this I hear such things about?” And he wanted to see him.
LUK.9.10	When the apostles returned,
LUK.9.11	When the crowds found out, they followed him. He welcomed them,
LUK.9.12	Late in the day,
LUK.9.13	“We have no more than five loaves
LUK.9.14	(For about five thousand men were there.)
LUK.9.14	Then he told his disciples, 
LUK.9.15	They did what he said, and had them all sit down. 
LUK.9.16	Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven,
LUK.9.17	Everyone ate and was filled. They picked up twelve baskets of leftover pieces.
LUK.9.18	While he was praying in private
LUK.9.19	They answered, “John the Baptist; others, Elijah; still others, that one of the ancient prophets has come back.”
LUK.9.20	Peter answered, “God’s Messiah.”
LUK.9.21	But he strictly warned and instructed them to tell this to no one,
LUK.9.22	saying,
LUK.9.23	Then he said to them all, 
LUK.9.28	About eight days after this conversation,
LUK.9.29	As he was praying, the appearance of his face changed,
LUK.9.30	Suddenly, two men were talking with him — Moses and Elijah. 
LUK.9.31	They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.
LUK.9.32	Peter and those with him were in a deep sleep,
LUK.9.33	As the two men were departing from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master,
LUK.9.34	While he was saying this, a cloud appeared and overshadowed
LUK.9.35	Then a voice came from the cloud,
LUK.9.36	After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. They kept silent, and at that time told no one what they had seen.
LUK.9.37	The next day,
LUK.9.38	Just then a man from the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, because he’s my only child.
LUK.9.39	A spirit seizes him; suddenly he shrieks, and it throws him into convulsions until he foams at the mouth; severely bruising him, it scarcely ever leaves him. 
LUK.9.40	I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn’t.”
LUK.9.41	Jesus replied, 
LUK.9.42	As the boy was still approaching, the demon knocked him down and threw him into severe convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy,
LUK.9.43	And they were all astonished at the greatness of God.
LUK.9.43	While everyone was amazed at all the things he was doing,
LUK.9.45	But they did not understand this statement;
LUK.9.46	An argument started among them about who was the greatest of them.
LUK.9.47	But Jesus, knowing their inner thoughts,
LUK.9.48	He told them, 
LUK.9.49	John responded,
LUK.9.51	When the days were coming to a close for him to be taken up,
LUK.9.52	He sent messengers ahead of himself,
LUK.9.53	But they did not welcome him, because he determined to journey to Jerusalem.
LUK.9.54	When the disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call down fire from heaven to consume them?” 
LUK.9.55	But he turned and rebuked them,
LUK.9.56	and they went to another village.
LUK.9.57	As they were traveling on the road someone said to him,
LUK.9.58	Jesus told him, 
LUK.9.59	Then he said to another, 
LUK.9.59	“Lord,” he said, “first let me go bury my father.”
LUK.9.60	But he told him, 
LUK.9.61	Another said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me go and say good-bye to those at my house.”
LUK.9.62	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.1	After this, the Lord appointed seventy-two
LUK.10.2	He told them,
LUK.10.17	The seventy-two
LUK.10.18	He said to them, 
LUK.10.21	At that time
LUK.10.23	Then turning to his disciples he said privately, 
LUK.10.25	Then
LUK.10.27	He answered, 
LUK.10.29	But wanting to justify himself,
LUK.10.30	Jesus took up the question and said: 
LUK.10.37	“The one who showed mercy
LUK.10.37	Then Jesus told him, 
LUK.10.38	While they were traveling, he entered a village, and a woman named Martha
LUK.10.39	She had a sister named Mary, who also sat at the Lord’s
LUK.10.40	But Martha was distracted by her many tasks, and she came up and asked, “Lord, don’t you care
LUK.10.41	The Lord
LUK.11.1	He was praying
LUK.11.2	He said to them, 
LUK.11.5	He also said to them: 
LUK.11.14	Now
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, “He drives out demons by Beelzebul,
LUK.11.16	And others, as a test,
LUK.11.17	Knowing their thoughts,
LUK.11.27	As he was saying these things, a woman from the crowd
LUK.11.28	He said, 
LUK.11.29	As the crowds were increasing, he began saying: 
LUK.11.37	As he was speaking, a Pharisee
LUK.11.38	When the Pharisee saw this, he was amazed that he did not first perform the ritual washing
LUK.11.39	But the Lord said to him, 
LUK.11.45	One of the experts in the law
LUK.11.46	Then he said: 
LUK.11.53	When he left there,
LUK.11.54	they were lying in wait
LUK.12.1	Meanwhile, a crowd of many thousands came together, so that they were trampling
LUK.12.13	Someone from the crowd said to him, “Teacher,
LUK.12.15	He then told them, 
LUK.12.16	Then he told them a parable:
LUK.12.22	Then he said to his disciples: 
LUK.12.41	“Lord,” Peter asked, “are you telling this parable to us or to everyone?”
LUK.12.42	The Lord said: 
LUK.12.54	He also said to the crowds:
LUK.13.1	At that time,
LUK.13.2	And he
LUK.13.6	And he told this parable:
LUK.13.10	As he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath,
LUK.13.11	a woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit
LUK.13.12	When Jesus saw her, he called out to her,
LUK.13.13	Then he laid his hands on her,
LUK.13.14	But the leader of the synagogue, indignant
LUK.13.15	But the Lord answered him and said, 
LUK.13.17	When he had said these things, all his adversaries
LUK.13.18	He said, therefore, 
LUK.13.20	Again he said, 
LUK.13.22	He went through one town and village after another, teaching and making his way to Jerusalem.
LUK.13.23	“Lord,” someone asked him, “are only a few people going to be saved?” 
LUK.13.23	He said to them, 
LUK.13.31	At that time some Pharisees came and told him, “Go, get out of here. Herod
LUK.13.32	He said to them, 
LUK.14.1	One Sabbath, when he went in to eat
LUK.14.2	There in front of him was a man whose body was swollen with fluid. 
LUK.14.3	In response, Jesus asked the law experts
LUK.14.4	But they kept silent. He took the man, healed him, and sent him away. 
LUK.14.5	And to them, he said, 
LUK.14.6	They could find no answer to these things.
LUK.14.7	He told a parable
LUK.14.12	He also said to the one who had invited him, 
LUK.14.15	When
LUK.14.16	Then he told him: 
LUK.14.25	Now
LUK.15.1	All
LUK.15.2	And the Pharisees and scribes were complaining, “This man welcomes sinners
LUK.15.3	So he told them this parable:
LUK.15.11	He also said: 
LUK.16.1	Now he said to the disciples: 
LUK.16.14	The Pharisees, who were lovers of money,
LUK.16.15	And he told them, 
LUK.17.1	He
LUK.17.5	The
LUK.17.11	While traveling to Jerusalem,
LUK.17.12	As he entered a village, ten men with leprosy
LUK.17.13	and raised their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master,
LUK.17.14	When he saw them, he told them, 
LUK.17.15	But one of them, seeing that he was healed, returned and, with a loud voice, gave glory to God.
LUK.17.16	He fell facedown
LUK.17.17	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.17.19	And he told him, 
LUK.17.20	Being
LUK.17.22	Then he told the disciples: 
LUK.17.37	“Where, Lord?” 
LUK.17.37	He said to them, 
LUK.18.1	Now he told them a parable on the need for them to pray
LUK.18.6	Then the Lord said, 
LUK.18.9	He
LUK.18.15	People
LUK.18.16	Jesus, however, invited them: 
LUK.18.18	A
LUK.18.21	“I have kept all these from my youth,” he said.
LUK.18.22	When Jesus heard this, he told him, 
LUK.18.23	After he heard this, he became extremely sad,
LUK.18.24	Seeing that he became sad,
LUK.18.26	Those who heard this asked, “Then who can be saved?” 
LUK.18.27	He replied, 
LUK.18.28	Then Peter said, “Look, we have left what we had and followed
LUK.18.29	So he said to them, 
LUK.18.31	Then
LUK.18.34	They understood none of these things.
LUK.18.35	As
LUK.18.36	Hearing a crowd passing by, he inquired what was happening. 
LUK.18.37	“Jesus of Nazareth
LUK.18.38	So he called out,
LUK.18.39	Then those in front told him to keep quiet,
LUK.18.40	Jesus stopped and commanded that he be brought to him. When he came closer, he asked him, 
LUK.18.41	“Lord,” he said, “I want to see.”
LUK.18.43	Instantly he could see, and he began to follow him, glorifying God.
LUK.19.1	He entered Jericho and was passing through. 
LUK.19.2	There was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. 
LUK.19.3	He was trying to see who Jesus was, but he was not able because of the crowd, since he was a short man. 
LUK.19.4	So running ahead, he climbed up a sycamore tree to see Jesus, since he was about to pass that way. 
LUK.19.5	When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, 
LUK.19.6	So he quickly came down and welcomed him joyfully. 
LUK.19.7	All who saw it began to complain,
LUK.19.8	But Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, “Look, I’ll give half of my possessions to the poor,
LUK.19.11	As
LUK.19.12	Therefore he said: 
LUK.19.28	When
LUK.19.29	As he approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives,
LUK.19.30	and said, 
LUK.19.32	So those who were sent left and found it just as he had told them.
LUK.19.33	As they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, “Why are you untying the colt?”
LUK.19.34	“The Lord needs it,” they said. 
LUK.19.35	Then
LUK.19.36	As he was going along, they were spreading their clothes on the road.
LUK.19.37	Now he came near the path down the Mount of Olives, and the whole crowd of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the miracles they had seen:
LUK.19.38	Peace in heaven
LUK.19.38	and glory
LUK.19.39	Some of the Pharisees from the crowd told him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples.”
LUK.19.40	He answered, 
LUK.19.41	As he approached and saw the city, he wept
LUK.19.42	saying, 
LUK.19.45	He
LUK.19.46	and he said, 
LUK.19.47	Every day he was teaching
LUK.19.48	but they could not find a way to do it, because all the people
LUK.20.1	One
LUK.20.2	and said to him: “Tell us, by what authority are you doing these things? Who is it who gave you this authority?”
LUK.20.3	He answered them, 
LUK.20.5	They discussed it among themselves: “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why didn’t you believe him?’ 
LUK.20.6	But if we say, ‘Of human origin,’ all the people
LUK.20.7	So they answered that they did not know its origin.
LUK.20.8	And Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.9	Now
LUK.20.16	But when they heard this they said, “That must never happen!” 
LUK.20.17	But he looked at them and said, 
LUK.20.19	Then the scribes and the chief priests
LUK.20.20	They
LUK.20.21	They questioned him, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly,
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful
LUK.20.23	But detecting their craftiness, he said to them,
LUK.20.24	“Caesar’s,” they said.
LUK.20.26	They were not able to catch him in what he said in public, and being amazed at his answer, they became silent.
LUK.20.27	Some
LUK.20.28	“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that 
LUK.20.29	Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and died without children. 
LUK.20.30	Also the second
LUK.20.31	and the third took her. In the same way, all seven died and left no children. 
LUK.20.32	Finally, the woman died too. 
LUK.20.33	In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had married her.”
LUK.20.34	Jesus told them, 
LUK.20.39	Some of the scribes answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well.” 
LUK.20.40	And they no longer dared to ask him anything.
LUK.20.41	Then
LUK.20.45	While
LUK.21.1	He
LUK.21.2	He also saw a poor widow dropping in two tiny coins.
LUK.21.3	 he said, 
LUK.21.5	As
LUK.21.7	“Teacher,” they asked him, “so when will these things happen? And what will be the sign when these things are about to take place?” 
LUK.21.8	Then he said, 
LUK.21.10	Then he told them: 
LUK.21.29	Then he told them a parable: 
LUK.21.37	During
LUK.21.38	Then all the people would come early in the morning to hear him in the temple.
LUK.22.1	The
LUK.22.2	The chief priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put him to death,
LUK.22.3	Then
LUK.22.4	He went away and discussed with the chief priests and temple police
LUK.22.5	They were glad and agreed to give him silver.
LUK.22.6	So he accepted the offer and started looking for a good opportunity to betray him to them when the crowd was not present.
LUK.22.7	Then
LUK.22.8	Jesus sent Peter and John,
LUK.22.9	“Where do you want us to prepare it?” they asked him.
LUK.22.13	So they went and found it just as he had told them,
LUK.22.14	When
LUK.22.15	Then he said to them, 
LUK.22.17	Then he took a cup,
LUK.22.19	And he took bread, gave thanks, broke it, gave it to them, and said, 
LUK.22.20	In the same way he also took the cup after supper and said, 
LUK.22.23	So they began to argue
LUK.22.24	Then a dispute also arose among them about who should be considered the greatest.
LUK.22.25	But he said to them,
LUK.22.33	“Lord,”
LUK.22.35	He also said to them, 
LUK.22.35	“Not a thing,” they said.
LUK.22.36	Then he said to them, 
LUK.22.38	“Lord,” they said, “look, here are two swords.”
LUK.22.39	He went out and made his way
LUK.22.40	When he reached the place,
LUK.22.41	Then he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and began to pray,
LUK.22.43	Then an angel from heaven
LUK.22.44	Being in anguish,
LUK.22.45	When he got up from prayer and came to the disciples, he found them sleeping, exhausted from their grief. 
LUK.22.46	 he asked them. 
LUK.22.47	While
LUK.22.48	but Jesus said to him, 
LUK.22.49	When those around him saw what was going to happen, they asked, “Lord, should we strike with the sword?” 
LUK.22.50	Then one of them struck the high priest’s servant and cut off his right ear.
LUK.22.51	But Jesus responded, 
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus said to the chief priests, temple police, and the elders who had come for him, 
LUK.22.54	They seized him, led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. Meanwhile Peter
LUK.22.55	They
LUK.22.56	When a servant saw him sitting in the light, and looked closely at him, she said, “This man was with him too.”
LUK.22.57	But he denied it: “Woman, I don’t know him.”
LUK.22.58	After a little while, someone else saw him and said, “You’re one of them too.”
LUK.22.58	“Man, I am not!” Peter said.
LUK.22.59	About an hour later, another kept insisting, “This man was certainly with him, since he’s also a Galilean.”
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 
LUK.22.61	Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter.
LUK.22.62	And he went outside and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	The men who were holding Jesus started mocking and beating him.
LUK.22.64	After blindfolding him, they kept
LUK.22.65	And they were saying many other blasphemous
LUK.22.66	When daylight came,
LUK.22.67	They said,
LUK.22.67	But he said to them, 
LUK.22.70	They all asked, “Are you, then, the Son of God?” 
LUK.22.70	And he said to them, 
LUK.22.71	“Why do we need any more testimony,” they said, “since we’ve heard it ourselves from his mouth?”
LUK.23.1	Then
LUK.23.2	They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man misleading our nation, opposing payment of taxes
LUK.23.3	So Pilate asked him,
LUK.23.3	He answered him, 
LUK.23.4	Pilate then told the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no grounds
LUK.23.5	But they kept insisting, “He stirs up the people,
LUK.23.6	When Pilate
LUK.23.7	Finding that he was under Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod,
LUK.23.8	Herod was very glad to see Jesus; for a long time he had wanted to see him because he had heard about him and was hoping to see some miracle
LUK.23.9	So he kept asking him questions, but Jesus did not answer him.
LUK.23.10	The chief priests and the scribes stood by, vehemently accusing him. 
LUK.23.11	Then Herod, with his soldiers, treated him with contempt, mocked
LUK.23.12	That very day Herod and Pilate became friends.
LUK.23.13	Pilate called together the chief priests, the leaders, and the people,
LUK.23.14	and said to them, “You have brought me this man as one who misleads the people.
LUK.23.15	Neither has Herod, because he sent him back to us. Clearly, he has done nothing to deserve death. 
LUK.23.16	Therefore, I will have him whipped
LUK.23.18	Then
LUK.23.19	(He had been thrown into prison for a rebellion that had taken place in the city, and for murder.)
LUK.23.20	Wanting to release Jesus,
LUK.23.21	but they kept shouting, “Crucify! Crucify him!”
LUK.23.22	A third time he said to them, “Why? What has this man done wrong?
LUK.23.23	But they kept up the pressure, demanding with loud voices that he be crucified, and their voices
LUK.23.24	So
LUK.23.25	and released the one they were asking for, who had been thrown into prison for rebellion and murder. But he handed Jesus over to their will.
LUK.23.26	As
LUK.23.27	A large crowd of people followed him, including women who were mourning and lamenting him.
LUK.23.28	But turning to them, Jesus said, 
LUK.23.32	Two others — criminals
LUK.23.33	When
LUK.23.34	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.23.35	The
LUK.23.36	The soldiers also mocked him. They came offering him sour wine
LUK.23.37	and said, “If you are the King of the Jews,
LUK.23.38	An inscription was above him:
LUK.23.39	Then
LUK.23.40	But the other answered, rebuking him: “Don’t you even fear God,
LUK.23.41	We are punished justly, because we’re getting back what we deserve for the things we did, but this man has done nothing wrong.”
LUK.23.42	Then he said, “Jesus, remember me
LUK.23.43	And he said to him, 
LUK.23.44	It
LUK.23.45	because the sun’s light failed.
LUK.23.46	And Jesus called out with a loud voice, 
LUK.23.47	When the centurion saw what happened, he began to glorify
LUK.23.48	All the crowds that had gathered for this spectacle, when they saw what had taken place, went home, striking their chests.
LUK.23.49	But
LUK.23.50	There
LUK.23.51	who had not agreed with their plan
LUK.23.52	He approached Pilate and asked for Jesus’s body. 
LUK.23.53	Taking it down, he wrapped it in fine linen and placed it in a tomb cut into the rock, where no one had ever been placed.
LUK.23.54	It was the preparation day, and the Sabbath was about to begin.
LUK.23.55	The women
LUK.23.56	Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes.
LUK.24.1	On
LUK.24.2	They found the stone rolled away from the tomb. 
LUK.24.3	They went in but did not find the body
LUK.24.4	While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men stood by them in dazzling
LUK.24.5	So the women were terrified and bowed down to the ground.
LUK.24.5	“Why are you looking for the living among the dead?” asked the men. 
LUK.24.6	“He is not here, but he has risen!
LUK.24.7	saying, 
LUK.24.8	And they remembered his words.
LUK.24.9	Returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the Eleven
LUK.24.10	Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James,
LUK.24.11	But these words seemed like nonsense to them, and they did not believe
LUK.24.12	Peter,
LUK.24.13	Now
LUK.24.14	Together they were discussing everything that had taken place. 
LUK.24.15	And while they were discussing and arguing, Jesus himself came near and began to walk along with them. 
LUK.24.16	But they
LUK.24.17	Then he asked them, 
LUK.24.18	The one named Cleopas answered him, “Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who doesn’t know the things that happened there in these days?” 
LUK.24.19	So they said to him, “The things concerning Jesus of Nazareth,
LUK.24.20	and how our chief priests and leaders
LUK.24.21	But we were hoping that he was the one who was about to redeem
LUK.24.22	Moreover, some women from our group astounded us. They arrived early at the tomb, 
LUK.24.23	and when they didn’t find his body, they came and reported that they had seen a vision of angels who said he was alive. 
LUK.24.24	Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn’t see him.”
LUK.24.25	He said to them, 
LUK.24.27	Then beginning with Moses
LUK.24.28	They came near the village where they were going, and he gave the impression that he was going farther.
LUK.24.29	But they urged him, “Stay with us, because it’s almost evening, and now the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them.
LUK.24.30	It was as he reclined at the table with them that he took the bread, blessed and broke
LUK.24.31	Then their eyes were opened,
LUK.24.32	They said to each other, “Weren’t our hearts burning within us while he was talking with us on the road and explaining the Scriptures
LUK.24.33	That very hour they got up and returned to Jerusalem. They found the Eleven
LUK.24.34	who said, “The Lord has truly been raised and has appeared to Simon!” 
LUK.24.35	Then they began to describe what had happened on the road and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread.
LUK.24.36	As
LUK.24.37	But they were startled and terrified
LUK.24.40	Having said this, he showed them his hands and feet. 
LUK.24.41	But while they still were amazed and in disbelief because of their joy, he asked them, 
LUK.24.42	So they gave him a piece of a broiled fish,
LUK.24.43	and he took it and ate in their presence.
LUK.24.44	He told them, 
LUK.24.45	Then he opened their minds
LUK.24.46	He also said to them, 
LUK.24.50	Then he led them out to the vicinity of Bethany,
LUK.24.51	And while he was blessing them, he left them and was carried up into heaven.
LUK.24.52	After worshiping him,
LUK.24.53	And they were continually in the temple praising God.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning
JHN.1.2	He was with God in the beginning.
JHN.1.3	All things were created
JHN.1.4	In him was life,
JHN.1.5	That light shines
JHN.1.6	There was a man sent from God whose name was John.
JHN.1.7	He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.
JHN.1.8	He was not the light, but he came to testify
JHN.1.9	The true light
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was created
JHN.1.11	He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. 
JHN.1.12	But to all who did receive
JHN.1.13	who were born,
JHN.1.14	The Word
JHN.1.15	(John testified concerning him and exclaimed, “This was the one of whom I said, ‘The one coming after me
JHN.1.16	Indeed, we have all received grace
JHN.1.17	for the law was given through Moses;
JHN.1.18	No one has ever seen God. The one and only
JHN.1.19	This was John’s testimony when the Jews from Jerusalem
JHN.1.20	He didn’t deny it but confessed: “I am not the Messiah.”
JHN.1.21	“What then?” they asked him. “Are you Elijah?” 
JHN.1.21	“I am not,” he said.
JHN.1.21	“Are you the Prophet?” 
JHN.1.21	“No,” he answered.
JHN.1.22	“Who are you, then?” they asked. “We need to give an answer to those who sent us. What can you tell us about yourself?”
JHN.1.23	He said, “I am a 
JHN.1.24	Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.
JHN.1.25	So they asked him, “Why then do you baptize if you aren’t the Messiah, or Elijah, or the Prophet?”
JHN.1.26	“I baptize with
JHN.1.27	He is the one coming after me,
JHN.1.28	All this happened in Bethany
JHN.1.29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Here is the Lamb of God,
JHN.1.30	This is the one I told you about: ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me, because he existed before me.’ 
JHN.1.31	I didn’t know him,
JHN.1.32	And John testified, “I saw the Spirit
JHN.1.33	I didn’t know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘The one you see the Spirit descending and resting on — he is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’
JHN.1.34	I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.”
JHN.1.35	The next day, John was standing with two of his disciples. 
JHN.1.36	When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”
JHN.1.37	The two disciples heard him say this and followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.38	When Jesus turned and noticed them following him, he asked them, 
JHN.1.38	They said to him, “Rabbi”
JHN.1.40	Andrew,
JHN.1.41	He first found his own brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah”
JHN.1.42	and he brought Simon to Jesus.
JHN.1.42	When Jesus saw him, he said, 
JHN.1.43	The next day Jesus
JHN.1.44	Now Philip was from Bethsaida,
JHN.1.45	Philip found Nathanael
JHN.1.46	“Can anything good
JHN.1.46	“Come and see,” Philip answered.
JHN.1.47	Then Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and said about him, 
JHN.1.48	“How do you know me?” Nathanael asked.
JHN.1.49	“Rabbi,”
JHN.1.50	Jesus responded to him, 
JHN.1.51	Then he said, 
JHN.2.1	On the third day a wedding took place in Cana
JHN.2.2	Jesus and his disciples were invited to the wedding as well. 
JHN.2.3	When the wine ran out, Jesus’s mother told him, “They don’t have any wine.”
JHN.2.5	“Do whatever he tells you,” his mother told the servants.
JHN.2.6	Now six stone water jars had been set there for Jewish purification.
JHN.2.8	Then he said to them, 
JHN.2.9	When the headwaiter tasted the water (after it had become wine), he did not know where it came from — though the servants who had drawn the water knew. He called the groom 
JHN.2.10	and told him, “Everyone sets out the fine wine first, then, after people are drunk, the inferior. But you have kept the fine wine until now.”
JHN.2.11	Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana
JHN.2.12	After this, he went down to Capernaum,
JHN.2.13	The Jewish Passover
JHN.2.14	In the temple
JHN.2.15	After making a whip out of cords,
JHN.2.16	He told those who were selling doves, 
JHN.2.17	And his disciples remembered that it is written: 
JHN.2.18	So the Jews replied to him, “What sign will you show us for doing these things?”
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered, 
JHN.2.20	Therefore the Jews said, “This temple took forty-six years to build,
JHN.2.21	But he was speaking about the temple of his body.
JHN.2.22	So when he was raised from the dead,
JHN.2.23	While he was in Jerusalem
JHN.2.24	Jesus, however, would not entrust himself to them, since he knew them all 
JHN.2.25	and because he did not need anyone to testify about man; for he himself knew what was in man.
JHN.3.1	There was a man from the Pharisees
JHN.3.2	This man came to him at night and said, “Rabbi,
JHN.3.3	Jesus replied, 
JHN.3.4	“How can anyone be born when he is old?” Nicodemus asked him. “Can he enter his mother’s womb a second time and be born?”
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.9	“How can these things be?” asked Nicodemus.
JHN.3.22	After this, Jesus and his disciples went to the Judean countryside, where he spent time with them and baptized.
JHN.3.23	John
JHN.3.24	since John had not yet been thrown into prison.
JHN.3.25	Then a dispute arose between John’s disciples
JHN.3.26	So they came to John and told him, “Rabbi,
JHN.3.27	John responded, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven. 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Messiah,
JHN.3.29	He who has the bride
JHN.3.30	He must increase, but I must decrease.”
JHN.3.31	The one who comes from above
JHN.3.32	He testifies
JHN.3.33	The one who has accepted his testimony has affirmed that God is true.
JHN.3.34	For the one whom God sent speaks God’s words, since he
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son
JHN.3.36	The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who rejects the Son
JHN.4.1	When Jesus
JHN.4.2	(though Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were), 
JHN.4.3	he left Judea
JHN.4.4	He had to travel through Samaria;
JHN.4.5	so he came to a town of Samaria called Sychar near the property
JHN.4.6	Jacob’s well
JHN.4.7	A woman of Samaria came to draw water.
JHN.4.8	because his disciples had gone into town to buy food.
JHN.4.9	“How is it that you, a Jew,
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered, 
JHN.4.11	“Sir,”
JHN.4.12	You aren’t greater than our father Jacob,
JHN.4.13	Jesus said, 
JHN.4.15	“Sir,” the woman said to him, “give me this water so that I won’t get thirsty and come here to draw water.”
JHN.4.17	“I don’t have a husband,” she answered.
JHN.4.19	“Sir,” the woman replied, “I see that you are a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshiped on this mountain,
JHN.4.21	Jesus told her, 
JHN.4.25	The woman said to him, “I know that the Messiah
JHN.4.26	Jesus told her, 
JHN.4.27	Just then his disciples arrived, and they were amazed that he was talking with a woman. Yet no one said, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”
JHN.4.28	Then the woman left her water jar, went into town, and told the people, 
JHN.4.29	“Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?” 
JHN.4.30	They left the town and made their way to him.
JHN.4.31	In the meantime the disciples kept urging him, “Rabbi,
JHN.4.32	But he said, 
JHN.4.33	The disciples said to one another, “Could someone have brought him something to eat?”
JHN.4.39	Now many Samaritans
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans came to him,
JHN.4.41	Many more believed because of what he said.
JHN.4.42	And they told the woman, “We no longer believe because of what you said, since we have heard for ourselves and know that this really is the Savior
JHN.4.43	After two days he left there for Galilee.
JHN.4.44	(Jesus himself had testified
JHN.4.45	When
JHN.4.46	He went again to Cana
JHN.4.47	When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea
JHN.4.48	Jesus told him, 
JHN.4.49	“Sir,”
JHN.4.51	While he was still going down, his servants met him saying that his boy was alive. 
JHN.4.52	He asked them at what time he got better. “Yesterday at one in the afternoon
JHN.4.53	The father
JHN.4.54	Now this was also the second sign
JHN.5.1	After this, a Jewish festival took place, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
JHN.5.2	By the Sheep Gate
JHN.5.3	Within these lay a large number of the disabled — blind, lame, and paralyzed.
JHN.5.5	One man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him lying there and realized he had already been there a long time,
JHN.5.7	“Sir,”
JHN.5.9	Instantly the man got well, picked up his mat, and started to walk.
JHN.5.9	Now that day was the Sabbath,
JHN.5.10	and so the Jews
JHN.5.11	He replied, “The man who made me well
JHN.5.12	“Who is this man who told you, 
JHN.5.13	But the man who was healed did not know who it was,
JHN.5.14	After this, Jesus found him in the temple
JHN.5.15	The man went and reported to the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
JHN.5.16	Therefore, the Jews began persecuting
JHN.5.17	Jesus responded to them, 
JHN.5.18	This is why the Jews began trying all the more to kill him:
JHN.5.19	Jesus replied, 
JHN.6.1	After
JHN.6.2	A huge crowd was following him because they saw the signs that he was performing by healing the sick. 
JHN.6.3	Jesus went up a mountain and sat down there with his disciples.
JHN.6.4	Now the Passover, a Jewish festival, was near. 
JHN.6.5	So when Jesus looked up and noticed a huge crowd coming toward him,
JHN.6.6	He asked this to test him,
JHN.6.7	Philip answered him, “Two hundred denarii
JHN.6.8	One of his disciples, Andrew,
JHN.6.9	“There’s a boy here who has five barley loaves and two fish — but what are they for so many?”
JHN.6.10	Jesus said, 
JHN.6.10	There was plenty of grass in that place; so they sat down. The men numbered about five thousand.
JHN.6.11	Then Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks he distributed them to those who were seated — so also with the fish, as much as they wanted.
JHN.6.12	When they were full, he told his disciples, 
JHN.6.13	So they collected them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces from the five barley loaves that were left over by those who had eaten.
JHN.6.14	When the people saw the sign
JHN.6.15	Therefore, when Jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king,
JHN.6.16	When
JHN.6.17	got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum.
JHN.6.18	A high wind arose, and the sea began to churn. 
JHN.6.19	After they had rowed about three or four miles,
JHN.6.20	But he said to them, 
JHN.6.21	Then they were willing to take him on board, and at once the boat was at the shore where they were heading.
JHN.6.22	The next day, the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea saw there had been only one boat.
JHN.6.23	Some boats from Tiberias
JHN.6.24	When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went to Capernaum looking for Jesus. 
JHN.6.25	When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi,
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.28	“What can we do to perform the works of God?” they asked.
JHN.6.29	Jesus replied, 
JHN.6.30	“What sign, then, are you going to do so we may see and believe you?” they asked. “What are you going to perform? 
JHN.6.31	Our ancestors ate the manna
JHN.6.32	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.34	Then they said, “Sir, give us this bread always.”
JHN.6.41	Therefore the Jews started complaining about him because he said, 
JHN.6.42	They were saying, “Isn’t this Jesus the son of Joseph,
JHN.6.43	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.6.52	At that, the Jews argued
JHN.6.53	So Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.59	He said these things while teaching in the synagogue
JHN.6.60	Therefore, when many of his disciples heard this, they said, “This teaching is hard. Who can accept
JHN.6.61	Jesus, knowing in himself
JHN.6.64	 (For Jesus knew from the beginning
JHN.6.65	He said, 
JHN.6.66	From that moment
JHN.6.67	So Jesus said to the Twelve,
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter
JHN.6.69	We have come to believe and know that you are the Holy One of God.”
JHN.6.70	Jesus replied to them, 
JHN.6.71	He was referring to Judas,
JHN.7.1	After this, Jesus traveled in Galilee,
JHN.7.2	The Jewish Festival of Shelters
JHN.7.3	So his brothers
JHN.7.4	For no one does anything in secret while he’s seeking public recognition. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.” 
JHN.7.5	(For not even his brothers believed in him.)
JHN.7.6	Jesus told them, 
JHN.7.9	After he had said these things, he stayed in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	After his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up, not openly but secretly. 
JHN.7.11	The Jews were looking for him at the festival and saying, “Where is he?” 
JHN.7.12	And there was a lot of murmuring about him among the crowds. Some were saying, “He’s a good
JHN.7.13	Still, nobody was talking publicly about him for fear of the Jews.
JHN.7.14	When the festival was already half over, Jesus went up into the temple
JHN.7.15	Then the Jews were amazed and said, “How is this man so learned,
JHN.7.16	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.7.20	“You have a demon!” the crowd responded. “Who is trying to kill you?”
JHN.7.25	Some of the people of Jerusalem
JHN.7.26	Yet, look, he’s speaking publicly and they’re saying nothing to him. Can it be true that the authorities
JHN.7.27	But we know where this man is from.
JHN.7.28	As he was teaching in the temple,
JHN.7.30	Then they tried to seize him. Yet no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come. 
JHN.7.31	However, many from the crowd believed in him and said, “When the Messiah comes, he won’t perform more signs than this man has done,
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees
JHN.7.33	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.7.35	Then the Jews
JHN.7.36	What is this remark he made: 
JHN.7.37	On the last and most important day of the festival,
JHN.7.39	He said this about the Spirit.
JHN.7.40	When some from the crowd heard these words, they said, “This truly is the Prophet.”
JHN.7.41	Others said, “This is the Messiah.” But some said, “Surely the Messiah doesn’t come from Galilee, does he? 
JHN.7.42	Doesn’t the Scripture
JHN.7.43	So the crowd was divided
JHN.7.44	Some of them wanted to seize him,
JHN.7.45	Then the servants
JHN.7.46	The servants answered, “No man ever spoke like this!” 
JHN.7.47	Then the Pharisees responded to them: “Are you fooled
JHN.7.48	Have any of the rulers
JHN.7.49	But this crowd, which doesn’t know the law, is accursed.”
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus
JHN.7.51	“Our law doesn’t judge a man before it hears from him and knows what he’s doing, does it?” 
JHN.7.52	“You aren’t from Galilee
JHN.7.52	[The earliest mss do not include 7:53–8:11.]
JHN.7.53	Then each one went to his house.
JHN.8.1	But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
JHN.8.2	At dawn he went to the temple
JHN.8.3	Then the scribes and the Pharisees
JHN.8.4	“Teacher,” they said to him, “this woman was caught in the act of committing adultery.
JHN.8.5	In the law Moses
JHN.8.6	They asked this to trap him,
JHN.8.6	Jesus stooped down and started writing on the ground with his finger. 
JHN.8.7	When they persisted in questioning him, he stood up and said to them, 
JHN.8.8	Then he stooped down again and continued writing on the ground. 
JHN.8.9	When they heard this, they left one by one, starting with the older men. Only he was left, with the woman in the center. 
JHN.8.10	When Jesus stood up, he said to her, 
JHN.8.11	“No one, Lord,”
JHN.8.12	Jesus spoke to them again: 
JHN.8.13	So the Pharisees said to him, “You are testifying about yourself. Your testimony is not valid.”
JHN.8.19	Then they asked him, “Where is your Father?”
JHN.8.20	He spoke these words by the treasury,
JHN.8.21	Then he said to them again, 
JHN.8.22	So the Jews said again, “He won’t kill himself, will he, since he says, 
JHN.8.25	“Who are you?” they questioned.
JHN.8.27	They did not know he was speaking to them about the Father. 
JHN.8.28	So Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.30	As he was saying these things, many believed in him.
JHN.8.31	Then Jesus said to the Jews who had believed him, 
JHN.8.33	“We are descendants
JHN.8.34	Jesus responded, 
JHN.8.39	“Our father is Abraham,” they replied.
JHN.8.41	“We weren’t born
JHN.8.42	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.48	The Jews responded to him, “Aren’t we right in saying that you’re a Samaritan
JHN.8.52	Then the Jews said, “Now we know you have a demon. Abraham died and so did the prophets. You say, 
JHN.8.53	Are you greater than our father Abraham who died? And the prophets died. Who do you claim to be?”
JHN.8.57	The Jews replied, “You aren’t fifty years old yet, and you’ve seen Abraham?” 
JHN.8.58	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.59	So they picked up stones
JHN.9.1	As he was passing by, he saw a man blind from birth. 
JHN.9.2	His disciples asked him: “Rabbi,
JHN.9.6	After he said these things he spit on the ground, made some mud
JHN.9.7	 he told him, 
JHN.9.8	His neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar said, “Isn’t this the one who used to sit begging?” 
JHN.9.9	Some said, “He’s the one.” Others were saying, “No, but he looks like him.”
JHN.9.9	He kept saying, “I’m the one.”
JHN.9.10	So they asked him, “Then how were your eyes opened?”
JHN.9.11	He answered, “The man called Jesus made mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me, 
JHN.9.12	“Where is he?” they asked.
JHN.9.12	“I don’t know,” he said.
JHN.9.13	They brought the man who used to be blind to the Pharisees.
JHN.9.14	The day that Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes was a Sabbath.
JHN.9.15	Then the Pharisees asked him again how he received his sight.
JHN.9.15	“He put mud on my eyes,” he told them. “I washed and I can see.”
JHN.9.16	Some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God,
JHN.9.17	Again they asked the blind man, “What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?”
JHN.9.17	“He’s a prophet,”
JHN.9.18	The Jews did not believe this about him — that he was blind and received sight — until they summoned the parents of the one who had received his sight.
JHN.9.19	They asked them, “Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
JHN.9.20	“We know this is our son and that he was born blind,” his parents answered. 
JHN.9.21	“But we don’t know how he now sees, and we don’t know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he’s of age. He will speak for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews, since the Jews had already agreed that if anyone confessed him as the Messiah,
JHN.9.23	This is why his parents said, “He’s of age; ask him.”
JHN.9.24	So a second time they summoned the man who had been blind and told him, “Give glory
JHN.9.25	He answered, “Whether or not he’s a sinner, I don’t know. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I can see!”
JHN.9.26	Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
JHN.9.27	“I already told you,” he said, “and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don’t want to become his disciples too, do you?”
JHN.9.28	They ridiculed him: “You’re that man’s disciple, but we’re Moses’s
JHN.9.29	We know that God has spoken to Moses. But this man — we don’t know where he’s from.”
JHN.9.30	“This is an amazing thing!” the man told them. “You don’t know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes. 
JHN.9.31	We know that God doesn’t listen to sinners,
JHN.9.32	Throughout history
JHN.9.33	If this man were not from God, he wouldn’t be able to do anything.”
JHN.9.34	“You were born entirely in sin,”
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had thrown the man out, and when he found him, he asked, 
JHN.9.36	“Who is he, Sir,
JHN.9.37	Jesus answered, 
JHN.9.38	“I believe, Lord!” he said, and he worshiped him.
JHN.9.39	Jesus said, 
JHN.9.40	Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things and asked him, “We aren’t blind too, are we?”
JHN.10.6	Jesus gave them this figure of speech, but they did not understand
JHN.10.7	Jesus said again, 
JHN.10.19	Again the Jews were divided
JHN.10.20	Many of them were saying, “He has a demon
JHN.10.21	Others were saying, “These aren’t the words of someone who is demon-possessed. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?” 
JHN.10.22	Then the Festival of Dedication took place in Jerusalem, and it was winter. 
JHN.10.23	Jesus was walking in the temple in Solomon’s Colonnade.
JHN.10.24	The Jews surrounded him and asked, “How long are you going to keep us in suspense?
JHN.10.31	Again the Jews picked up rocks to stone him.
JHN.10.32	Jesus replied, 
JHN.10.33	“We aren’t stoning
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.10.39	Then they were trying again to seize him,
JHN.10.40	So he departed again across the Jordan
JHN.10.41	Many came to him
JHN.10.42	And many believed in him there.
JHN.11.1	Now a man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany,
JHN.11.2	Mary was the one who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair,
JHN.11.3	So the sisters sent a message to him: “Lord, the one you love is sick.”
JHN.11.4	When Jesus heard it, he said, 
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved Martha, her sister, and Lazarus. 
JHN.11.6	So when he heard that he was sick, he stayed two more days in the place where he was. 
JHN.11.7	Then after that, he said to the disciples, 
JHN.11.8	“Rabbi,”
JHN.11.11	He said this, and then he told them, 
JHN.11.12	Then the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well.”
JHN.11.13	Jesus, however, was speaking about his death, but they thought he was speaking about natural sleep. 
JHN.11.14	So Jesus then told them plainly, 
JHN.11.16	Then Thomas
JHN.11.17	When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb
JHN.11.18	Bethany was near Jerusalem
JHN.11.19	Many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them about their brother.
JHN.11.20	As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him, but Mary remained seated in the house. 
JHN.11.21	Then Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother wouldn’t have died. 
JHN.11.22	Yet even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you.”
JHN.11.24	Martha said to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.”
JHN.11.25	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.27	“Yes, Lord,” she told him, “I believe you are the Messiah,
JHN.11.28	Having said this, she went back and called her sister Mary, saying in private, “The Teacher is here and is calling for you.”
JHN.11.29	As soon as Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
JHN.11.30	Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him. 
JHN.11.31	The Jews who were with her in the house consoling her saw that Mary got up quickly and went out. They followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb
JHN.11.32	As soon as Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet
JHN.11.33	When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, he was deeply moved
JHN.11.34	he asked.
JHN.11.34	“Lord,” they told him, “come and see.”
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept.
JHN.11.36	So the Jews said, “See how he loved
JHN.11.37	But some of them said, “Couldn’t he who opened the blind man’s eyes
JHN.11.38	Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
JHN.11.39	 Jesus said.
JHN.11.39	Martha, the dead man’s sister, told him, “Lord, there is already a stench because he has been dead four days.”
JHN.11.40	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.41	So they removed the stone. Then Jesus raised his eyes and said, 
JHN.11.43	After he said this, he shouted with a loud voice, 
JHN.11.44	The dead man came out bound hand and foot with linen strips and with his face wrapped in a cloth. Jesus said to them, 
JHN.11.45	Therefore, many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he did believed in him.
JHN.11.46	But some of them went to the Pharisees
JHN.11.47	So the chief priests and the Pharisees convened the Sanhedrin
JHN.11.48	If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans
JHN.11.49	One of them, Caiaphas,
JHN.11.50	You’re not considering that it is to your
JHN.11.51	He did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus was going to die
JHN.11.52	and not for the nation only, but also to unite the scattered children
JHN.11.53	So from that day on they plotted to kill him.
JHN.11.54	Jesus therefore no longer walked openly
JHN.11.55	Now the Jewish Passover
JHN.11.56	They were looking for Jesus and asking one another as they stood in the temple:
JHN.11.57	The chief priests
JHN.12.1	Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany
JHN.12.2	So
JHN.12.3	Then Mary took a pound of perfume, pure and expensive nard, anointed Jesus’s feet, and wiped his feet with her hair.
JHN.12.4	Then one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot
JHN.12.5	“Why wasn’t this perfume sold for three hundred denarii
JHN.12.6	He didn’t say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief.
JHN.12.7	Jesus answered, 
JHN.12.9	Then a large crowd of the Jews learned he was there. They came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, the one he had raised from the dead.
JHN.12.10	But the chief priests had decided to kill Lazarus also, 
JHN.12.11	because he was the reason many of the Jews were deserting them
JHN.12.12	The
JHN.12.13	they took palm branches
JHN.12.14	Jesus found a young donkey
JHN.12.16	His disciples did not understand these things at first. However, when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him
JHN.12.17	Meanwhile, the crowd, which had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb
JHN.12.18	This is also why the crowd met him, because they heard he had done this sign. 
JHN.12.19	Then the Pharisees said to one another, “You see? You’ve accomplished nothing. Look, the world has gone after him!” 
JHN.12.20	Now some Greeks were among those who went up to worship at the festival. 
JHN.12.21	So they came to Philip,
JHN.12.22	Philip went and told Andrew;
JHN.12.23	Jesus replied to them, 
JHN.12.28	Then a voice
JHN.12.29	The crowd standing there heard it and said it was thunder. Others said, “An angel has spoken to him.”
JHN.12.30	Jesus responded, 
JHN.12.33	He said this to indicate what kind of death he was about to die.
JHN.12.34	Then the crowd replied to him, “We have heard from the law that the Messiah will remain forever.
JHN.12.35	Jesus answered, 
JHN.12.37	Even though he had performed so many signs in their presence, they did not believe in him. 
JHN.12.38	This was to fulfill
JHN.12.39	This is why they were unable to believe, because Isaiah also said:
JHN.12.41	Isaiah said these things because
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless, many did believe in him even among the rulers,
JHN.12.43	For they loved human praise
JHN.12.44	Jesus cried out, 
JHN.13.1	Before the Passover Festival, Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world to the Father.
JHN.13.2	Now when it was time for supper, the devil
JHN.13.3	Jesus knew that the Father had given everything into his hands,
JHN.13.4	So he got up from supper, laid aside his outer clothing,
JHN.13.5	Next, he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel tied around him.
JHN.13.6	He came to Simon Peter,
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.13.8	“You will never wash my feet,” Peter said.
JHN.13.8	Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.”
JHN.13.11	For he knew who would betray him. This is why he said, 
JHN.13.12	When Jesus had washed their feet and put on his outer clothing, he reclined again and said to them, 
JHN.13.21	When
JHN.13.22	The disciples started looking at one another — uncertain which one he was speaking about. 
JHN.13.23	One of his disciples, the one Jesus loved,
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter motioned to him to find out who it was he was talking about. 
JHN.13.25	So he leaned back against Jesus and asked him, “Lord, who is it?”
JHN.13.26	Jesus replied, 
JHN.13.27	After Judas ate the piece of bread, Satan
JHN.13.28	None of those reclining at the table knew why he said this to him. 
JHN.13.29	Since Judas
JHN.13.30	After receiving the piece of bread, he immediately left. And it was night.
JHN.13.31	When
JHN.13.36	“Lord,” Simon Peter said to him, “where are you going?”
JHN.13.36	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.37	“Lord,” Peter asked, “why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life
JHN.13.38	Jesus replied, 
JHN.14.5	“Lord,” Thomas
JHN.14.6	Jesus told him, 
JHN.14.8	“Lord,” said Philip,
JHN.14.9	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.14.22	Judas
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered, 
JHN.16.17	Then some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this he’s telling us: 
JHN.16.18	They said, “What is this he is saying,
JHN.16.19	Jesus knew they wanted to ask him, and so he said to them, 
JHN.16.29	His disciples said, “Look, now you’re speaking plainly and not using any figurative language. 
JHN.16.30	Now we know that you know everything
JHN.16.31	Jesus responded to them, 
JHN.17.1	Jesus spoke these things, looked up to heaven, and said: 
JHN.18.1	After
JHN.18.2	Judas,
JHN.18.3	So Judas took a company of soldiers and some officials
JHN.18.4	Then Jesus, knowing everything that was about to happen to him,
JHN.18.5	“Jesus of Nazareth,” they answered.
JHN.18.5	Judas, who betrayed him, was also standing with them. 
JHN.18.6	When Jesus told them, 
JHN.18.7	Then he asked them again, 
JHN.18.7	“Jesus of Nazareth,” they said.
JHN.18.9	This was to fulfill
JHN.18.10	Then Simon
JHN.18.11	At that, Jesus said to Peter, 
JHN.18.12	Then the company of soldiers, the commander, and the Jewish officials arrested Jesus and tied him up. 
JHN.18.13	First they led him to Annas,
JHN.18.14	Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that it would be better for one man to die for the people.
JHN.18.15	Simon Peter
JHN.18.16	But Peter remained standing outside by the door. So the other disciple, the one known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the girl who was the doorkeeper and brought Peter in.
JHN.18.17	Then the servant girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter, “You aren’t one of this man’s disciples too, are you?”
JHN.18.17	“I am not.” he said. 
JHN.18.18	Now the servants and the officials had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold. They were standing there warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, warming himself.
JHN.18.19	The high priest
JHN.18.22	When he had said these things, one of the officials standing by slapped Jesus, saying, “Is this the way you answer the high priest?”
JHN.18.24	Then
JHN.18.25	Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said to him, “You aren’t one of his disciples too, are you?”
JHN.18.25	He denied it and said, “I am not.”
JHN.18.26	One of the high priest’s servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Didn’t I see you with him in the garden?” 
JHN.18.27	Peter denied it again. Immediately a rooster crowed.
JHN.18.28	Then
JHN.18.29	So Pilate
JHN.18.30	They answered him, “If this man weren’t a criminal,
JHN.18.31	Pilate told them, “You take him and judge him according to your law.”
JHN.18.31	“It’s not legal for us to put anyone to death,” the Jews declared. 
JHN.18.32	They said this so that Jesus’s words might be fulfilled indicating what kind of death he was going to die.
JHN.18.33	Then Pilate went back into the headquarters, summoned Jesus, and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 
JHN.18.34	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.35	“I’m not a Jew, am I?” Pilate replied. “Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What have you done?”
JHN.18.37	“You are a king then?” Pilate asked.
JHN.18.38	“What is truth?” said Pilate.
JHN.18.38	After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, “I find no grounds
JHN.18.39	You
JHN.18.40	They shouted back, “Not this man, but Barabbas!” 
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. 
JHN.19.2	The soldiers also twisted together a crown
JHN.19.3	And they kept coming up to him
JHN.19.4	Pilate went outside again and said to them, “Look, I’m bringing him out to you to let you know I find no grounds
JHN.19.5	Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe.
JHN.19.6	When the chief priests and the temple servants
JHN.19.6	Pilate responded, “Take him and crucify him yourselves, since I find no grounds for charging him.”
JHN.19.7	“We have a law,” the Jews replied to him, “and according to that law he ought to die,
JHN.19.8	When Pilate heard this statement, he was more afraid than ever. 
JHN.19.9	He went back into the headquarters
JHN.19.10	So Pilate said to him, “Do you refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know that I have the authority to release you and the authority to crucify you?”
JHN.19.12	From that moment Pilate kept trying
JHN.19.13	When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside. He sat down on the judge’s seat in a place called the Stone Pavement (but in Aramaic,
JHN.19.14	It was the preparation day for the Passover, and it was about noon.
JHN.19.15	They shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!”
JHN.19.15	Pilate said to them, “Should I crucify your king?”
JHN.19.15	“We have no king but Caesar!” the chief priests answered.
JHN.19.16	Then he handed him over to be crucified.
JHN.19.16	Then they took Jesus away.
JHN.19.17	Carrying
JHN.19.18	There they crucified him and two others with him, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle. 
JHN.19.19	Pilate also had a sign made and put on the cross. It said: J
JHN.19.20	Many of the Jews read this sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city,
JHN.19.21	So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews,’
JHN.19.22	Pilate replied, “What I have written, I have written.”
JHN.19.23	When the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, a part for each soldier. They also took the tunic, which was seamless, woven in one piece from the top. 
JHN.19.24	So they said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it, to see who gets it.” This happened that the Scripture
JHN.19.25	Standing
JHN.19.26	When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple he loved
JHN.19.27	Then he said to the disciple, 
JHN.19.28	After
JHN.19.29	A jar full of sour wine was sitting there; so they fixed a sponge full of sour wine on a hyssop branch
JHN.19.30	When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, 
JHN.19.31	Since it was the preparation day,
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other one who had been crucified with him. 
JHN.19.33	When they came to Jesus, they did not break his legs since they saw that he was already dead.
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers pierced
JHN.19.35	He who saw this has testified
JHN.19.36	For these things happened so that the Scripture would be fulfilled:
JHN.19.37	Also, another Scripture says: 
JHN.19.38	After
JHN.19.39	Nicodemus
JHN.19.40	They took Jesus’s body
JHN.19.41	There was a garden in the place where he was crucified. A new tomb was in the garden; no one had yet been placed in it. 
JHN.19.42	They placed Jesus there because of the Jewish day of preparation and since the tomb was nearby.
JHN.20.1	On
JHN.20.2	So she went running to Simon Peter
JHN.20.3	At that, Peter and the other disciple went out, heading for the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and got to the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	Stooping down, he saw the linen cloths
JHN.20.6	Then, following him, Simon Peter also came. He entered the tomb and saw the linen cloths lying there. 
JHN.20.7	The wrapping
JHN.20.8	The other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, then also went in, saw, and believed. 
JHN.20.9	For they did not yet understand the Scripture
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples returned to the place where they were staying.
JHN.20.11	But
JHN.20.12	She saw two angels
JHN.20.13	They said to her, “Woman, why are you crying?”
JHN.20.13	“Because they’ve taken away my Lord,”
JHN.20.14	Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know it was Jesus.
JHN.20.15	 Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.15	Supposing he was the gardener, she replied, “Sir, if you’ve carried him away, tell me where you’ve put him, and I will take him away.”
JHN.20.16	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.16	Turning around, she said to him in Aramaic,
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” 
JHN.20.19	When it was evening of that first day of the week,
JHN.20.20	Having said this, he showed them his hands and his side.
JHN.20.21	Jesus said to them again, 
JHN.20.22	After saying this, he breathed on them
JHN.20.24	But Thomas
JHN.20.25	So the other disciples were telling him, “We’ve seen the Lord!”
JHN.20.25	But he said to them, “If I don’t see the mark of the nails in his hands, put my finger into the mark of the nails,
JHN.20.26	A week later his disciples were indoors again, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 
JHN.20.27	Then he said to Thomas, 
JHN.20.28	Thomas responded to him, “My Lord and my God!”
JHN.20.29	Jesus said, 
JHN.20.30	Jesus performed many other signs
JHN.20.31	But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah,
JHN.21.1	After this, Jesus revealed
JHN.21.2	Simon Peter,
JHN.21.3	“I’m going fishing,” Simon Peter said to them.
JHN.21.3	“We’re coming with you,” they told him. They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.
JHN.21.4	When daybreak came, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not know it was Jesus.
JHN.21.5	 Jesus called to them, 
JHN.21.5	“No,” they answered.
JHN.21.7	The disciple, the one Jesus loved, said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” 
JHN.21.7	When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he tied his outer clothing around him (for he had taken it off) and plunged into the sea. 
JHN.21.8	Since they were not far from land (about a hundred yards
JHN.21.9	When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish lying on it, and bread. 
JHN.21.10	 Jesus told them. 
JHN.21.11	So Simon Peter climbed up and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish — 153 of them. Even though there were so many, the net was not torn.
JHN.21.13	Jesus came, took the bread, and gave it to them. He did the same with the fish. 
JHN.21.14	This was now the third time
JHN.21.15	When they had eaten breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, 
JHN.21.15	“Yes, Lord,” he said to him, “you know that I love you.”
JHN.21.16	A second time he asked him, 
JHN.21.16	“Yes, Lord,” he said to him, “you know that I love you.”
JHN.21.17	He asked him the third time, 
JHN.21.17	Peter was grieved
JHN.21.19	He said this to indicate by what kind of death
JHN.21.20	So Peter turned around and saw the disciple Jesus loved
JHN.21.21	When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”
JHN.21.23	So this rumor
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.
JHN.21.25	And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which, if every one of them were written down, I suppose not even the world itself could contain the books
ACT.1.1	I wrote the first narrative, Theophilus, about all that Jesus began to do and teach
ACT.1.2	until the day he was taken up, after he had given instructions through the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
ACT.1.3	After he had suffered, he also presented himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them over a period of forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
ACT.1.4	While he was
ACT.1.6	So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time?”
ACT.1.7	He said to them, 
ACT.1.9	After he had said this, he was taken up as they were watching, and a cloud took him out of their sight. 
ACT.1.10	While he was going, they were gazing into heaven, and suddenly two men in white clothes stood by them.
ACT.1.11	They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up into heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken from you into heaven, will come in the same way that you have seen him going into heaven.”
ACT.1.12	Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem — a Sabbath day’s journey away. 
ACT.1.13	When they arrived, they went to the room
ACT.1.14	They all were continually united
ACT.1.15	In those days Peter stood up among the brothers and sisters
ACT.1.16	“Brothers and sisters, it was necessary that the Scripture be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit through the mouth of David foretold about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
ACT.1.17	For he was one of our number and shared in this ministry.”
ACT.1.18	Now this man acquired a field with his unrighteous wages. He fell headfirst, his body burst open and his intestines spilled out.
ACT.1.19	This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that in their own language that field is called 
ACT.1.20	“For it is written in the Book of Psalms:
ACT.1.21	“Therefore, from among the men who have accompanied us during the whole time the Lord Jesus went in and out among us —  
ACT.1.22	beginning from the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us — from among these, it is necessary that one become a witness with us of his resurrection.”
ACT.1.23	So they proposed two: Joseph, called Barsabbas, who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.
ACT.1.24	Then they prayed,
ACT.1.25	to take the place
ACT.1.26	Then they cast lots
ACT.2.1	When the day of Pentecost had arrived, they were all together in one place.
ACT.2.2	Suddenly a sound like that of a violent rushing wind
ACT.2.3	They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated and rested on each one of them. 
ACT.2.4	Then they were all filled
ACT.2.5	Now there were Jews staying in Jerusalem, devout people from every nation
ACT.2.6	When this sound occurred, a crowd came together and was confused because each one heard them speaking in his own language. 
ACT.2.7	They were astounded and amazed, saying,
ACT.2.8	How is it that each of us can hear them in our own native language? 
ACT.2.9	Parthians, Medes, Elamites; those who live in Mesopotamia, in Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
ACT.2.10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya near Cyrene; visitors from Rome (both Jews and converts),
ACT.2.11	Cretans and Arabs — we hear them declaring the magnificent acts of God in our own tongues.” 
ACT.2.12	They were all astounded and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?” 
ACT.2.13	But some sneered and said, “They’re drunk on new wine.”
ACT.2.14	Peter stood up with the Eleven, raised his voice, and proclaimed to them: “Fellow Jews and all you residents of Jerusalem, let me explain this to you and pay attention to my words. 
ACT.2.15	For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it’s only nine in the morning.
ACT.2.16	On the contrary, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:
ACT.2.17	that 
ACT.2.18	and they will prophesy.
ACT.2.22	“Fellow Israelites, listen to these words: This Jesus of Nazareth was a man attested to you by God with miracles, wonders, and signs that God did among you through him, just as you yourselves know.
ACT.2.23	Though he was delivered up according to God’s determined plan and foreknowledge, you used
ACT.2.24	God raised him up, ending the pains of death,
ACT.2.25	For David says of him:
ACT.2.29	“Brothers and sisters, I can confidently speak to you about the patriarch David: He is both dead and buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
ACT.2.30	Since he was a prophet, he knew that God had sworn an oath to him to seat one of his descendants
ACT.2.31	Seeing what was to come, he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Messiah: 
ACT.2.32	“God has raised
ACT.2.33	Therefore, since he has been exalted to the right hand of God
ACT.2.34	For it was not David who ascended into the heavens, but he himself says:
ACT.2.36	“Therefore let all the house of Israel know with certainty that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah.”
ACT.2.37	When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles: “Brothers, what should we do?” 
ACT.2.38	Peter replied, “Repent
ACT.2.39	For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all who are far off,
ACT.2.40	With many other words he testified and strongly urged them, saying, “Be saved from this corrupt
ACT.2.41	So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand people were added to them.
ACT.2.42	They devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching,
ACT.2.43	Everyone was filled with awe, and many wonders and signs were being performed through the apostles.
ACT.2.44	Now all the believers were together and held all things in common.
ACT.2.45	They sold their possessions and property and distributed the proceeds to all, as any had need. 
ACT.2.46	Every day they devoted themselves to meeting together in the temple, and broke bread from house to house. They ate their food with joyful and sincere hearts,
ACT.2.47	praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people. Every day the Lord added to their number
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John were going up to the temple for the time of prayer
ACT.3.2	A man who was lame from birth was being carried there. He was placed each day at the temple gate called Beautiful, so that he could beg from those entering the temple.
ACT.3.3	When he saw Peter and John about to enter the temple, he asked for money. 
ACT.3.4	Peter, along with John, looked straight at him and said, “Look at us.” 
ACT.3.5	So he turned to them, expecting to get something from them. 
ACT.3.6	But Peter said, “I don’t have silver or gold, but what I do have, I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, get up and walk!” 
ACT.3.7	Then, taking him by the right hand he raised him up, and at once his feet and ankles became strong. 
ACT.3.8	So he jumped up and started to walk, and he entered the temple with them — walking, leaping, and praising God.
ACT.3.9	All the people saw him walking and praising God, 
ACT.3.10	and they recognized that he was the one who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. So they were filled with awe and astonishment at what had happened to him.
ACT.3.11	While he
ACT.3.12	When Peter saw this, he addressed the people: “Fellow Israelites, why are you amazed at this? Why do you stare at us, as though we had made him walk by our own power or godliness? 
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors,
ACT.3.14	You denied the Holy and Righteous One
ACT.3.15	You killed the source
ACT.3.16	By faith in his name, his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know. So the faith that comes through Jesus has given him this perfect health in front of all of you.
ACT.3.17	“And now, brothers and sisters, I know that you acted in ignorance, just as your leaders also did.
ACT.3.18	In this way God fulfilled what he had predicted through all the prophets — that his Messiah would suffer.
ACT.3.19	Therefore repent
ACT.3.20	that seasons of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send Jesus, who has been appointed
ACT.3.21	Heaven must receive him until the time of the restoration of all things, which God spoke about through his holy prophets from the beginning.
ACT.3.22	Moses said:
ACT.3.24	“In addition, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those after him, have also foretold these days. 
ACT.3.25	You are the sons
ACT.3.26	God raised up his servant
ACT.4.1	While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple police, and the Sadducees confronted them,
ACT.4.2	because they were annoyed that they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.
ACT.4.3	So they seized them and took them into custody until the next day since it was already evening. 
ACT.4.4	But many of those who heard the message believed, and the number of the men
ACT.4.5	The next day, their rulers, elders, and scribes assembled in Jerusalem 
ACT.4.6	with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and all the members of the high-priestly family.
ACT.4.7	After they had Peter and John stand before them, they began to question them: “By what power or in what name have you done this?”
ACT.4.8	Then Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit and said to them, “Rulers of the people and elders:
ACT.4.9	If we are being examined today about a good deed done to a disabled man, by what means he was healed, 
ACT.4.10	let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified and whom God raised from the dead — by him this man is standing here before you healthy.
ACT.4.11	This Jesus is
ACT.4.12	There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to people by which we must be saved.”
ACT.4.13	When they observed the boldness of Peter and John and realized that they were uneducated and untrained men, they were amazed and recognized that they had been with Jesus.
ACT.4.14	And since they saw the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say in opposition. 
ACT.4.15	After they ordered them to leave the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves, 
ACT.4.16	saying, “What should we do with these men? For an obvious sign has been done through them, clear to everyone living in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
ACT.4.17	But so that this does not spread any further among the people, let’s threaten them against speaking to anyone in this name again.” 
ACT.4.18	So they called for them and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
ACT.4.19	Peter and John answered them, “Whether it’s right in the sight of God for us to listen to you rather than to God, you decide;
ACT.4.20	for we are unable to stop speaking about what we have seen and heard.”
ACT.4.21	After threatening them further, they released them. They found no way to punish them because the people were all giving glory to God over what had been done.
ACT.4.22	For this sign of healing had been performed on a man over forty years old.
ACT.4.23	After they were released, they went to their own people and reported everything the chief priests and the elders had said to them. 
ACT.4.24	When they heard this, they raised their voices together to God and said, “Master, you are the one who made the heaven, the earth, and the sea, and everything in them.
ACT.4.25	You said through the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of our father David your servant:
ACT.4.27	“For, in fact, in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, assembled together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,
ACT.4.28	to do whatever your hand and your will had predestined to take place. 
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, consider their threats, and grant that your servants may speak your word with all boldness,
ACT.4.30	while you stretch out your hand for healing, and signs and wonders
ACT.4.31	When they had prayed, the place where they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God boldly.
ACT.4.32	Now the entire group of those who believed were of one heart and mind, and no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own, but instead they held everything in common.
ACT.4.33	With great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on all of them.
ACT.4.34	For there was not a needy person among them because all those who owned lands or houses sold them, brought the proceeds of what was sold,
ACT.4.35	and laid them at the apostles’ feet. This was then distributed to each person as any had need.
ACT.4.36	Joseph, a Levite from Cyprus by birth, the one the apostles called Barnabas (which is translated Son of Encouragement),
ACT.4.37	sold a field he owned, brought the money, and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
ACT.5.1	But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property. 
ACT.5.2	However, he kept back part of the proceeds with his wife’s knowledge, and brought a portion of it and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
ACT.5.3	“Ananias,” Peter asked, “why has Satan filled your heart
ACT.5.4	Wasn’t it yours while you possessed it? And after it was sold, wasn’t it at your disposal? Why is it that you planned this thing in your heart? You have not lied to people but to God.” 
ACT.5.5	When he heard these words, Ananias dropped dead, and a great fear came on all who heard.
ACT.5.6	The young men got up, wrapped his body, carried him out, and buried him.
ACT.5.7	About three hours later, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	“Tell me,” Peter asked her, “did you sell the land for this price?”
ACT.5.8	“Yes,” she said, “for that price.”
ACT.5.9	Then Peter said to her, “Why did you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.”
ACT.5.10	Instantly she dropped dead at his feet. When the young men came in, they found her dead, carried her out, and buried her beside her husband. 
ACT.5.11	Then great fear came on the whole church and on all who heard these things.
ACT.5.12	Many signs and wonders were being done among the people through the hands of the apostles.
ACT.5.13	No one else dared to join them, but the people spoke well of them.
ACT.5.14	Believers were added to the Lord in increasing numbers — multitudes of both men and women. 
ACT.5.15	As a result, they would carry the sick out into the streets and lay them on cots and mats so that when Peter came by, at least his shadow
ACT.5.16	In addition, a multitude came together from the towns surrounding Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those who were tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
ACT.5.17	Then the high priest rose up. He and all who were with him, who belonged to the party of the Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
ACT.5.18	So they arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
ACT.5.19	But an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail during the night, brought them out, and said,
ACT.5.20	“Go and stand in the temple, and tell the people all about this life.”
ACT.5.21	Hearing this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach.
ACT.5.21	When the high priest and those who were with him arrived, they convened the Sanhedrin — the full council of the Israelites — and sent orders to the jail to have them brought.
ACT.5.22	But when the servants
ACT.5.23	“We found the jail securely locked, with the guards standing in front of the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.” 
ACT.5.24	As
ACT.5.25	Someone came and reported to them, “Look! The men you put in jail are standing in the temple and teaching the people.” 
ACT.5.26	Then the commander went with the servants and brought them in without force, because they were afraid the people might stone them.
ACT.5.27	After they brought them in, they had them stand before the Sanhedrin, and the high priest asked, 
ACT.5.28	“Didn’t we strictly order you not to teach in this name?
ACT.5.29	Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than people. 
ACT.5.30	The God of our ancestors raised up Jesus,
ACT.5.31	God exalted this man to his right hand as ruler and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
ACT.5.32	We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit
ACT.5.33	When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.
ACT.5.34	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the Sanhedrin and ordered the men
ACT.5.35	He said to them, “Men of Israel, be careful about what you’re about to do to these men. 
ACT.5.36	Some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a group of about four hundred men rallied to him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and came to nothing.
ACT.5.37	After this man, Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and attracted a following. He also perished, and all his followers were scattered. 
ACT.5.38	So in the present case, I tell you, stay away from these men and leave them alone. For if this plan or this work is of human origin, it will fail;
ACT.5.39	but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You may even be found fighting against God.” They were persuaded by him.
ACT.5.40	After they called in the apostles and had them flogged, they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and released them.
ACT.5.41	Then they went out from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be treated shamefully on behalf of the Name.
ACT.5.42	Every day in the temple, and in various homes, they continued teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Messiah.
ACT.6.1	In those days, as the disciples
ACT.6.2	The Twelve summoned the whole company of the disciples and said, “It would not be right for us to give up preaching the word of God to wait on tables. 
ACT.6.3	Brothers and sisters, select from among you seven men of good reputation,
ACT.6.4	But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” 
ACT.6.5	This proposal pleased the whole company. So they chose Stephen,
ACT.6.6	They had them stand before the apostles, who prayed
ACT.6.7	So the word of God spread, the disciples in Jerusalem increased
ACT.6.8	Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people. 
ACT.6.9	Opposition arose, however, from some members of the Freedmen’s Synagogue, composed of both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, and some from Cilicia and Asia, and they began to argue with Stephen. 
ACT.6.10	But they were unable to stand up against his wisdom and the Spirit by whom he was speaking.
ACT.6.11	Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, “We heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.”
ACT.6.12	They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes; so they came, seized him, and took him to the Sanhedrin. 
ACT.6.13	They also presented false witnesses who said, “This man never stops speaking against this holy place and the law.
ACT.6.14	For we heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”
ACT.6.15	And all who were sitting in the Sanhedrin looked intently at him and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	“Are these things true?” the high priest asked.
ACT.7.2	“Brothers and fathers,” he replied, “listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran,
ACT.7.3	and said to him: 
ACT.7.4	“Then he left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. From there, after his father died, God had him move to this land in which you are now living.
ACT.7.5	He didn’t give him an inheritance in it — not even a foot of ground — but he promised to give it to him as a possession, and to his descendants after him,
ACT.7.6	God spoke in this way: His 
ACT.7.7	 God said. 
ACT.7.8	And so he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. After this, he fathered Isaac and circumcised
ACT.7.9	“The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him into Egypt, but God was with him
ACT.7.10	and rescued him out of all his troubles. He gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler over Egypt and over his whole household.
ACT.7.11	Now a famine and great suffering came over all of Egypt and Canaan,
ACT.7.12	When Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there the first time. 
ACT.7.13	The second time, Joseph revealed himself to his brothers, and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh. 
ACT.7.14	Joseph invited his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five people in all,
ACT.7.15	and Jacob went down to Egypt. He and our ancestors died there,
ACT.7.16	were carried back to Shechem, and were placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
ACT.7.17	“As the time was approaching to fulfill the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people flourished and multiplied in Egypt
ACT.7.18	until a different king who did not know Joseph ruled over Egypt.
ACT.7.19	He dealt deceitfully with our race and oppressed our ancestors by making them abandon their infants outside so that they wouldn’t survive.
ACT.7.20	At this time Moses was born, and he was beautiful in God’s sight. He was cared for in his father’s home for three months. 
ACT.7.21	When he was put outside, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted and raised him as her own son.
ACT.7.22	So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his speech and actions.
ACT.7.23	“When he was forty years old, he decided to visit his own people, the Israelites. 
ACT.7.24	When he saw one of them being mistreated, he came to his rescue and avenged the oppressed man by striking down the Egyptian. 
ACT.7.25	He assumed his people would understand that God would give them deliverance through him, but they did not understand. 
ACT.7.26	The next day he showed up while they were fighting and tried to reconcile them peacefully, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why are you mistreating each other? ’ 
ACT.7.27	“But the one who was mistreating his neighbor pushed Moses aside, saying: 
ACT.7.29	“When he heard this, Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.
ACT.7.30	After forty years had passed, an angel
ACT.7.31	When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight. As he was approaching to look at it, the voice of the Lord came: 
ACT.7.32	 Moses began to tremble and did not dare to look.
ACT.7.33	“The Lord said to him: 
ACT.7.35	“This Moses, whom they rejected when they said, 
ACT.7.36	This man led them out and performed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt,
ACT.7.37	“This is the Moses who said to the Israelites: 
ACT.7.38	He is the one who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors.
ACT.7.39	Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him. Instead, they pushed him aside, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.
ACT.7.40	They told Aaron: 
ACT.7.41	They even made a calf in those days, offered sacrifice to the idol, and were celebrating what their hands had made.
ACT.7.42	God turned away
ACT.7.44	“Our ancestors had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.
ACT.7.45	Our ancestors in turn received it and with Joshua brought it in when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before them,
ACT.7.46	He found favor in God’s sight and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the God
ACT.7.47	It was Solomon, rather, who built him a house,
ACT.7.48	but the Most High does not dwell in sanctuaries made with hands, as the prophet says:
ACT.7.51	“You stiff-necked
ACT.7.52	Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute?
ACT.7.53	You received the law under the direction of angels
ACT.7.54	When they heard these things, they were enraged
ACT.7.55	Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven. He saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
ACT.7.56	He said, “Look, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” 
ACT.7.57	They yelled at the top of their voices, covered their ears, and together rushed against him. 
ACT.7.58	They dragged him out of the city and began to stone
ACT.7.59	While they were stoning Stephen, he called out: “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” 
ACT.7.60	He knelt down and cried out with a loud voice,
ACT.8.1	Saul agreed with putting him to death.
ACT.8.1	On that day a severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout the land of Judea and Samaria.
ACT.8.2	Devout men buried Stephen and mourned deeply over him. 
ACT.8.3	Saul,
ACT.8.4	So those who were scattered went on their way preaching the word. 
ACT.8.5	Philip went down to a
ACT.8.6	The crowds were all paying attention to what Philip said, as they listened and saw the signs he was performing. 
ACT.8.7	For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who were possessed, and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.
ACT.8.8	So there was great joy in that city.
ACT.8.9	A man named Simon had previously practiced sorcery in that city and amazed the Samaritan people, while claiming to be somebody great.
ACT.8.10	They all paid attention to him, from the least of them to the greatest, and they said, “This man is called the Great Power of God.”
ACT.8.11	They were attentive to him because he had amazed them with his sorceries for a long time. 
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip, as he proclaimed the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized.
ACT.8.13	Even Simon himself believed. And after he was baptized, he followed Philip everywhere and was amazed as he observed the signs and great miracles
ACT.8.14	When the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
ACT.8.15	After they went down there, they prayed for them so the Samaritans might receive the Holy Spirit because he had not yet come down on any of them. 
ACT.8.16	(They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
ACT.8.17	Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
ACT.8.18	When Simon saw that the Spirit
ACT.8.19	saying, “Give me this power also so that anyone I lay hands on may receive the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.8.20	But Peter told him, “May your silver be destroyed with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
ACT.8.21	You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart is not right before God.
ACT.8.22	Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, your heart’s intent may be forgiven. 
ACT.8.23	For I see you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by wickedness.”
ACT.8.24	“Pray to the Lord for me,” Simon replied, “so that nothing you have said may happen to me.”
ACT.8.25	So, after they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they traveled back to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
ACT.8.26	An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip: “Get up and go south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is the desert road.
ACT.8.27	So he got up and went. There was an Ethiopian man, a eunuch
ACT.8.28	and was sitting in his chariot on his way home, reading the prophet Isaiah aloud.
ACT.8.29	The Spirit told Philip, “Go and join that chariot.”
ACT.8.30	When Philip ran up to it, he heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, “Do you understand what you’re reading?”
ACT.8.31	“How can I,” he said, “unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. 
ACT.8.32	Now the Scripture passage he was reading was this:
ACT.8.34	The eunuch said to Philip, “I ask you, who is the prophet saying this about — himself or someone else?” 
ACT.8.35	Philip proceeded to tell him the good news about Jesus, beginning with that Scripture.
ACT.8.36	As they were traveling down the road, they came to some water. The eunuch said, “Look, there’s water. What would keep me from being baptized?” 
ACT.8.38	So he ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord
ACT.8.40	Philip appeared in
ACT.9.1	Now Saul was still breathing threats and murder against the disciples
ACT.9.2	and requested letters
ACT.9.3	As
ACT.9.4	Falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, 
ACT.9.5	“Who are you, Lord?” Saul said.
ACT.9.7	The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the sound but seeing no one.
ACT.9.8	Saul got up from the ground, and though his eyes were open, he could see nothing. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	He was unable to see for three days and did not eat or drink.
ACT.9.10	There was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, 
ACT.9.10	“Here I am, Lord,” he replied.
ACT.9.13	“Lord,” Ananias answered, “I have heard from many people about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem.
ACT.9.14	And he has authority here from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name.”
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said to him, 
ACT.9.17	Ananias went and entered the house. He placed his hands on him and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road you were traveling, has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.9.18	At once something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was baptized. 
ACT.9.19	And after taking some food, he regained his strength.
ACT.9.19	Saul was with the disciples in Damascus for some time. 
ACT.9.20	Immediately he began proclaiming Jesus in the synagogues: “He is the Son of God.”
ACT.9.21	All who heard him were astounded and said, “Isn’t this the man in Jerusalem who was causing havoc for those who called on this name and came here for the purpose of taking them as prisoners to the chief priests?” 
ACT.9.22	But Saul grew stronger and kept confounding the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Messiah.
ACT.9.23	After many days had passed, the Jews conspired to kill him, 
ACT.9.24	but Saul learned of their plot. So they were watching the gates day and night intending to kill him,
ACT.9.25	but his disciples took him by night and lowered him in a large basket through an opening in the wall.
ACT.9.26	When he arrived in Jerusalem,
ACT.9.27	Barnabas, however, took him and brought him to the apostles and explained to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and that the Lord had talked to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly
ACT.9.28	Saul was coming and going with them in Jerusalem, speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. 
ACT.9.29	He conversed and debated with the Hellenistic Jews, but they tried to kill him.
ACT.9.30	When the brothers found out, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	So the church
ACT.9.32	As Peter was traveling from place to place, he also came down to the saints
ACT.9.33	There he found a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years. 
ACT.9.34	Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Get up and make your bed,”
ACT.9.35	So all who lived in Lydda and Sharon
ACT.9.36	In Joppa
ACT.9.37	About that time she became sick and died. After washing her, they placed her in a room upstairs. 
ACT.9.38	Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to him who urged him, “Don’t delay in coming with us.” 
ACT.9.39	Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they led him to the room upstairs. And all the widows approached him, weeping and showing him the robes and clothes that Dorcas had made while she was with them. 
ACT.9.40	Peter sent them all out of the room. He knelt down, prayed, and turning toward the body said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, saw Peter, and sat up.
ACT.9.41	He gave her his hand and helped her stand up. He called the saints and widows and presented her alive. 
ACT.9.42	This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	Peter stayed for some time in Joppa with Simon,
ACT.10.1	There was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment.
ACT.10.2	He was a devout man and feared God along with his whole household. He did many charitable deeds for the Jewish people and always prayed to God.
ACT.10.3	About three in the afternoon
ACT.10.4	Staring at him in awe, he said, “What is it, Lord?”
ACT.10.4	The angel told him, “Your prayers and your acts of charity have ascended as a memorial offering before God.
ACT.10.5	Now send men to Joppa and call for Simon, who is also named Peter. 
ACT.10.6	He is lodging with Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.”
ACT.10.7	When the angel who spoke to him had gone, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier, who was one of those who attended him. 
ACT.10.8	After explaining everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	The
ACT.10.10	He became hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing something, he fell into a trance. 
ACT.10.11	He saw heaven opened
ACT.10.12	In it were all the four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth, and the birds of the sky. 
ACT.10.13	A voice said to him, 
ACT.10.14	“No, Lord!” Peter said. “For I have never eaten anything impure and ritually unclean.”
ACT.10.15	Again, a second time, the voice said to him, 
ACT.10.16	This happened three times, and suddenly the object was taken up into heaven.
ACT.10.17	While Peter was deeply perplexed about what the vision he had seen might mean, right away the men who had been sent by Cornelius, having asked directions to Simon’s house, stood at the gate. 
ACT.10.18	They called out, asking if Simon, who was also named Peter, was lodging there.
ACT.10.19	While Peter was thinking about the vision, the Spirit told him, “Three men are here looking for you.
ACT.10.20	Get up, go downstairs, and go with them with no doubts at all, because I have sent them.”
ACT.10.21	Then Peter went down to the men and said, “Here I am, the one you’re looking for. What is the reason you’re here?”
ACT.10.22	They said, “Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who has a good reputation with the whole Jewish nation, was divinely directed by a holy angel to call you to his house and to hear a message from you.”
ACT.10.23	Peter then invited them in and gave them lodging.
ACT.10.23	The next day he got up and set out with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went with him.
ACT.10.24	The following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him.
ACT.10.26	But Peter lifted him up and said, “Stand up. I myself am also a man.”
ACT.10.27	While talking with him, he went in and found a large gathering of people. 
ACT.10.28	Peter said to them, “You know it’s forbidden for a Jewish man to associate with or visit a foreigner,
ACT.10.29	That’s why I came without any objection when I was sent for. So may I ask why you sent for me?”
ACT.10.30	Cornelius replied, “Four days ago at this hour, at three in the afternoon,
ACT.10.31	and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your acts of charity have been remembered in God’s sight. 
ACT.10.32	Therefore send someone to Joppa and invite Simon here, who is also named Peter. He is lodging in Simon the tanner’s house by the sea.’
ACT.10.33	So I immediately sent for you, and it was good of you to come. So now we are all in the presence of God to hear everything you have been commanded by the Lord.”
ACT.10.34	Peter began to speak: “Now I truly understand that God doesn’t show favoritism,
ACT.10.35	but in every nation the person who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. 
ACT.10.36	He sent the message to the Israelites, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ — he is Lord of all.
ACT.10.37	You know the events that took place throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John preached: 
ACT.10.38	how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went about doing good and healing all who were under the tyranny of the devil, because God was with him.
ACT.10.39	We ourselves are witnesses of everything he did in both the Judean country and in Jerusalem, and yet they killed him by hanging him on a tree.
ACT.10.40	God raised up this man on the third day and caused him to be seen, 
ACT.10.41	not by all the people, but by us whom God appointed as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
ACT.10.42	He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be the judge of the living and the dead.
ACT.10.43	All the prophets testify
ACT.10.44	While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came down
ACT.10.45	The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were amazed because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles.
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speaking in other tongues
ACT.10.46	Then Peter responded, 
ACT.10.47	“Can anyone withhold water and prevent these people from being baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?” 
ACT.10.48	He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.
ACT.11.1	The apostles and the brothers and sisters who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God. 
ACT.11.2	When Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him,
ACT.11.3	saying, “You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them.”
ACT.11.4	Peter began to explain to them step by step: 
ACT.11.5	“I
ACT.11.6	When I looked closely and considered it, I saw the four-footed animals of the earth, the wild beasts, the reptiles, and the birds of the sky. 
ACT.11.7	I also heard a voice telling me, 
ACT.11.8	“‘No, Lord! ’ I said. ‘For nothing impure or ritually unclean has ever entered my mouth.’ 
ACT.11.9	But a voice answered from heaven a second time, 
ACT.11.10	“Now this happened three times, and everything was drawn up again into heaven. 
ACT.11.11	At that very moment, three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were. 
ACT.11.12	The Spirit told me to accompany them with no doubts at all. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we went into the man’s house.
ACT.11.13	He reported to us how he had seen the angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send
ACT.11.14	He will speak a message to you by which you and all your household
ACT.11.15	“As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came down on them, just as on us at the beginning.
ACT.11.16	I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 
ACT.11.17	If, then, God gave them the same gift that he also gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, how could I possibly hinder God?” 
ACT.11.18	When they heard this they became silent. And they glorified God, saying, “So then, God has given repentance resulting in life even to the Gentiles.”
ACT.11.19	Now those who had been scattered as a result of the persecution that started because of Stephen made their way as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch,
ACT.11.20	But there were some of them, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began speaking to the Greeks
ACT.11.21	The Lord’s hand was with them, and a large number who believed turned to the Lord.
ACT.11.22	News about them reached
ACT.11.23	When he arrived and saw the grace of God, he was glad and encouraged all of them to remain true to the Lord with devoted hearts,
ACT.11.24	for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit
ACT.11.25	Then he
ACT.11.26	and when he found him he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught large numbers. The disciples
ACT.11.27	In those days some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
ACT.11.28	One of them, named Agabus, stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine throughout the Roman world.
ACT.11.29	Each of the disciples, according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers and sisters who lived in Judea.
ACT.11.30	They did this, sending it to the elders
ACT.12.1	About that time King Herod violently attacked some who belonged to the church, 
ACT.12.2	and he executed James,
ACT.12.3	When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter too, during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
ACT.12.4	After the arrest, he put him in prison and assigned four squads of four soldiers each to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after the Passover. 
ACT.12.5	So Peter was kept in prison, but the church was praying fervently to God for him.
ACT.12.6	When Herod was about to bring him out for trial, that very night Peter, bound with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, while the sentries in front of the door guarded the prison. 
ACT.12.7	Suddenly an angel of the Lord
ACT.12.8	“Get dressed,” the angel told him, “and put on your sandals.” And he did. “Wrap your cloak around you,” he told him, “and follow me.” 
ACT.12.9	So he went out and followed, and he did not know that what the angel did was really happening, but he thought he was seeing a vision.
ACT.12.10	After they passed the first and second guards, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened to them by itself. They went outside and passed one street, and suddenly the angel left him.
ACT.12.11	When Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod’s grasp and from all that the Jewish people expected.”
ACT.12.12	As soon as he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark,
ACT.12.13	He knocked at the door of the outer gate, and a servant named Rhoda came to answer. 
ACT.12.14	She recognized Peter’s voice, and because of her joy, she did not open the gate but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the outer gate.
ACT.12.15	“You’re out of your mind!” they told her. But she kept insisting that it was true, and they said, “It’s his angel.”
ACT.12.16	Peter, however, kept on knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were amazed.
ACT.12.17	Motioning to them with his hand
ACT.12.18	At daylight, there was a great commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter. 
ACT.12.19	After Herod had searched and did not find him, he interrogated the guards and ordered their execution. Then Herod went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.
ACT.12.20	Herod had been very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. Together they presented themselves before him. After winning over Blastus, who was in charge of the king’s bedroom, they asked for peace, because their country was supplied with food from the king’s country.
ACT.12.21	On an appointed day, dressed in royal robes and seated on the throne, Herod delivered a speech to them. 
ACT.12.22	The assembled people began to shout, “It’s the voice of a god and not of a man!” 
ACT.12.23	At once an angel of the Lord
ACT.12.24	But the word of God flourished and multiplied.
ACT.12.25	After they had completed their relief mission, Barnabas and Saul returned to
ACT.13.1	Now in the church at Antioch there were prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, a close friend of Herod the tetrarch,
ACT.13.2	As they were worshiping
ACT.13.3	Then after they had fasted, prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them off.
ACT.13.4	So being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	Arriving in Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John as their assistant.
ACT.13.6	When they had traveled the whole island as far as Paphos, they came across a sorcerer, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
ACT.13.7	He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul and wanted to hear the word of God.
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the sorcerer (that is the meaning of his name) opposed
ACT.13.9	But Saul — also called Paul — filled with the Holy Spirit, stared straight at Elymas 
ACT.13.10	and said, “You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery, you son of the devil
ACT.13.11	Now, look, the Lord’s hand is against you.
ACT.13.12	Then, when he saw what happened, the proconsul believed, because he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia, but John left them and went back to Jerusalem.
ACT.13.14	They continued their journey from Perga and reached Pisidian Antioch. On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
ACT.13.15	After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent word to them, saying, “Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, you can speak.”
ACT.13.16	Paul stood up and motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites, and you who fear God, listen!
ACT.13.17	The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors, made the people prosper during their stay in the land of Egypt, and led them out of it with a mighty
ACT.13.18	And for about forty years he put up with them
ACT.13.19	and after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan,
ACT.13.20	This all took about 450 years. After this, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
ACT.13.21	Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
ACT.13.22	After removing him,
ACT.13.23	“From this man’s descendants, as he promised, God brought to Israel
ACT.13.24	Before his coming to public attention, John had previously proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
ACT.13.25	Now as John was completing his mission, he said, ‘Who do you think I am? I am not the one. But one is coming after me, and I am not worthy to untie the sandals on his feet.’
ACT.13.26	“Brothers and sisters, children of Abraham’s race, and those among you who fear God, it is to us that the word of this salvation has been sent.
ACT.13.27	Since the residents of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize him or the sayings of the prophets that are read every Sabbath, they have fulfilled their words by condemning him.
ACT.13.28	Though they found no grounds for the death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him killed.
ACT.13.29	When they had carried out all that had been written about him, they took him down from the tree and put him in a tomb.
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead,
ACT.13.31	and he appeared for many days to those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.
ACT.13.32	And we ourselves proclaim to you the good news of the promise that was made to our ancestors.
ACT.13.33	God has fulfilled this for us, their children, by raising up Jesus, as it is written in the second Psalm:
ACT.13.34	As to his raising him from the dead, never to return to decay, he has spoken in this way, 
ACT.13.35	Therefore he also says in another passage, 
ACT.13.36	For David, after serving God’s purpose in his own generation, fell asleep,
ACT.13.37	but the one God raised up did not decay. 
ACT.13.38	Therefore, let it be known to you, brothers and sisters, that through this man forgiveness of sins is being proclaimed to you.
ACT.13.39	Everyone who believes is justified
ACT.13.40	So beware that what is said in the prophets does not happen to you:
ACT.13.42	As they were leaving, the people
ACT.13.43	After the synagogue had been dismissed, many of the Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who were speaking with them and urging them to continue in the grace of God.
ACT.13.44	The following Sabbath almost the whole town assembled to hear the word of the Lord.
ACT.13.45	But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what Paul was saying, insulting him.
ACT.13.46	Paul and Barnabas boldly replied, “It was necessary that the word of God be spoken to you first. Since you reject it and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we are turning to the Gentiles.
ACT.13.47	For this is what the Lord has commanded us:
ACT.13.48	When the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and honored the word of the Lord, and all who had been appointed to eternal life believed. 
ACT.13.49	The word of the Lord spread through the whole region. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jews incited the prominent God-fearing women and the leading men of the city. They stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them from their district.
ACT.13.51	But Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
ACT.14.1	In Iconium they entered the Jewish synagogue, as usual, and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
ACT.14.2	But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
ACT.14.3	So they stayed there a long time and spoke boldly for the Lord, who testified to the message of his grace by enabling them to do signs and wonders.
ACT.14.4	But the people of the city were divided, some siding with the Jews and others with the apostles.
ACT.14.5	When an attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat and stone them, 
ACT.14.6	they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian towns of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding countryside.
ACT.14.7	There they continued preaching the gospel.
ACT.14.8	In Lystra a man was sitting who was without strength in his feet, had never walked, and had been lame from birth. 
ACT.14.9	He listened as Paul spoke. After looking directly at him and seeing that he had faith to be healed, 
ACT.14.10	Paul said in a loud voice, “Stand up on your feet!” And he jumped up and began to walk around.
ACT.14.11	When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted, saying in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!” 
ACT.14.12	Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. 
ACT.14.13	The priest of Zeus, whose temple was just outside the town, brought bulls and wreaths to the gates because he intended, with the crowds, to offer sacrifice.
ACT.14.14	The apostles Barnabas and Paul tore their robes when they heard this and rushed into the crowd, shouting:
ACT.14.15	“People! Why are you doing these things? We are people also, just like you, and we are proclaiming good news to you, that you turn from these worthless things
ACT.14.16	In past generations he allowed all the nations
ACT.14.17	although he did not leave himself without a witness,
ACT.14.18	Even though they said these things, they barely stopped the crowds from sacrificing to them.
ACT.14.19	Some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and when they won over the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, thinking he was dead.
ACT.14.20	After the disciples gathered around him, he got up and went into the town. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.
ACT.14.21	After they had preached the gospel in that town and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch,
ACT.14.22	strengthening the
ACT.14.23	When they had appointed elders
ACT.14.24	They passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	After they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 
ACT.14.26	From there they sailed back to Antioch where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had now completed.
ACT.14.27	After they arrived and gathered the church together, they reported everything God had done with them
ACT.14.28	And they spent a considerable time with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	Some men
ACT.15.2	After Paul and Barnabas had engaged them in serious argument and debate, Paul and Barnabas and some others were appointed to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about this issue.
ACT.15.3	When they had been sent on their way by the church,
ACT.15.4	When they arrived at Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported all that God had done with them.
ACT.15.5	But some of the believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “It is necessary to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses.”
ACT.15.6	The apostles and the elders gathered to consider this matter. 
ACT.15.7	After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them: “Brothers and sisters, you are aware that in the early days God made a choice among you,
ACT.15.8	And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he also did to us.
ACT.15.9	He made no distinction between us and them,
ACT.15.10	Now then, why are you testing God by putting a yoke on the disciples’ necks
ACT.15.11	On the contrary, we believe that we are saved through the grace
ACT.15.12	The whole assembly became silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul describe all the signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
ACT.15.13	After they stopped speaking, James responded: “Brothers and sisters, listen to me. 
ACT.15.14	Simeon
ACT.15.15	And the words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written:
ACT.15.19	Therefore, in my judgment, we should not cause difficulties for those among the Gentiles who turn to God, 
ACT.15.20	but instead we should write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality,
ACT.15.21	For since ancient times, Moses has had those who proclaim him in every city, and every Sabbath day he is read aloud in the synagogues.”
ACT.15.22	Then the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, decided to select men who were among them and to send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: Judas, called Barsabbas, and Silas,
ACT.15.23	They wrote:
ACT.15.23	“From the apostles and the elders, your brothers,
ACT.15.23	To the brothers and sisters among the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:
ACT.15.23	Greetings.
ACT.15.24	Since we have heard that some without our authorization went out from us
ACT.15.25	we have unanimously
ACT.15.26	who have risked their lives
ACT.15.27	Therefore we have sent Judas and Silas, who will personally report the same things by word of mouth. 
ACT.15.28	For it was the Holy Spirit’s decision — and ours — not to place further burdens on you beyond these requirements:
ACT.15.29	that you abstain from food offered to idols, from blood, from eating anything that has been strangled, and from sexual immorality.
ACT.15.29	Farewell.”
ACT.15.30	So they were sent off and went down to Antioch, and after gathering the assembly, they delivered the letter. 
ACT.15.31	When they read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. 
ACT.15.32	Both Judas and Silas, who were also prophets themselves, encouraged the brothers and sisters and strengthened them with a long message.
ACT.15.33	After spending some time there, they were sent back in peace
ACT.15.35	But Paul and Barnabas, along with many others, remained in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of the Lord.
ACT.15.36	After some time had passed, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s go back and visit the brothers and sisters in every town
ACT.15.37	Barnabas wanted to take along John Mark.
ACT.15.38	But Paul insisted that they should not take along this man who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them to the work. 
ACT.15.39	They had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company, and Barnabas took Mark
ACT.15.40	But Paul chose Silas and departed, after being commended by the brothers and sisters to the grace of the Lord.
ACT.15.41	He traveled through Syria
ACT.16.1	Paul went on to Derbe and Lystra, where there was a disciple named Timothy,
ACT.16.2	The brothers and sisters at Lystra and Iconium spoke highly of him.
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted Timothy to go with him; so he took him and circumcised
ACT.16.4	As they traveled through the towns, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem for the people to observe.
ACT.16.5	So the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers.
ACT.16.6	They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia; they had been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
ACT.16.7	When they came to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus
ACT.16.8	Passing by Mysia they went down to Troas.
ACT.16.9	During the night Paul had a vision in which a Macedonian man was standing and pleading with him, “Cross over to Macedonia and help us!” 
ACT.16.10	After
ACT.16.11	From Troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for Samothrace, the next day to Neapolis, 
ACT.16.12	and from there to Philippi,
ACT.16.13	On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate by the river, where we expected to find a place of prayer. We sat down and spoke to the women gathered there. 
ACT.16.14	A God-fearing woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, was listening. The Lord opened her heart to respond to what Paul was saying.
ACT.16.15	After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, “If you consider me a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house.”
ACT.16.16	Once, as we were on our way to prayer, a slave girl met us who had a spirit by which she predicted the future.
ACT.16.17	As she followed Paul and us she cried out, “These men, who are proclaiming to you
ACT.16.18	She did this for many days.
ACT.16.18	Paul was greatly annoyed. Turning to the spirit, he said, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out right away.
ACT.16.19	When her owners realized that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas
ACT.16.20	Bringing them before the chief magistrates, they said, “These men are seriously disturbing our city. They are Jews 
ACT.16.21	and are promoting customs that are not legal for us as Romans to adopt or practice.”
ACT.16.22	The crowd joined in the attack against them, and the chief magistrates stripped off their clothes and ordered them to be beaten with rods.
ACT.16.23	After they had severely flogged them, they threw them in jail, ordering the jailer to guard them carefully. 
ACT.16.24	Receiving such an order, he put them into the inner prison and secured their feet in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. 
ACT.16.26	Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the jail were shaken, and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone’s chains came loose.
ACT.16.27	When the jailer woke up and saw the doors of the prison standing open, he drew his sword and was going to kill himself, since he thought the prisoners had escaped.
ACT.16.28	But Paul called out in a loud voice, “Don’t harm yourself, because we’re all here!”
ACT.16.29	The jailer called for lights, rushed in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. 
ACT.16.30	He escorted them out and said, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” 
ACT.16.31	They said, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved — you and your household.”
ACT.16.32	And they spoke the word of the Lord to him along with everyone in his house. 
ACT.16.33	He took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds. Right away he and all his family were baptized. 
ACT.16.34	He brought them into his house, set a meal before them, and rejoiced because he had come to believe in God with his entire household.
ACT.16.35	When daylight came, the chief magistrates sent the police to say, “Release those men.”
ACT.16.36	The jailer reported these words to Paul: “The magistrates have sent orders for you to be released. So come out now and go in peace.”
ACT.16.37	But Paul said to them, “They beat us in public without a trial, although we are Roman citizens, and threw us in jail. And now are they going to send us away secretly? Certainly not! On the contrary, let them come themselves and escort us out.”
ACT.16.38	The police reported these words to the magistrates. They were afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens. 
ACT.16.39	So they came to appease them, and escorting them from prison, they urged them to leave town. 
ACT.16.40	After leaving the jail, they came to Lydia’s house, where they saw and encouraged the brothers and sisters, and departed.
ACT.17.1	After they passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica,
ACT.17.2	As usual, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
ACT.17.3	explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Messiah to suffer and rise from the dead: “This Jesus I am proclaiming to you is the Messiah.”
ACT.17.4	Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, including a large number of God-fearing Greeks, as well as a number of the leading women.
ACT.17.5	But the Jews became jealous, and they brought together some wicked men from the marketplace, formed a mob, and started a riot in the city. Attacking Jason’s house, they searched for them to bring them out to the public assembly.
ACT.17.6	When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city officials, shouting, “These men who have turned the world upside down have come here too, 
ACT.17.7	and Jason has welcomed them. They are all acting contrary to Caesar’s decrees,
ACT.17.8	The crowd and city officials who heard these things were upset. 
ACT.17.9	After taking a security bond from Jason and the others, they released them.
ACT.17.10	As soon as it was night, the brothers and sisters sent Paul and Silas away to Berea.
ACT.17.11	The people here were of more noble character than those in Thessalonica, since they received the word with eagerness and examined the Scriptures
ACT.17.12	Consequently, many of them believed, including a number of the prominent Greek women as well as men. 
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews from Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul at Berea, they came there too, agitating and upsetting
ACT.17.14	Then the brothers and sisters immediately sent Paul away to go to the coast, but Silas and Timothy
ACT.17.15	Those who escorted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving instructions for Silas and Timothy to come to him as quickly as possible, they departed.
ACT.17.16	While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply distressed when he saw that the city was full of idols. 
ACT.17.17	So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with those who worshiped God, as well as in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
ACT.17.18	Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also debated with him. Some said, “What is this ignorant show-off
ACT.17.18	Others replied, “He seems to be a preacher of foreign deities” — because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
ACT.17.19	They took him and brought him to the Areopagus,
ACT.17.20	Because what you say sounds strange to us, and we want to know what these things mean.” 
ACT.17.21	Now all the Athenians and the foreigners residing there spent their time on nothing else but telling or hearing something new.
ACT.17.22	Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus and said: “People of Athens! I see that you are extremely religious in every respect. 
ACT.17.23	For as I was passing through and observing the objects of your worship, I even found an altar on which was inscribed: ‘To an Unknown God.’ Therefore, what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you. 
ACT.17.24	The God who made the world and everything in it
ACT.17.25	Neither is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything,
ACT.17.26	From one man
ACT.17.27	He did this so that they might seek God, and perhaps they might reach out and find him, though he is not far from each one of us.
ACT.17.28	For in him we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also his offspring.’
ACT.17.29	Since we are God’s offspring then, we shouldn’t think that the divine nature is like gold or silver or stone, an image fashioned by human art and imagination.
ACT.17.30	“Therefore, having overlooked
ACT.17.31	because he has set a day when he is going to judge the world in righteousness by the man he has appointed. He has provided proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”
ACT.17.32	When they heard about the resurrection of the dead, some began to ridicule him, but others said, “We’d like to hear from you again about this.” 
ACT.17.33	So Paul left their presence. 
ACT.17.34	However, some people joined him and believed, including Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
ACT.18.1	After this, he
ACT.18.2	where he found a Jew named Aquila,
ACT.18.3	and since they were of the same occupation, tentmakers by trade,
ACT.18.4	He reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath and tried to persuade both Jews and Greeks.
ACT.18.5	When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself to preaching the word
ACT.18.6	When they resisted and blasphemed,
ACT.18.7	So he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was next door to the synagogue. 
ACT.18.8	Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, along with his whole household.
ACT.18.9	The Lord said to Paul in a night vision, 
ACT.18.11	He stayed there a year and a half, teaching the word of God among them.
ACT.18.12	While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack against Paul and brought him to the tribunal.
ACT.18.13	“This man,” they said, “is persuading people to worship God in ways contrary to the law.”
ACT.18.14	As Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of wrongdoing or of a serious crime, it would be reasonable for me to put up with you Jews. 
ACT.18.15	But if these are questions about words, names, and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of such things.”
ACT.18.16	So he drove them from the tribunal. 
ACT.18.17	And they all
ACT.18.18	After staying for some time, Paul said farewell to the brothers and sisters and sailed away to Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. He shaved his head at Cenchreae because of a vow he had taken.
ACT.18.19	When they reached Ephesus
ACT.18.20	When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he declined, 
ACT.18.21	but he said farewell and added,
ACT.18.22	On landing at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and greeted the church, then went down to Antioch.
ACT.18.23	After spending some time there, he set out, traveling through one place after another in the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
ACT.18.24	Now a Jew named Apollos,
ACT.18.25	He had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit,
ACT.18.26	He began to speak boldly in the synagogue. After Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside
ACT.18.27	When he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers and sisters wrote to the disciples to welcome him. After he arrived, he was a great help to those who by grace had believed.
ACT.18.28	For he vigorously refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating through the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.
ACT.19.1	While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior regions and came to Ephesus. He found some disciples
ACT.19.2	and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” 
ACT.19.2	“No,” they told him, “we haven’t even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”
ACT.19.3	“Into what then were you baptized?” he asked them.
ACT.19.3	“Into John’s baptism,” they replied.
ACT.19.4	Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance,
ACT.19.5	When they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.6	And when Paul had laid his hands on
ACT.19.7	Now there were about twelve men in all.
ACT.19.8	Paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly over a period of three months, arguing and persuading them about the kingdom of God.
ACT.19.9	But when some became hardened and would not believe, slandering the Way in front of the crowd, he withdrew from them, taking the disciples, and conducted discussions every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
ACT.19.10	This went on for two years, so that all the residents of Asia, both Jews and Greeks,
ACT.19.11	God was performing extraordinary miracles by Paul’s hands, 
ACT.19.12	so that even facecloths or aprons
ACT.19.13	Now some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists also attempted to pronounce the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “I command you by the Jesus that Paul preaches!” 
ACT.19.14	Seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, were doing this. 
ACT.19.15	The evil spirit answered them, “I know Jesus, and I recognize Paul — but who are you?” 
ACT.19.16	Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them, overpowered them all, and prevailed against them, so that they ran out of that house naked and wounded. 
ACT.19.17	When this became known to everyone who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, they became afraid, and the name of the Lord Jesus
ACT.19.18	And many who had become believers came confessing and disclosing their practices, 
ACT.19.19	while many of those who had practiced magic
ACT.19.20	In this way the word of the Lord flourished and prevailed.
ACT.19.21	After these events, Paul resolved by the Spirit
ACT.19.22	After sending to Macedonia two of those who assisted him, Timothy and Erastus,
ACT.19.23	About that time there was a major disturbance about the Way.
ACT.19.24	For a person named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, provided a great deal of business for the craftsmen. 
ACT.19.25	When he had assembled them, as well as the workers engaged in this type of business, he said: “Men, you know that our prosperity is derived from this business. 
ACT.19.26	You see and hear that not only in Ephesus, but in almost all of Asia, this man Paul has persuaded and misled a considerable number of people by saying that gods made by hand are not gods.
ACT.19.27	Not only do we run a risk that our business may be discredited, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be despised and her magnificence come to the verge of ruin — the very one all of Asia and the world worship.”
ACT.19.28	When they had heard this, they were filled with rage and began to cry out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” 
ACT.19.29	So the city was filled with confusion, and they rushed all together into the amphitheater, dragging along Gaius
ACT.19.30	Although Paul wanted to go in before the people, the disciples did not let him. 
ACT.19.31	Even some of the provincial officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent word to him, pleading with him not to venture
ACT.19.32	Some were shouting one thing and some another,
ACT.19.33	Some Jews in the crowd gave instructions to Alexander
ACT.19.34	But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison for about two hours: “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”
ACT.19.35	When the city clerk had calmed the crowd down, he said, “People of Ephesus! What person is there who doesn’t know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple guardian of the great
ACT.19.36	Therefore, since these things are undeniable, you must keep calm and not do anything rash. 
ACT.19.37	For you have brought these men here who are not temple robbers or blasphemers of our
ACT.19.38	So if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a case against anyone, the courts are in session, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.
ACT.19.39	But if you seek anything further, it must be decided in a legal assembly. 
ACT.19.40	In fact, we run a risk of being charged with rioting
ACT.19.41	After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	After the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples, encouraged them, and after saying farewell, departed to go to Macedonia.
ACT.20.2	And when he had passed through those areas and offered them many words of encouragement, he came to Greece 
ACT.20.3	and stayed three months. The Jews plotted against him when he was about to set sail for Syria, and so he decided to go back through Macedonia.
ACT.20.4	He was accompanied
ACT.20.5	These men went on ahead and waited for us in Troas,
ACT.20.6	but we sailed away from Philippi after the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
ACT.20.7	On the first day of the week, we
ACT.20.8	There were many lamps in the room upstairs where we were assembled, 
ACT.20.9	and a young man named Eutychus was sitting on a window sill and sank into a deep sleep as Paul kept on talking. When he was overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead. 
ACT.20.10	But Paul went down, bent over him, embraced him, and said, “Don’t be alarmed, because he’s alive.”
ACT.20.11	After going upstairs, breaking the bread, and eating, Paul talked a long time until dawn. Then he left. 
ACT.20.12	They brought the boy home alive and were greatly comforted.
ACT.20.13	We went on ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were going to take Paul on board, because these were his instructions, since he himself was going by land. 
ACT.20.14	When he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went on to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	Sailing from there, the next day we arrived off Chios. The following day we crossed over to Samos, and
ACT.20.16	For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of Asia, because he was hurrying to be in Jerusalem, if possible, for the day of Pentecost.
ACT.20.17	Now from Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and summoned the elders of the church. 
ACT.20.18	When they came to him, he said to them: “You know, from the first day I set foot in Asia, how I was with you the whole time,
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all humility, with tears, and during the trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews.
ACT.20.20	You know that I did not avoid proclaiming to you anything that was profitable or from teaching you publicly and from house to house. 
ACT.20.21	I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God
ACT.20.22	“And now I am on my way to Jerusalem, compelled by the Spirit,
ACT.20.23	except that in every town the Holy Spirit warns me that chains and afflictions are waiting for me.
ACT.20.24	But I consider my life of no value to myself; my purpose is to finish my course
ACT.20.25	“And now I know that none of you, among whom I went about preaching the kingdom, will ever see me again. 
ACT.20.26	Therefore I declare to you this day that I am innocent
ACT.20.27	because I did not avoid declaring to you the whole plan of God.
ACT.20.28	Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock
ACT.20.29	I know that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. 
ACT.20.30	Men will rise up even from your own number and distort the truth to lure the disciples into following them.
ACT.20.31	Therefore be on the alert, remembering that night and day for three years I never stopped warning each one of you with tears.
ACT.20.32	“And now
ACT.20.33	I have not coveted anyone’s silver or gold or clothing.
ACT.20.34	You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to support myself and those who are with me.
ACT.20.35	In every way I’ve shown you that it is necessary to help the weak by laboring like this and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, because he said, 
ACT.20.36	After he said this, he knelt down and prayed with all of them.
ACT.20.37	There were many tears shed by everyone. They embraced Paul and kissed him, 
ACT.20.38	grieving most of all over his statement that they would never see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship.
ACT.21.1	After
ACT.21.2	Finding a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we boarded and set sail. 
ACT.21.3	After we sighted Cyprus, passing to the south of it,
ACT.21.4	We sought out the disciples and stayed there seven days. Through the Spirit they told Paul not to go to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.5	When our time had come to an end, we left to continue our journey, while all of them, with their wives and children, accompanied us out of the city. After kneeling down on the beach to pray, 
ACT.21.6	we said farewell to one another and boarded the ship, and they returned home.
ACT.21.7	When we completed our voyage
ACT.21.8	The next day we left and came to Caesarea, where we entered the house of Philip
ACT.21.9	This man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.
ACT.21.10	After we had been there for several days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. 
ACT.21.11	He came to us, took Paul’s belt, tied his own feet and hands, and said, “This is what the Holy Spirit says: ‘In this way the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him over to the Gentiles.’”
ACT.21.12	When we heard this, both we and the local people pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.13	Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.”
ACT.21.14	Since he would not be persuaded, we said no more except, “The Lord’s will be done.”
ACT.21.15	After this we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	Some of the disciples from Caesarea also went with us and brought us to Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to stay.
ACT.21.17	When we reached Jerusalem, the brothers and sisters welcomed us warmly.
ACT.21.18	The following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
ACT.21.19	After greeting them, he reported in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
ACT.21.20	When they heard it, they glorified God and said, “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous
ACT.21.21	But they have been informed about you — that you are teaching all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or to live according to our customs.
ACT.21.22	So what is to be done?
ACT.21.23	Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have made a vow. 
ACT.21.24	Take these men, purify yourself along with them, and pay for them to get their heads shaved. Then everyone will know that what they were told about you amounts to nothing, but that you yourself are also careful about observing the law.
ACT.21.25	With regard to the Gentiles who have believed, we have written a letter containing our decision that
ACT.21.26	So the next day, Paul took the men, having purified himself along with them, and entered the temple, announcing the completion of the purification days when the offering would be made for each of them.
ACT.21.27	When the seven days were nearly over, some Jews from the province of Asia saw him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd, and seized him,
ACT.21.28	shouting, “Fellow Israelites, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere against our people, our law, and this place. What’s more, he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.”
ACT.21.29	For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
ACT.21.30	The whole city was stirred up, and the people rushed together. They seized Paul, dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut.
ACT.21.31	As they were trying to kill him, word went up to the commander of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in chaos. 
ACT.21.32	Taking along soldiers and centurions, he immediately ran down to them. Seeing the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. 
ACT.21.33	Then the commander approached, took him into custody, and ordered him to be bound with two chains.
ACT.21.34	Some in the crowd were shouting one thing and some another. Since he was not able to get reliable information because of the uproar, he ordered him to be taken into the barracks.
ACT.21.35	When Paul got to the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd, 
ACT.21.36	for the mass of people followed, yelling, “Get rid of him!” 
ACT.21.37	As he was about to be brought into the barracks, Paul said to the commander, “Am I allowed to say something to you?”
ACT.21.37	He replied, “You know how to speak Greek? 
ACT.21.38	Aren’t you the Egyptian who started a revolt some time ago and led four thousand men of the Assassins into the wilderness?” 
ACT.21.39	Paul said, “I am a Jewish man from Tarsus of Cilicia,
ACT.21.40	After he had given permission, Paul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand to the people. When there was a great hush, he addressed them in Aramaic:
ACT.22.1	“Brothers and fathers, listen now to my defense before you.” 
ACT.22.2	When they heard that he was addressing them in Aramaic,
ACT.22.3	He
ACT.22.4	I persecuted this Way
ACT.22.5	as both the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. After I received letters from them to the brothers, I traveled to Damascus to arrest those who were there and bring them to Jerusalem to be punished.
ACT.22.6	“As
ACT.22.7	I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 
ACT.22.8	“I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’
ACT.22.8	“He said to me, 
ACT.22.9	Now those who were with me saw the light,
ACT.22.10	“I said, ‘What should I do, Lord?’
ACT.22.10	“The Lord told me, 
ACT.22.11	“Since I couldn’t see because of the brightness of the light,
ACT.22.12	Someone named Ananias, a devout man according to the law, who had a good reputation with all the Jews living there,
ACT.22.13	came and stood by me and said, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight.’ And in that very hour I looked up and saw him. 
ACT.22.14	And he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has appointed
ACT.22.15	since you will be a witness for him to all people of what you have seen and heard.
ACT.22.16	And now, why are you delaying? Get up and be baptized, and wash away your sins,
ACT.22.17	“After I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance
ACT.22.18	and saw him telling me, 
ACT.22.19	“But I said, ‘Lord, they know that in synagogue after synagogue I had those who believed in you imprisoned and beaten.
ACT.22.20	And when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I stood there giving approval
ACT.22.21	“He said to me, 
ACT.22.22	They listened to him up to this point. Then they raised their voices, shouting, “Wipe this man off the face of the earth! He should not be allowed to live!” 
ACT.22.23	As they were yelling and flinging aside their garments and throwing dust into the air,
ACT.22.24	the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, directing that he be interrogated with the scourge to discover the reason they were shouting against him like this. 
ACT.22.25	As they stretched him out for the lash, Paul said to the centurion standing by, “Is it legal for you to scourge a man who is a Roman citizen and is uncondemned?” 
ACT.22.26	When the centurion heard this, he went and reported to the commander, saying, “What are you going to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.”
ACT.22.27	The commander came and said to him, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”
ACT.22.27	“Yes,” he said.
ACT.22.28	The commander replied, “I bought this citizenship for a large amount of money.”
ACT.22.28	“But I was born a citizen,” Paul said.
ACT.22.29	So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately. The commander too was alarmed when he realized Paul was a Roman citizen and he had bound him.
ACT.22.30	The next day, since he wanted to find out exactly why Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him
ACT.23.1	Paul looked straight at the Sanhedrin and said, “Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience
ACT.23.2	The high priest Ananias ordered those who were standing next to him to strike him on the mouth.
ACT.23.3	Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! You are sitting there judging me according to the law, and yet in violation of the law are you ordering me to be struck?” 
ACT.23.4	Those standing nearby said, “Do you dare revile God’s high priest?”
ACT.23.5	“I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest,” replied Paul. “For it is written, 
ACT.23.6	When Paul realized that one part of them were Sadducees and the other part were Pharisees, he cried out in the Sanhedrin, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees.
ACT.23.7	When he said this, a dispute broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. 
ACT.23.8	For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection,
ACT.23.9	The shouting grew loud, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees’
ACT.23.10	When the dispute became violent, the commander feared that Paul might be torn apart by them and ordered the troops to go down, take him away from them, and bring him into the barracks.
ACT.23.11	The following night, the Lord stood by him and said, 
ACT.23.12	When it was morning, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul.
ACT.23.13	There were more than forty who had formed this plot. 
ACT.23.14	These men went to the chief priests and elders and said, “We have bound ourselves under a solemn curse that we won’t eat anything until we have killed Paul. 
ACT.23.15	So now you, along with the Sanhedrin, make a request to the commander that he bring him down to you
ACT.23.16	But the son of Paul’s sister, hearing about their ambush, came and entered the barracks and reported it to Paul. 
ACT.23.17	Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander, because he has something to report to him.”
ACT.23.18	So he took him, brought him to the commander, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, because he has something to tell you.”
ACT.23.19	The commander took him by the hand, led him aside, and inquired privately, “What is it you have to report to me?”
ACT.23.20	“The Jews,” he said, “have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin tomorrow, as though they are going to hold a somewhat more careful inquiry about him. 
ACT.23.21	Don’t let them persuade you, because there are more than forty of them lying in ambush — men who have bound themselves under a curse not to eat or drink until they have killed him. Now they are ready, waiting for your consent.”
ACT.23.22	So the commander dismissed the young man and instructed him, “Don’t tell anyone that you have informed me about this.”
ACT.23.23	He summoned two of his centurions and said, “Get two hundred soldiers ready with seventy cavalry and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at nine tonight.
ACT.23.24	Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor.”
ACT.23.25	He wrote the following letter:
ACT.23.26	Claudius Lysias,
ACT.23.26	To the most excellent governor Felix:
ACT.23.26	Greetings.
ACT.23.27	When this man had been seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them, I arrived with my troops and rescued him because I learned that he is a Roman citizen.
ACT.23.28	Wanting to know the charge they were accusing him of, I brought him down before their Sanhedrin. 
ACT.23.29	I found out that the accusations were concerning questions of their law,
ACT.23.30	When I was informed that there was a plot against the man,
ACT.23.31	So the soldiers took Paul during the night and brought him to Antipatris as they were ordered. 
ACT.23.32	The next day, they returned to the barracks, allowing the cavalry to go on with him. 
ACT.23.33	When these men entered Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.
ACT.23.34	After he
ACT.23.35	he said, “I will give you a hearing whenever your accusers also get here.” He ordered that he be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.
ACT.24.1	Five days later Ananias
ACT.24.2	When Paul was called in, Tertullus began to accuse him and said: “We enjoy great peace because of you, and reforms are taking place for the benefit of this nation because of your foresight. 
ACT.24.3	We acknowledge this in every way and everywhere, most excellent
ACT.24.4	But, so that I will not burden you any further, I request that you would be kind enough to give us a brief hearing. 
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man to be a plague,
ACT.24.6	He even tried to desecrate the temple, and so we apprehended him.
ACT.24.9	The Jews also joined in the attack, alleging that these things were true.
ACT.24.10	When the governor motioned for him to speak, Paul replied: “Because I know you have been a judge of this nation for many years, I am glad to offer my defense in what concerns me.
ACT.24.11	You can verify for yourself that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.
ACT.24.12	They didn’t find me arguing with anyone or causing a disturbance among the crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or anywhere in the city.
ACT.24.13	Neither can they prove the charges they are now making against me. 
ACT.24.14	But I admit this to you: I worship the God of my ancestors according to the Way,
ACT.24.15	I have a hope in God, which these men themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection,
ACT.24.16	I always strive to have a clear conscience
ACT.24.17	After many years, I came to bring charitable gifts and offerings to my people.
ACT.24.18	While I was doing this, some Jews from Asia found me ritually purified in the temple, without a crowd and without any uproar.
ACT.24.19	It is they who ought to be here before you to bring charges, if they have anything against me. 
ACT.24.20	Or let these men here state what wrongdoing they found in me when I stood before the Sanhedrin, 
ACT.24.21	other than this one statement I shouted while standing among them, ‘Today I am on trial before you concerning the resurrection of the dead.’”
ACT.24.22	Since Felix was well informed about the Way,
ACT.24.23	He ordered that the centurion keep Paul under guard, though he could have some freedom, and that he should not prevent any of his friends from meeting
ACT.24.24	Several days later, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and listened to him on the subject of faith in Christ Jesus. 
ACT.24.25	Now as he spoke about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come,
ACT.24.26	At the same time he was also hoping that Paul would offer him money.
ACT.24.27	After two years had passed, Porcius Festus
ACT.25.1	Three days after Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
ACT.25.2	The chief priests and the leaders of the Jews presented their case against Paul to him; and they appealed,
ACT.25.3	asking for a favor against Paul, that Festus summon him to Jerusalem. They were, in fact, preparing an ambush along the road to kill him. 
ACT.25.4	Festus, however, answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to go there shortly.
ACT.25.5	“Therefore,” he said, “let those of you who have authority go down with me and accuse him, if he has done anything wrong.”
ACT.25.6	When he had spent not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea. The next day, seated at the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought in.
ACT.25.7	When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him and brought many serious charges that they were not able to prove.
ACT.25.8	Then Paul made his defense: “Neither against the Jewish law,
ACT.25.9	But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor,
ACT.25.10	Paul replied: “I am standing at Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as even you yourself know very well. 
ACT.25.11	If then I did anything wrong and am deserving of death, I am not trying to escape death; but if there is nothing to what these men accuse me of, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar!” 
ACT.25.12	Then after Festus conferred with his council, he replied, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you will go.”
ACT.25.13	Several days later, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea and paid a courtesy call on Festus. 
ACT.25.14	Since they were staying there several days, Festus presented Paul’s case to the king, saying, “There’s a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix. 
ACT.25.15	When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews presented their case and asked that he be condemned.
ACT.25.16	I answered them that it is not the Roman custom to give someone up
ACT.25.17	So when they had assembled here, I did not delay. The next day I took my seat at the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought in. 
ACT.25.18	The accusers stood up but brought no charge against him of the evils I was expecting. 
ACT.25.19	Instead they had some disagreements
ACT.25.20	Since I was at a loss in a dispute over such things, I asked him if he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding these matters. 
ACT.25.21	But when Paul appealed to be held for trial by the Emperor,
ACT.25.22	Agrippa said to Festus, “I would like to hear the man myself.”
ACT.25.22	“Tomorrow you will hear him,” he replied.
ACT.25.23	So the next day, Agrippa and Bernice
ACT.25.24	Then Festus said: “King Agrippa and all men present with us, you see this man. The whole Jewish community has appealed to me concerning him, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he should not live any longer.
ACT.25.25	I found that he had not done anything deserving of death, but when he himself appealed to the Emperor, I decided to send him.
ACT.25.26	I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore, I have brought him before all of you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this examination is over, I may have something to write. 
ACT.25.27	For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without indicating the charges against him.”
ACT.26.1	Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.”
ACT.26.1	Then Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense: 
ACT.26.2	“I consider myself fortunate, that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews, 
ACT.26.3	especially since you are very knowledgeable about all the Jewish customs and controversies. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
ACT.26.4	“All the Jews know my way of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem.
ACT.26.5	They have known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived as a Pharisee.
ACT.26.6	And now I stand on trial because of the hope
ACT.26.7	the promise our twelve tribes hope to reach as they earnestly serve him night and day. King Agrippa, I am being accused by the Jews because of this hope.
ACT.26.8	Why do any of you consider it incredible that God raises the dead? 
ACT.26.9	In fact, I myself was convinced that it was necessary to do many things in opposition to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
ACT.26.10	I actually did this in Jerusalem, and I locked up many of the saints in prison, since I had received authority for that from the chief priests. When they were put to death, I was in agreement against them.
ACT.26.11	In all the synagogues I often punished them and tried to make them blaspheme.
ACT.26.12	“I was traveling to Damascus under
ACT.26.13	King Agrippa, while on the road at midday, I saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun, shining around me and those traveling with me. 
ACT.26.14	We all fell to the ground, and I heard a voice speaking to me in Aramaic,
ACT.26.15	“I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’
ACT.26.15	“And the Lord replied: 
ACT.26.19	“So then, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. 
ACT.26.20	Instead, I preached to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem and in all the region of Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works worthy of repentance.
ACT.26.21	For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and were trying to kill me. 
ACT.26.22	To this very day, I have had help from God, and I stand and testify to both small and great, saying nothing other than what the prophets and Moses said would take place
ACT.26.23	that the Messiah must suffer, and that, as the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light to our people and to the Gentiles.”
ACT.26.24	As he was saying these things in his defense, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice, “You’re out of your mind,
ACT.26.25	But Paul replied, “I’m not out of my mind, most excellent Festus. On the contrary, I’m speaking words of truth and good judgment.
ACT.26.26	For the king knows about these matters, and I can speak boldly to him. For I am convinced that none of these things has escaped his notice, since this was not done in a corner. 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe.”
ACT.26.28	Agrippa said to Paul, “Are you going to persuade me to become a Christian so easily?” 
ACT.26.29	“I wish before God,” replied Paul, “that whether easily or with difficulty,
ACT.26.30	The king, the governor, Bernice, and those sitting with them got up, 
ACT.26.31	and when they had left they talked with each other and said, “This man is not doing anything to deserve death or imprisonment.”
ACT.26.32	Agrippa said to Festus, “This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar.”
ACT.27.1	When it was decided that we were to sail to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Imperial Regiment.
ACT.27.2	When we had boarded a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, intending to sail to ports along the coast of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.
ACT.27.3	The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to go to his friends to receive their care.
ACT.27.4	When we had put out to sea from there, we sailed along the northern coast
ACT.27.5	After sailing through the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.
ACT.27.6	There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing for Italy and put us on board. 
ACT.27.7	Sailing slowly for many days, with difficulty we arrived off Cnidus. Since the wind did not allow us to approach it, we sailed along the south side of Crete off Salmone. 
ACT.27.8	With still more difficulty we sailed along the coast and came to a place called Fair Havens near the city of Lasea.
ACT.27.9	By now much time had passed, and the voyage was already dangerous. Since the Day of Atonement
ACT.27.10	and told them, “Men, I can see that this voyage is headed toward disaster and heavy loss, not only of the cargo and the ship but also of our lives.” 
ACT.27.11	But the centurion paid attention to the captain and the owner of the ship rather than to what Paul said.
ACT.27.12	Since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in, the majority decided to set sail from there, hoping somehow to reach Phoenix, a harbor on Crete
ACT.27.13	When a gentle south wind sprang up, they thought they had achieved their purpose. They weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of Crete. 
ACT.27.14	But before long, a fierce wind called the “northeaster” rushed down from the island. 
ACT.27.15	Since the ship was caught and unable to head into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. 
ACT.27.16	After running under the shelter of a little island called Cauda,
ACT.27.17	After hoisting it up, they used ropes and tackle and girded the ship. Fearing they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the drift-anchor, and in this way they were driven along. 
ACT.27.18	Because we were being severely battered by the storm, they began to jettison the cargo the next day.
ACT.27.19	On the third day, they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands. 
ACT.27.20	For many days neither sun nor stars appeared, and the severe storm kept raging. Finally all hope was fading that we would be saved.
ACT.27.21	Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul then stood up among them and said, “You men should have followed my advice not to sail from Crete and sustain this damage and loss. 
ACT.27.22	Now I urge you to take courage, because there will be no loss of any of your lives, but only of the ship. 
ACT.27.23	For last night an angel of the God I belong to and serve stood by me
ACT.27.24	and said, ‘Don’t be afraid, Paul. It is necessary for you to appear before Caesar. And indeed, God has graciously given you all those who are sailing with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	So take courage, men, because I believe God that it will be just the way it was told to me.
ACT.27.26	But we have to run aground on some island.”
ACT.27.27	When the fourteenth night came, we were drifting in the Adriatic Sea, and about midnight the sailors thought they were approaching land. 
ACT.27.28	They took soundings and found it to be a hundred and twenty feet
ACT.27.29	Then, fearing we might run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight to come. 
ACT.27.30	Some sailors tried to escape from the ship; they had let down the skiff into the sea, pretending that they were going to put out anchors from the bow. 
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.” 
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut the ropes holding the skiff and let it drop away.
ACT.27.33	When it was about daylight, Paul urged them all to take food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been waiting and going without food, having eaten nothing. 
ACT.27.34	So I urge you to take some food. For this is for your survival, since none of you will lose a hair from your head.”
ACT.27.35	After he said these things and had taken some bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all of them, and after he broke it, he began to eat.
ACT.27.36	They all were encouraged and took food themselves. 
ACT.27.37	In all there were 276 of us on the ship.
ACT.27.38	When they had eaten enough, they began to lighten the ship by throwing the grain overboard into the sea.
ACT.27.39	When daylight came, they did not recognize the land but sighted a bay with a beach. They planned to run the ship ashore if they could.
ACT.27.40	After cutting loose the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that held the rudders. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and headed for the beach. 
ACT.27.41	But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship aground. The bow jammed fast and remained immovable, while the stern began to break up by the pounding of the waves. 
ACT.27.42	The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners so that no one could swim away and escape. 
ACT.27.43	But the centurion kept them from carrying out their plan because he wanted to save Paul, and so he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land. 
ACT.27.44	The rest were to follow, some on planks and some on debris from the ship. In this way, everyone safely reached the shore.
ACT.28.1	Once safely ashore, we
ACT.28.2	The local people
ACT.28.3	As Paul gathered a bundle of brushwood and put it on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened itself on his hand. 
ACT.28.4	When the local people saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “This man, no doubt, is a murderer. Even though he has escaped the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live.”
ACT.28.5	But he shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no harm.
ACT.28.6	They expected that he would begin to swell up or suddenly drop dead. After they waited a long time and saw nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.
ACT.28.7	Now in the area around that place was an estate belonging to the leading man of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us and entertained us hospitably for three days. 
ACT.28.8	Publius’s father was in bed suffering from fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, and praying and laying his hands on him, he healed him.
ACT.28.9	After this, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed. 
ACT.28.10	So they heaped many honors on us, and when we sailed, they gave us what we needed.
ACT.28.11	After three months we set sail in an Alexandrian ship that had wintered at the island, with the Twin Gods
ACT.28.12	Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed three days. 
ACT.28.13	From there, after making a circuit along the coast,
ACT.28.14	There we found brothers and sisters
ACT.28.15	Now the brothers and sisters from there had heard the news about us and had come to meet us as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage. 
ACT.28.16	When we entered Rome,
ACT.28.17	After three days he called together the leaders of the Jews. When they had gathered he said to them: “Brothers, although I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
ACT.28.18	After they examined me, they wanted to release me, since there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.
ACT.28.19	Because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar;
ACT.28.20	For this reason I’ve asked to see you and speak to you. In fact, it is for the hope of Israel that I’m wearing this chain.”
ACT.28.21	Then they said to him, “We haven’t received any letters about you from Judea. None of the brothers has come and reported or spoken anything evil about you. 
ACT.28.22	But we want to hear what your views are, since we know that people everywhere are speaking against this sect.”
ACT.28.23	After arranging a day with him, many came to him at his lodging. From dawn to dusk he expounded and testified about the kingdom of God. He tried to persuade them about Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets.
ACT.28.24	Some were persuaded by what he said, but others did not believe.
ACT.28.25	Disagreeing among themselves, they began to leave after Paul made one statement:
ACT.28.26	when he said,
ACT.28.28	Therefore, let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen.”  
ACT.28.30	Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house. And he welcomed all who visited him, 
ACT.28.31	proclaiming the kingdom of God
ROM.1.1	Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called as an apostle
ROM.1.2	which he promised beforehand
ROM.1.3	concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, who was a descendant of David
ROM.1.4	and was appointed to be the powerful
ROM.1.5	Through him we have received grace and apostleship
ROM.1.6	including you who are also called by Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.7	To all who are in Rome, loved by God,
ROM.1.7	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you because the news of your faith
ROM.1.9	God is my witness,
ROM.1.10	always asking in my prayers that if it is somehow in God’s will, I may now at last succeed in coming to you.
ROM.1.11	For I want very much to see you,
ROM.1.12	that is, to be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith, both yours and mine.
ROM.1.13	Now I don’t want you to be unaware,
ROM.1.14	I am obligated both to Greeks and barbarians,
ROM.1.15	So I am eager to preach the gospel
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel,
ROM.1.17	For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith,
ROM.1.18	For God’s wrath
ROM.1.19	since what can be known
ROM.1.20	For his invisible attributes, that is, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world,
ROM.1.21	For though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God or show gratitude. Instead, their thinking became worthless, and their senseless hearts were darkened.
ROM.1.22	Claiming to be wise, they became fools
ROM.1.23	and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles.
ROM.1.24	Therefore God delivered them over in the desires of their hearts
ROM.1.25	They exchanged the truth of God for a lie,
ROM.1.26	For this reason God delivered them over to disgraceful passions.
ROM.1.27	The men
ROM.1.28	And because they did not think it worthwhile to acknowledge God, God delivered them over to a corrupt mind so that they do what is not right. 
ROM.1.29	They are filled with all unrighteousness,
ROM.1.30	slanderers, God-haters, arrogant, proud, boastful,
ROM.1.31	senseless, untrustworthy, unloving,
ROM.1.32	Although they know God’s just sentence — that those who practice such things deserve to die
ROM.2.1	Therefore, every one of you
ROM.2.2	We know that God’s judgment on those who do such things is based on the truth. 
ROM.2.3	Do you really think — anyone of you who judges those who do such things yet do the same — that you will escape God’s judgment? 
ROM.2.4	Or do you despise the riches of his kindness,
ROM.2.5	Because of your hardened and unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath
ROM.2.6	:
ROM.2.7	eternal life
ROM.2.8	but wrath and anger to those who are self-seeking
ROM.2.9	There will be affliction and distress
ROM.2.10	but glory, honor, and peace for everyone who does what is good, first to the Jew, and also to the Greek. 
ROM.2.11	For there is no favoritism with God.
ROM.2.12	All who sin without the law
ROM.2.13	For the hearers of the law
ROM.2.14	So, when Gentiles, who do not by nature have the law,
ROM.2.15	They show that the work of the law
ROM.2.16	on the day when God judges
ROM.2.17	Now if
ROM.2.18	and know his will, and approve the things that are superior,
ROM.2.19	and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness, 
ROM.2.20	an instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and truth
ROM.2.21	you then, who teach another,
ROM.2.22	You who say, “You must not commit adultery” — do you commit adultery? You who detest idols, do you rob their temples?
ROM.2.23	You who boast in the law,
ROM.2.24	For, as it is written: 
ROM.2.25	Circumcision benefits you if you observe the law, but if you are a lawbreaker, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.
ROM.2.26	So if an uncircumcised
ROM.2.27	A man who is physically uncircumcised, but who keeps the law, will judge you
ROM.2.28	For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly,
ROM.2.29	On the contrary, a person is a Jew who is one inwardly,
ROM.3.1	So what advantage does the Jew have? Or what is the benefit of circumcision? 
ROM.3.2	Considerable in every way. First, they were entrusted
ROM.3.3	What then? If some were unfaithful,
ROM.3.4	Absolutely not!
ROM.3.5	But if our unrighteousness highlights
ROM.3.6	Absolutely not! Otherwise, how will God judge the world?
ROM.3.7	But if by my lie God’s truth abounds to his glory, why am I also still being judged as a sinner?
ROM.3.8	And why not say, just as some people slanderously claim we say, “Let us do what is evil so that good may come”?
ROM.3.9	What then? Are we any better off?
ROM.3.10	as it is written:
ROM.3.19	Now we know that whatever the law says,
ROM.3.20	For no one will be justified
ROM.3.21	But now, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been revealed,
ROM.3.22	The righteousness of God is through faith
ROM.3.23	For all have sinned
ROM.3.24	They are justified freely by his grace
ROM.3.25	God presented him as an atoning sacrifice
ROM.3.26	God presented him to demonstrate his righteousness at the present time, so that he would be righteous and declare righteous
ROM.3.27	Where, then, is boasting?
ROM.3.28	For we conclude that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.
ROM.3.29	Or is God the God of Jews only?
ROM.3.30	since there is one God
ROM.3.31	Do we then nullify the law through faith? Absolutely not!
ROM.4.1	What then will we say that Abraham, our forefather
ROM.4.2	If Abraham was justified
ROM.4.3	For what does the Scripture say? 
ROM.4.4	Now to the one who works,
ROM.4.5	But to the one who does not work, but believes on him who declares the ungodly to be righteous,
ROM.4.6	Just as David also speaks of the blessing of the person to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:
ROM.4.9	Is this blessing only for the circumcised,
ROM.4.10	In what way then was it credited — while he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? It was not while he was circumcised, but uncircumcised. 
ROM.4.11	And he received the sign of circumcision
ROM.4.12	And he became the father of the circumcised, who are not only circumcised but who also follow in the footsteps of the faith our father Abraham had while he was still uncircumcised.
ROM.4.13	For the promise to Abraham
ROM.4.14	If those who are of the law are heirs,
ROM.4.15	because the law produces wrath.
ROM.4.16	This is why the promise is by faith, so that it may be according to grace,
ROM.4.17	As it is written: 
ROM.4.18	He believed, hoping against hope, so that he became 
ROM.4.19	He did not weaken in faith when he considered
ROM.4.20	He did not waver in unbelief at God’s promise but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to God,
ROM.4.21	because he was fully convinced
ROM.4.22	Therefore, 
ROM.4.23	Now 
ROM.4.24	but also for us. It will be credited to us who believe in him
ROM.4.25	He was delivered up for
ROM.5.1	Therefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith,
ROM.5.2	We have also obtained access through him
ROM.5.3	And not only that,
ROM.5.4	endurance produces proven character,
ROM.5.5	This hope will not disappoint us,
ROM.5.6	For while we were still helpless, at the right time,
ROM.5.7	For rarely will someone die for a just person — though for a good person perhaps someone might even dare to die. 
ROM.5.8	But God proves
ROM.5.9	How much more then, since we have now been declared righteous by his blood,
ROM.5.10	For if, while we were enemies,
ROM.5.11	And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.
ROM.5.12	Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man,
ROM.5.13	In fact, sin was in the world before the law, but sin is not charged to a person’s account when there is no law.
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless, death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the likeness of Adam’s transgression.
ROM.5.15	But the gift is not like the trespass. For if by the one man’s trespass the many died, how much more have the grace of God and the gift which comes through the grace of the one man
ROM.5.16	And the gift is not like the one man’s sin, because from one sin came the judgment,
ROM.5.17	Since by the one man’s trespass, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive the overflow of grace and the gift of righteousness reign in life
ROM.5.18	So then, as through one trespass there is condemnation for everyone, so also through one righteous act there is justification leading to life
ROM.5.19	For just as through one man’s disobedience the many were made sinners,
ROM.5.20	The law came along to multiply the trespass.
ROM.5.21	so that, just as sin reigned in death,
ROM.6.1	What should we say then?
ROM.6.2	Absolutely not!
ROM.6.3	Or are you unaware that all of us who were baptized
ROM.6.4	Therefore we were buried with him by baptism into death,
ROM.6.5	For if we have been united with him in the likeness of his death,
ROM.6.6	For we know that our old self
ROM.6.7	since a person who has died
ROM.6.8	Now if we died with Christ,
ROM.6.9	because we know that Christ, having been raised from the dead,
ROM.6.10	For the death he died, he died to sin once for all time; but the life he lives, he lives to God. 
ROM.6.11	So, you too consider yourselves dead to sin
ROM.6.12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, so that you obey
ROM.6.13	And do not offer any parts
ROM.6.14	For sin will not rule over you, because you are not under the law
ROM.6.15	What then? Should we sin because we are not under the law but under grace?
ROM.6.16	Don’t you know that if you offer yourselves to someone
ROM.6.17	But thank God that, although you used to be slaves of sin,
ROM.6.18	and having been set free from sin,
ROM.6.19	I am using a human analogy
ROM.6.20	For when you were slaves of sin, you were free with regard to righteousness.
ROM.6.21	So what fruit was produced
ROM.6.22	But now, since you have been set free from sin and have become enslaved to God,
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.7.1	Since I am speaking to those who know the law, brothers and sisters,
ROM.7.2	For example, a married woman is legally bound to her husband while he lives.
ROM.7.3	So then, if she is married to another man while her husband is living, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law. Then, if she is married to another man, she is not an adulteress.
ROM.7.4	Therefore, my brothers and sisters, you also were put to death
ROM.7.5	For when we were in the flesh,
ROM.7.6	But now we have been released from the law, since we have died to what held us, so that we may serve in the newness of the Spirit
ROM.7.7	What should we say then?
ROM.7.8	And sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment,
ROM.7.9	Once I was alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin sprang to life again 
ROM.7.10	and I died. The commandment that was meant for life
ROM.7.11	For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me,
ROM.7.12	So then, the law is holy,
ROM.7.13	Therefore, did what is good become death to me? Absolutely not!
ROM.7.14	For we know that the law is spiritual,
ROM.7.15	For I do not understand what I am doing,
ROM.7.16	Now if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that it is good. 
ROM.7.17	So now I am no longer the one doing it, but it is sin living in me. 
ROM.7.18	For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh.
ROM.7.19	For I do not do the good that I want to do, but I practice the evil that I do not want to do. 
ROM.7.20	Now if I do what I do not want, I am no longer the one that does it, but it is the sin that lives in me. 
ROM.7.21	So I discover this law:
ROM.7.22	For in my inner self
ROM.7.23	but I see a different law in the parts of my body,
ROM.7.24	What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?
ROM.7.25	Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!
ROM.8.1	Therefore, there is now no condemnation
ROM.8.2	because the law of the Spirit of life
ROM.8.3	What the law could not do
ROM.8.4	in order that the law’s requirement would be fulfilled
ROM.8.5	For those who live according to the flesh have their minds set on the things of the flesh,
ROM.8.6	Now the mind-set of the flesh
ROM.8.7	The mind-set of the flesh is hostile
ROM.8.8	Those who are in the flesh
ROM.8.9	You, however, are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you.
ROM.8.10	Now if Christ is in you,
ROM.8.11	And if the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead
ROM.8.12	So then, brothers and sisters, we are not obligated to the flesh to live according to the flesh, 
ROM.8.13	because if you live according to the flesh, you are going to die. But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body,
ROM.8.14	For all those led by God’s Spirit
ROM.8.15	For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear.
ROM.8.16	The Spirit himself testifies together with our spirit
ROM.8.17	and if children, also heirs
ROM.8.18	For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing
ROM.8.19	For the creation eagerly waits with anticipation
ROM.8.20	For the creation was subjected
ROM.8.21	that the creation itself
ROM.8.22	For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together with labor pains
ROM.8.23	Not only that,
ROM.8.24	Now in this hope
ROM.8.25	Now if we hope for what we do not see,
ROM.8.26	In the same way the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, because we do not know what to pray for as we should,
ROM.8.27	And he who searches our hearts
ROM.8.28	We know that all things work together
ROM.8.29	For those he foreknew he also predestined
ROM.8.30	And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified;
ROM.8.31	What then are we to say about these things?
ROM.8.32	He did not even spare his own Son
ROM.8.33	Who can bring an accusation against God’s elect?
ROM.8.34	Who is the one who condemns?
ROM.8.35	Who can separate us from the love of Christ? Can affliction
ROM.8.36	As it is written:
ROM.8.37	No, in all these things we are more than conquerors
ROM.8.38	For I am persuaded that neither death nor life,
ROM.8.39	nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing will be able to separate us from the love of God
ROM.9.1	I speak the truth in Christ
ROM.9.2	that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 
ROM.9.3	For I could wish
ROM.9.4	They are Israelites,
ROM.9.5	The ancestors are theirs,
ROM.9.6	Now it is not as though the word of God has failed,
ROM.9.7	Neither are all of Abraham’s children his descendants.
ROM.9.8	That is, it is not the children by physical descent
ROM.9.9	For this is the statement of the promise: 
ROM.9.10	And not only that,
ROM.9.11	For though her sons had not been born yet or done anything good or bad, so that God’s purpose according to election might stand
ROM.9.12	not from works but from the one who calls — she was told, 
ROM.9.13	As it is written: 
ROM.9.14	What should we say then?
ROM.9.15	For he tells Moses, 
ROM.9.16	So then, it does not depend on human will or effort
ROM.9.17	For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, 
ROM.9.18	So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden.
ROM.9.19	You will say to me,
ROM.9.20	But who are you, a mere man, to talk back to God?
ROM.9.21	Or has the potter no right over the clay,
ROM.9.22	And what if God, wanting to display his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience
ROM.9.23	And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory
ROM.9.24	on us, the ones he also called,
ROM.9.25	As it
ROM.9.27	But Isaiah cries out concerning Israel,
ROM.9.29	And just as Isaiah predicted:
ROM.9.30	What should we say then?
ROM.9.31	But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness,
ROM.9.32	Why is that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works.
ROM.9.33	As it is written,
ROM.10.1	Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God concerning them
ROM.10.2	I can testify about them that they have zeal for God,
ROM.10.3	Since they are ignorant of the righteousness of God
ROM.10.4	For Christ is the end
ROM.10.5	since Moses writes about the righteousness that is from the law: 
ROM.10.6	But the righteousness that comes from faith
ROM.10.7	or, 
ROM.10.8	On the contrary, what does it say? 
ROM.10.9	If you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,”
ROM.10.10	One believes with the heart, resulting in righteousness, and one confesses with the mouth, resulting in salvation. 
ROM.10.11	For the Scripture says, 
ROM.10.12	since there is no distinction between Jew and Greek,
ROM.10.13	For 
ROM.10.14	How, then, can they call on him they have not believed in? And how can they believe without hearing about him?
ROM.10.15	And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written: 
ROM.10.16	But not all obeyed the gospel.
ROM.10.17	So faith comes from what is heard,
ROM.10.18	But I ask, “Did they not hear?” Yes, they did:
ROM.10.19	But I ask, “Did Israel not understand?” First, Moses said,
ROM.10.20	And Isaiah says boldly,
ROM.10.21	But to Israel he says, 
ROM.11.1	I ask, then, has God rejected his people?
ROM.11.2	God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.
ROM.11.4	But what was God’s answer to him? 
ROM.11.5	In the same way, then, there is also at the present time a remnant chosen by grace.
ROM.11.6	Now if by grace,
ROM.11.7	What then? Israel did not find what it was looking for,
ROM.11.8	as it is written,
ROM.11.9	And David says,
ROM.11.11	I ask, then, have they stumbled so as to fall? Absolutely not! On the contrary, by their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles
ROM.11.12	Now if their transgression brings riches for the world, and their failure riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their fullness bring!
ROM.11.13	Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Insofar as I am an apostle to the Gentiles,
ROM.11.14	if I might somehow make my own people
ROM.11.15	For if their rejection brings reconciliation
ROM.11.16	Now if the firstfruits are holy,
ROM.11.17	Now if some of the branches were broken off,
ROM.11.18	do not boast that you are better than those branches. But if you do boast — you do not sustain the root, but the root sustains you.
ROM.11.19	Then you will say,
ROM.11.20	True enough; they were broken off because of unbelief, but you stand by faith.
ROM.11.21	because if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either. 
ROM.11.22	Therefore, consider God’s kindness and severity: severity toward those who have fallen but God’s kindness
ROM.11.23	And even they, if they do not remain in unbelief,
ROM.11.24	For if you were cut off from your native wild olive tree and against nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these — the natural branches — be grafted into their own olive tree?
ROM.11.25	I don’t want you to be ignorant
ROM.11.26	And in this way all
ROM.11.28	Regarding the gospel, they are enemies for your advantage,
ROM.11.29	since God’s gracious gifts and calling
ROM.11.30	As you once disobeyed God but now have received mercy through their disobedience, 
ROM.11.31	so they too have now disobeyed, resulting in mercy to you, so that they also may now
ROM.11.32	For God has imprisoned all in disobedience
ROM.11.33	Oh, the depth of the riches
ROM.11.33	both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God!
ROM.11.33	How unsearchable his judgments
ROM.11.33	and untraceable his ways!
ROM.11.36	For from him and through him
ROM.11.36	and to him are all things.
ROM.11.36	To him be the glory forever. Amen.
ROM.12.1	Therefore, brothers and sisters, in view of the mercies of God, I urge you
ROM.12.2	Do not be conformed
ROM.12.3	For by the grace
ROM.12.4	Now as we have many parts in one body,
ROM.12.5	in the same way we who are many
ROM.12.6	According to the grace given to us, we have different gifts:
ROM.12.7	if service,
ROM.12.8	if exhorting,
ROM.12.9	Let love be without hypocrisy.
ROM.12.10	Love one another deeply as brothers and sisters.
ROM.12.11	Do not lack diligence in zeal; be fervent in the Spirit;
ROM.12.12	Rejoice in hope;
ROM.12.13	Share with the saints in their needs;
ROM.12.14	Bless those who persecute you;
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with those who rejoice;
ROM.12.16	Live in harmony with one another.
ROM.12.17	Do not repay anyone evil for evil.
ROM.12.18	If possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone.
ROM.12.19	Friends, do not avenge yourselves; instead, leave room for God’s wrath, because it is written, 
ROM.12.20	But
ROM.12.21	Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Let everyone submit to the governing authorities,
ROM.13.2	So then, the one who resists the authority is opposing God’s command, and those who oppose it will bring judgment on themselves. 
ROM.13.3	For rulers are not a terror
ROM.13.4	For it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, because it does not carry the sword for no reason. For it is God’s servant, an avenger
ROM.13.5	Therefore, you must submit, not only because of wrath but also because of your conscience.
ROM.13.6	And for this reason you pay taxes, since the authorities are God’s servants, continually attending to these tasks.
ROM.13.7	Pay your obligations
ROM.13.8	Do not owe anyone anything, except to love one another, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.
ROM.13.9	The commandments, 
ROM.13.10	Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Love, therefore, is the fulfillment of the law.
ROM.13.11	Besides this, since you know the time, it is already the hour
ROM.13.12	The night is nearly over, and the day is near;
ROM.13.13	Let us walk with decency,
ROM.13.14	But put on the Lord Jesus Christ,
ROM.14.1	Accept
ROM.14.2	One person believes he may eat anything,
ROM.14.3	One who eats must not look down on one who does not eat,
ROM.14.4	Who are you to judge
ROM.14.5	One person judges one day to be more important than another day.
ROM.14.6	Whoever observes the day, observes it for the honor of the Lord.
ROM.14.7	For none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself.
ROM.14.8	If we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
ROM.14.9	Christ died and returned to life
ROM.14.10	But you, why do you judge your brother or sister? Or you, why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God.
ROM.14.11	For it is written,
ROM.14.12	So then, each of us will give an account of himself to God.
ROM.14.13	Therefore, let us no longer judge one another.
ROM.14.14	I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself.
ROM.14.15	For if your brother or sister is hurt by what you eat, you are no longer walking according to love.
ROM.14.16	Therefore, do not let your good be slandered,
ROM.14.17	for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking,
ROM.14.18	Whoever serves Christ
ROM.14.19	So then, let us pursue what promotes peace
ROM.14.20	Do not tear down God’s work because of food. Everything is clean, but it is wrong to make someone fall by what he eats.
ROM.14.21	It is a good thing not to eat meat, or drink wine, or do anything that makes your brother or sister stumble.
ROM.14.22	Whatever you believe about these things, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who does not condemn himself by what he approves.
ROM.14.23	But whoever doubts stands condemned if he eats,
ROM.15.1	Now we who are strong have an obligation to bear the weaknesses of those without strength,
ROM.15.2	Each one of us is to please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.
ROM.15.3	For even Christ did not please himself.
ROM.15.4	For whatever was written in the past was written for our instruction,
ROM.15.5	Now may the God who gives
ROM.15.6	so that you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
ROM.15.7	Therefore accept one another,
ROM.15.8	For I say that Christ became a servant of the circumcised
ROM.15.9	and so that Gentiles
ROM.15.10	Again it says, 
ROM.15.11	And again,
ROM.15.12	And again, Isaiah says,
ROM.15.13	Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe
ROM.15.14	My brothers and sisters, I myself am convinced about you that you also are full of goodness,
ROM.15.15	Nevertheless, I have written to remind you more boldly on some points
ROM.15.16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles,
ROM.15.17	Therefore I have reason to boast in Christ Jesus
ROM.15.18	For I would not dare say anything except what Christ has accomplished through me
ROM.15.19	by the power of miraculous signs and wonders,
ROM.15.20	My aim is to preach the gospel where Christ has not been named,
ROM.15.21	but, as it is written,
ROM.15.22	That is why I have been prevented many times from coming to you.
ROM.15.23	But now I no longer have any work to do in these regions,
ROM.15.24	whenever I travel to Spain.
ROM.15.25	Right now I am traveling to Jerusalem
ROM.15.26	because Macedonia
ROM.15.27	Yes, they were pleased, and indeed are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual benefits,
ROM.15.28	So when I have finished this and safely delivered the funds
ROM.15.29	I know that when I come to you, I will come in the fullness of the blessing
ROM.15.30	Now I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit,
ROM.15.31	Pray that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea,
ROM.15.32	and that, by God’s will,
ROM.15.33	May the God of peace be with all of you.
ROM.16.1	I commend to you
ROM.16.2	So you should welcome her in the Lord
ROM.16.3	Give my greetings to Prisca
ROM.16.4	who risked their own necks for my life. Not only do I thank them, but so do all the Gentile churches. 
ROM.16.5	Greet also the church that meets in their home.
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary,
ROM.16.7	Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews
ROM.16.8	Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Greet Urbanus, our coworker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys. 
ROM.16.10	Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the household of Aristobulus.
ROM.16.11	Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew.
ROM.16.12	Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard in the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, who has worked very hard in the Lord. 
ROM.16.13	Greet Rufus,
ROM.16.14	Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters who are with them. 
ROM.16.15	Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
ROM.16.16	Greet one another with a holy kiss.
ROM.16.17	Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, to watch out for those who create divisions and obstacles contrary to the teaching that you learned.
ROM.16.18	because such people do not serve our Lord Christ
ROM.16.19	The report of your obedience has reached everyone.
ROM.16.20	The God of peace
ROM.16.21	Timothy,
ROM.16.22	I Tertius, who wrote this letter,
ROM.16.23	Gaius,
ROM.16.25	Now to him who is able to strengthen you
ROM.16.26	but now revealed and made known through the prophetic Scriptures,
ROM.16.27	to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ — to him be the glory forever!
1CO.1.1	Paul,
1CO.1.2	To the church of God at Corinth,
1CO.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father
1CO.1.4	I always thank
1CO.1.5	that you were enriched in him
1CO.1.6	In this way, the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you,
1CO.1.7	so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait
1CO.1.8	He will also strengthen you to the end,
1CO.1.9	God is faithful;
1CO.1.10	Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree in what you say, that there be no divisions among you, and that you be united with the same understanding and the same conviction. 
1CO.1.11	For it has been reported to me about you, my brothers and sisters, by members of Chloe’s people, that there is rivalry
1CO.1.12	What I am saying is this: One of you says, “I belong to Paul,” or “I belong to Apollos,”
1CO.1.13	Is Christ divided?
1CO.1.14	I thank God
1CO.1.15	so that no one can say you were baptized in my name. 
1CO.1.16	I did, in fact, baptize the household
1CO.1.17	For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel — not with eloquent wisdom, so that the cross
1CO.1.18	For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is the power of God to us who are being saved.
1CO.1.19	For it is written,
1CO.1.20	Where is the one who is wise? Where is the teacher of the law?
1CO.1.21	For since, in God’s wisdom, the world did not know God through wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the foolishness of what is preached. 
1CO.1.22	For the Jews ask for signs
1CO.1.23	but we preach Christ crucified,
1CO.1.24	Yet to those who are called,
1CO.1.25	because God’s foolishness is wiser than human wisdom, and God’s weakness is stronger than human strength.
1CO.1.26	Brothers and sisters, consider your calling: Not many were wise from a human perspective,
1CO.1.27	Instead, God has chosen
1CO.1.28	God has chosen what is insignificant and despised in the world
1CO.1.29	so that no one
1CO.1.30	It is from him that you are in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom from God for us — our righteousness,
1CO.1.31	in order that, as it is written:
1CO.2.1	When I came to you, brothers and sisters, announcing the mystery
1CO.2.2	I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
1CO.2.3	I came to you in weakness,
1CO.2.4	My speech
1CO.2.5	so that your faith might not be based on human wisdom but on God’s power.
1CO.2.6	We do, however, speak a wisdom among the mature,
1CO.2.7	On the contrary, we speak God’s hidden wisdom in a mystery, a wisdom God predestined
1CO.2.8	None of the rulers of this age knew this wisdom, because if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
1CO.2.9	But as it is written,
1CO.2.10	Now God has revealed these things to us by the Spirit, since the Spirit searches everything,
1CO.2.11	For who knows a person’s thoughts
1CO.2.12	Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we may understand what has been freely given to us by God. 
1CO.2.13	We also speak these things, not in words
1CO.2.14	But the person without the Spirit
1CO.2.15	The spiritual person, however, can evaluate
1CO.2.16	For
1CO.2.16	But we have the mind of Christ.
1CO.3.1	For my part, brothers and sisters, I was not able to speak to you as spiritual people but as people of the flesh, as babies in Christ.
1CO.3.2	I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, since you were not yet ready for it. In fact, you are still not ready, 
1CO.3.3	because you are still worldly. For since there is envy
1CO.3.4	For whenever someone says, “I belong to Paul,” and another, “I belong to Apollos,”
1CO.3.5	What then is Apollos? What is Paul? They are servants through whom you believed, and each has the role the Lord has given. 
1CO.3.6	I planted,
1CO.3.7	So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth. 
1CO.3.8	Now he who plants and he who waters are one,
1CO.3.9	For we are God’s coworkers.
1CO.3.10	According to God’s grace that was given to me, I have laid a foundation as a skilled master builder,
1CO.3.11	For no one can lay any other foundation
1CO.3.12	If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver,
1CO.3.13	each one’s work will become obvious. For the day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire;
1CO.3.14	If anyone’s work that he has built survives, he will receive a reward. 
1CO.3.15	If anyone’s work is burned up, he will experience
1CO.3.16	Don’t you yourselves know that you are God’s temple
1CO.3.17	If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him;
1CO.3.18	Let no one deceive
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness
1CO.3.20	and again, 
1CO.3.21	So let no one boast in human leaders, for everything is yours
1CO.3.22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas
1CO.3.23	and you belong to Christ,
1CO.4.1	A person should think of us in this way: as servants
1CO.4.2	In this regard, it is required that managers be found faithful.
1CO.4.3	It is of little
1CO.4.4	For I am not conscious of anything against myself, but I am not justified
1CO.4.5	So don’t judge
1CO.4.6	Now, brothers and sisters,
1CO.4.7	For who makes you so superior? What do you have that you didn’t receive? If, in fact, you did receive it, why do you boast as if you hadn’t received it? 
1CO.4.8	You are already full! You are already rich! You have begun to reign as kings without us — and I wish you did reign, so that we could also reign with you! 
1CO.4.9	For I think God has displayed us, the apostles, in last place, like men condemned to die: We have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to people. 
1CO.4.10	We are fools for Christ, but you are wise in Christ!
1CO.4.11	Up to the present hour we are both hungry and thirsty; we are poorly clothed, roughly treated, homeless; 
1CO.4.12	we labor, working
1CO.4.13	when we are slandered, we respond graciously. Even now, we are like the scum of the earth, like everyone’s garbage.
1CO.4.14	I’m not writing this to shame you, but to warn you as my dear children.
1CO.4.15	For you may have countless instructors in Christ, but you don’t have many fathers. For I became your father
1CO.4.16	Therefore I urge you to imitate me. 
1CO.4.17	This is why I have sent
1CO.4.18	Now some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you soon,
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power. 
1CO.4.21	What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod,
1CO.5.1	It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality
1CO.5.2	And you are arrogant! Shouldn’t you be filled with grief
1CO.5.3	Even though I am absent in the body, I am present in spirit.
1CO.5.4	When you are assembled in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I am with you in spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
1CO.5.5	hand that one over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh,
1CO.5.6	Your boasting is not good. Don’t you know that a little leaven
1CO.5.7	Clean out the old leaven so that you may be a new unleavened batch, as indeed you are. For Christ our Passover lamb
1CO.5.8	Therefore, let us observe the feast, not with old leaven or with the leaven of malice and evil,
1CO.5.9	I wrote to you in a letter not to associate
1CO.5.10	I did not mean the immoral people of this world or the greedy
1CO.5.11	But actually, I wrote
1CO.5.12	For what business is it of mine to judge
1CO.5.13	God judges outsiders. 
1CO.6.1	If any of you has a dispute against another, how dare you take it to court
1CO.6.2	Or don’t you know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the trivial cases? 
1CO.6.3	Don’t you know that we will judge angels — how much more matters of this life? 
1CO.6.4	So if you have such matters, do you appoint as your judges those who have no standing
1CO.6.5	I say this to your shame!
1CO.6.6	Instead, brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers!
1CO.6.7	As it is, to have legal disputes against one another is already a defeat for you.
1CO.6.8	Instead, you yourselves do wrong and cheat — and you do this to brothers and sisters! 
1CO.6.9	Don’t you know that the unrighteous
1CO.6.10	no thieves,
1CO.6.11	And some of you used to be like this.
1CO.6.12	“Everything is permissible
1CO.6.13	“Food
1CO.6.14	God raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.
1CO.6.15	Don’t you know that your bodies are a part of Christ’s body?
1CO.6.16	Don’t you know that anyone joined to a prostitute is one body with her? For Scripture says, 
1CO.6.17	But anyone joined
1CO.6.18	Flee
1CO.6.19	Don’t you know that your body is a temple
1CO.6.20	for you were bought
1CO.7.1	Now in response to the matters you wrote
1CO.7.2	But because sexual immorality is so common,
1CO.7.3	A husband should fulfill his marital duty
1CO.7.4	A wife does not have the right over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband does not have the right over his own body, but his wife does. 
1CO.7.5	Do not deprive
1CO.7.6	I say this as a concession, not as a command. 
1CO.7.7	I wish that all people were as I am. But each has his own gift
1CO.7.8	I say to the unmarried
1CO.7.9	But if they do not have self-control,
1CO.7.10	To the married I give this command
1CO.7.11	But if she does leave, she must remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband — and a husband is not to divorce his wife.
1CO.7.12	But I (not the Lord) say to the rest: If any brother
1CO.7.13	Also, if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce her husband. 
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is made holy
1CO.7.15	But if the unbeliever leaves, let him leave. A brother or a sister is not bound in such cases. God has called you
1CO.7.16	Wife, for all you know, you might save your husband. Husband, for all you know, you might save your wife.
1CO.7.17	Let each one live his life in the situation the Lord assigned when God called
1CO.7.18	Was anyone already circumcised when he was called? He should not undo his circumcision. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? He should not get circumcised. 
1CO.7.19	Circumcision does not matter and uncircumcision does not matter. Keeping God’s commands is what matters. 
1CO.7.20	Let each of you remain in the situation
1CO.7.21	Were you called while a slave? Don’t let it concern you. But if you can become free, by all means take the opportunity.
1CO.7.22	For he who is called by the Lord as a slave
1CO.7.23	You were bought
1CO.7.24	Brothers and sisters, each person is to remain with God in the situation in which he was called.
1CO.7.25	Now about virgins:
1CO.7.26	Because of the present distress, I think that it is good for a man to remain as he is. 
1CO.7.27	Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Are you released from a wife? Do not seek a wife. 
1CO.7.28	However, if you do get married,
1CO.7.29	This is what I mean, brothers and sisters: The time is limited,
1CO.7.30	those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice
1CO.7.31	and those who use the world as though they did not make full use of it. For this world in its current form is passing away.
1CO.7.32	I want you to be without concerns. The unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord — how he may please
1CO.7.33	But the married man is concerned about the things of the world — how he may please his wife —  
1CO.7.34	and his interests are divided. The unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord,
1CO.7.35	I am saying this for your own benefit, not to put a restraint on you, but to promote what is proper and so that you may be devoted to the Lord without distraction.
1CO.7.36	If any man thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to, if she is getting beyond the usual age for marriage, and he feels he should marry — he can do what he wants. He is not sinning; they can get married. 
1CO.7.37	But he who stands firm in his heart (who is under no compulsion, but has control over his own will
1CO.7.38	So then he who marries his fiancée does well, but he who does not marry will do better.
1CO.7.39	A wife is bound
1CO.7.40	But she is happier if she remains as she is, in my opinion. And I think that I also have the Spirit of God.
1CO.8.1	Now about food sacrificed to idols:
1CO.8.2	If anyone thinks he knows anything, he does not yet know it as he ought to know it.
1CO.8.3	But if anyone loves God,
1CO.8.4	About eating food sacrificed to idols, then, we know that “an idol is nothing in the world,”
1CO.8.5	For even if there are so-called gods,
1CO.8.6	yet for us there is one God, the Father.
1CO.8.7	However, not everyone has this knowledge. Some have been so used to idolatry up until now that when they eat food sacrificed to an idol, their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 
1CO.8.8	Food will not bring us close to God.
1CO.8.9	But be careful that this right of yours in no way becomes a stumbling block
1CO.8.10	For if someone sees you, the one who has knowledge, dining in an idol’s temple, won’t his weak conscience be encouraged
1CO.8.11	So the weak person, the brother or sister for whom Christ died,
1CO.8.12	Now when you sin like this against brothers and sisters and wound their weak conscience, you are sinning against Christ. 
1CO.8.13	Therefore, if food causes my brother or sister to fall, I will never again eat meat,
1CO.9.1	Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? 
1CO.9.2	If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you, because you are the seal
1CO.9.3	My defense to those who examine me is this: 
1CO.9.4	Don’t we have the right to eat and drink?
1CO.9.5	Don’t we have the right to be accompanied by a believing wife
1CO.9.6	Or do only Barnabas
1CO.9.7	Who serves as a soldier at his own expense?
1CO.9.8	Am I saying this from a human perspective? Doesn’t the law also say the same thing? 
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the law of Moses, 
1CO.9.10	Isn’t he really saying it for our sake? Yes, this is written for our sake,
1CO.9.11	If we have sown spiritual things for you, is it too much if we reap material benefits from you? 
1CO.9.12	If others have this right to receive benefits from you, don’t we even more? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right; instead, we endure everything
1CO.9.13	Don’t you know that those who perform the temple services eat the food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar
1CO.9.14	In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should earn their living by the gospel.
1CO.9.15	For my part I have used none of these rights, nor have I written these things that they may be applied in my case. For it would be better for me to die than for anyone to deprive me of my boast! 
1CO.9.16	For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason to boast, because I am compelled to preach
1CO.9.17	For if I do this willingly, I have a reward, but if unwillingly, I am entrusted
1CO.9.18	What then is my reward? To preach the gospel and offer it free of charge and not make full use of my rights in the gospel.
1CO.9.19	Although I am free from all and not anyone’s slave, I have made myself a slave to everyone, in order to win
1CO.9.20	To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win Jews; to those under the law, like one under the law — though I myself am not under the law
1CO.9.21	To those who are without the law,
1CO.9.22	To the weak I became weak, in order to win the weak. I have become all things to all people, so that I may by every possible means save some.
1CO.9.23	Now I do all this because of the gospel, so that I may share in the blessings.
1CO.9.24	Don’t you know that the runners in a stadium all race,
1CO.9.25	Now everyone who competes exercises self-control
1CO.9.26	So I do not run like one who runs aimlessly or box like one beating the air. 
1CO.9.27	Instead, I discipline my body and bring it under strict control, so that after preaching to others, I myself will not be disqualified.
1CO.10.1	Now I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our ancestors
1CO.10.2	and all were baptized
1CO.10.3	They all ate the same spiritual food,
1CO.10.4	and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual rock
1CO.10.5	Nevertheless God was not pleased with most of them, since they were struck down in the wilderness.
1CO.10.6	Now these things took place as examples for us, so that we will not desire
1CO.10.7	Don’t become idolaters
1CO.10.8	Let us not commit sexual immorality
1CO.10.9	Let us not test Christ as some of them did
1CO.10.10	And don’t complain
1CO.10.11	These things happened to them as examples, and they were written for our instruction,
1CO.10.12	So, whoever thinks he stands must be careful not to fall.
1CO.10.13	No temptation has come upon you except what is common to humanity. But God is faithful;
1CO.10.14	So then, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. 
1CO.10.15	I am speaking as to sensible people. Judge for yourselves what I am saying. 
1CO.10.16	The cup
1CO.10.17	Because there is one bread, we who are many are one
1CO.10.18	Consider the people of Israel.
1CO.10.19	What am I saying then? That food sacrificed to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything? 
1CO.10.20	No, but I do say that what they
1CO.10.21	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot share in the Lord’s table and the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	Or are we provoking the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
1CO.10.23	“Everything is permissible,”
1CO.10.24	No one is to seek his own good, but the good of the other person.
1CO.10.25	Eat everything that is sold in the meat market, without raising questions for the sake of conscience, 
1CO.10.26	since 
1CO.10.27	If any of the unbelievers invites you over and you want to go, eat everything that is set before you, without raising questions for the sake of conscience. 
1CO.10.28	But if someone says to you, “This is food from a sacrifice,” do not eat it,
1CO.10.29	I do not mean your own conscience, but the other person’s. For why is my freedom judged
1CO.10.30	If I partake with thanksgiving,
1CO.10.31	So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.
1CO.10.32	Give no offense
1CO.10.33	just as I also try to please everyone in everything, not seeking my own benefit, but the benefit of many,
1CO.11.1	Imitate me, as I also imitate Christ.
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you
1CO.11.3	But I want you to know that Christ is the head
1CO.11.4	Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors
1CO.11.5	Every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since that is one and the same as having her head shaved.
1CO.11.6	For if a woman doesn’t cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, let her head be covered.
1CO.11.7	A man should not cover his head, because he is the image
1CO.11.8	For man did not come from woman, but woman came from man.
1CO.11.9	Neither was man created for the sake of woman, but woman for the sake of man. 
1CO.11.10	This is why a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. 
1CO.11.11	In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, and man is not independent of woman. 
1CO.11.12	For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman, and all things come from God.
1CO.11.13	Judge
1CO.11.14	Does not even nature itself teach
1CO.11.15	but that if a woman has long hair, it is her glory?
1CO.11.16	If anyone wants to argue about this, we have no other
1CO.11.17	Now in giving this instruction I do not praise you, since you come together not for the better but for the worse. 
1CO.11.18	For to begin with, I hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. 
1CO.11.19	Indeed, it is necessary that there be factions
1CO.11.20	When you come together, then, it is not to eat the Lord’s Supper.
1CO.11.21	For at the meal, each one eats his own supper.
1CO.11.22	Don’t you have homes in which to eat and drink? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I do not praise you in this matter!
1CO.11.23	For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you:
1CO.11.24	and when he had given thanks, broke it, and said,
1CO.11.25	In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, and said, 
1CO.11.26	For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death
1CO.11.27	So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sin against the body
1CO.11.28	Let a person examine himself; in this way let him eat the bread and drink from the cup. 
1CO.11.29	For whoever eats and drinks without recognizing the body,
1CO.11.30	This is why many are sick and ill among you, and many have fallen asleep.
1CO.11.31	If we were properly judging ourselves, we would not be judged, 
1CO.11.32	but when we are judged
1CO.11.33	Therefore, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, welcome one another.
1CO.11.34	If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you gather together you will not come under judgment. I will give instructions about the other matters whenever I come.
1CO.12.1	Now concerning spiritual gifts:
1CO.12.2	You know that when you were pagans, you used to be enticed and led astray by mute
1CO.12.3	Therefore I want you to know that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	Now there are different gifts,
1CO.12.5	There are different ministries, but the same Lord. 
1CO.12.6	And there are different activities, but the same God produces each gift in each person. 
1CO.12.7	A manifestation of the Spirit is given to each person
1CO.12.8	to one
1CO.12.9	to another, faith by the same Spirit, to another, gifts of healing
1CO.12.10	to another, the performing of miracles,
1CO.12.11	One and the same Spirit is active in all these, distributing to each person as he wills.
1CO.12.12	For just as the body is one
1CO.12.13	For we were all baptized by
1CO.12.14	Indeed, the body is not one part but many. 
1CO.12.15	If the foot should say, “Because I’m not a hand, I don’t belong to the body,” it is not for that reason any less a part of the body. 
1CO.12.16	And if the ear should say, “Because I’m not an eye, I don’t belong to the body,” it is not for that reason any less a part of the body. 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be? 
1CO.12.18	But as it is, God has arranged each one of the parts in the body just as he wanted.
1CO.12.19	And if they were all the same part, where would the body be? 
1CO.12.20	As it is, there are many parts, but one body. 
1CO.12.21	The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” Or again, the head can’t say to the feet, “I don’t need you!” 
1CO.12.22	On the contrary, those parts of the body that are weaker are indispensable. 
1CO.12.23	And those parts of the body that we consider less honorable,
1CO.12.24	which our respectable parts do not need.
1CO.12.24	Instead, God has put the body together, giving greater honor to the less honorable, 
1CO.12.25	so that there would be no division
1CO.12.26	So if one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.
1CO.12.27	Now you are the body of Christ,
1CO.12.28	And God has appointed these in the church:
1CO.12.29	Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all do miracles? 
1CO.12.30	Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in other tongues? Do all interpret?
1CO.12.31	But desire
1CO.13.1	If I speak human or angelic tongues
1CO.13.2	If I have the gift of prophecy
1CO.13.3	And if I give away all my possessions, and if I give over my body in order to boast
1CO.13.4	Love is patient,
1CO.13.5	is not rude, is not self-seeking,
1CO.13.6	Love finds no joy in unrighteousness but rejoices in the truth.
1CO.13.7	It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures
1CO.13.8	Love never ends.
1CO.13.9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part, 
1CO.13.10	but when the perfect comes, the partial will come to an end. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put aside childish things. 
1CO.13.12	For now we see only a reflection
1CO.13.13	Now these three remain: faith, hope,
1CO.14.1	Pursue love and desire spiritual gifts, and especially that you may prophesy. 
1CO.14.2	For the person who speaks in another tongue
1CO.14.3	On the other hand, the person who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening,
1CO.14.4	The person who speaks in another tongue builds himself up, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. 
1CO.14.5	I wish all of you spoke in other tongues,
1CO.14.6	So now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in other tongues, how will I benefit you unless I speak to you with a revelation
1CO.14.7	Even lifeless instruments that produce sounds — whether flute or harp
1CO.14.8	In fact, if the bugle makes an unclear sound, who will prepare for battle?
1CO.14.9	In the same way, unless you use your tongue for intelligible speech, how will what is spoken be known? For you will be speaking into the air. 
1CO.14.10	There are doubtless many different kinds of languages in the world, none is without meaning. 
1CO.14.11	Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner
1CO.14.12	So also you — since you are zealous
1CO.14.13	Therefore the person who speaks in another tongue should pray that he can interpret. 
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in another tongue, my spirit
1CO.14.15	What then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with my understanding. I will sing praise with the spirit, and I will also sing praise with my understanding. 
1CO.14.16	Otherwise, if you praise with the spirit,
1CO.14.17	For you may very well be giving thanks, but the other person is not being built up. 
1CO.14.18	I thank
1CO.14.19	yet in the church I would rather speak five words
1CO.14.20	Brothers and sisters, don’t be childish in your thinking, but be infants in regard to evil and adult in your thinking.
1CO.14.21	It is written in the law,
1CO.14.21	says the Lord. 
1CO.14.22	Speaking in other tongues, then, is intended as a sign, not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers. 
1CO.14.23	If, therefore, the whole church assembles together and all are speaking in other tongues and people who are outsiders or unbelievers come in, will they not say that you are out of your minds? 
1CO.14.24	But if all are prophesying and some unbeliever or outsider comes in, he is convicted by all and is called to account by all. 
1CO.14.25	The secrets of his heart will be revealed, and as a result he will fall facedown and worship God, proclaiming, “God is really among you.”
1CO.14.26	What then, brothers and sisters? Whenever you come together, each one
1CO.14.27	If anyone speaks in another tongue, there are to be only two, or at the most three, each in turn, and let someone interpret. 
1CO.14.28	But if there is no interpreter, that person is to keep silent in the church and speak to himself and God. 
1CO.14.29	Two or three prophets should speak, and the others should evaluate.
1CO.14.30	But if something has been revealed to another person sitting there, the first prophet should be silent. 
1CO.14.31	For you can all prophesy one by one, so that everyone may learn and everyone may be encouraged.
1CO.14.32	And the prophets’ spirits are subject to the prophets, 
1CO.14.33	since God is not a God of disorder but of peace.
1CO.14.33	As in all the churches of the saints,
1CO.14.34	the women
1CO.14.35	If they want to learn something, let them ask their own husbands
1CO.14.36	Or did the word of God originate from you, or did it come to you only?
1CO.14.37	If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, he should recognize that what I write to you is the Lord’s command. 
1CO.14.38	If anyone ignores this, he will be ignored.
1CO.14.39	So then, my brothers and sisters, be eager
1CO.14.40	But everything is to be done decently
1CO.15.1	Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel I preached to you, which you received, on which you have taken your stand
1CO.15.2	and by which you are being saved, if you hold to the message I preached to you — unless you believed in vain.
1CO.15.3	For I passed on to you
1CO.15.4	that he was buried,
1CO.15.5	and that he appeared to Cephas,
1CO.15.6	Then he appeared to over five hundred brothers and sisters at one time;
1CO.15.7	Then he appeared to James,
1CO.15.8	Last of all, as to one born at the wrong time,
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the apostles,
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me.
1CO.15.11	Whether, then, it is I or they, so we proclaim and so you have believed.
1CO.15.12	Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead,
1CO.15.13	If there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised; 
1CO.15.14	and if Christ has not been raised, then our proclamation is in vain, and so is your faith.
1CO.15.15	Moreover, we are found to be false witnesses
1CO.15.16	For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. 
1CO.15.17	And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins. 
1CO.15.18	Those, then, who have fallen asleep in Christ
1CO.15.19	If we have put our hope in Christ for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone.
1CO.15.20	But as it is, Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits
1CO.15.21	For since death
1CO.15.22	For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
1CO.15.23	But each in his own order:
1CO.15.24	Then comes the end,
1CO.15.25	For he must reign
1CO.15.26	The last enemy to be abolished is death.
1CO.15.27	For 
1CO.15.28	When everything is subject to Christ, then the Son
1CO.15.29	Otherwise what will they do who are being baptized for the dead?
1CO.15.30	Why are we in danger every hour? 
1CO.15.31	I face death every day,
1CO.15.32	If I fought wild beasts in Ephesus
1CO.15.33	Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.” 
1CO.15.34	Come to your senses
1CO.15.35	But someone will ask, “How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have when they come?” 
1CO.15.36	You fool! What you sow does not come to life
1CO.15.37	And as for what you sow — you are not sowing the body that will be, but only a seed, perhaps of wheat or another grain. 
1CO.15.38	But God gives it a body as he wants,
1CO.15.39	Not all flesh
1CO.15.40	There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor
1CO.15.41	There is a splendor of the sun, another of the moon, and another of the stars; in fact, one star differs from another star in splendor. 
1CO.15.42	So it is with the resurrection of the dead: Sown in corruption, raised in incorruption;
1CO.15.43	sown in dishonor,
1CO.15.44	sown a natural body, raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	So it is written, 
1CO.15.46	However, the spiritual is not first, but the natural, then the spiritual.
1CO.15.47	The first man was from the earth, a man of dust;
1CO.15.48	Like the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; like the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven.
1CO.15.49	And just as we have borne the image
1CO.15.50	What I am saying, brothers and sisters, is this: Flesh
1CO.15.51	Listen, I am telling you a mystery: We will not all fall asleep, but we will all be changed, 
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.
1CO.15.53	For this corruptible body must be clothed
1CO.15.54	When this corruptible body is clothed with incorruptibility, and this mortal body is clothed with immortality, then the saying that is written will take place:
1CO.15.56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin
1CO.15.57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters, be steadfast, immovable, always excelling in the Lord’s work,
1CO.16.1	Now about the collection
1CO.16.2	On the first day of the week,
1CO.16.3	When I arrive, I will send with letters
1CO.16.4	If it is suitable for me to go as well, they will travel with me.
1CO.16.5	I will come to you after I pass through Macedonia
1CO.16.6	and perhaps I will remain with you or even spend the winter, so that you may send me on my way wherever I go. 
1CO.16.7	I don’t want to see you now just in passing, since I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord allows.
1CO.16.8	But I will stay in Ephesus
1CO.16.9	because a wide door
1CO.16.10	If Timothy comes, see that he has nothing to fear while with you, because he is doing the Lord’s work,
1CO.16.11	So let no one look down
1CO.16.12	Now about our brother Apollos:
1CO.16.13	Be alert, stand firm in the faith,
1CO.16.14	Do everything in love.
1CO.16.15	Brothers and sisters, you know the household of Stephanas: They are the firstfruits
1CO.16.16	also to submit to such people, and to everyone who works and labors with them. 
1CO.16.17	I am delighted to have Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus present, because these men have made up for your absence. 
1CO.16.18	For they have refreshed my spirit
1CO.16.19	The churches of Asia
1CO.16.20	All the brothers and sisters send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
1CO.16.21	This greeting is in my own hand
1CO.16.22	If anyone does not love the Lord, a curse be on him. Our Lord, come!
1CO.16.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1CO.16.24	My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
2CO.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will,
2CO.1.1	To the church of God at Corinth,
2CO.1.2	Grace to you and peace
2CO.1.3	Blessed be
2CO.1.4	He comforts us in all our affliction,
2CO.1.5	For just as the sufferings
2CO.1.6	If we are afflicted,
2CO.1.7	And our hope
2CO.1.8	We don’t want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, of our affliction that took place in Asia.
2CO.1.9	Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death, so that we would not trust in ourselves but in God
2CO.1.10	He has delivered
2CO.1.11	while you join in helping us by your prayers. Then many will give thanks on our
2CO.1.12	Indeed, this is our boast: The testimony
2CO.1.13	For we are writing nothing to you other than what you can read and also understand. I hope you will understand completely —  
2CO.1.14	just as you have partially understood us — that we are your reason for pride,
2CO.1.15	Because of this confidence, I planned to come to you first,
2CO.1.16	and to visit you on my way to Macedonia,
2CO.1.17	Now when I planned this, was I of two minds? Or what I plan, do I plan in a purely human
2CO.1.18	As God is faithful,
2CO.1.19	For the Son of God,
2CO.1.20	For every one of God’s promises
2CO.1.21	Now it is God who strengthens us together with you in Christ, and who has anointed
2CO.1.22	He has also put his seal on us and given us the Spirit in our hearts
2CO.1.23	I call on God as a witness,
2CO.1.24	I do not mean that we lord it over your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy, because you stand firm in your
2CO.2.1	In fact, I made up my mind about this: I would not come to you on another painful visit.
2CO.2.2	For if I cause you pain, then who will cheer me other than the one being hurt by me?
2CO.2.3	I wrote this very thing so that when I came I wouldn’t have pain from those who ought to give me joy, because I am confident
2CO.2.4	For I wrote to you with many tears out of an extremely troubled and anguished heart — not to cause you pain, but that you should know the abundant love I have for you.
2CO.2.5	If anyone has caused pain, he has caused pain not so much to me but to some degree — not to exaggerate
2CO.2.6	This punishment by the majority is sufficient for that person. 
2CO.2.7	As a result, you should instead forgive
2CO.2.8	Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love to him. 
2CO.2.9	I wrote for this purpose: to test your character
2CO.2.10	Anyone you forgive, I do too. For what I have forgiven — if I have forgiven anything — it is for your benefit in the presence of Christ, 
2CO.2.11	so that we may not be taken advantage
2CO.2.12	When I came to Troas
2CO.2.13	I had no rest
2CO.2.14	But thanks be to God,
2CO.2.15	For to God we are the fragrance
2CO.2.16	To some we are an aroma of death
2CO.2.17	For we do not market the word of God
2CO.3.1	Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, like some, letters of recommendation to you or from you? 
2CO.3.2	You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone.
2CO.3.3	You show that you are Christ’s letter,
2CO.3.4	Such is the confidence we have through Christ before God. 
2CO.3.5	It is not that we are competent in
2CO.3.6	He has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant,
2CO.3.7	Now if the ministry that brought death, chiseled in letters on stones, came with glory,
2CO.3.8	how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious? 
2CO.3.9	For if the ministry that brought condemnation had glory, the ministry that brings righteousness overflows with even more glory. 
2CO.3.10	In fact, what had been glorious is not glorious now by comparison because of the glory that surpasses it. 
2CO.3.11	For if what was set aside
2CO.3.12	Since, then, we have such a hope,
2CO.3.13	We are not like Moses, who used to put a veil over his face
2CO.3.14	but their minds were hardened.
2CO.3.15	Yet still today, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their hearts, 
2CO.3.16	but whenever a person turns
2CO.3.17	Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 
2CO.3.18	We all, with unveiled faces, are looking as in a mirror at
2CO.4.1	Therefore, since we have this ministry because we were shown mercy,
2CO.4.2	Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful things, not acting
2CO.4.3	But if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. 
2CO.4.4	In their case, the god of this age
2CO.4.5	For we are not proclaiming ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord,
2CO.4.6	For God who said, “Let light shine out of darkness,”
2CO.4.7	Now we have this treasure in clay jars, so that this extraordinary power
2CO.4.8	We are afflicted in every way but not crushed; we are perplexed but not in despair; 
2CO.4.9	we are persecuted but not abandoned; we are struck down but not destroyed. 
2CO.4.10	We always carry the death of Jesus
2CO.4.11	For we who live are always being given over to death
2CO.4.12	So then, death is at work in us, but life in you. 
2CO.4.13	And since we have the same spirit of faith in keeping with what is written, 
2CO.4.14	For we know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus
2CO.4.15	Indeed, everything is for your benefit so that, as grace extends through more and more people, it may cause thanksgiving
2CO.4.16	Therefore we do not give up.
2CO.4.17	For our momentary light affliction
2CO.4.18	So we do not focus on what is seen,
2CO.5.1	For we know that if our earthly tent we live in
2CO.5.2	Indeed, we groan in this tent, desiring
2CO.5.3	since, when we have taken it off,
2CO.5.4	Indeed, we groan while we are in this tent, burdened as we are, because we do not want to be unclothed but clothed, so that mortality
2CO.5.5	Now the one who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment.
2CO.5.6	So we are always confident and know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. 
2CO.5.7	For we walk by faith,
2CO.5.8	In fact, we are confident, and we would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
2CO.5.9	Therefore, whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to be pleasing
2CO.5.10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat
2CO.5.11	Therefore, since we know the fear of the Lord,
2CO.5.12	We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you may have a reply for those who take pride in outward appearance rather than in the heart. 
2CO.5.13	For if we are out of our mind,
2CO.5.14	For the love of Christ compels us, since we have reached this conclusion: If one died for all,
2CO.5.15	And he died for all
2CO.5.16	From now on, then, we do not know anyone from a worldly perspective.
2CO.5.17	Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation;
2CO.5.18	Everything is from God, who has reconciled us to himself through Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation.
2CO.5.19	That is, in Christ, God was reconciling the world
2CO.5.20	Therefore, we are ambassadors
2CO.5.21	He made the one who did not know sin
2CO.6.1	Working together with him, we also appeal to you, “Don’t receive the grace of God in vain.” 
2CO.6.2	For he says:
2CO.6.2	See, now is the acceptable time; now is the day of salvation!
2CO.6.3	We are not giving anyone an occasion for offense, so that the ministry will not be blamed. 
2CO.6.4	Instead, as God’s ministers, we commend ourselves in everything: by great endurance, by afflictions, by hardships, by difficulties, 
2CO.6.5	by beatings, by imprisonments,
2CO.6.6	by purity,
2CO.6.7	by the word of truth,
2CO.6.8	through glory
2CO.6.9	as unknown, yet recognized; as dying, yet see — we live; as being disciplined, yet not killed; 
2CO.6.10	as grieving, yet always rejoicing;
2CO.6.11	We have spoken openly to you, Corinthians; our heart has been opened wide. 
2CO.6.12	We are not withholding our affection from you, but you are withholding yours from us. 
2CO.6.13	I speak as to my children; as a proper response, open your heart to us.
2CO.6.14	Don’t become partners with those who do not believe. For what partnership is there between righteousness and lawlessness?
2CO.6.15	What agreement does Christ have with Belial?
2CO.6.16	And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols?
2CO.7.1	So then, dear friends, since we have these promises,
2CO.7.2	Make room for us in your hearts. We have wronged no one, corrupted
2CO.7.3	I don’t say this to condemn you, since I have already said that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together. 
2CO.7.4	I am very frank with you; I have great pride in you. I am filled with encouragement; I am overflowing with joy in all our afflictions.
2CO.7.5	In fact, when we came into Macedonia,
2CO.7.6	But God, who comforts the downcast,
2CO.7.7	and not only by his arrival but also by the comfort he received from you. He told us about your deep longing, your sorrow, and your zeal
2CO.7.8	For even if I grieved you with my letter,
2CO.7.9	I now rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because your grief led to repentance. For you were grieved as God willed, so that you didn’t experience any loss from us. 
2CO.7.10	For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly grief produces death.
2CO.7.11	For consider how much diligence this very thing — this grieving as God wills — has produced in you: what a desire to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what deep longing, what zeal, what justice! In every way you showed yourselves to be pure
2CO.7.12	So even though I wrote to you, it was not because of the one who did wrong, or because of the one who was wronged, but in order that your devotion to us might be made plain to you in the sight of God. 
2CO.7.13	For this reason we have been comforted.
2CO.7.13	In addition to our own comfort, we rejoiced even more over the joy Titus
2CO.7.14	For if I have made any boast to him about you, I have not been disappointed; but as I have spoken everything to you in truth,
2CO.7.15	And his affection toward you is even greater as he remembers the obedience of all of you, and how you received him with fear and trembling. 
2CO.7.16	I rejoice that I have complete confidence in you.
2CO.8.1	We want you to know, brothers and sisters, about the grace of God that was given to the churches
2CO.8.2	During a severe trial brought about by affliction, their abundant joy and their extreme poverty overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
2CO.8.3	I can testify that, according to their ability and even beyond their ability, of their own accord, 
2CO.8.4	they begged us earnestly for the privilege of sharing
2CO.8.5	and not just as we had hoped. Instead, they gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us by God’s will.
2CO.8.6	So we urged Titus that just as he had begun, so he should also complete among you this act of grace.
2CO.8.7	Now as you excel in everything — in faith, speech, knowledge,
2CO.8.8	I am not saying this as a command. Rather, by means of the diligence of others, I am testing the genuineness of your love. 
2CO.8.9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: Though he was rich,
2CO.8.10	And in this matter I am giving advice because it is profitable for you, who began last year not only to do something but also to want to do it.
2CO.8.11	Now also finish the task, so that just as there was an eager desire, there may also be a completion, according to what you have. 
2CO.8.12	For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have.
2CO.8.13	It is not that there should be relief for others and hardship for you, but it is a question of equality.
2CO.8.14	At the present time your surplus is available for their need, so that their abundance may in turn meet your need, in order that there may be equality. 
2CO.8.15	As it is written: 
2CO.8.16	Thanks be to God, who put the same concern for you into the heart of Titus. 
2CO.8.17	For he welcomed our appeal and, being very diligent, went out to you by his own choice. 
2CO.8.18	We have sent with him the brother
2CO.8.19	And not only that, but he was also appointed by the churches to accompany us with this gracious gift that we are administering for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our eagerness to help. 
2CO.8.20	We are taking this precaution so that no one will criticize us about this large sum that we are administering. 
2CO.8.21	Indeed, we are giving careful thought
2CO.8.22	We have also sent with them our brother. We have often tested him in many circumstances and found him to be diligent — and now even more diligent because of his great confidence in you. 
2CO.8.23	As for Titus, he is my partner
2CO.8.24	Therefore, show them proof before the churches of your love and of our boasting
2CO.9.1	Now concerning the ministry to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you. 
2CO.9.2	For I know your eagerness, and I boast about you to the Macedonians:
2CO.9.3	But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you in this matter would not prove empty, and so that you would be ready just as I said. 
2CO.9.4	Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we, not to mention you, would be put to shame in that situation.
2CO.9.5	Therefore I considered it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance the generous gift
2CO.9.6	The point is this:
2CO.9.7	Each person should do as he has decided in his heart — not reluctantly or out of compulsion, since God loves
2CO.9.8	And God is able
2CO.9.9	As it is written:
2CO.9.10	Now the one who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will also provide and multiply your seed and increase the harvest of your righteousness.
2CO.9.11	You will be enriched
2CO.9.12	For the ministry of this service
2CO.9.13	Because of the proof provided by this ministry, they will glorify God for your obedient confession of the gospel of Christ, and for your generosity
2CO.9.14	And as they pray on your behalf, they will have deep affection for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you. 
2CO.9.15	Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
2CO.10.1	Now I Paul, myself, appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ — I who am humble among you in person but bold toward you when absent. 
2CO.10.2	I beg you that when I am present I will not need to be bold with the confidence by which I plan to challenge certain people who think we are behaving according to the flesh.
2CO.10.3	For although we live in the flesh, we do not wage war according to the flesh, 
2CO.10.4	since the weapons of our warfare
2CO.10.5	and every proud thing that is raised up against the knowledge
2CO.10.6	And we are ready to punish any disobedience, once your obedience is complete.
2CO.10.7	Look at what is obvious.
2CO.10.8	For if I boast a little too much about our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up
2CO.10.9	I don’t want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters. 
2CO.10.10	For it is said, “His letters are weighty and powerful, but his physical presence is weak and his public speaking amounts to nothing.” 
2CO.10.11	Let such a person consider this: What we are in our letters, when we are absent, we will also be in our actions when we are present.
2CO.10.12	For we don’t dare classify or compare ourselves with some who commend
2CO.10.13	We, however, will not boast beyond measure but according to the measure of the area of ministry that God has assigned
2CO.10.14	For we are not overextending ourselves, as if we had not reached you, since we have come to you with the gospel of Christ. 
2CO.10.15	We are not boasting beyond measure about other people’s labors. On the contrary, we have the hope
2CO.10.16	so that we may preach the gospel to the regions beyond you
2CO.10.17	So 
2CO.10.18	For it is not the one commending himself who is approved, but the one the Lord commends.
2CO.11.1	I wish you would put up with a little foolishness
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous
2CO.11.3	But I fear that, as the serpent
2CO.11.4	For if a person comes and preaches another Jesus,
2CO.11.5	Now I consider myself in no way inferior to those “super-apostles.”
2CO.11.6	Even if I am untrained in public speaking,
2CO.11.7	Or did I commit a sin by humbling
2CO.11.8	I robbed other churches by taking pay from them to minister to you. 
2CO.11.9	When I was present with you and in need, I did not burden anyone, since the brothers who came from Macedonia
2CO.11.10	As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be stopped
2CO.11.11	Why? Because I don’t love you? God knows I do!
2CO.11.12	But I will continue to do what I am doing, in order to deny
2CO.11.13	For such people are false apostles,
2CO.11.14	And no wonder! For Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	So it is no great surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will be according to their works.
2CO.11.16	I repeat: Let no one consider me a fool. But if you do, at least accept me as a fool so that I can also boast a little. 
2CO.11.17	What I am saying in this matter
2CO.11.18	Since many boast according to the flesh, I will also boast. 
2CO.11.19	For you, being so wise, gladly put up with fools!
2CO.11.20	In fact, you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone exploits
2CO.11.21	I say this to our shame: We have been too weak for that!
2CO.11.21	But in whatever anyone dares to boast — I am talking foolishly — I also dare: 
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews?
2CO.11.23	Are they servants of Christ? I’m talking like a madman — I’m a better one: with far more labors, many more imprisonments, far worse beatings, many times near death.
2CO.11.24	Five times I received the forty lashes minus one from the Jews.
2CO.11.25	Three times I was beaten with rods.
2CO.11.26	On frequent journeys, I faced dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers,
2CO.11.27	toil and hardship, many sleepless nights, hunger and thirst, often without food, cold, and without clothing.
2CO.11.28	Not to mention
2CO.11.29	Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble,
2CO.11.30	If boasting is necessary, I will boast about my weaknesses. 
2CO.11.31	The God and Father
2CO.11.32	In Damascus,
2CO.11.33	So I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped from his hands.
2CO.12.1	Boasting is necessary. It is not profitable, but I will move on to visions
2CO.12.2	I know a man in Christ who was caught up
2CO.12.3	I know that this man — whether in the body or out of the body I don’t know; God knows —  
2CO.12.4	was caught up into paradise
2CO.12.5	I will boast about this person, but not about myself, except of my weaknesses.
2CO.12.6	For if I want to boast, I wouldn’t be a fool, because I would be telling the truth.
2CO.12.7	especially because of the extraordinary revelations. Therefore, so that I would not exalt myself, a thorn in the flesh
2CO.12.8	Concerning this, I pleaded with the Lord three times that it would leave me. 
2CO.12.9	But he said to me, 
2CO.12.9	Therefore, I will most gladly boast all the more about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may reside in me. 
2CO.12.10	So I take pleasure in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and in difficulties, for the sake of Christ.
2CO.12.11	I have been a fool; you forced it on me. You ought to have commended me, since I am not in any way inferior to those “super-apostles,” even though I am nothing.
2CO.12.12	The signs
2CO.12.13	So in what way are you worse off than the other churches, except that I personally did not burden you? Forgive me for this wrong!
2CO.12.14	Look, I am ready to come to you this third time.
2CO.12.15	I will most gladly spend and be spent for you.
2CO.12.16	Now granted, I did not burden
2CO.12.17	Did I take advantage of you by any of those I sent you? 
2CO.12.18	I urged Titus
2CO.12.19	Have you been thinking all along that we were defending ourselves to you? No, in the sight of God we are speaking in Christ, and everything, dear friends, is for building you up.
2CO.12.20	For I fear that perhaps when I come I will not find you to be what I want, and you may not find me to be what you want. Perhaps there will be quarreling,
2CO.12.21	I fear that when I come my God will again
2CO.13.1	This is the third time I am coming to you.
2CO.13.2	I gave a warning when I was present the second time, and now I give a warning
2CO.13.3	since you seek proof of Christ speaking in me.
2CO.13.4	For he was crucified
2CO.13.5	Test
2CO.13.6	And I hope you will recognize that we ourselves do not fail the test. 
2CO.13.7	But we pray to God that you do nothing wrong — not that we may appear to pass the test, but that you may do what is right,
2CO.13.8	For we can’t do anything against the truth,
2CO.13.9	We rejoice when we are weak and you are strong.
2CO.13.10	This is why I am writing these things while absent, so that when I am there I may not have to deal harshly with you, in keeping with the authority the Lord gave me for building up
2CO.13.11	Finally, brothers and sisters, rejoice.
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with a holy kiss.
2CO.13.13	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love
GAL.1.1	Paul,
GAL.1.2	and all the brothers who are with me:
GAL.1.2	To the churches of Galatia.
GAL.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord
GAL.1.4	who gave himself for our sins
GAL.1.5	To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
GAL.1.6	I am amazed that you are so quickly turning away from him who called
GAL.1.7	not that there is another gospel,
GAL.1.8	But even if we or an angel
GAL.1.9	As we have said before, I now say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to what you received,
GAL.1.10	For am I now trying to persuade people,
GAL.1.11	For I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel preached by me is not of human origin. 
GAL.1.12	For I did not receive it from a human source and I was not taught it, but it came by a revelation
GAL.1.13	For you have heard about my former way of life
GAL.1.14	I advanced in Judaism beyond many contemporaries among my people, because I was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.
GAL.1.15	But when God, who from my mother’s womb set me apart and called
GAL.1.16	to reveal his Son
GAL.1.17	I did not go up to Jerusalem
GAL.1.18	Then after three years I did go up to Jerusalem
GAL.1.19	But I didn’t see any of the other apostles except James,
GAL.1.20	I declare in the sight of God: I am not lying in what I write to you.
GAL.1.21	Afterward, I went to the regions of Syria
GAL.1.22	I remained personally unknown to the Judean churches that are in Christ. 
GAL.1.23	They simply kept hearing: “He who formerly persecuted
GAL.1.24	And they glorified God because of me.
GAL.2.1	Then after fourteen years I went up again
GAL.2.2	I went up according to a revelation
GAL.2.3	But not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. 
GAL.2.4	This matter arose because some false brothers
GAL.2.5	But we did not give up and submit to these people for even a moment, so that the truth
GAL.2.6	Now from those recognized as important (what they
GAL.2.7	On the contrary, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised,
GAL.2.8	since the one at work in Peter for an apostleship to the circumcised was also at work in me for the Gentiles. 
GAL.2.9	When James,
GAL.2.10	They asked only that we would remember the poor,
GAL.2.11	But when Cephas
GAL.2.12	For he regularly ate with the Gentiles before certain men came from James. However, when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, because he feared those from the circumcision party. 
GAL.2.13	Then the rest of the Jews
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they were deviating from the truth of the gospel, I told Cephas
GAL.2.15	We are Jews by birth and not “Gentile sinners,” 
GAL.2.16	and yet because we know that a person is not justified by the works of the law
GAL.2.17	But if we ourselves are also found to be “sinners” while seeking to be justified by Christ,
GAL.2.18	If I rebuild
GAL.2.19	For through the law I died to the law,
GAL.2.20	I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me.
GAL.2.21	I do not set aside the grace of God, for if righteousness comes through the law,
GAL.3.1	You foolish
GAL.3.2	I only want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing what you heard?
GAL.3.3	Are you so foolish? After beginning by the Spirit, are you now finishing by the flesh? 
GAL.3.4	Did you experience
GAL.3.5	So then, does God give you the Spirit and work miracles
GAL.3.6	just like Abraham who 
GAL.3.7	You know, then, that those who have faith, these are Abraham’s sons.
GAL.3.8	Now the Scripture saw in advance that God would justify the Gentiles by faith and proclaimed the gospel ahead of time to Abraham,
GAL.3.9	Consequently those who have faith are blessed with Abraham,
GAL.3.10	For all who rely on the works of the law are under a curse,
GAL.3.11	Now it is clear that no one is justified before God by the law, because 
GAL.3.12	But the law is not based on faith; instead, 
GAL.3.13	Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us,
GAL.3.14	The purpose was that the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles by Christ Jesus, so that we could receive the promised Spirit through faith.
GAL.3.15	Brothers and sisters, I’m using a human illustration. No one sets aside or makes additions to a validated human will.
GAL.3.16	Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say “and to seeds,” as though referring to many, but referring to one, 
GAL.3.17	My point is this: The law, which came 430 years later,
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on the promise; but God has graciously given it to Abraham through the promise.
GAL.3.19	Why then was the law given?
GAL.3.20	Now a mediator is not just for one person alone, but God is one.
GAL.3.21	Is the law therefore contrary to God’s promises? Absolutely not! For if the law had been granted with the ability to give life, then righteousness would certainly be on the basis of the law. 
GAL.3.22	But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin’s power,
GAL.3.23	Before this faith
GAL.3.24	The law, then, was our guardian until Christ,
GAL.3.25	But since that faith
GAL.3.26	for through faith you are all sons of God in Christ Jesus.
GAL.3.27	For those of you who were baptized into Christ have been clothed with Christ.
GAL.3.28	There is no Jew or Greek, slave or free,
GAL.3.29	And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s seed, heirs
GAL.4.1	Now I say that as long as the heir
GAL.4.2	Instead, he is under guardians and trustees until the time set by his father. 
GAL.4.3	In the same way we also, when we were children, were in slavery under the elements
GAL.4.4	When the time came to completion, God sent his Son,
GAL.4.5	to redeem those under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.
GAL.4.6	And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son
GAL.4.7	So you are no longer a slave
GAL.4.8	But in the past, since you didn’t know God,
GAL.4.9	But now, since you know God,
GAL.4.10	You are observing special days, months, seasons, and years.
GAL.4.11	I am fearful for you, that perhaps my labor for you has been wasted.
GAL.4.12	I beg you, brothers and sisters: Become like me, for I also became like you. You have not wronged me; 
GAL.4.13	you know
GAL.4.14	You did not despise or reject me though my physical condition was a trial for you.
GAL.4.15	Where, then, is your blessing? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me. 
GAL.4.16	So then, have I become your enemy because I told you the truth?
GAL.4.17	They court you eagerly, but not for good. They want to exclude you from me, so that you would pursue them. 
GAL.4.18	But it is always good to be pursued
GAL.4.19	My children,
GAL.4.20	I would like to be with you right now and change my tone of voice, because I don’t know what to do about you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, you who want to be under the law, don’t you hear the law? 
GAL.4.22	For it is written that Abraham
GAL.4.23	But the one by the slave was born as a result of the flesh, while the one by the free woman was born through promise. 
GAL.4.24	These things are being taken figuratively, for the women represent two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai
GAL.4.25	Now Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem above
GAL.4.27	For it is written,
GAL.4.28	Now you too, brothers and sisters, like Isaac,
GAL.4.29	But just as then the child born as a result of the flesh persecuted the one born as a result of the Spirit,
GAL.4.30	But what does the Scripture say? 
GAL.4.31	Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of a slave but of the free woman.
GAL.5.1	For freedom, Christ set us free. Stand firm
GAL.5.2	Take note! I, Paul, am telling you that if you get yourselves circumcised, Christ will not benefit you at all. 
GAL.5.3	Again I testify to every man who gets himself circumcised that he is obligated to do the entire law. 
GAL.5.4	You who are trying to be justified by the law are alienated from Christ; you have fallen from grace.
GAL.5.5	For we eagerly await
GAL.5.6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision accomplishes anything; what matters is faith
GAL.5.7	You were running well. Who prevented you from being persuaded regarding the truth?
GAL.5.8	This persuasion does not come from the one who calls you.
GAL.5.9	A little leaven
GAL.5.10	I myself am persuaded in the Lord you will not accept any other view. But whoever it is that is confusing you will pay the penalty.
GAL.5.11	Now brothers and sisters, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross
GAL.5.12	I wish those who are disturbing you might also let themselves be mutilated!
GAL.5.13	For you were called
GAL.5.14	For the whole law is fulfilled
GAL.5.15	But if you bite and devour
GAL.5.16	I say then, walk by the Spirit
GAL.5.17	For the flesh desires
GAL.5.18	But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
GAL.5.19	Now the works of the flesh are obvious:
GAL.5.20	idolatry,
GAL.5.21	envy,
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit
GAL.5.23	gentleness,
GAL.5.24	Now those who belong to Christ Jesus
GAL.5.25	If we live
GAL.5.26	Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
GAL.6.1	Brothers and sisters, if someone is overtaken in any wrongdoing, you who are spiritual, restore such a person with a gentle
GAL.6.2	Carry one another’s burdens; in this way you will fulfill the law of Christ.
GAL.6.3	For if anyone considers himself to be something when he is nothing,
GAL.6.4	Let each person examine his own work,
GAL.6.5	For each person will have to carry his own load.
GAL.6.6	Let the one who is taught the word share
GAL.6.7	Don’t be deceived: God is not mocked. For whatever a person sows he will also reap, 
GAL.6.8	because the one who sows to his flesh will reap destruction from the flesh, but the one who sows to the Spirit
GAL.6.9	Let us not get tired
GAL.6.10	Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us work
GAL.6.11	Look at what large letters I use as I write to you in my own handwriting. 
GAL.6.12	Those who want to make a good impression in the flesh
GAL.6.13	For even the circumcised don’t keep
GAL.6.14	But as for me, I will never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. The world has been crucified to me through the cross, and I to the world. 
GAL.6.15	For
GAL.6.16	May peace come to all those who follow this standard, and mercy even to the Israel
GAL.6.17	From now on, let no one cause me trouble, because I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
GAL.6.18	Brothers and sisters, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
EPH.1.1	Paul,
EPH.1.1	To the faithful saints
EPH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.3	Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavens in Christ.
EPH.1.4	For he chose us in him, before the foundation of the world, to be holy and blameless in love before him.
EPH.1.5	He predestined us to be adopted as sons through Jesus Christ for himself, according to the good pleasure of his will, 
EPH.1.6	to the praise of his glorious grace
EPH.1.7	In him we have redemption
EPH.1.8	that he richly poured out on us with all wisdom and understanding.
EPH.1.9	He made known to us the mystery of his will,
EPH.1.10	as a plan for the right time
EPH.1.11	In him we have also received an inheritance,
EPH.1.12	so that we who had already put our hope
EPH.1.13	In him you also were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit
EPH.1.14	The Holy Spirit is the down payment
EPH.1.15	This is why, since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, 
EPH.1.16	I never stop giving thanks for you as I remember you in my prayers. 
EPH.1.17	I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father,
EPH.1.18	I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you may know what is the hope
EPH.1.19	and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power
EPH.1.20	He exercised this power in Christ by raising him from the dead and seating him at his right hand
EPH.1.21	far above every ruler and authority, power and dominion, and every title given,
EPH.1.22	And 
EPH.1.23	which is his body,
EPH.2.1	And you were dead
EPH.2.2	in which you previously lived according to the ways of this world,
EPH.2.3	We too all previously lived among them in our fleshly
EPH.2.4	But God, who is rich in mercy,
EPH.2.5	made us alive
EPH.2.6	He also raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus,
EPH.2.7	so that in the coming ages
EPH.2.8	For you are saved by grace
EPH.2.9	not from works, so that no one can boast. 
EPH.2.10	For we are his workmanship, created
EPH.2.11	So then, remember that at one time you were Gentiles in the flesh — called “the uncircumcised” by those called “the circumcised,”
EPH.2.12	At that time you were without Christ, excluded from the citizenship of Israel, and foreigners to the covenants of promise,
EPH.2.13	But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away have been brought near by the blood
EPH.2.14	For he is our peace, who made both groups one
EPH.2.15	he made of no effect the law consisting of commands and expressed in regulations, so that he might create
EPH.2.16	He did this so that he might reconcile both to God in one body
EPH.2.17	He came and proclaimed the good news
EPH.2.18	For through him we both have access
EPH.2.19	So then you are no longer foreigners and strangers, but fellow citizens with the saints, and members of God’s household, 
EPH.2.20	built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets,
EPH.2.21	In him the whole building, being put together,
EPH.2.22	In him you are also being built together
EPH.3.1	For this reason, I, Paul, the prisoner
EPH.3.2	you have heard, haven’t you, about the administration of God’s grace that he gave to me for you? 
EPH.3.3	The mystery was made known to me by revelation,
EPH.3.4	By reading this you are able to understand my insight into the mystery of Christ.
EPH.3.5	This was not made known to people
EPH.3.6	The Gentiles are coheirs, members of the same body, and partners in the promise
EPH.3.7	I was made a servant of this gospel by the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the working of his power.
EPH.3.8	This grace was given to me — the least of all the saints — to proclaim to the Gentiles the incalculable riches
EPH.3.9	and to shed light for all about the administration of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created
EPH.3.10	This is so that God’s multi-faceted wisdom
EPH.3.11	This is according to his eternal purpose
EPH.3.12	In him we have boldness and confident access
EPH.3.13	So then I ask you not to be discouraged
EPH.3.14	For this reason I kneel
EPH.3.15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named. 
EPH.3.16	I pray that he may grant you, according to the riches
EPH.3.17	and that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith. I pray that you, being rooted and firmly established in love, 
EPH.3.18	may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the length and width, height and depth of God’s love,
EPH.3.19	and to know Christ’s love that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
EPH.3.20	Now to him who is able
EPH.3.21	to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
EPH.4.1	Therefore I, the prisoner in the Lord,
EPH.4.2	with all humility
EPH.4.3	making every effort to keep the unity
EPH.4.4	There is one body and one Spirit
EPH.4.5	one Lord,
EPH.4.6	one God
EPH.4.7	Now grace was given to each one of us
EPH.4.8	For it says:
EPH.4.9	But what does “he ascended” mean except that he
EPH.4.10	The one who descended is also the one who ascended far above all the heavens,
EPH.4.11	And he himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, some pastors and teachers, 
EPH.4.12	equipping the saints for the work of ministry, to build up the body of Christ,
EPH.4.13	until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of God’s Son,
EPH.4.14	Then we will no longer be little children, tossed by the waves and blown around by every wind of teaching,
EPH.4.15	But speaking the truth in love, let us grow in every way into him who is the head
EPH.4.16	From him the whole body, fitted and knit together
EPH.4.17	Therefore, I say this and testify in the Lord: You should no longer live as the Gentiles live, in the futility of their thoughts. 
EPH.4.18	They are darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God, because of the ignorance that is in them and because
EPH.4.19	They became callous and gave themselves over to promiscuity for the practice of every kind of impurity
EPH.4.20	But that is not how you came to know Christ, 
EPH.4.21	assuming you heard about him and were taught by him, as the truth
EPH.4.22	to take off
EPH.4.23	to be renewed
EPH.4.24	and to put on
EPH.4.25	Therefore, putting away
EPH.4.26	 Don’t let the sun go down on your anger, 
EPH.4.27	and don’t give the devil an opportunity. 
EPH.4.28	Let the thief no longer steal. Instead, he is to do honest work with his own hands, so that he has something to share
EPH.4.29	No foul language should come from your mouth, but only what is good for building up someone in need,
EPH.4.30	And don’t grieve God’s Holy Spirit.
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness, anger and wrath, shouting and slander be removed from you, along with all malice. 
EPH.4.32	And be kind
EPH.5.1	Therefore, be imitators of God, as dearly loved children, 
EPH.5.2	and walk in love, as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us,
EPH.5.3	But sexual immorality
EPH.5.4	Obscene and foolish talking or crude joking are not suitable, but rather giving thanks. 
EPH.5.5	For know and recognize this: Every sexually immoral
EPH.5.6	Let no one deceive you with empty arguments, for God’s wrath
EPH.5.7	Therefore, do not become their partners. 
EPH.5.8	For you were once darkness, but now you are light
EPH.5.9	for the fruit of the light
EPH.5.10	testing
EPH.5.11	Don’t participate in the fruitless
EPH.5.12	For it is shameful even to mention what is done by them in secret. 
EPH.5.13	Everything exposed by the light is made visible,
EPH.5.14	for what makes everything visible is light. Therefore it is said:
EPH.5.14	Get up, sleeper,
EPH.5.14	and Christ will shine on you.
EPH.5.15	Pay careful attention, then, to how you live — not as unwise people but as wise —  
EPH.5.16	making the most of the time,
EPH.5.17	So don’t be foolish, but understand
EPH.5.18	And don’t get drunk
EPH.5.19	speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music with your heart to the Lord, 
EPH.5.20	giving thanks always for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
EPH.5.21	submitting to one another in the fear of Christ.
EPH.5.22	Wives,
EPH.5.23	because the husband is the head of the wife
EPH.5.24	Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives are to submit to their husbands in everything. 
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives,
EPH.5.26	to make her holy, cleansing
EPH.5.27	He did this to present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or anything like that, but holy and blameless.
EPH.5.28	In the same way, husbands are to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. 
EPH.5.29	For no one ever hates his own flesh but provides and cares for it, just as Christ does for the church, 
EPH.5.30	since we are members of his body.
EPH.5.32	This mystery
EPH.5.33	To sum up, each one of you is to love his wife as himself, and the wife is to respect her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, obey
EPH.6.2	, which is the first commandment with a promise, 
EPH.6.4	Fathers, don’t stir up anger
EPH.6.5	Slaves, obey your human
EPH.6.6	Don’t work only while being watched, as people-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, do God’s will
EPH.6.7	Serve with a good attitude, as to the Lord and not to people,
EPH.6.8	knowing that whatever good each one does, slave or free, he will receive this back from the Lord. 
EPH.6.9	And masters, treat your slaves the same way, without threatening
EPH.6.10	Finally, be strengthened by the Lord and by his vast strength.
EPH.6.11	Put on
EPH.6.12	For our struggle is not against flesh
EPH.6.13	For this reason take up the full armor
EPH.6.14	Stand,
EPH.6.15	and your feet sandaled with readiness for the gospel of peace. 
EPH.6.16	In every situation take up the shield
EPH.6.17	Take the helmet
EPH.6.18	Pray
EPH.6.19	Pray also for me, that the message may be given to me when I open my mouth to make known with boldness
EPH.6.20	For this I am an ambassador
EPH.6.21	Tychicus,
EPH.6.22	I am sending him to you for this very reason, to let you know how we are and to encourage
EPH.6.23	Peace to the brothers and sisters, and love with faith, from God the Father
EPH.6.24	Grace be with all who have undying love for our Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.1	Paul
PHP.1.1	To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi,
PHP.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.3	I give thanks to my God for every remembrance of you,
PHP.1.4	always praying with joy for all of you in my every prayer, 
PHP.1.5	because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day
PHP.1.6	I am sure of this, that he who started a good work
PHP.1.7	Indeed, it is right
PHP.1.8	For God is my witness,
PHP.1.9	And I pray this: that your love
PHP.1.10	so that you may approve the things that are superior
PHP.1.11	filled with the fruit
PHP.1.12	Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has actually advanced the gospel,
PHP.1.13	so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard, and to everyone else, that my imprisonment is because I am in Christ. 
PHP.1.14	Most of the brothers have gained confidence in the Lord from my imprisonment and dare even more to speak the word
PHP.1.15	To be sure, some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry,
PHP.1.16	These preach out of love,
PHP.1.17	the others proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition,
PHP.1.18	What does it matter? Only that in every way, whether from false motives
PHP.1.19	because I know this will lead to my salvation
PHP.1.20	My eager expectation and hope
PHP.1.21	For me, to live is Christ
PHP.1.22	Now if I live on in the flesh, this means fruitful
PHP.1.23	I am torn between the two. I long to depart and be with Christ
PHP.1.24	but to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake. 
PHP.1.25	Since I am persuaded of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith,
PHP.1.26	so that, because of my coming to you again, your boasting
PHP.1.27	Just one thing: As citizens of heaven, live your life
PHP.1.28	not being frightened in any way by your opponents.
PHP.1.29	For it has been granted to you on Christ’s behalf not only to believe
PHP.1.30	since you are engaged in the same struggle that you saw I had and now hear that I have.
PHP.2.1	If then there is any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love,
PHP.2.2	make my joy complete by thinking the same way,
PHP.2.3	Do nothing out of selfish ambition
PHP.2.4	Everyone should look out not only for his own interests,
PHP.2.5	Adopt the same attitude as that of Christ Jesus,
PHP.2.6	who, existing in the form of God,
PHP.2.6	did not consider equality with God
PHP.2.6	as something to be exploited.
PHP.2.7	Instead he emptied himself
PHP.2.7	by assuming the form of a servant,
PHP.2.7	taking on the likeness of humanity.
PHP.2.7	And when he had come as a man,
PHP.2.8	he humbled himself by becoming obedient
PHP.2.8	to the point of death —
PHP.2.8	even to death on a cross.
PHP.2.9	For this reason God highly exalted him
PHP.2.9	and gave him the name
PHP.2.9	that is above every name,
PHP.2.10	so that at the name of Jesus
PHP.2.10	every knee will bow
PHP.2.10	in heaven
PHP.2.10	and under the earth
PHP.2.11	and every tongue
PHP.2.11	that Jesus Christ is Lord,
PHP.2.11	to the glory
PHP.2.12	Therefore, my dear friends,
PHP.2.13	For it is God who is working in you both to will and to work according to his good purpose. 
PHP.2.14	Do everything without grumbling
PHP.2.15	so that you may be blameless
PHP.2.16	by holding firm to the word
PHP.2.17	But even if I am poured out
PHP.2.18	In the same way you should also be glad and rejoice with me.
PHP.2.19	Now I hope in the Lord Jesus
PHP.2.20	For I have no one else like-minded who will genuinely care about your interests; 
PHP.2.21	all seek their own interests,
PHP.2.22	But you know his proven character, because he has served with me in the gospel ministry like a son with a father. 
PHP.2.23	Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things go with me. 
PHP.2.24	I am confident in the Lord that I myself will also come soon.
PHP.2.25	But I considered it necessary to send you Epaphroditus
PHP.2.26	since he has been longing for all of you and was distressed because you heard that he was sick. 
PHP.2.27	Indeed, he was so sick that he nearly died. However, God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have sorrow upon sorrow. 
PHP.2.28	For this reason, I am very eager to send him so that you may rejoice again when you see him and I may be less anxious. 
PHP.2.29	Therefore, welcome him in the Lord with great joy and hold people like him in honor, 
PHP.2.30	because he came close to death for the work
PHP.3.1	In addition, my brothers and sisters, rejoice
PHP.3.2	Watch out for the dogs, watch out for the evil
PHP.3.3	For we are the circumcision,
PHP.3.4	although I have reasons for confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he has grounds for confidence in the flesh, I have more: 
PHP.3.5	circumcised the eighth day;
PHP.3.6	regarding zeal,
PHP.3.7	But everything that was a gain to me, I have considered to be a loss because of Christ. 
PHP.3.8	More than that, I also consider everything to be a loss in view of the surpassing value
PHP.3.9	and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own from the law,
PHP.3.10	My goal is to know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings,
PHP.3.11	assuming that I will somehow reach the resurrection from among the dead.
PHP.3.12	Not that I have already reached the goal or am already perfect, but I make every effort to take hold
PHP.3.13	Brothers and sisters, I do not
PHP.3.14	I pursue as my goal the prize promised by God’s heavenly
PHP.3.15	Therefore, let all of us who are mature think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will reveal
PHP.3.16	In any case, we should live up to whatever truth we have attained. 
PHP.3.17	Join in imitating me, brothers and sisters, and pay careful attention to those who live according to the example you have in us. 
PHP.3.18	For I have often told you, and now say again with tears, that many live as enemies of the cross
PHP.3.19	Their end is destruction; their god is their stomach; their glory
PHP.3.20	but our citizenship is in heaven, and we eagerly wait for a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ. 
PHP.3.21	He will transform the body of our humble condition into the likeness of his glorious
PHP.4.1	So then, my dearly loved and longed for brothers and sisters, my joy and crown,
PHP.4.2	I urge Euodia and I urge Syntyche to agree in the Lord. 
PHP.4.3	Yes, I also ask you, true partner,
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! 
PHP.4.5	Let your graciousness
PHP.4.6	Don’t worry about anything, but in everything, through prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. 
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God, which surpasses
PHP.4.8	Finally
PHP.4.9	Do what you have learned and received
PHP.4.10	I rejoiced in the Lord greatly because once again
PHP.4.11	I don’t say this out of need, for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I find myself. 
PHP.4.12	I know both how to make do with little, and I know how to make do with a lot.
PHP.4.13	I am able to do all things through him
PHP.4.14	Still, you did well by partnering with me in my hardship.
PHP.4.15	And you Philippians
PHP.4.16	For even in Thessalonica
PHP.4.17	Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the profit
PHP.4.18	But I have received everything in full,
PHP.4.19	And my God
PHP.4.20	Now to our God and Father
PHP.4.21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you greetings. 
PHP.4.22	All the saints send you greetings, especially those who belong to Caesar’s
PHP.4.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
COL.1.1	Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by God’s will,
COL.1.2	To the saints in Christ at Colossae, who are faithful brothers and sisters.
COL.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
COL.1.3	We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, 
COL.1.4	for we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love you have for all the saints 
COL.1.5	because of the hope reserved for you in heaven. You have already heard about this hope in the word of truth,
COL.1.6	that has come to you. It is bearing fruit
COL.1.7	You learned this from Epaphras,
COL.1.8	and he has told us about your love in the Spirit.
COL.1.9	For this reason also, since the day we heard this, we haven’t stopped praying for you. We are asking
COL.1.10	so that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him: bearing fruit in every good work
COL.1.11	being strengthened
COL.1.12	giving thanks to the Father, who has enabled you
COL.1.13	He has rescued
COL.1.14	In him we have redemption,
COL.1.15	He is the image of the invisible God,
COL.1.15	the firstborn over all creation.
COL.1.16	For everything was created by him,
COL.1.16	in heaven and on earth,
COL.1.16	the visible and the invisible,
COL.1.16	whether thrones or dominions
COL.1.16	or rulers or authorities —
COL.1.16	all things have been created through him and for him.
COL.1.17	He is before all things,
COL.1.17	and by him all things
COL.1.18	He is also the head of the body, the church;
COL.1.18	he is the beginning,
COL.1.18	the firstborn from the dead,
COL.1.18	so that he might come to have
COL.1.18	first place in everything.
COL.1.19	For God was pleased to have
COL.1.19	all his fullness
COL.1.20	and through him to reconcile
COL.1.20	everything to himself,
COL.1.20	whether things on earth or things in heaven,
COL.1.20	by making peace
COL.1.20	through his blood,
COL.1.21	Once you were alienated and hostile in your minds expressed in your evil actions. 
COL.1.22	But now he has reconciled you by his physical body through his death,
COL.1.23	if indeed you remain grounded and steadfast in the faith
COL.1.24	Now I rejoice in my sufferings
COL.1.25	I have become its servant, according to God’s commission that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known, 
COL.1.26	the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints. 
COL.1.27	God wanted to make known among the Gentiles the glorious wealth of this mystery, which is Christ
COL.1.28	We proclaim him, warning and teaching everyone with all wisdom, so that we may present everyone mature in Christ. 
COL.1.29	I labor for this, striving
COL.2.1	For I want you to know how greatly I am struggling
COL.2.2	I want their hearts to be encouraged
COL.2.3	In him are hidden all the treasures of wisdom
COL.2.4	I am saying this so that no one will deceive you with arguments that sound reasonable. 
COL.2.5	For I may be absent in body, but I am with you in spirit,
COL.2.6	So then, just as you have received
COL.2.7	being rooted and built up in him
COL.2.8	Be careful that no one takes you captive through philosophy and empty deceit based on human tradition,
COL.2.9	For the entire fullness
COL.2.10	and you have been filled by him, who is the head
COL.2.11	You were also circumcised in him with a circumcision not done with hands, by putting off the body of flesh,
COL.2.12	when you were buried with him
COL.2.13	And when you were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he made you alive with him and forgave us all our trespasses. 
COL.2.14	He erased the certificate of debt, with its obligations, that was against us and opposed to us, and has taken it away by nailing it to the cross.
COL.2.15	He disarmed the rulers and authorities and disgraced them publicly; he triumphed over them in him.
COL.2.16	Therefore, don’t let anyone judge
COL.2.17	These are a shadow
COL.2.18	Let no one condemn
COL.2.19	He doesn’t hold on to the head, from whom the whole body,
COL.2.20	If you died with Christ
COL.2.21	“Don’t handle, don’t taste, don’t touch”? 
COL.2.22	All these regulations refer to what is destined to perish by being used up; they are human commands and doctrines. 
COL.2.23	Although these have a reputation for wisdom
COL.3.1	So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
COL.3.2	Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things.
COL.3.3	For you died,
COL.3.4	When Christ, who is your
COL.3.5	Therefore, put to death what belongs to your earthly nature: sexual immorality, impurity,
COL.3.6	Because of these, God’s wrath
COL.3.7	and you once walked in these things when you were living
COL.3.8	But now, put away
COL.3.9	Do not lie
COL.3.10	and have put on
COL.3.11	In Christ there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all.
COL.3.12	Therefore, as God’s chosen ones, holy and dearly loved,
COL.3.13	bearing with one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a grievance against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you are also to forgive.
COL.3.14	Above all, put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity. 
COL.3.15	And let the peace of Christ, to which you were also called
COL.3.16	Let the word of Christ dwell richly among you, in all wisdom teaching and admonishing one another through psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs,
COL.3.17	And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do everything in the name
COL.3.18	Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
COL.3.19	Husbands,
COL.3.20	Children,
COL.3.21	Fathers,
COL.3.22	Slaves, obey your human
COL.3.23	Whatever you do, do it from the heart, as something done for the Lord and not for people,
COL.3.24	knowing that you will receive the reward of an inheritance from the Lord. You serve the Lord Christ. 
COL.3.25	For the wrongdoer
COL.4.1	Masters,
COL.4.2	Devote yourselves
COL.4.3	At the same time, pray also for us that God may open a door
COL.4.4	so that I may make it known as I should. 
COL.4.5	Act wisely toward outsiders, making the most of the time.
COL.4.6	Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt,
COL.4.7	Tychicus,
COL.4.8	I have sent him to you for this very purpose, so that you may know how we are
COL.4.9	He is coming with Onesimus,
COL.4.10	Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you greetings, as does Mark,
COL.4.11	and so does Jesus who is called Justus. These alone of the circumcised are my coworkers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me. 
COL.4.12	Epaphras,
COL.4.13	For I testify about him that he works hard
COL.4.14	Luke, the dearly loved physician, and Demas
COL.4.15	Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her home.
COL.4.16	After this letter has been read at your gathering, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea. 
COL.4.17	And tell Archippus,
COL.4.18	I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains.
1TH.1.1	Paul, Silvanus,
1TH.1.1	To the church of the Thessalonians
1TH.1.1	Grace to you and peace.
1TH.1.2	We always thank God for all of you, making mention of you constantly in our prayers. 
1TH.1.3	We recall, in the presence of our God and Father,
1TH.1.4	For we know, brothers and sisters loved
1TH.1.5	because our gospel did not come to you in word only, but also in power, in the Holy Spirit,
1TH.1.6	and you yourselves became imitators of us and of the Lord when, in spite of severe persecution, you welcomed the message
1TH.1.7	As a result, you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia
1TH.1.8	For the word of the Lord rang out from you, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place that your faith
1TH.1.9	for they themselves report
1TH.1.10	and to wait
1TH.2.1	For you yourselves know, brothers and sisters, that our visit
1TH.2.2	On the contrary, after we had previously suffered
1TH.2.3	For our exhortation didn’t come from error or impurity
1TH.2.4	Instead, just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted
1TH.2.5	For we never used flattering speech, as you know, or had greedy
1TH.2.6	and we didn’t seek glory
1TH.2.7	Although we could have been a burden as Christ’s apostles,
1TH.2.8	We cared so much for you that we were pleased to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us. 
1TH.2.9	For you remember our labor and hardship, brothers and sisters. Working
1TH.2.10	You are witnesses,
1TH.2.11	As you know, like a father with his own children,
1TH.2.12	we encouraged, comforted, and implored each one of you to live worthy of God,
1TH.2.13	This is why we constantly thank God, because when you received the word of God that you heard from us, you welcomed it not as a human message, but as it truly is,
1TH.2.14	For you, brothers and sisters, became imitators of God’s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea,
1TH.2.15	who killed the Lord Jesus
1TH.2.16	by keeping us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved. As a result, they are constantly filling up their sins to the limit,
1TH.2.17	But as for us, brothers and sisters, after we were forced to leave you
1TH.2.18	So we wanted to come to you — even I, Paul, time and again — but Satan
1TH.2.19	For who is our hope or joy
1TH.2.20	Indeed you are our glory
1TH.3.1	Therefore, when we could no longer stand it, we thought it was better to be left alone in Athens.
1TH.3.2	And we sent Timothy,
1TH.3.3	so that no one will be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are appointed to this. 
1TH.3.4	In fact, when we were with you, we told you in advance that we were going to experience affliction, and as you know, it happened. 
1TH.3.5	For this reason, when I could no longer stand it, I also sent him to find out about your faith, fearing that the tempter had tempted you and that our labor might be for nothing.
1TH.3.6	But now Timothy has come to us
1TH.3.7	Therefore, brothers and sisters, in all our distress and affliction, we were encouraged about you through your faith. 
1TH.3.8	For now we live, if you stand firm
1TH.3.9	How can we thank God for you in return for all the joy
1TH.3.10	as we pray very earnestly night and day to see you face to face
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father
1TH.3.12	And may the Lord cause you to increase and overflow with love
1TH.3.13	May he make your hearts blameless
1TH.4.1	Additionally then, brothers and sisters, we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus, that as you have received instruction from us on how you should live and please God — as you are doing
1TH.4.2	For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
1TH.4.3	For this is God’s will,
1TH.4.4	that each of you knows how to control his own body
1TH.4.5	not with lustful passions,
1TH.4.6	This means one must not transgress against and take advantage
1TH.4.7	For God has not called us to impurity
1TH.4.8	Consequently, anyone who rejects this does not reject man, but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit.
1TH.4.9	About brotherly love: You don’t need me to write you because you yourselves are taught by God
1TH.4.10	In fact, you are doing this toward all the brothers and sisters in the entire region of Macedonia.
1TH.4.11	to seek to lead a quiet life,
1TH.4.12	so that you may behave properly
1TH.4.13	We do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, concerning those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve like the rest, who have no hope.
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose
1TH.4.15	For we say this to you by a word from the Lord:
1TH.4.16	For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a shout,
1TH.4.17	Then
1TH.4.18	Therefore encourage
1TH.5.1	About the times and the seasons:
1TH.5.2	For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord
1TH.5.3	When they say, “Peace and security,” then sudden destruction
1TH.5.4	But you, brothers and sisters, are not in the dark, for this day to surprise you like a thief.
1TH.5.5	For you are all children of light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or the darkness.
1TH.5.6	So then, let us not sleep, like the rest, but let us stay awake and be self-controlled. 
1TH.5.7	For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	But since we belong to the day, let us be self-controlled
1TH.5.9	For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord
1TH.5.10	who died for us,
1TH.5.11	Therefore encourage one another and build each other up as you are already doing.
1TH.5.12	Now we ask you, brothers and sisters, to give recognition
1TH.5.13	and to regard them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace
1TH.5.14	And we exhort you, brothers and sisters:
1TH.5.15	See to it that no one repays evil for evil
1TH.5.16	Rejoice
1TH.5.17	pray constantly, 
1TH.5.18	give thanks in everything; for this is God’s will
1TH.5.19	Don’t stifle the Spirit. 
1TH.5.20	Don’t despise prophecies, 
1TH.5.21	but test all things.
1TH.5.22	Stay away
1TH.5.23	Now may the God of peace
1TH.5.24	He who calls
1TH.5.25	Brothers and sisters, pray for us also. 
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brothers and sisters with a holy kiss. 
1TH.5.27	I charge you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the brothers and sisters.
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
2TH.1.1	Paul, Silvanus,
2TH.1.1	To the church of the Thessalonians
2TH.1.2	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.3	We ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, since your faith is flourishing and the love
2TH.1.4	Therefore, we ourselves boast
2TH.1.5	It is clear evidence of God’s righteous
2TH.1.6	since it is just for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you 
2TH.1.7	and to give relief to you who are afflicted, along with us. This will take place at the revelation of the Lord Jesus from heaven with his powerful angels, 
2TH.1.8	when he takes vengeance with flaming fire
2TH.1.9	They will pay the penalty of eternal destruction
2TH.1.10	on that day when he comes
2TH.1.11	In view of this, we always pray for you that our God will make you worthy of his calling,
2TH.1.12	so that the name
2TH.2.1	Now concerning the coming
2TH.2.2	not to be easily upset or troubled, either by a prophecy
2TH.2.3	Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way. For that day will not come unless the apostasy
2TH.2.4	He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god
2TH.2.5	Don’t you remember that when I was still with you I used to tell you about this? 
2TH.2.6	And you know what currently restrains him, so that he will be revealed in his time.
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of lawlessness
2TH.2.8	and then the lawless one will be revealed. The Lord Jesus will destroy him with the breath of his mouth
2TH.2.9	The coming of the lawless one is based on Satan’s working, with all kinds of false miracles, signs, and wonders,
2TH.2.10	and with every wicked deception among those who are perishing. They perish because they did not accept the love of the truth and so be saved.
2TH.2.11	For this reason God sends them a strong delusion so that they will believe the lie, 
2TH.2.12	so that all will be condemned
2TH.2.13	But we ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because from the beginning
2TH.2.14	He called you to this through our gospel, so that you might obtain the glory
2TH.2.15	So then, brothers and sisters, stand firm
2TH.2.16	May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who has loved
2TH.2.17	encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good work and word.
2TH.3.1	In addition, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly and be honored, just as it was with you,
2TH.3.2	and that we may be delivered
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen and guard you from the evil one.
2TH.3.4	We have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will continue to do what we command. 
2TH.3.5	May the Lord direct your hearts to God’s love and Christ’s endurance.
2TH.3.6	Now we command you, brothers and sisters, in the name
2TH.3.7	For you yourselves know how you should imitate
2TH.3.8	we did not eat
2TH.3.9	It is not that we don’t have the right
2TH.3.10	In fact, when we were with you, this is what we commanded you: “If anyone isn’t willing to work, he should not eat.”
2TH.3.11	For we hear that there are some among you who are idle. They are not busy but busybodies.
2TH.3.12	Now we command and exhort such people by the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and provide for themselves.
2TH.3.13	But as for you, brothers and sisters, do not grow weary
2TH.3.14	If anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter, take note of that person; don’t associate with him, so that he may be ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	Yet don’t consider him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
2TH.3.16	May the Lord of peace
2TH.3.17	I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand,
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
1TI.1.1	Paul,
1TI.1.2	To Timothy,
1TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, and peace from God the
1TI.1.3	As I urged you when I went to Macedonia,
1TI.1.4	or to pay attention to myths
1TI.1.5	Now the goal of our instruction is love
1TI.1.6	Some have departed from these and turned aside to fruitless discussion. 
1TI.1.7	They want to be teachers of the law, although they don’t understand what they are saying or what they are insisting on. 
1TI.1.8	But we know that the law is good,
1TI.1.9	We know that the law is not meant for a righteous person, but for the lawless and rebellious,
1TI.1.10	for the sexually immoral
1TI.1.11	that conforms to the gospel
1TI.1.12	I give thanks to Christ Jesus our Lord who has strengthened
1TI.1.13	even though I was formerly a blasphemer,
1TI.1.14	and the grace of our Lord overflowed, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. 
1TI.1.15	This saying is trustworthy
1TI.1.16	But I received mercy
1TI.1.17	Now to the King
1TI.1.18	Timothy, my son, I am giving you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies
1TI.1.19	having faith
1TI.1.20	Among them are Hymenaeus
1TI.2.1	First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for everyone, 
1TI.2.2	for kings and all those who are in authority,
1TI.2.3	This is good, and it pleases God our Savior,
1TI.2.4	who wants everyone
1TI.2.5	For there is one God
1TI.2.6	who gave himself as a ransom for all,
1TI.2.7	For this I was appointed a herald, an apostle
1TI.2.8	Therefore, I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or argument.
1TI.2.9	Also, the women are to dress themselves in modest clothing,
1TI.2.10	but with good works,
1TI.2.11	A woman is to learn quietly with full submission.
1TI.2.12	I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man; instead, she is to remain quiet. 
1TI.2.13	For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
1TI.2.14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and transgressed.
1TI.2.15	But she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and holiness,
1TI.3.1	This saying is trustworthy:
1TI.3.2	An overseer,
1TI.3.3	not an excessive drinker, not a bully but gentle, not quarrelsome, not greedy.
1TI.3.4	He must manage his own household competently and have his children under control with all dignity. 
1TI.3.5	(If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he take care of God’s church?) 
1TI.3.6	He must not be a new convert, or he might become conceited and incur the same condemnation as the devil.
1TI.3.7	Furthermore, he must have a good reputation among outsiders, so that he does not fall into disgrace and the devil’s
1TI.3.8	Deacons,
1TI.3.9	holding the mystery of the faith
1TI.3.10	They must also be tested first; if they prove blameless, then they can serve as deacons. 
1TI.3.11	Wives,
1TI.3.12	Deacons are to be husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households competently. 
1TI.3.13	For those who have served well as deacons acquire a good standing for themselves and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	I write these things to you, hoping to come
1TI.3.15	But if I should be delayed, I have written so that you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household,
1TI.3.16	And most certainly, the mystery of godliness
1TI.3.16	He
1TI.3.16	vindicated in the Spirit,
1TI.3.16	seen by angels,
1TI.3.16	preached among the nations,
1TI.3.16	believed
1TI.3.16	taken up in glory.
1TI.4.1	Now the Spirit
1TI.4.2	through the hypocrisy
1TI.4.3	They forbid marriage
1TI.4.4	For everything created by God is good,
1TI.4.5	since it is sanctified by the word of God
1TI.4.6	If you point these things out to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith
1TI.4.7	But have nothing to do with pointless and silly myths.
1TI.4.8	For the training of the body has limited benefit,
1TI.4.9	This saying is trustworthy and deserves full acceptance.
1TI.4.10	For this reason we labor and strive,
1TI.4.11	Command and teach these things. 
1TI.4.12	Don’t let anyone despise your youth, but set an example for the believers in speech,
1TI.4.13	Until I come,
1TI.4.14	Don’t neglect the gift that is in you; it was given to you through prophecy,
1TI.4.15	Practice these things; be committed to them, so that your progress may be evident to all. 
1TI.4.16	Pay close attention to your life and your teaching; persevere in these things, for in doing this you will save
1TI.5.1	Don’t rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers, 
1TI.5.2	older women as mothers, and the younger women as sisters with all purity.
1TI.5.3	Support
1TI.5.4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn to practice godliness toward their own family first and to repay their parents, for this pleases God. 
1TI.5.5	The widow who is truly in need and left all alone has put her hope in God
1TI.5.6	however, she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives.
1TI.5.7	Command this also, so that they will be above reproach. 
1TI.5.8	But if anyone does not provide
1TI.5.9	No widow is to be enrolled on the list for support unless she is at least sixty years old, has been the wife of one husband, 
1TI.5.10	and is well known for good works
1TI.5.11	But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when they are drawn away from Christ by desire, they want to marry
1TI.5.12	and will therefore receive condemnation
1TI.5.13	At the same time, they also learn to be idle, going from house to house; they are not only idle, but are also gossips
1TI.5.14	Therefore, I want younger women to marry,
1TI.5.15	For some have already turned away
1TI.5.16	If any
1TI.5.17	The elders who are good leaders are to be considered worthy of double honor,
1TI.5.18	For the Scripture says: 
1TI.5.19	Don’t accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported by two or three witnesses.
1TI.5.20	Publicly rebuke those who sin, so that the rest will be afraid. 
1TI.5.21	I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels to observe
1TI.5.22	Don’t be too quick to appoint
1TI.5.23	Don’t continue drinking only water, but use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses. 
1TI.5.24	Some people’s sins are obvious, preceding them to judgment,
1TI.5.25	Likewise, good works are obvious, and those that are not obvious cannot remain hidden.
1TI.6.1	All who are under the yoke as slaves should regard their own masters
1TI.6.2	Let those who have believing masters not be disrespectful to them because they are brothers, but serve them even better, since those who benefit from their service are believers and dearly loved.
1TI.6.2	Teach and encourage these things. 
1TI.6.3	If anyone teaches false doctrine and does not agree with the sound teaching of our Lord
1TI.6.4	he is conceited and understands nothing, but has an unhealthy interest in disputes and arguments over words.
1TI.6.5	and constant disagreement among people whose minds are depraved and deprived of the truth, who imagine that godliness is a way to material gain.
1TI.6.6	But godliness with contentment is great gain.
1TI.6.7	For we brought nothing into the world, and
1TI.6.8	If we have food and clothing,
1TI.6.9	But those who want to be rich fall into temptation, a trap, and many foolish and harmful desires, which plunge people into ruin and destruction. 
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is a root
1TI.6.11	But you, man of God, flee from these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love,
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight
1TI.6.13	In the presence of God, who gives life to all,
1TI.6.14	to keep this command without fault or failure until the appearing
1TI.6.15	God will bring this about in his own time.
1TI.6.16	who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light,
1TI.6.17	Instruct those who are rich in the present age not to be arrogant
1TI.6.18	Instruct them to do what is good, to be rich in good works,
1TI.6.19	storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the coming age,
1TI.6.20	Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you,
1TI.6.21	By professing it, some
1TI.6.21	Grace be with you all.
2TI.1.1	Paul,
2TI.1.2	To Timothy, my dearly loved son.
2TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, and peace
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I serve with a clear conscience
2TI.1.4	Remembering your tears, I long to see you so that I may be filled with joy. 
2TI.1.5	I recall your sincere faith
2TI.1.6	Therefore, I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands.
2TI.1.7	For God has not given us a spirit of fear,
2TI.1.8	So don’t be ashamed
2TI.1.9	He has saved us and called us with a holy calling,
2TI.1.10	This has now been made evident through the appearing
2TI.1.11	For this gospel I was appointed
2TI.1.12	and that is why I suffer
2TI.1.13	Hold on to the pattern of sound teaching
2TI.1.14	Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who lives in us. 
2TI.1.15	You know that all those in the province of Asia
2TI.1.16	May the Lord grant mercy
2TI.1.17	On the contrary, when he was in Rome,
2TI.1.18	May the Lord grant that he obtain mercy
2TI.2.1	You, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace
2TI.2.2	What you have heard from me
2TI.2.3	Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
2TI.2.4	No one serving as a soldier gets entangled in the concerns of civilian life; he seeks to please the commanding officer. 
2TI.2.5	Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. 
2TI.2.6	The hardworking farmer ought to be the first to get a share of the crops.
2TI.2.7	Consider what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
2TI.2.8	Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead
2TI.2.9	for which I suffer to the point of being bound like a criminal. But the word of God is not bound. 
2TI.2.10	This is why I endure
2TI.2.11	This saying is trustworthy:
2TI.2.11	For if we died with him,
2TI.2.11	we will also live with him;
2TI.2.12	if we endure, we will also reign
2TI.2.12	if we deny him, he will also deny us;
2TI.2.13	if we are faithless, he remains faithful,
2TI.2.13	for he cannot deny himself.
2TI.2.14	Remind them of these things, and charge them before God
2TI.2.15	Be diligent to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who doesn’t need to be ashamed, correctly teaching the word of truth.
2TI.2.16	Avoid irreverent and empty speech, since those who engage in it will produce even more godlessness,
2TI.2.17	and their teaching will spread like gangrene. Hymenaeus
2TI.2.18	They have departed from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already taken place,
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless, God’s solid foundation stands firm, bearing this inscription:
2TI.2.20	Now in a large house there are not only gold and silver vessels,
2TI.2.21	So if anyone purifies himself from anything dishonorable,
2TI.2.22	Flee
2TI.2.23	But reject foolish and ignorant disputes, because you know that they breed quarrels. 
2TI.2.24	The Lord’s
2TI.2.25	instructing his opponents with gentleness.
2TI.2.26	Then they may come to their senses and escape the trap of the devil,
2TI.3.1	But know this: Hard times will come in the last days.
2TI.3.2	For people will be lovers of self,
2TI.3.3	unloving, irreconcilable, slanderers,
2TI.3.4	traitors,
2TI.3.5	holding to the form of godliness but denying its power.
2TI.3.6	For among them are those who worm their way into households and deceive gullible women overwhelmed by sins and led astray by a variety of passions,
2TI.3.7	always learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth.
2TI.3.8	Just as Jannes and Jambres
2TI.3.9	But they will not make further progress, for their foolishness will be clear to all, as was the foolishness of Jannes and Jambres.
2TI.3.10	But you have followed my teaching, conduct, purpose,
2TI.3.11	along with the persecutions and sufferings
2TI.3.12	In fact, all who want to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
2TI.3.13	Evil people and impostors will become worse, deceiving
2TI.3.14	But as for you, continue in what you have learned and firmly believed. You know those who taught you,
2TI.3.15	and you know that from infancy you have known the sacred Scriptures,
2TI.3.16	All Scripture is inspired by God
2TI.3.17	so that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.
2TI.4.1	I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is going to judge
2TI.4.2	Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; rebuke, correct, and encourage with great patience and teaching. 
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when people will not tolerate sound doctrine,
2TI.4.4	They will turn away from hearing the truth and will turn aside to myths.
2TI.4.5	But as for you, exercise self-control in everything, endure hardship, do the work of an evangelist,
2TI.4.6	For I am already being poured out as a drink offering,
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 
2TI.4.8	There is reserved for me the crown
2TI.4.9	Make every effort to come to me soon,
2TI.4.10	because Demas
2TI.4.11	Only Luke
2TI.4.12	I have sent Tychicus
2TI.4.13	When you come, bring the cloak I left in Troas
2TI.4.14	Alexander
2TI.4.15	Watch out
2TI.4.16	At my first defense, no one stood by me, but everyone deserted me.
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, so that I might fully preach the word and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion’s mouth. 
2TI.4.18	The Lord will rescue me from every evil work and will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom.
2TI.4.19	Greet Prisca and Aquila,
2TI.4.20	Erastus
2TI.4.21	Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus greets you, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters.
2TI.4.22	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you all.
TIT.1.1	Paul,
TIT.1.2	in the hope of eternal life
TIT.1.3	In his own time he has revealed
TIT.1.4	To Titus,
TIT.1.4	Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
TIT.1.5	The reason I left you in Crete
TIT.1.6	An elder
TIT.1.7	As an overseer
TIT.1.8	but hospitable, loving what is good, sensible, righteous, holy, self-controlled, 
TIT.1.9	holding to the faithful message as taught,
TIT.1.10	For there are many rebellious people, full of empty talk and deception, especially those from the circumcision party. 
TIT.1.11	It is necessary to silence them; they are ruining entire households by teaching what they shouldn’t in order to get money dishonestly. 
TIT.1.12	One of their very own prophets said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” 
TIT.1.13	This testimony is true.
TIT.1.14	and may not pay attention to Jewish myths
TIT.1.15	To the pure, everything is pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; in fact, both their mind and conscience
TIT.1.16	They claim to know God,
TIT.2.1	But you are to proclaim things consistent with sound teaching.
TIT.2.2	Older men
TIT.2.3	In the same way, older women
TIT.2.4	so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands and to love their children, 
TIT.2.5	to be self-controlled, pure, workers at home, kind, and in submission
TIT.2.6	In the same way, encourage the young men
TIT.2.7	in everything. Make yourself an example of good works with integrity and dignity
TIT.2.8	Your message is to be sound beyond reproach,
TIT.2.9	Slaves are to submit to their masters
TIT.2.10	or stealing, but demonstrating utter faithfulness, so that they may adorn the teaching of God our Savior
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation
TIT.2.12	instructing us to deny godlessness
TIT.2.13	while we wait for the blessed hope,
TIT.2.14	He gave himself for us
TIT.2.15	Proclaim these things; encourage and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard
TIT.3.1	Remind them to submit
TIT.3.2	to slander no one, to avoid fighting, and to be kind, always showing gentleness
TIT.3.3	For we too were once foolish, disobedient, deceived, enslaved by various passions
TIT.3.4	But when the kindness of God our Savior and his love for mankind appeared,
TIT.3.5	he saved us
TIT.3.6	He poured out his Spirit on us abundantly
TIT.3.7	so that, having been justified by his grace,
TIT.3.8	This saying is trustworthy.
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish debates,
TIT.3.10	Reject a divisive
TIT.3.11	For you know that such a person has gone astray and is sinning; he is self-condemned.
TIT.3.12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you,
TIT.3.13	Diligently help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos
TIT.3.14	Let our people learn to devote themselves to good works for pressing needs, so that they will not be unfruitful.
TIT.3.15	All those who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with all of you.
PHM.1.1	Paul,
PHM.1.1	To Philemon our dear friend and coworker, 
PHM.1.2	to Apphia our sister,
PHM.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.4	I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	because I hear of your love
PHM.1.6	I pray that your participation in the faith may become effective
PHM.1.7	For I have great joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed
PHM.1.8	For this reason, although I have great boldness in Christ to command you to do what is right, 
PHM.1.9	I appeal to you, instead, on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an elderly man
PHM.1.10	appeal to you for my son,
PHM.1.11	Once he was useless to you, but now he is useful both to you and to me. 
PHM.1.12	I am sending him back to you — I am sending my very own heart.
PHM.1.13	I wanted to keep him with me, so that in my imprisonment for the gospel he might serve me in your place. 
PHM.1.14	But I didn’t want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be out of obligation, but of your own free will. 
PHM.1.15	For perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a brief time, so that you might get him back permanently, 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a slave, but more than a slave — as a dearly loved brother. He is especially so to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh
PHM.1.17	So if you consider me a partner, welcome
PHM.1.18	And if he has wronged you in any way, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, write this with my own hand:
PHM.1.20	Yes, brother, may I benefit from you in the Lord; refresh my heart in Christ. 
PHM.1.21	Since I am confident of your obedience, I am writing to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. 
PHM.1.22	Meanwhile, also prepare a guest room for me, since I hope that through your prayers I will be restored to you.
PHM.1.23	Epaphras,
PHM.1.24	Mark,
PHM.1.25	The grace of the Lord
HEB.1.1	Long ago God spoke
HEB.1.2	In these last days,
HEB.1.3	The Son is the radiance
HEB.1.4	So he became superior to the angels, just as the name he inherited is more excellent than theirs.
HEB.1.5	For to which of the angels did he ever say,
HEB.1.5	or again,
HEB.1.6	Again, when he
HEB.1.7	And about the angels he says:
HEB.1.8	but to
HEB.1.10	And:
HEB.1.13	Now to which of the angels has he ever said:
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve those who are going to inherit salvation?
HEB.2.1	For this reason, we must pay attention all the more to what we have heard, so that we will not drift away.
HEB.2.2	For if the message spoken through angels was legally binding
HEB.2.3	how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?
HEB.2.4	At the same time, God also testified by signs and wonders, various miracles, and distributions of gifts from the Holy Spirit according to his will.
HEB.2.5	For he has not subjected to angels the world to come that we are talking about. 
HEB.2.6	But someone somewhere has testified:
HEB.2.8	For in 
HEB.2.9	But we do see Jesus —  
HEB.2.10	For in bringing many sons and daughters to glory, it was entirely appropriate that God — for whom and through whom all things exist — should make the source
HEB.2.11	For the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one Father.
HEB.2.12	saying:
HEB.2.13	Again, 
HEB.2.14	Now since the children have flesh and blood in common, Jesus also shared in these, so that through his death he might destroy the one holding the power of death — that is, the devil
HEB.2.15	and free those who were held in slavery all their lives by the fear of death.
HEB.2.16	For it is clear that he does not reach out to help angels, but to help Abraham’s offspring.
HEB.2.17	Therefore, he had to be like his brothers and sisters in every way, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in matters
HEB.2.18	For since he himself has suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.
HEB.3.1	Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.
HEB.3.2	He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was in all God’s household. 
HEB.3.3	For Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder has more honor than the house. 
HEB.3.4	Now every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God.
HEB.3.5	Moses was faithful as a servant
HEB.3.6	But Christ was faithful as a Son over his household. And we are that household if we hold on to our confidence and the hope in which we boast.
HEB.3.7	Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says:
HEB.3.12	Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won’t be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away
HEB.3.13	But encourage each other daily,
HEB.3.14	For we have become participants in Christ if we hold firmly until the end the reality
HEB.3.15	As it is said:
HEB.3.16	For who heard and rebelled? Wasn’t it all who came out of Egypt under Moses?
HEB.3.17	With whom was God angry for forty years? Wasn’t it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
HEB.3.18	And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who disobeyed? 
HEB.3.19	So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
HEB.4.1	Therefore, since the promise to enter his rest remains, let us beware
HEB.4.2	For we also have received the good news just as they did. But the message they heard did not benefit them, since they were not united with those who heard it in faith.
HEB.4.3	For we who have believed enter the rest, in keeping with what
HEB.4.3	even though his works have been finished since the foundation of the world. 
HEB.4.4	For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in this way: 
HEB.4.5	Again, in that passage he says, 
HEB.4.6	Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news did not enter because of disobedience,
HEB.4.7	he again specifies a certain day —  
HEB.4.8	For if Joshua
HEB.4.9	Therefore, a Sabbath rest remains for God’s people. 
HEB.4.10	For the person who has entered his rest has rested from his own works, just as God did from his.
HEB.4.11	Let us then make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one will fall into the same pattern of disobedience.
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is living and effective
HEB.4.13	No creature is hidden from him, but all things are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom
HEB.4.14	Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens — Jesus the Son of God — let us hold fast to our confession.
HEB.4.15	For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way as we are,
HEB.4.16	Therefore, let us approach the throne of grace with boldness, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in time of need.
HEB.5.1	For every high priest taken from among men is appointed in matters pertaining to God for the people, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
HEB.5.2	He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray, since he is also clothed with weakness.
HEB.5.3	Because of this, he must make an offering for his own sins as well as for the people.
HEB.5.4	No one takes this honor on himself; instead, a person is called by God, just as Aaron was.
HEB.5.5	In the same way, Christ did not exalt himself to become a high priest, but God who said to him,
HEB.5.6	also says in another place,
HEB.5.7	During his earthly life,
HEB.5.8	Although he was the Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered.
HEB.5.9	After he was perfected, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him, 
HEB.5.10	and he was declared by God a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.
HEB.5.11	We have a great deal to say about this, and it is difficult to explain, since you have become too lazy to understand. 
HEB.5.12	Although by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the basic principles of God’s revelation again. You need milk, not solid food.
HEB.5.13	Now everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced with the message about righteousness, because he is an infant. 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for the mature — for those whose senses have been trained to distinguish between good and evil.
HEB.6.1	Therefore, let us leave the elementary teaching about Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, faith in God,
HEB.6.2	teaching about ritual washings,
HEB.6.3	And we will do this if God permits.
HEB.6.4	For it is impossible to renew to repentance those who were once enlightened, who tasted the heavenly gift, who shared in the Holy Spirit,
HEB.6.5	who tasted God’s good word and the powers of the coming age, 
HEB.6.6	and who have fallen away. This is because,
HEB.6.7	For the ground that drinks the rain that often falls on it and that produces vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated receives a blessing from God. 
HEB.6.8	But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is worthless and about to be cursed, and at the end will be burned.
HEB.6.9	Even though we are speaking this way, dearly loved friends, in your case we are confident of things that are better and that pertain to salvation. 
HEB.6.10	For God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love
HEB.6.11	Now we desire each of you to demonstrate the same diligence for the full assurance of your hope until the end, 
HEB.6.12	so that you won’t become lazy but will be imitators of those who inherit the promises through faith and perseverance.
HEB.6.13	For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater to swear by, he swore by himself: 
HEB.6.15	And so, after waiting patiently, Abraham obtained the promise. 
HEB.6.16	For people swear by something greater than themselves, and for them a confirming oath ends every dispute. 
HEB.6.17	Because God wanted to show his unchangeable purpose even more clearly to the heirs of the promise, he guaranteed it with an oath,
HEB.6.18	so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us.
HEB.6.19	We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain.
HEB.6.20	Jesus has entered there on our behalf as a forerunner,
HEB.7.1	For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, met Abraham and blessed him as he returned from defeating the kings, 
HEB.7.2	and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything. First, his name means king of righteousness, then also, king of Salem, meaning king of peace. 
HEB.7.3	Without father, mother, or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God,
HEB.7.4	Now consider how great this man was: even Abraham the patriarch
HEB.7.5	The sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have a command according to the law to collect a tenth from the people
HEB.7.6	But one without this
HEB.7.7	Without a doubt, the inferior is blessed by the superior. 
HEB.7.8	In the one case, men who will die receive a tenth, but in the other case, Scripture testifies that he lives.
HEB.7.9	And in a sense Levi himself, who receives a tenth, has paid a tenth through Abraham, 
HEB.7.10	for he was still within his ancestor
HEB.7.11	Now if perfection came through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the law
HEB.7.12	For when there is a change of the priesthood, there must be a change of law as well. 
HEB.7.13	For the one these things are spoken about belonged to a different tribe. No one from it has served at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	Now it is evident that our Lord came from Judah,
HEB.7.15	And this becomes clearer if another priest like Melchizedek appears, 
HEB.7.16	who did not become a priest based on a legal regulation about physical
HEB.7.17	For it has been testified:
HEB.7.18	So the previous command is annulled because it was weak and unprofitable
HEB.7.19	(for the law perfected
HEB.7.20	None of this happened without an oath. For others became priests without an oath, 
HEB.7.21	but he became a priest with an oath made by the one who said to him:
HEB.7.22	Because of this oath, Jesus has also become the guarantee of a better covenant.
HEB.7.23	Now many have become Levitical priests, since they are prevented by death from remaining in office. 
HEB.7.24	But because he remains forever, he holds his priesthood permanently. 
HEB.7.25	Therefore, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, since he always lives to intercede
HEB.7.26	For this is the kind of high priest we need: holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.
HEB.7.27	He doesn’t need to offer sacrifices every day, as high priests do — first for their own sins, then for those of the people. He did this once for all time when he offered himself.
HEB.7.28	For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the promise of the oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son,
HEB.8.1	Now the main point of what is being said is this: We have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
HEB.8.2	a minister of the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not man.
HEB.8.3	For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts
HEB.8.4	Now if he were on earth, he wouldn’t be a priest, since there are those
HEB.8.5	These serve as a copy and shadow
HEB.8.6	But Jesus has now obtained a superior ministry, and to that degree he is the mediator
HEB.8.7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second one. 
HEB.8.8	But finding fault with his people,
HEB.8.13	By saying 
HEB.9.1	Now the first covenant also had regulations for ministry and an earthly sanctuary. 
HEB.9.2	For a tabernacle was set up, and in the first room, which is called the holy place, were the lampstand, the table, and the presentation loaves.
HEB.9.3	Behind the second curtain was a tent called the most holy place.
HEB.9.4	It had the gold altar of incense and the ark of the covenant, covered with gold on all sides, in which was a gold jar containing the manna, Aaron’s staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.
HEB.9.5	The cherubim of glory were above the ark overshadowing the mercy seat. It is not possible to speak about these things in detail right now.
HEB.9.6	With these things prepared like this, the priests enter the first room repeatedly, performing their ministry.
HEB.9.7	But the high priest alone enters the second room, and he does that only once a year, and never without blood, which he offers for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
HEB.9.8	The Holy Spirit was making it clear that the way into the most holy place had not yet been disclosed while the first tabernacle was still standing.
HEB.9.9	This is a symbol for the present time, during which gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the worshiper’s conscience.
HEB.9.10	They are physical regulations and only deal with food, drink, and various washings imposed until the time of the new order.
HEB.9.11	But Christ has appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come.
HEB.9.12	he entered the most holy place once for all time, not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption.
HEB.9.13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow, sprinkling those who are defiled, sanctify for the purification of the flesh,
HEB.9.14	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
HEB.9.15	Therefore, he is the mediator
HEB.9.16	Where a will exists, the death of the one who made it must be established. 
HEB.9.17	For a will is valid only when people die, since it is never in effect while the one who made it is living. 
HEB.9.18	That is why even the first covenant was inaugurated with blood. 
HEB.9.19	For when every command had been proclaimed by Moses to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats,
HEB.9.20	saying, 
HEB.9.21	In the same way, he sprinkled the tabernacle and all the articles of worship with blood.
HEB.9.22	According to the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness.
HEB.9.23	Therefore, it was necessary for the copies of the things in the heavens to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves to be purified with better sacrifices than these.
HEB.9.24	For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands (only a model
HEB.9.25	He did not do this to offer himself many times, as the high priest enters the sanctuary yearly with the blood of another.
HEB.9.26	Otherwise, he would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared one time, at the end of the ages,
HEB.9.27	And just as it is appointed for people to die once — and after this, judgment
HEB.9.28	so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many,
HEB.10.1	Since the law has only a shadow of the good things
HEB.10.2	Otherwise, wouldn’t they have stopped being offered, since the worshipers, purified once and for all, would no longer have any consciousness of sins? 
HEB.10.3	But in the sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year. 
HEB.10.4	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
HEB.10.5	Therefore, as he was coming into the world, he said:
HEB.10.8	After he says above, 
HEB.10.9	he then says, 
HEB.10.10	By this will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all time.
HEB.10.11	Every priest stands day after day ministering and offering the same sacrifices time after time, which can never take away sins.
HEB.10.12	But this man, after offering one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God.
HEB.10.13	He is now waiting until his enemies are made his footstool.
HEB.10.14	For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are sanctified. 
HEB.10.15	The Holy Spirit also testifies to us about this. For after he says:
HEB.10.17	and
HEB.10.18	Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.
HEB.10.19	Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have boldness to enter the sanctuary through the blood of Jesus
HEB.10.20	he has inaugurated
HEB.10.21	and since we have a great high priest over the house of God,
HEB.10.22	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water.
HEB.10.23	Let us hold on to the confession of our hope without wavering, since he who promised is faithful.
HEB.10.24	And let us watch out for one another to provoke love and good works, 
HEB.10.25	not neglecting to gather together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other,
HEB.10.26	For if we deliberately go on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
HEB.10.27	but a terrifying expectation of judgment and the fury of a fire about to consume the adversaries.
HEB.10.28	Anyone who disregarded the law of Moses died without mercy, based on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
HEB.10.29	How much worse punishment do you think one will deserve who has trampled on the Son of God, who has regarded as profane
HEB.10.30	For we know the one who has said,
HEB.10.30	and again,
HEB.10.31	It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	Remember the earlier days when, after you had been enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings.
HEB.10.33	Sometimes you were publicly exposed to taunts and afflictions, and at other times you were companions of those who were treated that way.
HEB.10.34	For you sympathized with the prisoners
HEB.10.35	So don’t throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
HEB.10.36	For you need endurance, so that after you have done God’s will, you may receive what was promised.
HEB.10.37	For yet in 
HEB.10.39	But we are not those who draw back and are destroyed, but those who have faith and are saved.
HEB.11.1	Now faith is the reality
HEB.11.2	For by it our ancestors won God’s approval.
HEB.11.3	By faith we understand that the universe was
HEB.11.4	By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain did. By faith he was approved as a righteous man, because God approved his gifts, and even though he is dead, he still speaks through his faith.
HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was taken away, and so he did not experience death. 
HEB.11.6	Now without faith it is impossible to please God, since the one who draws near to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
HEB.11.7	By faith Noah, after he was warned about what was not yet seen and motivated by godly fear, built an ark to deliver his family. By faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed and set out for a place that he was going to receive as an inheritance. He went out, even though he did not know where he was going.
HEB.11.9	By faith he stayed as a foreigner in the land of promise, living in tents as did Isaac and Jacob, coheirs of the same promise.
HEB.11.10	For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God.
HEB.11.11	By faith even Sarah herself, when she was unable to have children, received power to conceive offspring, even though she was past the age, since she
HEB.11.12	Therefore, from one man — in fact, from one as good as dead — came offspring as numerous as the stars of the sky and as innumerable as the grains of sand along the seashore.
HEB.11.13	These all died in faith, although they had not received the things that were promised. But they saw them from a distance,
HEB.11.14	Now those who say such things make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. 
HEB.11.15	If they were thinking about where they came from, they would have had an opportunity to return. 
HEB.11.16	But they now desire a better place — a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac.
HEB.11.18	the one to whom it had been said, 
HEB.11.19	He considered God to be able even to raise someone from the dead;
HEB.11.20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, and 
HEB.11.22	By faith Joseph, as he was nearing the end of his life, mentioned
HEB.11.23	By faith Moses, after he was born, was hidden by his parents for three months, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they didn’t fear the king’s edict.
HEB.11.24	By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter 
HEB.11.25	and chose to suffer with the people of God rather than to enjoy the fleeting pleasure of sin.
HEB.11.26	For he considered reproach for the sake of Christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, since he was looking ahead to the reward.
HEB.11.27	By faith he left Egypt behind, not being afraid of the king’s anger, for Moses persevered as one who sees him who is invisible.
HEB.11.28	By faith he instituted the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch the Israelites. 
HEB.11.29	By faith they crossed the Red Sea as though they were on dry land. When the Egyptians attempted to do this, they were drowned.
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after being marched around by the Israelites for seven days. 
HEB.11.31	By faith Rahab the prostitute welcomed the spies in peace and didn’t perish with those who disobeyed.
HEB.11.32	And what more can I say? Time is too short for me to tell about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah,
HEB.11.33	who by faith conquered kingdoms,
HEB.11.34	quenched the raging of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, gained strength in weakness, became mighty in battle, and put foreign armies to flight.
HEB.11.35	Women received their dead, raised to life again. Other people were tortured, not accepting release, so that they might gain a better resurrection. 
HEB.11.36	Others experienced mockings and scourgings, as well as bonds and imprisonment.
HEB.11.37	They were stoned,
HEB.11.38	The world was not worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and on mountains, hiding in caves and holes in the ground.
HEB.11.39	All these were approved through their faith, but they did not receive what was promised, 
HEB.11.40	since God had provided something better for us, so that they would not be made perfect without us.
HEB.12.1	Therefore, since we also have such a large cloud of witnesses
HEB.12.2	keeping our eyes on Jesus,
HEB.12.3	For consider him who endured such hostility from sinners against himself, so that you won’t grow weary and give up.
HEB.12.4	In struggling against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood. 
HEB.12.5	And you have forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons:
HEB.12.7	Endure suffering as discipline: God is dealing with you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? 
HEB.12.8	But if you are without discipline — which all receive
HEB.12.9	Furthermore, we had human fathers discipline us, and we respected them. Shouldn’t we submit even more to the Father of spirits and live?
HEB.12.10	For they disciplined us for a short time based on what seemed good to them, but he does it for our benefit, so that we can share his holiness.
HEB.12.11	No discipline seems enjoyable at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it yields the peaceful fruit
HEB.12.12	Therefore, strengthen your tired hands and weakened knees,
HEB.12.13	and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be dislocated
HEB.12.14	Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness
HEB.12.15	Make sure that no one falls short of the grace of God and that no root of bitterness springs up, causing trouble and defiling many.
HEB.12.16	And make sure that there isn’t any immoral
HEB.12.17	For you know that later, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, even though he sought it with tears, because he didn’t find any opportunity for repentance.
HEB.12.18	For you have not come to what could be touched, to a blazing fire, to darkness, gloom, and storm, 
HEB.12.19	to the blast of a trumpet, and the sound of words. Those who heard it begged that not another word be spoken to them, 
HEB.12.20	for they could not bear what was commanded: 
HEB.12.21	The appearance was so terrifying that Moses said, 
HEB.12.22	Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God (the heavenly Jerusalem), to myriads of angels, a festive gathering,
HEB.12.23	to the assembly of the firstborn whose names have been written
HEB.12.24	and to Jesus, the mediator
HEB.12.25	See to it that you do not reject the one who speaks. For if they did not escape when they rejected him who warned them on earth, even less will we if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven.
HEB.12.26	His voice shook the earth at that time, but now he has promised, 
HEB.12.27	This expression, “Yet once more,” indicates the removal of what can be shaken
HEB.12.28	Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful. By it, we may serve God acceptably, with reverence and awe,
HEB.12.29	for our God is a consuming fire.
HEB.13.1	Let brotherly love
HEB.13.2	Don’t neglect to show hospitality, for by doing this some have welcomed angels as guests without knowing it.
HEB.13.3	Remember those in prison, as though you were in prison with them, and the mistreated,
HEB.13.4	Marriage is to be honored by all and the marriage bed kept undefiled, because God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterers.
HEB.13.5	Keep your life free from the love of money. Be satisfied with what you have, for he himself has said, 
HEB.13.6	Therefore, we may boldly say,
HEB.13.7	Remember your leaders who have spoken God’s word to you. As you carefully observe the outcome of their lives, imitate their faith.
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
HEB.13.9	Don’t be led astray by various kinds of strange teachings; for it is good for the heart to be established by grace and not by food regulations, since those who observe them have not benefited.
HEB.13.10	We have an altar from which those who worship at the tabernacle do not have a right to eat.
HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the most holy place by the high priest
HEB.13.12	Therefore, Jesus also suffered outside the gate,
HEB.13.13	Let us then go to him outside the camp, bearing his disgrace.
HEB.13.14	For we do not have an enduring city here; instead, we seek the one to come.
HEB.13.15	Therefore, through him let us continually offer up to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips that confess his name.
HEB.13.16	Don’t neglect to do what is good and to share, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.
HEB.13.17	Obey your leaders
HEB.13.18	Pray for us, for we are convinced that we have a clear conscience, wanting to conduct ourselves honorably in everything.
HEB.13.19	And I urge you all the more to pray
HEB.13.20	Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus — the great Shepherd of the sheep
HEB.13.21	equip
HEB.13.22	Brothers and sisters, I urge you to receive this message of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly. 
HEB.13.23	Be aware that our brother Timothy has been released. If he comes soon enough, he will be with me when I see you. 
HEB.13.24	Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who are from Italy send you greetings. 
HEB.13.25	Grace be with you all.
JAS.1.1	James,
JAS.1.1	To the twelve tribes
JAS.1.1	Greetings.
JAS.1.2	Consider it a great joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you experience various trials,
JAS.1.3	because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. 
JAS.1.4	And let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.
JAS.1.5	Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God — who gives to all generously and ungrudgingly — and it will be given to him.
JAS.1.6	But let him ask in faith without doubting.
JAS.1.7	That person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord, 
JAS.1.8	being double-minded and unstable in all his ways.
JAS.1.9	Let the brother of humble circumstances boast in his exaltation, 
JAS.1.10	but let the rich boast in his humiliation because he will pass away like a flower of the field.
JAS.1.11	For the sun rises and, together with the scorching wind, dries up the grass; its flower falls off, and its beautiful appearance perishes. In the same way, the rich person will wither away while pursuing his activities.
JAS.1.12	Blessed is the one who endures trials, because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown
JAS.1.13	No one undergoing a trial should say, “I am being tempted by God,” since God is not tempted by evil, and he himself doesn’t tempt anyone. 
JAS.1.14	But each person is tempted when he is drawn away and enticed by his own evil desire.
JAS.1.15	Then after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is fully grown, it gives birth to death.
JAS.1.16	Don’t be deceived, my dear brothers and sisters.
JAS.1.17	Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, who does not change like shifting shadows.
JAS.1.18	By his own choice, he gave us birth by the word of truth so that we would be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
JAS.1.19	My dear brothers and sisters, understand this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to anger,
JAS.1.20	for human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness. 
JAS.1.21	Therefore, ridding yourselves of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent,
JAS.1.22	But
JAS.1.23	Because if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like someone looking at his own face
JAS.1.24	For he looks at himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of person he was. 
JAS.1.25	But the one who looks intently into the perfect law of freedom and perseveres in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer who works — this person will be blessed in what he does.
JAS.1.26	If anyone
JAS.1.27	Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to look after orphans and widows
JAS.2.1	My brothers and sisters, do not show favoritism as you hold on to the faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.
JAS.2.2	For if someone comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and dressed in fine clothes, and a poor person dressed in filthy clothes also comes in, 
JAS.2.3	if you look with favor on the one wearing the fine clothes and say, “Sit here in a good place,” and yet you say to the poor person, “Stand over there,” or “Sit here on the floor by my footstool,” 
JAS.2.4	haven’t you made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
JAS.2.5	Listen, my dear brothers and sisters: Didn’t God choose the poor in this world
JAS.2.6	Yet you have dishonored the poor.
JAS.2.7	Don’t they blaspheme the good name that was invoked over you?
JAS.2.8	Indeed, if you fulfill the royal law prescribed in the Scripture, 
JAS.2.9	If, however, you show favoritism,
JAS.2.10	For whoever keeps the entire law, and yet stumbles at one point, is guilty of breaking it all.
JAS.2.11	For he who said, 
JAS.2.12	Speak and act as those who are to be judged by the law of freedom.
JAS.2.13	For judgment is without mercy to the one who has not shown mercy.
JAS.2.14	What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can such faith save him?
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister is without clothes and lacks daily food 
JAS.2.16	and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, stay warm, and be well fed,” but you don’t give them what the body needs, what good is it?
JAS.2.17	In the same way faith, if it doesn’t have works, is dead by itself.
JAS.2.18	But someone will say, “You have faith, and I have works.”
JAS.2.19	You believe that God is one. Good! Even the demons believe — and they shudder.
JAS.2.20	Senseless person! Are you willing to learn that faith without works is useless? 
JAS.2.21	Wasn’t Abraham our father justified by works in offering Isaac his son on the altar? 
JAS.2.22	You see that faith was active together with his works, and by works, faith was made complete,
JAS.2.23	and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, 
JAS.2.24	You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. 
JAS.2.25	In the same way, wasn’t Rahab the prostitute also justified by works in receiving the messengers and sending them out by a different route?
JAS.2.26	For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.
JAS.3.1	Not many should become teachers, my brothers,
JAS.3.2	For we all stumble in many ways.
JAS.3.3	Now if we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us,
JAS.3.4	And consider ships: Though very large and driven by fierce winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs. 
JAS.3.5	So too, though the tongue is a small part of the body, it boasts great things.
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is a fire. The tongue, a world of unrighteousness, is placed
JAS.3.7	Every kind of animal, bird, reptile, and fish is tamed and has been tamed by humankind, 
JAS.3.8	but no one can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
JAS.3.9	With the tongue we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in God’s likeness.
JAS.3.10	Blessing and cursing come out of the same mouth. My brothers and sisters, these things should not be this way. 
JAS.3.11	Does a spring pour out sweet and bitter water from the same opening? 
JAS.3.12	Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers and sisters, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a saltwater spring yield fresh water.
JAS.3.13	Who among you is wise and understanding? By his good conduct he should show that his works are done in the gentleness that comes from wisdom.
JAS.3.14	But if you have bitter envy and selfish ambition in your heart, don’t boast and deny the truth.
JAS.3.15	Such wisdom does not come down from above but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
JAS.3.16	For where there is envy and selfish ambition, there is disorder and every evil practice. 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peace-loving, gentle, compliant, full of mercy and good fruits, unwavering, without pretense.
JAS.3.18	And the fruit of righteousness
JAS.4.1	What is the source of wars and fights among you? Don’t they come from your passions
JAS.4.2	You desire and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and wage war.
JAS.4.3	You ask and don’t receive because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures.
JAS.4.4	You adulterous people!
JAS.4.5	Or do you think it’s without reason that the Scripture says: The spirit he made to dwell in us envies intensely?
JAS.4.6	But he gives greater grace. Therefore he says:
JAS.4.7	Therefore, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
JAS.4.8	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
JAS.4.9	Be miserable and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
JAS.4.11	Don’t criticize one another, brothers and sisters. Anyone who defames or judges a fellow believer
JAS.4.12	There is one lawgiver and judge
JAS.4.13	Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will travel to such and such a city and spend a year there and do business and make a profit.”
JAS.4.14	Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring — what your life will be! For you are like vapor that appears for a little while, then vanishes.
JAS.4.15	Instead, you should say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.” 
JAS.4.16	But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.
JAS.4.17	So it is sin to know the good and yet not do it.
JAS.5.1	Come now, you rich
JAS.5.2	Your wealth has rotted and your clothes are moth-eaten.
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasure in the last days.
JAS.5.4	Look! The pay that you withheld from the workers
JAS.5.5	You have lived luxuriously on the earth and have indulged yourselves. You have fattened your hearts
JAS.5.6	You have condemned, you have murdered the righteous, who does not resist you.
JAS.5.7	Therefore, brothers and sisters, be patient until the Lord’s coming. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth and is patient with it until it receives the early and the late rains.
JAS.5.8	You also must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, because the Lord’s coming is near.
JAS.5.9	Brothers and sisters, do not complain about one another, so that you will not be judged. Look, the judge stands at the door!
JAS.5.10	Brothers and sisters, take the prophets who spoke in the Lord’s name as an example of suffering and patience. 
JAS.5.11	See, we count as blessed those who have endured.
JAS.5.12	Above all, my brothers and sisters, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or with any other oath.
JAS.5.13	Is anyone among you suffering? He should pray. Is anyone cheerful? He should sing praises.
JAS.5.14	Is anyone among you sick? He should call for the elders of the church, and they are to pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
JAS.5.15	The prayer of faith will save the sick person, and the Lord will raise him up; if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
JAS.5.16	Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is very powerful in its effect.
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a human being as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the land.
JAS.5.18	Then he prayed again, and the sky gave rain and the land produced its fruit.
JAS.5.19	My brothers and sisters, if any among you strays from the truth,
JAS.5.20	let that person know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.
1PE.1.1	Peter,
1PE.1.1	To those chosen, living as exiles
1PE.1.2	according to the foreknowledge
1PE.1.2	May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
1PE.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1PE.1.4	and into an inheritance that is imperishable,
1PE.1.5	You are being guarded by God’s power
1PE.1.6	You rejoice in this,
1PE.1.7	so that the proven character of your faith
1PE.1.8	Though you have not seen
1PE.1.9	because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
1PE.1.10	Concerning this salvation, the prophets,
1PE.1.11	They inquired into what time or what circumstances the Spirit of Christ
1PE.1.12	It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you. These things have now been announced to you through those who preached the gospel to you
1PE.1.13	Therefore, with your minds ready for action,
1PE.1.14	As obedient children,
1PE.1.15	But as the one who called you
1PE.1.16	for it is written, 
1PE.1.17	If you appeal to the Father who judges impartially
1PE.1.18	For you know that you were redeemed from your empty way of life
1PE.1.19	but with the precious blood of Christ,
1PE.1.20	He was foreknown
1PE.1.21	Through him you believe in God,
1PE.1.22	Since you have purified yourselves by your obedience to the truth,
1PE.1.23	because you have been born again
1PE.1.24	For
1PE.1.25	And this word is the gospel that was proclaimed to you.
1PE.2.1	Therefore, rid yourselves of
1PE.2.2	Like newborn infants, desire the pure milk of the word,
1PE.2.3	if 
1PE.2.4	As you come to him, a living stone — rejected by people but chosen and honored by
1PE.2.5	you yourselves, as living stones, a spiritual house, are being built to be a holy priesthood
1PE.2.6	For it stands in Scripture:
1PE.2.7	So honor will come to you who believe; but for the unbelieving,
1PE.2.8	and
1PE.2.8	They stumble because they disobey the word; they were destined
1PE.2.9	But you are 
1PE.2.10	Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; you had not received mercy,
1PE.2.11	Dear friends, I urge you as strangers and exiles
1PE.2.12	Conduct
1PE.2.13	Submit
1PE.2.14	or to governors as those sent out by him to punish those who do what is evil and to praise those who do what is good. 
1PE.2.15	For it is God’s will
1PE.2.16	Submit as free people, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil,
1PE.2.17	Honor everyone. Love
1PE.2.18	Household slaves, submit to your masters
1PE.2.19	For it brings favor if, because of a consciousness of God, someone endures grief from suffering unjustly. 
1PE.2.20	For what credit is there if when you do wrong and are beaten, you endure it? But when you do what is good and suffer,
1PE.2.21	For you were called to this, because Christ also suffered
1PE.2.22	He did not commit sin,
1PE.2.23	when he was insulted, he did not insult in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten but entrusted himself to the one who judges
1PE.2.24	He himself bore our sins
1PE.2.25	For you 
1PE.3.1	In the same way, wives,
1PE.3.2	when they observe your pure, reverent lives.
1PE.3.3	Don’t let your beauty consist of outward things like elaborate hairstyles and wearing gold jewelry or fine clothes,
1PE.3.4	but rather what is inside the heart
1PE.3.5	For in the past, the holy
1PE.3.6	just as Sarah
1PE.3.7	Husbands,
1PE.3.8	Finally, all of you be like-minded and sympathetic, love one another,
1PE.3.9	not paying back evil for evil
1PE.3.10	For 
1PE.3.13	Who then will harm you if you are devoted to what is good? 
1PE.3.14	But even if you should suffer for righteousness,
1PE.3.15	but in your hearts regard
1PE.3.16	Yet do this with gentleness and respect, keeping a clear conscience,
1PE.3.17	For it is better to suffer
1PE.3.18	For Christ also suffered
1PE.3.19	in which
1PE.3.20	who in the past were disobedient, when God patiently waited in the days of Noah
1PE.3.21	Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you (not as the removal of dirt from the body,
1PE.3.22	who has gone into heaven
1PE.4.1	Therefore, since Christ suffered
1PE.4.2	in order to live the remaining time in the flesh no longer for human desires, but for God’s will.
1PE.4.3	For there has already been enough time spent in doing what the Gentiles choose to do: carrying on in unrestrained behavior, evil desires,
1PE.4.4	They are surprised that you don’t join them in the same flood of wild living — and they slander
1PE.4.5	They will give an account to the one who stands ready to judge the living and the dead.
1PE.4.6	For this reason the gospel was also preached to those who are now dead,
1PE.4.7	The end of all things is near;
1PE.4.8	Above all, maintain constant love
1PE.4.9	Be hospitable
1PE.4.10	Just as each one has received a gift, use it to serve others,
1PE.4.11	If anyone speaks, let it be as one who speaks God’s words; if anyone serves, let it be from the strength God provides,
1PE.4.12	Dear friends, don’t be surprised when the fiery ordeal comes among you to test you as if something unusual were happening to you.
1PE.4.13	Instead, rejoice as you share in the sufferings of Christ,
1PE.4.14	If you are ridiculed for the name of Christ,
1PE.4.15	Let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or a meddler.
1PE.4.16	But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed but let him glorify God in having that name.
1PE.4.17	For the time has come for judgment
1PE.4.18	And 
1PE.4.19	So then, let those who suffer according to God’s will entrust themselves
1PE.5.1	I exhort the elders among you as a fellow elder and witness
1PE.5.2	Shepherd God’s flock among you,
1PE.5.3	not lording it over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock. 
1PE.5.4	And when the chief Shepherd
1PE.5.5	In the same way, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. All of you clothe yourselves with
1PE.5.6	Humble
1PE.5.7	casting all your cares on him, because he cares about you.
1PE.5.8	Be sober-minded,
1PE.5.9	Resist him,
1PE.5.10	The God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory
1PE.5.11	To him be dominion
1PE.5.12	Through Silvanus,
1PE.5.13	She who is in Babylon,
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with a kiss of love.
2PE.1.1	Simeon
2PE.1.1	To those who have received a faith equal to ours through the righteousness
2PE.1.2	May grace and peace be multiplied to you through the knowledge of God
2PE.1.3	His
2PE.1.4	By these he has given us very great and precious promises,
2PE.1.5	For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with goodness, goodness with knowledge, 
2PE.1.6	knowledge with self-control,
2PE.1.7	godliness with brotherly affection,
2PE.1.8	For if you possess these qualities in increasing measure, they will keep you from being useless
2PE.1.9	The person who lacks these things is blind and shortsighted and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins. 
2PE.1.10	Therefore, brothers and sisters, make every effort to confirm your calling and election,
2PE.1.11	For in this way, entry into the eternal kingdom
2PE.1.12	Therefore I will always remind you about these things, even though you know them and are established in the truth
2PE.1.13	I think it is right, as long as I am in this bodily tent,
2PE.1.14	since I know that I will soon lay aside my tent, as our Lord Jesus Christ has indeed made clear to me.
2PE.1.15	And I will also make every effort so that you are able to recall these things at any time after my departure.
2PE.1.16	For we did not follow cleverly contrived myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ;
2PE.1.17	For he received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying “This is my beloved Son,
2PE.1.18	We ourselves heard this voice when it came from heaven while we were with him on the holy mountain.
2PE.1.19	We also have the prophetic word strongly confirmed, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp shining in a dark place,
2PE.1.20	Above all, you know this: No prophecy of Scripture comes from the prophet’s own interpretation, 
2PE.1.21	because no prophecy ever came by the will of man;
2PE.2.1	There were indeed false prophets
2PE.2.2	Many will follow their depraved ways, and the way of truth will be maligned because of them.
2PE.2.3	They will exploit
2PE.2.4	For if God didn’t spare
2PE.2.5	and if he didn’t spare the ancient world, but protected Noah,
2PE.2.6	and if he reduced the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
2PE.2.7	and if he rescued righteous Lot,
2PE.2.8	(for as that righteous man lived among them day by day, his righteous soul was tormented by the lawless deeds he saw and heard
2PE.2.9	then the Lord knows how to rescue
2PE.2.10	especially those who follow the polluting desires of the flesh and despise authority.
2PE.2.10	Bold, arrogant people! They are not afraid to slander the glorious ones; 
2PE.2.11	however, angels, who are greater in might and power, do not bring a slanderous charge against them before the Lord.
2PE.2.12	But these people, like irrational animals — creatures of instinct born to be caught and destroyed — slander what they do not understand, and in their destruction they too will be destroyed. 
2PE.2.13	They will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done. They consider it a pleasure to carouse in broad daylight. They are spots and blemishes, delighting in their deceptions
2PE.2.14	They have eyes full of adultery
2PE.2.15	They have gone astray by abandoning the straight path
2PE.2.16	but received a rebuke for his lawlessness: A speechless donkey spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet’s madness.
2PE.2.17	These people are springs without water, mists driven by a storm. The gloom of darkness has been reserved for them.
2PE.2.18	For by uttering boastful, empty words,
2PE.2.19	They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption, since people are enslaved to whatever defeats them.
2PE.2.20	For if, having escaped the world’s impurity through the knowledge of the Lord
2PE.2.21	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness
2PE.2.22	It has happened to them according to the true proverb: 
2PE.3.1	Dear friends, this is now the second letter
2PE.3.2	so that you recall the words previously spoken by the holy prophets and the command of our Lord and Savior given through your apostles. 
2PE.3.3	Above all, be aware of this: Scoffers will come in the last days
2PE.3.4	saying, “Where is his ‘coming’ that he promised?
2PE.3.5	They deliberately overlook this: By the word of God
2PE.3.6	Through these the world of that time perished when it was flooded.
2PE.3.7	By the same word,
2PE.3.8	Dear friends, don’t overlook this one fact: With the Lord one day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.
2PE.3.9	The Lord does not delay his promise,
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord
2PE.3.11	Since all these things are to be dissolved in this way, it is clear what sort of people you should be in holy conduct and godliness 
2PE.3.12	as you wait for the day of God and hasten its coming.
2PE.3.13	But based on his promise, we wait for new heavens and a new earth,
2PE.3.14	Therefore, dear friends, while you wait for these things, make every effort to be found without spot or blemish in his sight, at peace.
2PE.3.15	Also, regard the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our dear brother Paul has written to you according to the wisdom given to him.
2PE.3.16	He speaks about these things in all his letters. There are some matters that are hard to understand. The untaught and unstable will twist them to their own destruction,
2PE.3.17	Therefore, dear friends, since you know this in advance, be on your guard,
2PE.3.18	But grow in the grace and knowledge
1JN.1.1	What was from the beginning,
1JN.1.2	that life was revealed,
1JN.1.3	what we have seen and heard we also declare to you, so that you may also have fellowship
1JN.1.4	We are writing these things
1JN.1.5	This is the message we have heard from him and declare to you: God is light,
1JN.1.6	If we say, “We have fellowship
1JN.1.7	If we walk in the light
1JN.1.8	If we say, “We have no sin,”
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous to forgive
1JN.1.10	If we say, “We have not sinned,” we make him a liar, and his word
1JN.2.1	My little children, I am writing you these things so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate
1JN.2.2	He himself is the atoning sacrifice
1JN.2.3	This is how we know
1JN.2.4	The one who says, “I have come to know him,” and yet doesn’t keep his commands, is a liar, and the truth is not in him. 
1JN.2.5	But whoever keeps his word,
1JN.2.6	The one who says he remains in him
1JN.2.7	Dear friends, I am not writing you a new command
1JN.2.8	Yet I am writing you a new command, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away
1JN.2.9	The one who says he is in the light but hates his brother or sister
1JN.2.10	The one who loves his brother or sister
1JN.2.11	But the one who hates his brother or sister
1JN.2.12	I am writing to you, little children,
1JN.2.12	since your sins have been forgiven
1JN.2.12	on account of his name.
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you, fathers,
1JN.2.13	because you have come to know
1JN.2.13	the one who is from the beginning.
1JN.2.13	I am writing to you, young men,
1JN.2.13	because you have conquered the evil one.
1JN.2.14	I have written to you, children,
1JN.2.14	because you have come to know the Father.
1JN.2.14	I have written to you, fathers,
1JN.2.14	because you have come to know
1JN.2.14	the one who is from the beginning.
1JN.2.14	I have written to you, young men,
1JN.2.14	because you are strong,
1JN.2.14	God’s word
1JN.2.14	and you have conquered the evil one.
1JN.2.15	Do not love the world
1JN.2.16	For everything in the world — the lust of the flesh,
1JN.2.17	And the world with its lust is passing away,
1JN.2.18	Children, it is the last hour.
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they did not belong to us; for if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us. However, they went out so that it might be made clear that none of them belongs to us.
1JN.2.20	But you have an anointing
1JN.2.21	I have not written to you because you don’t know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie comes from the truth. 
1JN.2.22	Who is the liar, if not the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ?
1JN.2.23	No one who denies the Son has the Father;
1JN.2.24	What you have heard from the beginning is to remain in you. If what you have heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son
1JN.2.25	And this is the promise that he himself made to us: eternal life.
1JN.2.26	I have written these things to you concerning those who are trying to deceive you. 
1JN.2.27	As for you, the anointing you received from him remains in you, and you don’t need anyone to teach you. Instead, his anointing teaches you about all things
1JN.2.28	So now, little children, remain in him so that when he appears
1JN.2.29	If you know that he is righteous, you know this as well: Everyone who does what is right
1JN.3.1	See what great love
1JN.3.2	Dear friends, we are God’s children now, and what we will be has not yet been revealed.
1JN.3.3	And everyone who has this hope
1JN.3.4	Everyone who commits sin practices lawlessness; and sin is lawlessness. 
1JN.3.5	You know that he was revealed so that he might take away sins,
1JN.3.6	Everyone who remains in him
1JN.3.7	Children, let no one deceive you. The one who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. 
1JN.3.8	The one who commits
1JN.3.9	Everyone who has been born of God
1JN.3.10	This is how God’s children and the devil’s children become obvious. Whoever does not do what is right is not of God, especially the one who does not love his brother or sister.
1JN.3.11	For this is the message you have heard from the beginning: We should love one another, 
1JN.3.12	unlike Cain,
1JN.3.13	Do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates
1JN.3.14	We know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers and sisters. The one who does not love remains in death.
1JN.3.15	Everyone who hates his brother or sister
1JN.3.16	This is how we have come to know love: He laid down his life
1JN.3.17	If anyone has this world’s goods
1JN.3.18	Little children, let us not love in word or speech, but in action and in truth.
1JN.3.19	This is how we will know that we belong to the truth
1JN.3.20	whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater than our hearts, and he knows all things.
1JN.3.21	Dear friends, if our hearts don’t condemn us, we have confidence before God 
1JN.3.22	and receive whatever we ask from him because we keep his commands
1JN.3.23	Now this is his command: that we believe in the name
1JN.3.24	The one who keeps his commands remains in him,
1JN.4.1	Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits
1JN.4.2	This is how you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh
1JN.4.3	but every spirit that does not confess Jesus
1JN.4.4	You are from God, little children, and you have conquered them, because the one who is in you
1JN.4.5	They are from the world.
1JN.4.6	We are from God. Anyone who knows God listens to us;
1JN.4.7	Dear friends, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves has been born of God
1JN.4.8	The one who does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
1JN.4.9	God’s love was revealed among us
1JN.4.10	Love consists in this: not that we loved God, but that he loved us
1JN.4.11	Dear friends, if God loved us in this way, we also must love one another.
1JN.4.12	No one has ever seen God.
1JN.4.13	This is how we know that we remain in him
1JN.4.14	And we have seen and we testify that the Father has sent his Son
1JN.4.15	Whoever confesses
1JN.4.16	And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us.
1JN.4.16	God is love, and the one who remains in love remains in God, and God remains in him. 
1JN.4.17	In this, love is made complete with us so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment,
1JN.4.18	There is no fear in love; instead, perfect love drives out fear,
1JN.4.19	We love
1JN.4.20	If anyone says, “I love God,” and yet hates his brother or sister,
1JN.4.21	And we have this command from him: The one who loves God must also love his brother and sister.
1JN.5.1	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God,
1JN.5.2	This is how we know that we love God’s children: when we love God and obey
1JN.5.3	For this is what love for God is: to keep his commands. And his commands are not a burden,
1JN.5.4	because everyone who has been born of God conquers the world. This is the victory that has conquered the world: our faith.
1JN.5.5	Who is the one who conquers the world
1JN.5.6	Jesus Christ — he is the one who came by water and blood, not by water only, but by water
1JN.5.7	For there are three that testify:
1JN.5.8	the Spirit,
1JN.5.9	If we accept human testimony, God’s testimony
1JN.5.10	The one who believes in the Son of God has this testimony within himself. The one who does not believe God has made him a liar,
1JN.5.11	And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	The one who has the Son has life.
1JN.5.13	I have written these things to you who believe in the name
1JN.5.14	This is the confidence we have before him: If we ask
1JN.5.15	And if we know that he hears whatever we ask,
1JN.5.16	If anyone sees a fellow believer
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin that doesn’t lead to death.
1JN.5.18	We know that everyone who has been born of God does not sin, but the one who is born of God keeps him,
1JN.5.19	We know that we are of God, and the whole world is under the sway of the evil one. 
1JN.5.20	And we know that the Son of God has come
1JN.5.21	Little children, guard yourselves from idols.
2JN.1.1	The elder:
2JN.1.1	To the elect
2JN.1.2	because of the truth that remains in us
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy, and peace
2JN.1.4	I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth,
2JN.1.5	So now I ask you, dear lady — not as if I were writing you a new command, but one we have had from the beginning — that we love one another.
2JN.1.6	This is love:
2JN.1.7	Many deceivers have gone out into the world; they do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh.
2JN.1.8	Watch yourselves so you don’t lose what we
2JN.1.9	Anyone who does not remain in Christ’s teaching
2JN.1.10	If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive
2JN.1.11	for the one who greets him shares
2JN.1.12	Though I have many things to write to you,
2JN.1.13	The children of your elect sister send you greetings.
3JN.1.1	The elder:
3JN.1.1	To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
3JN.1.2	Dear friend, I pray that you are prospering in every way and are in good health,
3JN.1.3	For I was very glad when fellow believers came and testified
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy
3JN.1.5	Dear friend, you are acting faithfully in whatever you do for the brothers and sisters, especially when they are strangers. 
3JN.1.6	They have testified to your love before the church.
3JN.1.7	since they set out for the sake of the Name,
3JN.1.8	Therefore, we ought to support such people so that we can be coworkers with the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to have first place among them,
3JN.1.10	This is why, if I come, I will remind him of the works he is doing, slandering
3JN.1.11	Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil,
3JN.1.12	Everyone speaks well of Demetrius — even the truth itself. And we also speak well of him, and you know
3JN.1.13	I have many things to write you, but I don’t want to write to you with pen and ink. 
3JN.1.14	I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.
3JN.1.15	Peace to you. The friends send you greetings. Greet the friends by name.
JUD.1.1	Jude,
JUD.1.1	To those who are the called,
JUD.1.2	May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
JUD.1.3	Dear friends, although I was eager to write you about the salvation we share,
JUD.1.4	For some people, who were designated for this judgment long ago,
JUD.1.5	Now I want to remind you, although you came to know all these things once and for all, that Jesus
JUD.1.6	and the angels
JUD.1.7	Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah
JUD.1.8	In the same way these people — relying on their dreams — defile their flesh, reject authority, and slander glorious ones.
JUD.1.9	Yet when Michael
JUD.1.10	But these people blaspheme anything they do not understand. And what they do understand by instinct — like irrational animals — by these things they are destroyed. 
JUD.1.11	Woe to them! For they have gone the way of Cain,
JUD.1.12	These people are dangerous reefs
JUD.1.13	They are wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shameful deeds; wandering stars
JUD.1.14	It was about these that Enoch,
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly
JUD.1.16	These people are discontented grumblers, living according to their desires;
JUD.1.17	But you, dear friends, remember what was predicted by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
JUD.1.18	They told you, “In the end time
JUD.1.19	These people create divisions and are worldly,
JUD.1.20	But you, dear friends, as you build yourselves up in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
JUD.1.21	keep yourselves in the love of God,
JUD.1.22	Have mercy on those who waver; 
JUD.1.23	save others by snatching them from the fire;
JUD.1.24	Now to him
JUD.1.25	to the only
REV.1.1	The revelation of
REV.1.2	who testified to the word of God and to the testimony
REV.1.3	Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy,
REV.1.4	John: To the seven churches in Asia. Grace and peace
REV.1.5	and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness,
REV.1.5	To him who loves us and has set us free
REV.1.6	and made us a kingdom,
REV.1.7	and 
REV.1.7	So it is to be. Amen.
REV.1.8	“I am the Alpha and the Omega,”
REV.1.9	I, John, your brother and partner in the affliction,
REV.1.10	I was in the Spirit
REV.1.11	saying, 
REV.1.12	Then I turned to see whose voice
REV.1.13	and among the lampstands was one like the Son of Man,
REV.1.14	The hair of his head was white as wool — white as snow
REV.1.15	His feet were like fine bronze as it is fired in a furnace,
REV.1.16	He had seven stars in his right hand; a sharp double-edged sword came from his mouth,
REV.1.17	When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man.
REV.4.1	After this I looked, and there in heaven was an open door. The first voice that I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet
REV.4.2	Immediately I was in the Spirit,
REV.4.3	The one seated
REV.4.4	Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones sat twenty-four elders
REV.4.5	Flashes of lightning and rumblings and peals of thunder came from the throne.
REV.4.6	Something like a sea of glass, similar to crystal, was also before the throne.
REV.4.6	Four living creatures covered with eyes in front and in back were around the throne on each side. 
REV.4.7	The first living creature was like a lion; the second living creature was like an ox; the third living creature had a face like a man; and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
REV.4.8	Each of the four living creatures had six wings;
REV.4.8	Holy, holy, holy,
REV.4.8	Lord God, the Almighty,
REV.4.8	who was, who is, and who is to come.
REV.4.9	Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one seated on the throne, the one who lives forever and ever,
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fall down before the one seated on the throne
REV.4.11	Our Lord and God,
REV.4.11	you are worthy
REV.4.11	glory and honor and power,
REV.4.11	because you have created all things,
REV.4.11	and by your will
REV.4.11	they exist and were created.
REV.5.1	Then I saw in the right hand of the one seated on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides, sealed with seven seals.
REV.5.2	I also saw a mighty angel
REV.5.3	But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or even to look in it. 
REV.5.4	I wept and wept because no one was found worthy to open
REV.5.5	Then one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Look, the Lion from the tribe of Judah,
REV.5.6	Then I saw one like a slaughtered lamb
REV.5.7	He went and took the scroll out of the right hand of the one seated on the throne.
REV.5.8	When he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp
REV.5.9	And they sang a new song:
REV.5.9	You are worthy to take the scroll
REV.5.9	and to open its seals,
REV.5.9	because you were slaughtered,
REV.5.9	and you purchased
REV.5.9	for God by your blood
REV.5.9	from every tribe and language
REV.5.9	and people and nation.
REV.5.10	You made them a kingdom
REV.5.10	and priests to our God,
REV.5.10	and they will reign on the earth.
REV.5.11	Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels around the throne, and also of the living creatures and of the elders. Their number was countless thousands, plus thousands of thousands.
REV.5.12	They said with a loud voice,
REV.5.12	Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered
REV.5.12	to receive power and riches
REV.5.12	and wisdom and strength
REV.5.12	and honor and glory and blessing!
REV.5.13	I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth,
REV.5.13	Blessing and honor and glory and power
REV.5.13	be to the one seated on the throne,
REV.5.13	and to the Lamb, forever and ever!
REV.5.14	The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders fell down and worshiped.
REV.6.1	Then I saw the Lamb open one of the seven
REV.6.2	I looked, and there was a white horse.
REV.6.3	When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” 
REV.6.4	Then another horse went out, a fiery red one,
REV.6.5	When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” And I looked, and there was a black horse.
REV.6.6	Then I heard something like a voice among the four living creatures say, “A quart of wheat for a denarius,
REV.6.7	When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” 
REV.6.8	And I looked, and there was a pale green
REV.6.9	When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and the testimony they had given.
REV.6.10	They cried out with a loud voice: “Lord,
REV.6.11	So they were each given a white robe, and they were told to rest a little while longer until the number would be completed of their fellow servants and their brothers and sisters, who were going to be killed just as they had been.
REV.6.12	Then I saw him open
REV.6.13	the stars
REV.6.14	the sky was split apart like a scroll being rolled up;
REV.6.15	Then the kings of the earth, the nobles, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and every slave and free person hid in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
REV.6.16	And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us
REV.6.17	because the great day of their
REV.7.1	After this I saw four angels
REV.7.2	Then I saw another angel rising up from the east,
REV.7.3	“Don’t harm the earth or the sea or the trees
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of the sealed:
REV.7.4	144,000 sealed from every tribe of the Israelites:
REV.7.5	12,000 sealed from the tribe of Judah,
REV.7.5	12,000
REV.7.5	12,000 from the tribe of Gad,
REV.7.6	12,000 from the tribe of Asher,
REV.7.6	12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali,
REV.7.6	12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,
REV.7.7	12,000 from the tribe of Simeon,
REV.7.7	12,000 from the tribe of Levi,
REV.7.7	12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,
REV.7.8	12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun,
REV.7.8	12,000 from the tribe of Joseph,
REV.7.8	12,000 sealed from the tribe of Benjamin.
REV.7.9	After this I looked, and there was a vast multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language,
REV.7.10	And they cried out in a loud voice:
REV.7.10	Salvation belongs to our God,
REV.7.10	who is seated on the throne,
REV.7.10	and to the Lamb!
REV.7.11	All the angels stood around the throne, and along with the elders and the four living creatures they fell facedown before the throne and worshiped God, 
REV.7.12	saying,
REV.7.12	Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom
REV.7.12	and thanksgiving and honor
REV.7.12	and power and strength
REV.7.12	be to our God forever and ever.
REV.7.13	Then one of the elders asked me, “Who are these people in white robes, and where did they come from?”
REV.7.14	I said to him, “Sir,
REV.7.14	Then he told me: These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation.
REV.7.15	For this reason they are before the throne of God,
REV.7.15	and they serve him day and night
REV.7.15	The one seated on the throne will shelter
REV.7.16	They will no longer hunger;
REV.7.16	they will no longer thirst;
REV.7.16	the sun will no longer strike them,
REV.7.16	nor will any scorching heat.
REV.7.17	For the Lamb who is at the center of the throne
REV.7.17	will shepherd them;
REV.7.17	he will guide them to springs of the waters of life,
REV.7.17	and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
REV.8.1	When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence
REV.8.2	Then I saw the seven angels who stand in the presence of God;
REV.8.3	Another angel, with a golden incense burner, came and stood at the altar. He was given a large amount of incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar in front of the throne.
REV.8.4	The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up in the presence of God from the angel’s hand. 
REV.8.5	The angel took the incense burner, filled it with fire from the altar,
REV.8.6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
REV.8.7	The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire, mixed with blood, were hurled to the earth.
REV.8.8	The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain ablaze with fire was hurled into the sea.
REV.8.9	a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from heaven.
REV.8.11	The name of the star is Wormwood,
REV.8.12	The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. A third of the day was without light and also a third of the night.
REV.8.13	I looked and heard an eagle
REV.9.1	The fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to earth.
REV.9.2	He opened the shaft to the abyss, and smoke came up out of the shaft like smoke from a great
REV.9.3	Then locusts came out of the smoke on to the earth,
REV.9.4	They were told not to harm the grass of the earth, or any green plant, or any tree,
REV.9.5	They were not permitted to kill them but were to torment them for five months; their torment is like the torment caused by a scorpion when it stings someone. 
REV.9.6	In those days people will seek death and will not find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.
REV.9.7	The appearance of the locusts was like horses prepared for battle.
REV.9.8	they had hair like women’s hair; their teeth were like lions’ teeth;
REV.9.9	they had chests like iron breastplates; the sound of their wings was like the sound of many chariots with horses rushing into battle; 
REV.9.10	and they had tails with stingers like scorpions, so that with their tails they had the power to harm people for five months. 
REV.9.11	They had as their king
REV.9.12	The first woe has passed. There are still two more woes to come after this.
REV.9.13	The sixth angel blew his trumpet. From the four
REV.9.14	say to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Release the four angels
REV.9.15	So the four angels who were prepared for the hour, day, month, and year
REV.9.16	The number of mounted troops was two hundred million;
REV.9.17	This is how I saw the horses and their riders in the vision: They had breastplates that were fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and from their mouths came fire, smoke, and sulfur.
REV.9.18	A third of the human race was killed by these three plagues — by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came from their mouths. 
REV.9.19	For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, because their tails, which resemble snakes, have heads that inflict injury.
REV.9.20	The rest of the people, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands
REV.9.21	And they did not repent of their murders, their sorceries, their sexual immorality, or their thefts.
REV.10.1	Then I saw another mighty angel
REV.10.2	and he held a little scroll opened in his hand. He put his right foot on the sea, his left on the land, 
REV.10.3	and he called out with a loud voice like a roaring lion. When he cried out, the seven thunders raised their voices. 
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven, saying, “Seal up what the seven thunders said,
REV.10.5	Then the angel that I had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven. 
REV.10.6	He swore by the one who lives forever and ever,
REV.10.7	but in the days when the seventh angel
REV.10.8	Then the voice that I heard from heaven spoke to me again and said, “Go, take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.”
REV.10.9	So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take and eat it; it will be bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.”
REV.10.10	Then I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I ate it, my stomach became bitter.
REV.10.11	And they said to me, “You must prophesy again about
REV.11.1	Then I was given a measuring reed
REV.11.2	But exclude the courtyard outside the temple.
REV.11.3	I will grant
REV.11.4	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord
REV.11.5	If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies;
REV.11.6	They have authority to close up the sky so that it does not rain during the days of their prophecy.
REV.11.7	When they finish their testimony, the beast
REV.11.8	Their dead bodies
REV.11.9	And some of
REV.11.10	Those who live on the earth will gloat
REV.11.11	But after three and a half days, the breath
REV.11.12	Then they heard
REV.11.13	At that moment a violent earthquake took place,
REV.11.14	The second woe
REV.11.15	The seventh angel blew his trumpet,
REV.11.15	The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom
REV.11.15	of our Lord and of his Christ,
REV.11.15	and he will reign forever and ever.
REV.11.16	The twenty-four elders, who were seated before God on their thrones, fell facedown and worshiped God, 
REV.11.17	saying,
REV.11.17	We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty,
REV.11.17	who is and who was,
REV.11.17	because you have taken your great power
REV.11.17	and have begun to reign.
REV.11.18	The nations were angry,
REV.11.18	but your wrath has come.
REV.11.18	The time has come
REV.11.18	for the dead to be judged
REV.11.18	and to give the reward
REV.11.18	to your servants the prophets,
REV.11.18	to the saints, and to those who fear your name,
REV.11.18	both small and great,
REV.11.18	and the time has come to destroy
REV.11.18	those who destroy the earth.
REV.11.19	Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant
REV.12.1	A great sign
REV.12.2	She was pregnant and cried out in labor and agony as she was about to give birth.
REV.12.3	Then another sign
REV.12.4	Its tail swept away a third of the stars in heaven and hurled them to the earth.
REV.12.5	She gave birth to a Son, a male who is going to rule
REV.12.6	The woman fled into the wilderness, where she had a place prepared by God,
REV.12.7	Then war broke out in heaven: Michael
REV.12.8	but he could not prevail,
REV.12.9	So the great dragon was thrown out — the ancient serpent,
REV.12.10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say,
REV.12.10	The salvation and the power
REV.12.10	and the kingdom of our God
REV.12.10	and the authority of his Christ
REV.12.10	have now come,
REV.12.10	because the accuser
REV.12.10	who accuses them
REV.12.10	before our God day and night,
REV.12.10	has been thrown down.
REV.12.11	They conquered him
REV.12.11	by the blood of the Lamb
REV.12.11	and by the word of their testimony;
REV.12.11	for they did not love their lives
REV.12.11	to the point of death.
REV.12.12	Therefore rejoice, you heavens,
REV.12.12	and you who dwell in them!
REV.12.12	Woe to the earth and the sea,
REV.12.12	because the devil has come down to you
REV.12.12	with great fury,
REV.12.12	because he knows his time is short.
REV.12.13	When the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he persecuted
REV.12.14	The woman was given two wings of a great eagle,
REV.12.15	From his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river flowing after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood. 
REV.12.16	But the earth helped the woman. The earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth. 
REV.12.17	So the dragon was furious with the woman and went off to wage war
REV.12.18	The dragon
REV.13.1	And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea.
REV.13.2	The beast I saw was like a leopard, its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth.
REV.13.3	One of its heads appeared to be fatally wounded, but its fatal wound was healed.
REV.13.3	The whole earth was amazed and followed the beast.
REV.13.4	They worshiped the dragon
REV.13.5	The beast was given a mouth to utter boasts and blasphemies.
REV.13.6	It began to speak
REV.13.7	And it was permitted to wage war against the saints and to conquer them.
REV.13.8	All those who live on the earth will worship it, everyone whose name was not written from the foundation of the world in the book
REV.13.9	If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen.
REV.13.10	If anyone is to be taken captive,
REV.13.10	into captivity he goes.
REV.13.10	If anyone is to be killed
REV.13.10	with a sword he will be killed.
REV.13.10	This calls for endurance
REV.13.11	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; it had two horns like a lamb,
REV.13.12	It exercises all the authority of the first beast on its behalf and compels the earth and those who live on it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed. 
REV.13.13	It also performs great signs,
REV.13.14	It deceives those who live on the earth
REV.13.15	It was permitted to give breath
REV.13.16	And it makes everyone — small and great, rich and poor, free and slave — to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead,
REV.13.17	so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark: the beast’s name or the number of its name.
REV.13.18	This calls for wisdom:
REV.14.1	Then I looked, and there was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion,
REV.14.2	I heard a sound
REV.14.3	They sang
REV.14.4	These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, since they remained virgins.
REV.14.5	No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless.
REV.14.6	Then I saw another angel
REV.14.7	He spoke with a loud voice:
REV.14.8	And another, a second angel, followed, saying, “It has fallen, Babylon the Great
REV.14.9	And another, a third angel, followed them and spoke with a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand, 
REV.14.10	he will also drink the wine of God’s wrath, which is poured full strength into the cup of his anger.
REV.14.11	and the smoke of their torment will go up forever and ever.
REV.14.12	This calls for endurance from the saints,
REV.14.13	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on.”
REV.14.13	“Yes,” says the Spirit, “so they will rest from their labors, since their works follow them.”
REV.14.14	Then I looked, and there was a white cloud, and one like the Son of Man
REV.14.15	Another angel came out of the temple, crying out in a loud voice to the one who was seated on the cloud, “Use your sickle and reap, for the time to reap has come, since the harvest of the earth is ripe.”
REV.14.16	So the one seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
REV.14.17	Then another angel who also had a sharp sickle came out of the temple in heaven. 
REV.14.18	Yet another angel, who had authority over fire, came from the altar, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, “Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the vineyard of the earth, because its grapes have ripened.” 
REV.14.19	So the angel swung his sickle at the earth and gathered the grapes from the vineyard of the earth, and he threw them into the great winepress of God’s wrath.
REV.14.20	Then the press was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed out of the press up to the horses’ bridles for about 180 miles.
REV.15.1	Then I saw another great and awe-inspiring sign
REV.15.2	I also saw something like a sea of glass
REV.15.3	They sang the song of God’s servant Moses
REV.15.3	Great and awe-inspiring are your works,
REV.15.3	Lord God, the Almighty;
REV.15.3	just and true
REV.15.3	King of the nations.
REV.15.4	Lord, who will not fear
REV.15.4	and glorify your name?
REV.15.4	For you alone are holy.
REV.15.4	All the nations will come
REV.15.4	and worship before you
REV.15.4	because your righteous acts
REV.15.4	have been revealed.
REV.15.5	After this I looked, and the heavenly temple — the tabernacle of testimony
REV.15.6	Out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues, dressed in pure, bright linen, with golden sashes wrapped around their chests. 
REV.15.7	One of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.
REV.15.8	Then the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power,
REV.16.1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels,
REV.16.2	The first went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and severely painful sores
REV.16.3	The second
REV.16.4	The third
REV.16.5	I heard the angel of the waters say,
REV.16.5	You are just,
REV.16.5	the Holy One,
REV.16.5	because you have passed judgment on these things.
REV.16.6	Because they poured out
REV.16.6	the blood of the saints and the prophets,
REV.16.6	you have given them blood to drink;
REV.16.6	they deserve it!
REV.16.7	I heard the altar say,
REV.16.7	Yes, Lord God, the Almighty,
REV.16.7	true and just are your judgments.
REV.16.8	The fourth
REV.16.9	and people were scorched by the intense heat. So they blasphemed the name of God,
REV.16.10	The fifth
REV.16.11	and blasphemed the God of heaven
REV.16.12	The sixth
REV.16.13	Then I saw three unclean spirits like frogs
REV.16.14	For they are demonic spirits performing signs,
REV.16.16	So they assembled the kings at the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.
REV.16.17	Then the seventh
REV.16.18	There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, and peals of thunder. And a severe earthquake occurred like no other since people have been on the earth, so great was the quake.
REV.16.19	The great city
REV.16.20	Every island fled, and the mountains disappeared.
REV.16.21	Enormous hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds,
REV.17.1	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls
REV.17.2	The kings of the earth
REV.17.3	Then he carried me away in the Spirit
REV.17.3	I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered
REV.17.4	The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, jewels, and pearls.
REV.17.5	On her forehead was written a name, a mystery:
REV.17.6	Then I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the witnesses to Jesus.
REV.17.7	Then the angel said to me, “Why are you astonished? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast, with the seven heads and the ten horns, that carries her. 
REV.17.8	The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to come up from the abyss
REV.17.9	This calls for a mind that has wisdom.
REV.17.9	“The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated. They are also seven kings: 
REV.17.10	Five have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes, he must remain for only a little while. 
REV.17.11	The beast that was and is not, is itself an eighth king, but it belongs to the seven and is going to destruction. 
REV.17.12	The ten horns you saw are ten kings
REV.17.13	These have one purpose, and they give their power and authority to the beast. 
REV.17.14	These will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings.
REV.17.15	He also said to me, “The waters you saw,
REV.17.16	The ten horns you saw, and the beast, will hate the prostitute.
REV.17.17	For God has put it into their hearts to carry out his plan by having one purpose
REV.17.18	And the woman you saw is the great city that has royal power over the kings of the earth.”
REV.18.1	After this I saw another angel with great authority coming down from heaven,
REV.18.2	He called out in a mighty voice:
REV.18.2	It has fallen,
REV.18.2	Babylon the Great has fallen!
REV.18.2	She has become a home for demons,
REV.18.2	a haunt for every unclean spirit,
REV.18.2	a haunt for every unclean bird,
REV.18.2	and a haunt
REV.18.3	For all the nations have drunk
REV.18.3	the wine of her sexual immorality,
REV.18.3	which brings wrath.
REV.18.3	The kings of the earth
REV.18.3	have committed sexual immorality with her,
REV.18.3	and the merchants of the earth
REV.18.3	have grown wealthy from her sensuality and excess.
REV.18.4	Then I heard another voice from heaven:
REV.18.4	Come out of her, my people,
REV.18.4	so that you will not share in her sins
REV.18.4	or receive any of her plagues.
REV.18.5	For her sins are piled up
REV.18.5	and God has remembered her crimes.
REV.18.6	Pay her back the way she also paid,
REV.18.6	and double it according to her works.
REV.18.6	In the cup in which she mixed,
REV.18.6	mix a double portion for her.
REV.18.7	As much as she glorified herself and indulged her sensual and excessive ways,
REV.18.7	give her that much torment and grief.
REV.18.7	For she says in her heart,
REV.18.7	“I sit as a queen;
REV.18.7	I am not a widow,
REV.18.7	and I will never see grief.”
REV.18.8	For this reason her plagues will come in just one day —
REV.18.8	death and grief and famine.
REV.18.8	She will be burned up with fire,
REV.18.8	because the Lord God who judges
REV.18.9	The kings of the earth who have committed sexual immorality and shared her sensual and excessive ways will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke from her burning. 
REV.18.10	They will stand far off in fear of her torment,
REV.18.10	Woe, woe, the great city,
REV.18.10	Babylon, the mighty city!
REV.18.10	For in a single hour
REV.18.10	your judgment has come.
REV.18.11	The merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo any longer —  
REV.18.12	cargo of gold, silver, jewels, and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet; all kinds of fragrant wood products; objects of ivory; objects of expensive wood, brass,
REV.18.13	cinnamon, spice,
REV.18.14	The fruit you craved has left you.
REV.18.14	All your splendid and glamorous things are gone;
REV.18.14	they will never find them again.
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, will stand far off in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning, 
REV.18.16	saying,
REV.18.16	Woe, woe, the great city,
REV.18.16	dressed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet,
REV.18.16	adorned with gold, jewels, and pearls;
REV.18.17	for in a single hour
REV.18.17	such fabulous wealth was destroyed!
REV.18.17	And every shipmaster, seafarer, the sailors, and all who do business by sea, stood far off 
REV.18.18	as they watched the smoke from her burning and kept crying out: “Who was like the great city?” 
REV.18.19	They threw dust on their heads and kept crying out, weeping, and mourning,
REV.18.19	Woe, woe, the great city,
REV.18.19	where all those who have ships on the sea
REV.18.19	became rich from her wealth;
REV.18.19	for in a single hour she was destroyed.
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, heaven,
REV.18.20	and you saints, apostles, and prophets,
REV.18.20	because God has pronounced on her the judgment
REV.18.21	Then a mighty angel
REV.18.21	In this way, Babylon the great city
REV.18.21	will be thrown down violently
REV.18.21	and never be found again.
REV.18.22	The sound of harpists, musicians,
REV.18.22	flutists, and trumpeters
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again;
REV.18.22	no craftsman of any trade
REV.18.22	will ever be found in you again;
REV.18.22	the sound of a mill
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again;
REV.18.23	the light of a lamp
REV.18.23	will never shine in you again;
REV.18.23	and the voice of a groom and bride
REV.18.23	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.23	All this will happen
REV.18.23	because your merchants
REV.18.23	were the nobility of the earth,
REV.18.23	because all the nations were deceived
REV.18.23	by your sorcery.
REV.18.24	In her was found the blood of prophets and saints,
REV.18.24	and of all those slaughtered on the earth.
REV.19.1	After this I heard something like the loud voice of a vast multitude
REV.19.1	Hallelujah!
REV.19.1	Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God,
REV.19.2	because his judgments are true
REV.19.2	because he has judged the notorious prostitute
REV.19.2	who corrupted the earth with her sexual immorality;
REV.19.2	and he has avenged the blood of his servants
REV.19.2	that was on her hands.
REV.19.3	A second time they said,
REV.19.3	Hallelujah!
REV.19.3	Her smoke ascends forever and ever!
REV.19.4	Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God,
REV.19.4	Amen! Hallelujah!
REV.19.5	A voice came from the throne, saying,
REV.19.5	Praise our God,
REV.19.5	all his servants, and the ones who fear him,
REV.19.5	both small and great!
REV.19.6	Then I heard something like the voice of a vast multitude, like the sound of cascading waters,
REV.19.6	Hallelujah, because our Lord God, the Almighty,
REV.19.6	reigns!
REV.19.7	Let us be glad, rejoice, and give him glory,
REV.19.7	because the marriage of the Lamb has come,
REV.19.7	and his bride has prepared herself.
REV.19.8	She was given fine linen to wear, bright and pure.
REV.19.8	For the fine linen represents the righteous acts of the saints.
REV.19.9	Then he
REV.19.10	Then I fell at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, “Don’t do that!
REV.19.11	Then I saw heaven opened,
REV.19.12	His eyes were like a fiery flame,
REV.19.13	He wore a robe dipped in blood,
REV.19.14	The armies that were in heaven followed him on white horses, wearing pure white linen. 
REV.19.15	A sharp
REV.19.16	And he has a name written on his robe and on his thigh: K
REV.19.17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he called out in a loud voice, saying to all the birds flying high overhead, “Come, gather together for the great supper of God, 
REV.19.18	so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of military commanders, the flesh of the mighty, the flesh of horses and of their riders, and the flesh of everyone, both free and slave, small and great.”
REV.19.19	Then I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies
REV.19.20	But the beast was taken prisoner, and along with it the false prophet, who had performed the signs in its presence. He deceived those who accepted the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image with these signs.
REV.19.21	The rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds ate their fill of their flesh.
REV.20.1	Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven holding the key to the abyss
REV.20.2	He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent who is the devil and Satan,
REV.20.3	He threw him into the abyss, closed it, and put a seal on it
REV.20.4	Then I saw thrones, and people seated on them who were given authority to judge.
REV.20.5	The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were completed.
REV.20.5	This is the first resurrection. 
REV.20.6	Blessed
REV.20.7	When the thousand years are completed, Satan will be released from his prison 
REV.20.8	and will go out to deceive the nations
REV.20.9	They came up across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the encampment of the saints, the beloved city.
REV.20.10	The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet are,
REV.20.11	Then I saw a great white throne and one seated on it. Earth and heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them.
REV.20.12	I also saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened.
REV.20.13	Then the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades
REV.20.14	Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.
REV.20.15	And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth;
REV.21.2	I also saw the holy city,
REV.21.3	Then I heard a loud voice
REV.21.4	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes.
REV.21.5	Then the one seated on the throne said, “Look, I am making everything new.” He also said, “Write, because these words
REV.21.6	Then he said to me, “It is done!
REV.21.7	The one who conquers
REV.21.8	But the cowards, faithless,
REV.21.9	Then one of the seven angels, who had held the seven bowls filled with the seven last plagues,
REV.21.10	He then carried me away in the Spirit
REV.21.11	arrayed with God’s glory.
REV.21.12	The city had a massive high wall, with twelve gates. Twelve angels were at the gates; the names of the twelve tribes of Israel’s sons were inscribed on the gates. 
REV.21.13	There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
REV.21.14	The city wall had twelve foundations, and the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb were on the foundations.
REV.21.15	The one who spoke with me had a golden measuring rod
REV.21.16	The city is laid out in a square; its length and width are the same. He measured the city with the rod at 12,000 
REV.21.17	Then he measured its wall, 144 cubits according to human measurement, which the angel used. 
REV.21.18	The building material of its wall was jasper, and the city was pure gold clear as glass. 
REV.21.19	The foundations of the city wall were adorned with every kind of jewel:
REV.21.20	the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst. 
REV.21.21	The twelve gates are twelve pearls; each individual gate was made of a single pearl. The main street
REV.21.22	I did not see a temple in it, because the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. 
REV.21.23	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God illuminates it, and its lamp is the Lamb.
REV.21.24	The nations
REV.21.25	Its gates will never close by day because it will never be night there.
REV.21.26	They will bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
REV.21.27	Nothing unclean will ever enter it,
REV.22.1	Then he showed me the river
REV.22.2	down the middle of the city’s main street. The tree of life was on each side of the river, bearing twelve kinds of fruit, producing its fruit every month.
REV.22.3	and there will no longer be any curse.
REV.22.4	They will see his face,
REV.22.5	Night will be no more;
REV.22.6	Then he said to me, “These words are faithful
REV.22.8	I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had shown them to me. 
REV.22.9	But he said to me, “Don’t do that! I am a fellow servant with you, your brothers the prophets, and those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!” 
REV.22.10	Then he said to me, 
REV.22.17	Both the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” Let anyone who hears, say, “Come!” Let the one who is thirsty come. Let the one who desires take the water of life freely.
REV.22.18	I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book. 
REV.22.19	And if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share of the tree of life and the holy city, which are written about in this book.
REV.22.20	He who testifies about these things
REV.22.20	Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!
REV.22.21	The grace of the Lord Jesus
