GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
GEN.1.2	And the earth was without order, and empty; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
GEN.1.3	And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.
GEN.1.4	And God saw that the light was good, and God divided the light from the darkness.
GEN.1.5	And God called the light Day and the darkness he called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
GEN.1.6	And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
GEN.1.7	And God made a firmament and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so.
GEN.1.8	And God called the firmament Heavens. And the evening and the morning were the second day.
GEN.1.9	And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so.
GEN.1.10	And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters he called Seas; and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.11	And God said, Let the earth bring forth green grass, herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after its nature, whose seed is in itself upon the earth; and it was so.
GEN.1.12	And the earth brought forth green grass and herb yielding seed after its kind and the tree yielding fruit whose seed was in itself, according to its nature; and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.13	And the evening and the morning were the third day.
GEN.1.14	And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for appointed times and for days and years;
GEN.1.15	and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth; and it was so.
GEN.1.16	And God made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also.
GEN.1.17	And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth
GEN.1.18	and to rule over the day and over the night and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.19	And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	And God said, Let the waters bring forth great quantities of creatures with living souls and fowl that may fly above the earth upon the face of the firmament of the heavens.
GEN.1.21	And God created the great dragons and every living soul that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly after their nature, and every winged fowl after its nature; and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.22	And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.
GEN.1.23	And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living soul after its nature, beasts and serpents and animals of the earth after its nature; and it was so.
GEN.1.25	And God made the beast of the earth after its kind and cattle after their kind and every thing that moves upon the earth after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
GEN.1.26	And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the beasts and over all the earth and over every serpent that moves upon the earth.
GEN.1.27	So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
GEN.1.28	And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every beast that moves upon the earth.
GEN.1.29	And God said, Behold, I have given you every grass bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.
GEN.1.30	And to every beast of the earth and to every fowl of the air and to every thing that moves upon the earth, in which there is a living soul, I have given all green grass for food; and it was so.
GEN.1.31	And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
GEN.2.2	And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
GEN.2.3	And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because in it he had rested from all his work which God created in perfection.
GEN.2.4	These are the origins of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the 
GEN.2.5	and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and all the grass of the field before it grew, for the 
GEN.2.6	But there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground.
GEN.2.7	And the 
GEN.2.8	And the 
GEN.2.9	And out of the ground made the 
GEN.2.10	And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was divided into four heads.
GEN.2.11	The name of the first is Pison; that is it which compasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
GEN.2.12	and the gold of that land is good; there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
GEN.2.13	And the name of the second river is Gihon; this is the same that compasses the whole land of Ethiopia.
GEN.2.14	And the name of the third river is Hiddekel; this is that which goes toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
GEN.2.15	And the 
GEN.2.16	And the 
GEN.2.17	but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou dost eat of it thou shalt surely die.
GEN.2.18	And the 
GEN.2.19	And out of the ground the 
GEN.2.20	And the man gave names to every beast, and to the fowl of the heavens, and to every animal of the field; but for the man there was not found a help meet for him.
GEN.2.21	And the 
GEN.2.22	and the 
GEN.2.23	And the man said, This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman because she was taken out of Man.
GEN.2.24	Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh.
GEN.2.25	And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
GEN.3.1	Now the serpent was more astute than all the animals of the field which the 
GEN.3.2	And the woman answered unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;
GEN.3.3	but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it; neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
GEN.3.4	Then the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:
GEN.3.5	For God knows that in the day ye eat of it then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.
GEN.3.6	And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was desirable to the eyes, and a tree of covetousness to understand, she took of its fruit and ate and gave also unto her husband with her; and he ate.
GEN.3.7	And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves girdles.
GEN.3.8	And they heard the voice of the 
GEN.3.9	And the 
GEN.3.10	And he replied, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself.
GEN.3.11	And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee not to eat?
GEN.3.12	And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.
GEN.3.13	Then the 
GEN.3.14	And the 
GEN.3.15	and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed; that seed shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
GEN.3.16	Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth sons; and thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
GEN.3.17	And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed shall be the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life;
GEN.3.18	thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat the grass of the field;
GEN.3.19	in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread until thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken, for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
GEN.3.20	And the man called his wife’s name Eve because she was the mother of all living.
GEN.3.21	Then the 
GEN.3.22	And the 
GEN.3.23	therefore the 
GEN.3.24	So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life.
GEN.4.1	And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain and said, I have gained a man by the 
GEN.4.2	And she again bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a pastor of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.
GEN.4.3	And in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground a present unto the 
GEN.4.4	And Abel, he also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the 
GEN.4.5	but he did not look upon Cain and his present. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell.
GEN.4.6	Then the 
GEN.4.7	If thou doest good, it shall certainly be accepted; and if thou doest not good, sin lies at the door. And his desire shall be unto thee, but thou must rule over him.
GEN.4.8	And Cain talked with Abel his brother, and it came to pass when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and slew him.
GEN.4.9	And the 
GEN.4.10	And he said, What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother’s blood cries unto me from the ground.
GEN.4.11	And now thou art cursed from the earth, which has opened her mouth to receive thy brother’s blood from thy hand;
GEN.4.12	when thou tillest the ground, from now on it shall not yield unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.
GEN.4.13	And Cain said unto the 
GEN.4.14	Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth; and from thy face shall I hide; and I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to pass that anyone that finds me shall slay me.
GEN.4.15	And the 
GEN.4.16	And Cain went out from the presence of the 
GEN.4.17	And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.
GEN.4.18	And unto Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begat Mehujael, and Mehujael begat Methusael, and Methusael begat Lamech.
GEN.4.19	And Lamech took unto him two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.
GEN.4.20	And Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and of those who have cattle.
GEN.4.21	And his brother’s name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the harp and organ.
GEN.4.22	And Zillah also bore Tubalcain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and iron; and the sister of Tubalcain was Naamah.
GEN.4.23	And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech, for I shall slay a man for my wound and a young man for my hurt;
GEN.4.24	if Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy times seven.
GEN.4.25	And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth; for God, said she, has appointed me another seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.
GEN.4.26	And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos. Then men began to call upon the name of the 
GEN.5.1	This is the book of the descendants of Adam. In the day that God created man, he made him in the likeness of God;
GEN.5.2	male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name Man, in the day when they were created.
GEN.5.3	And Adam lived one hundred and thirty years and begat a son in his own likeness, after his image, and called his name Seth:
GEN.5.4	And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight hundred years, and he begat sons and daughters;
GEN.5.5	and all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty years, and he died.
GEN.5.6	And Seth lived one hundred and five years and begat Enos.
GEN.5.7	And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters;
GEN.5.8	and all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.
GEN.5.9	And Enos lived ninety years and begat Cainan,
GEN.5.10	and Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen years and begat sons and daughters;
GEN.5.11	and all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years, and he died.
GEN.5.12	And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel;
GEN.5.13	and Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and forty years and begat sons and daughters;
GEN.5.14	and all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years, and he died.
GEN.5.15	And Mahalaleel lived sixty-five years and begat Jared;
GEN.5.16	and Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters;
GEN.5.17	and all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety-five years and he died.
GEN.5.18	And Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years and he begat Enoch;
GEN.5.19	and Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years and begat sons and daughters;
GEN.5.20	and all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years, and he died.
GEN.5.21	And Enoch lived sixty-five years and begat Methuselah;
GEN.5.22	And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three hundred years and begat sons and daughters;
GEN.5.23	and all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.
GEN.5.24	And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him.
GEN.5.25	And Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, and begat Lamech;
GEN.5.26	and Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred eighty-two years and begat sons and daughters;
GEN.5.27	and all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years, and he died.
GEN.5.28	And Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years and begat a son;
GEN.5.29	and he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands because of the ground which the 
GEN.5.30	And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety-five years and begat sons and daughters;
GEN.5.31	and all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years, and he died.
GEN.5.32	And Noah was five hundred years old; and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and daughters were born unto them,
GEN.6.2	that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair, and they took for themselves wives of all whom they chose.
GEN.6.3	And the 
GEN.6.4	There were giants in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bore sons to them, the same became mighty men who were of old, men of renown.
GEN.6.5	And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
GEN.6.6	And the 
GEN.6.7	And the 
GEN.6.8	But Noah found grace in the eyes of the 
GEN.6.9	These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.
GEN.6.10	And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	The earth corrupted itself before God, and the earth filled itself with violence.
GEN.6.12	And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted its way upon the earth.
GEN.6.13	And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.
GEN.6.14	Make thee an ark of cedar trees; rooms shalt thou make in the ark and shalt reconcile it within and without covering it over with pitch. {Heb. ransom or atonement}
GEN.6.15	And this is the fashion of which thou shalt make it: The length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.
GEN.6.16	A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou make it.
GEN.6.17	And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the spirit of life, from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall die.
GEN.6.18	But with thee I will establish my covenant; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons’ wives with thee.
GEN.6.19	And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they shall be male and female.
GEN.6.20	Of fowls after their kind and of beasts after their kind, of every animal of the earth after its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.
GEN.6.21	And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee and for them.
GEN.6.22	Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did he.
GEN.7.1	And the 
GEN.7.2	Of every clean animal thou shalt take to thee seven pairs, the male and his female; but of animals that are not clean, two, the male and his female.
GEN.7.3	Of fowls also of the heavens by seven pairs, the male and the female; to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.
GEN.7.4	For yet in seven days, I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights; and every substance that I have made I will destroy from off the face of the earth.
GEN.7.5	And Noah did according unto all that the 
GEN.7.6	And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
GEN.7.7	And Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood.
GEN.7.8	Of clean animals and of animals that are not clean and of fowls and of every thing that moves upon the earth,
GEN.7.9	there went in two by two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female, as God had commanded Noah.
GEN.7.10	And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.
GEN.7.11	In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of the heavens were opened.
GEN.7.12	And there was rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	In that same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them entered into the ark,
GEN.7.14	they and every animal after its kind and all the beasts after their kind and every creeping thing that moves upon the earth after its kind and every fowl after its kind, every bird, every thing with wings.
GEN.7.15	And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two by two of all flesh in which is the spirit of life.
GEN.7.16	And those that went in went in male and female of all flesh, as God had commanded him, and the 
GEN.7.17	And the flood was forty days upon the earth, and the waters multiplied and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.
GEN.7.18	And the waters prevailed and multiplied greatly upon the earth, and the ark went upon the face of the waters.
GEN.7.19	And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high mountains that were under all the heavens were covered.
GEN.7.20	Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail, and the mountains were covered.
GEN.7.21	And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl and of beasts and of animals and of every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth and every man;
GEN.7.22	all in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life of all that was in the dry land died.
GEN.7.23	And every substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man and cattle and the animals and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed from the earth, and only Noah remained alive and those that were with him in the ark.
GEN.7.24	And the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days.
GEN.8.1	And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters ceased;
GEN.8.2	the fountains also of the deep and the windows of the heavens were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;
GEN.8.3	and the waters turned back and forth upon the earth, and after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were abated.
GEN.8.4	And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.
GEN.8.5	And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month; in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.
GEN.8.6	And it came to pass at the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made,
GEN.8.7	and he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth.
GEN.8.8	Also he sent forth a dove from him to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground,
GEN.8.9	but the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were still upon the face of the whole earth. Then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark.
GEN.8.10	And he waited yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark,
GEN.8.11	and the dove came in to him in the evening, and, behold, in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off, so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.
GEN.8.12	And he stayed yet other seven days and sent forth the dove, which returned not again unto him any more.
GEN.8.13	And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year of Noah, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth, and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.
GEN.8.14	And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dried.
GEN.8.15	And God spoke unto Noah, saying,
GEN.8.16	Go forth from the ark, thou and thy wife and thy sons, and thy sons’ wives with thee.
GEN.8.17	Bring forth with thee every animal that is with thee, of all flesh, both of fowl and of beasts and of every creeping thing that moves upon the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon the earth.
GEN.8.18	And Noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him;
GEN.8.19	all the animals, every creature and every fowl and whatever moves upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark.
GEN.8.20	And Noah built an altar unto the 
GEN.8.21	And the 
GEN.8.22	While the earth remains, seedtime and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease.
GEN.9.1	And God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth.
GEN.9.2	And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every animal of the earth and upon every fowl of the heavens, upon all that moves upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea; into your hand they are delivered.
GEN.9.3	Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; even as the green grass I have given you all things.
GEN.9.4	But flesh with the soul (or life) thereof, which is its blood, ye shall not eat.
GEN.9.5	For surely your blood which is your souls I will require; at the hand of every animal I will require it and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man’s brother I will require the soul (or life) of man.
GEN.9.6	Whoever sheds man’s blood in man, his blood shall be shed; for in the image of God is man made.
GEN.9.7	And you, be ye fruitful and multiply; bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein.
GEN.9.8	And God spoke unto Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
GEN.9.9	Behold that I establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you
GEN.9.10	and with every living soul that is with you, of the fowl, of the animals, and of every beast of the earth with you, from all that go out of the ark to every animal of the earth,
GEN.9.11	that I will establish my covenant with you, that all flesh shall not be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.
GEN.9.12	And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living soul that is with you, for perpetual ages:
GEN.9.13	I set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.
GEN.9.14	And it shall come to pass when I bring clouds over the earth, that the bow shall appear in the clouds;
GEN.9.15	and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you and every living soul of all flesh; and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.
GEN.9.16	And the bow shall be in the clouds, and I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living soul of all flesh that is upon the earth.
GEN.9.17	And God said unto Noah, This shall be the sign of the covenant, which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth.
GEN.9.18	And the sons of Noah, that went forth from the ark, were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan.
GEN.9.19	These are the three sons of Noah; and of them was the whole earth overspread.
GEN.9.20	And Noah began to till the ground, and he planted a vineyard;
GEN.9.21	and he drank of the wine and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
GEN.9.22	And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren outside.
GEN.9.23	Then Shem and Japheth took a garment and laid it upon both their shoulders and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they did not see their father’s nakedness.
GEN.9.24	And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
GEN.9.25	And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a slave of slaves shall he be unto his brethren.
GEN.9.26	And he said, Blessed be the 
GEN.9.27	God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his slave.
GEN.9.28	And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.
GEN.9.29	And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.
GEN.10.1	Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah: Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and unto them were born sons after the flood.
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth: Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.
GEN.10.3	And the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz and Riphath and Togarmah.
GEN.10.4	And the sons of Javan: Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim and Dodanim.
GEN.10.5	By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands, each one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.
GEN.10.6	And the sons of Ham: Cush and Mizraim and Phut and Canaan.
GEN.10.7	And the sons of Cush: Seba and Havilah and Sabtah and Raamah and Sabtecha. And the sons of Raamah: Sheba and Dedan.
GEN.10.8	And Cush begat Nimrod. He began to be powerful in the earth.
GEN.10.9	He was a powerful hunter before the 
GEN.10.10	And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh in the land of Shinar.
GEN.10.11	Out of that land went forth Asshur, who built Nineveh and the city Rehoboth and Calah
GEN.10.12	and Resen between Nineveh and Calah; the same is a great city.
GEN.10.13	And Mizraim begat Ludim and Anamim and Lehabim and Naphtuhim
GEN.10.14	and Pathrusim and Casluhim (out of whom came the Philistines) and Caphtorim.
GEN.10.15	And Canaan begat Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth
GEN.10.16	and Jebusite and Amorite and Girgasite
GEN.10.17	and Hivite and Arkite and Sinite
GEN.10.18	and Arvadite and Zemarite and Hamathite; and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.
GEN.10.19	And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar unto Gaza, as thou goest, unto Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.
GEN.10.20	These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.
GEN.10.21	Unto Shem also, the father of all the sons of Eber, the elder brother of Japheth, even to him were sons born.
GEN.10.22	The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
GEN.10.23	And the sons of Aram: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
GEN.10.24	And Arphaxad begat Salah, and Salah begat Eber.
GEN.10.25	And unto Eber were born two sons; the name of one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided; and his brother’s name was Joktan.
GEN.10.26	And Joktan begat Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan.
GEN.10.30	And their dwelling was from Mesha as thou goest unto Sephar, mount of the east.
GEN.10.31	These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.
GEN.10.32	These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their descendants, in their nations; and by these were the Gentiles divided in the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech.
GEN.11.2	And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
GEN.11.3	And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick and burn them thoroughly. And they had brick instead of stone and slime instead of mortar.
GEN.11.4	And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
GEN.11.5	And the 
GEN.11.6	And the 
GEN.11.7	Now, let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another’s speech.
GEN.11.8	So the 
GEN.11.9	Therefore the name of it was called Babel because there the 
GEN.11.10	These are the generations of Shem: Shem was one hundred years old and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:
GEN.11.11	And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.12	And Arphaxad lived thirty-five years and begat Salah;
GEN.11.13	and Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.14	And Salah lived thirty years and begat Eber;
GEN.11.15	and Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.16	And Eber lived thirty-four years and begat Peleg;
GEN.11.17	and Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	And Peleg lived thirty years and begat Reu;
GEN.11.19	and Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	And Reu lived thirty-two years and begat Serug;
GEN.11.21	and Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	And Serug lived thirty years and begat Nahor;
GEN.11.23	and Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	And Nahor lived twenty-nine years and begat Terah;
GEN.11.25	and Nahor lived after he begat Terah one hundred and nineteen years and begat sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	And Terah lived seventy years and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
GEN.11.27	Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
GEN.11.28	And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nature, in Ur of the Chaldees.
GEN.11.29	And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves; the name of Abram’s wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.
GEN.11.30	But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
GEN.11.31	And Terah took Abram, his son, and Lot, the son of Haran, his son’s son, and Sarai, his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife, and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran and dwelt there.
GEN.11.32	And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.
GEN.12.1	But the 
GEN.12.2	and I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing.
GEN.12.3	And I will bless those that bless thee and curse those that curse thee, and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.
GEN.12.4	So Abram departed, as the 
GEN.12.5	And Abram took Sarai, his wife, and Lot, his brother’s son, and all their substance that they had gathered and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.
GEN.12.6	And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.
GEN.12.7	And the 
GEN.12.8	And he went from there unto a mountain on the east of Bethel and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west and Hai on the east; and there he built an altar unto the 
GEN.12.9	And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the Negev (south desert).
GEN.12.10	And there was a famine in the land, and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there, for the famine was grievous in the land.
GEN.12.11	And it came to pass when he was come near to enter into Egypt that he said unto Sarai, his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon;
GEN.12.12	therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee that they shall say, This is his wife, and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.
GEN.12.13	Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.
GEN.12.14	And it came to pass that when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.
GEN.12.15	The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh, and the woman was taken into Pharaoh’s house.
GEN.12.16	And he treated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and menslaves and maidslaves and she asses and camels.
GEN.12.17	But the 
GEN.12.18	And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me? Why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?
GEN.12.19	Why didst thou say, She is my sister? I might have taken her to me to wife; now, therefore, behold thy wife, take her, and go away.
GEN.12.20	Then Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they sent him away and his wife with all that he had.
GEN.13.1	Thus Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had and Lot with him into the Negev.
GEN.13.2	And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.
GEN.13.3	And he retraced his journeys from the side of the Negev even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai,
GEN.13.4	unto the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first: and there Abram called on the name of the 
GEN.13.5	And Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks and herds and tents.
GEN.13.6	And the land was not able to bear them that they might dwell together, for their substance was so great that they could not dwell together.
GEN.13.7	And there was a strife between the pastors of Abram’s cattle and the pastors of Lot’s cattle; and the Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the land.
GEN.13.8	Then Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee and between my pastors and thine, for we are brethren.
GEN.13.9	Is not the whole land before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me; if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will go to the left.
GEN.13.10	And Lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of the Jordan that it was well watered everywhere, before the 
GEN.13.11	Then Lot chose for himself all the plain of the Jordan, and Lot journeyed east; and they separated themselves the one from the other.
GEN.13.12	Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tents toward Sodom.
GEN.13.13	But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the 
GEN.13.14	And the 
GEN.13.15	for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it and to thy seed for ever.
GEN.13.16	And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth, so that if someone could number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered.
GEN.13.17	Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for I must give it unto thee.
GEN.13.18	Then Abram removed his tent and came and dwelt among the terebinth {or mighty} trees of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the 
GEN.14.1	And it came to pass in those days that Amraphel king of Shinar, Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of the Gentiles
GEN.14.2	made war against Bera king of Sodom and against Birsha king of Gomorrah and against Shinab king of Admah and against Shemeber king of Zeboiim and against the king of Bela, which is Zoar.
GEN.14.3	All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is the salt sea.
GEN.14.4	Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
GEN.14.5	And in the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the kings that were with him came and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim and the Zuzims in Ham and the Emims in Shaveh Kiriathaim
GEN.14.6	and the Horites in their Mount Seir unto the plain of Paran, which is by the wilderness.
GEN.14.7	And they returned and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and smote all the works of the Amalekites and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazezontamar.
GEN.14.8	And the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of Admah and the king of Zeboiim and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar) went out, and they joined battle with them in the vale of Siddim,
GEN.14.9	that is, against Chedorlaomer the king of Elam and Tidal king of the Gentiles and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar: four kings against five.
GEN.14.10	And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits, and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there; and those that remained fled to the mountain.
GEN.14.11	And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their provisions and went away.
GEN.14.12	And they also took Lot, Abram’s brother’s son, who dwelt in Sodom, and his goods and departed.
GEN.14.13	And one came that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew, who dwelt among the terebinth trees of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner; and these were confederate with Abram.
GEN.14.14	And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his tried and experienced servants, born in his own house, three hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.
GEN.14.15	And he and his slaves poured themselves out against them by night and smote them and pursued them unto Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.
GEN.14.16	And he recovered all the goods and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods and the women also and the people.
GEN.14.17	And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and of the kings that were with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the valley of the king.
GEN.14.18	Then Melchizedek, king of Salem, brought forth bread and wine, for he was the priest of the most high God.
GEN.14.19	And he blessed him and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of the heavens and of the earth;
GEN.14.20	and blessed be the most high God, who has delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And Abram gave him tithes of all.
GEN.14.21	Then the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons and take the goods to thyself.
GEN.14.22	And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up my hand unto the 
GEN.14.23	that I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet; I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou should say, I have made Abram rich,
GEN.14.24	except only that which the young men have eaten and the portion of the men who went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre, who shall take their portion.
GEN.15.1	After these things the word of the 
GEN.15.2	And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
GEN.15.3	And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed; and, behold, one born in my house is my heir.
GEN.15.4	And then the word of the 
GEN.15.5	And he brought him forth abroad and said, Look now toward the heavens and count the stars, if thou art able to number them. And he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
GEN.15.6	And he believed the 
GEN.15.7	And he said unto him, I am the 
GEN.15.8	And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
GEN.15.9	And he said unto him, Take me a heifer three years old and a she goat three years old and a ram three years old and a turtledove and a young pigeon.
GEN.15.10	And he took unto him all these and divided them in the midst and laid each piece one against another, but he did not divide the birds.
GEN.15.11	And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
GEN.15.12	And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, behold, a horror of great darkness fell upon him.
GEN.15.13	Then he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and shall serve them, and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
GEN.15.14	and also that nation, whom they shall serve, I will judge; and afterward shall they come out with great riches.
GEN.15.15	And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
GEN.15.16	But in the fourth generation they shall come here again; for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
GEN.15.17	And it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
GEN.15.18	In the same day the 
GEN.15.19	the Kenite and the Kenizzite and the Kadmonite
GEN.15.20	and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Rephaim
GEN.15.21	and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Girgashite and the Jebusite.
GEN.16.1	Now Sarai Abram’s wife bore him no children; and she had a handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.
GEN.16.2	And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the 
GEN.16.3	And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar, her maid the Egyptian, after Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife.
GEN.16.4	And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived; and when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.
GEN.16.5	Then Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee; I have given my maid into thy bosom, and when she saw that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes; the 
GEN.16.6	But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thy hand; do to her as it pleases thee. Then Sarai afflicted her, and she fled from her face.
GEN.16.7	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.8	And he said, Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where didst thou come from and where wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai.
GEN.16.9	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.10	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.11	And the angel of the 
GEN.16.12	And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man, and every man’s hand against him; and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brethren.
GEN.16.13	And she called the name of the 
GEN.16.14	Therefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; {well of the living one who sees me} behold, it is between Kadesh and Bered.
GEN.16.15	And Hagar bore Abram a son; and Abram called his son’s name, which Hagar bore, Ishmael.
GEN.16.16	And Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.
GEN.17.1	And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, the 
GEN.17.2	And I will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly.
GEN.17.3	And Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying,
GEN.17.4	Behold my covenant with thee: Thou shalt be a father of many Gentiles.
GEN.17.5	Neither shall thy name any longer be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham; for a father of many Gentiles have I made thee.
GEN.17.6	And I will multiply thee exceeding, and I will make Gentiles of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.
GEN.17.7	And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee.
GEN.17.8	And I will give unto thee and to thy seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting inheritance; and I will be their God.
GEN.17.9	And God said again unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant therefore, thou and thy seed after thee in their generations.
GEN.17.10	This shall be my covenant, which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee: Every male among you shall be circumcised.
GEN.17.11	And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and it shall be a token of the covenant between me and you.
GEN.17.12	And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male in your generations, he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger, who is not of thy seed.
GEN.17.13	He that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised; and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.
GEN.17.14	And the uncircumcised male whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has annulled my covenant.
GEN.17.15	And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.
GEN.17.16	And I will bless her and give thee a son also of her; yea, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of Gentiles; kings of peoples shall be of her.
GEN.17.17	Then Abraham fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him who is one hundred years old? and shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear?
GEN.17.18	And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before thee!
GEN.17.19	And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed, and thou shalt call his name Isaac (laughter); and I will confirm my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him.
GEN.17.20	And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I shall bless him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly; he shall beget twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.
GEN.17.21	But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.
GEN.17.22	And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham.
GEN.17.23	Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all the servants born in his house and all that were bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in that same day as God had said unto him.
GEN.17.24	And Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
GEN.17.25	And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
GEN.17.26	In that same day Abraham was circumcised and Ishmael his son.
GEN.17.27	And all the men of his house, born in the house and bought with money from strangers, were circumcised with him.
GEN.18.1	And the 
GEN.18.2	and he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, three men stood by him; and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground
GEN.18.3	and said, My Lord, if now I have found grace in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy slave.
GEN.18.4	Let a little water, I pray you, be brought and wash your feet and rest yourselves under a tree;
GEN.18.5	and I will bring a morsel of bread and comfort your hearts; after that ye shall pass on because for this ye are come to your slave. And they said, So do as thou hast said.
GEN.18.6	And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make bread baked under the ashes.
GEN.18.7	And Abraham ran unto the herd and brought a calf tender and good and gave it unto a young man; and he hastened to dress it.
GEN.18.8	And he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they ate.
GEN.18.9	And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Here, in the tent.
GEN.18.10	Then he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, behold, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.
GEN.18.11	Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age, and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.
GEN.18.12	Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?
GEN.18.13	Then the 
GEN.18.14	Is any thing too hard for the 
GEN.18.15	Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, No, but thou didst laugh.
GEN.18.16	And the men rose up from there and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.
GEN.18.17	And the 
GEN.18.18	seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and that all the Gentiles of the earth shall be blessed in him?
GEN.18.19	For I know him, that he will command his sons and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the 
GEN.18.20	And the 
GEN.18.21	I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.
GEN.18.22	And the men turned their faces from there and went toward Sodom; but Abraham stood yet before the 
GEN.18.23	And Abraham drew near and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?
GEN.18.24	Peradventure there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are in it?
GEN.18.25	That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be treated as the wicked that are far from thee. Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?
GEN.18.26	And the 
GEN.18.27	And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, who am but dust and ashes;
GEN.18.28	peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said, If I find there forty-five, I will not destroy it.
GEN.18.29	And he spoke unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for forty’s sake.
GEN.18.30	And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord now be angry if I shall speak; peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he said, I will not do it if I find thirty there.
GEN.18.31	And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord; peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty’s sake.
GEN.18.32	And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once; peradventure ten shall be found there. And he said, I will not destroy it for ten’s sake.
GEN.18.33	And the 
GEN.19.1	And the two angels came to Sodom at evening; and Lot sat in the gate of Sodom, and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them, and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground,
GEN.19.2	and he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your slave’s house and tarry all night and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways. And they said, No, but we will abide in the street all night.
GEN.19.3	And he pressed upon them greatly, and they turned in unto him and entered into his house, and he made them a banquet and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.
GEN.19.4	But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter;
GEN.19.5	and they called unto Lot and said unto him, Where are the men who came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us that we may know them.
GEN.19.6	And Lot went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him
GEN.19.7	and said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.
GEN.19.8	Behold now, I have two daughters who have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you and do ye to them as is good in your eyes; only unto these men do nothing, for they have come under the shadow of my roof.
GEN.19.9	And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This fellow came in to sojourn and is he to lift himself up as judge? Now will we deal worse with thee than with them. And they did great violence to the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.
GEN.19.10	Then the men put forth their hand and pulled Lot into the house with them and shut the door.
GEN.19.11	And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door.
GEN.19.12	And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou anyone else here? Sons-in-law and thy sons and thy daughters and whatever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place;
GEN.19.13	For we will destroy this place because the cry of them is waxed great before the face of the 
GEN.19.14	And Lot went out and spoke unto his sons-in-law, those who were to marry his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the 
GEN.19.15	And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot, saying, Arise, take thy wife and thy two daughters who are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.
GEN.19.16	And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters, the 
GEN.19.17	And it came to pass as they brought them forth outside, that he said, Escape; for thy soul, do not look behind thee, neither stop thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed.
GEN.19.18	And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my lords;
GEN.19.19	behold now, thy slave has found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast showed unto me in saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die.
GEN.19.20	Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one; Oh, let me escape there, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live.
GEN.19.21	And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also that I will not overthrow the city for which thou hast spoken.
GEN.19.22	Make thee haste, escape there; for I cannot do anything until thou hast arrived there. Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.
GEN.19.23	The sun was rising upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.
GEN.19.24	Then the 
GEN.19.25	and he overthrew those cities and all that plain, with all the inhabitants of those cities, and the fruit of the ground.
GEN.19.26	Then the wife of Lot looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	And Abraham rose up early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the 
GEN.19.28	And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the land of that plain and beheld that the smoke of the land went up as the smoke of a furnace.
GEN.19.29	And it came to pass as God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent Lot out of the midst of the destruction when he overthrew the cities in the which Lot dwelt.
GEN.19.30	But Lot went up out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar; and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.
GEN.19.31	Then the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man left in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth.
GEN.19.32	Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him that we may preserve the generation of our father.
GEN.19.33	And they made their father drink wine that night; and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
GEN.19.34	And it came to pass on the next day that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay last night with my father; let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in and lie with him that we may preserve the generation of our father.
GEN.19.35	And they made their father drink wine that night also, and the younger arose and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.
GEN.19.36	Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father.
GEN.19.37	And the firstborn bore a son and called his name Moab; the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.
GEN.19.38	And the younger, she also bore a son and called his name Benammi; the same is the father of the sons of Ammon unto this day.
GEN.20.1	And Abraham journeyed from there toward the land of the Negev and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur and sojourned in Gerar.
GEN.20.2	And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. And Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah.
GEN.20.3	But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night and said to him, Behold, thou art a dead man, for the woman whom thou hast taken, for she is a man’s wife.
GEN.20.4	But Abimelech had not come near her, and he said, Lord, wilt thou slay also a righteous person?
GEN.20.5	Did he not say unto me, She is my sister? And she, even she herself said, He is my brother; in the simplicity of my heart and cleanness of my hands I have done this.
GEN.20.6	And God said unto him in a dream, Yes, I know that thou didst this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee from sinning against me; therefore I did not allow thee to touch her.
GEN.20.7	Now therefore restore the man his wife, for he is a prophet, and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live. And if thou restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou and all that are thine.
GEN.20.8	Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning and called all his slaves and told all these things in their ears; and the men feared greatly.
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us and in what have I sinned against thee that thou hast brought on me and on my kingdom such a great sin? Thou hast done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.
GEN.20.10	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What didst thou see that thou hast done this thing?
GEN.20.11	And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife’s sake.
GEN.20.12	And yet indeed, she is also my sister; she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.
GEN.20.13	And it came to pass when God caused me to wander from my father’s house that I said unto her, This is the mercy which thou shalt show unto me: at every place where we shall come, say of me, He is my brother.
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and menslaves and womenslaves and gave them unto Abraham and restored him Sarah his wife.
GEN.20.15	And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee; dwell where it pleases thee.
GEN.20.16	And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver; behold, he is to thee a covering of the eyes, unto all that were with thee and with everyone: thus she was reproved.
GEN.20.17	So Abraham prayed unto God; and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maidservants; and they bore children.
GEN.20.18	For the 
GEN.21.1	And the 
GEN.21.2	For Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him.
GEN.21.3	And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him, whom Sarah bore to him, Isaac.
GEN.21.4	And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old as God had commanded him.
GEN.21.5	And Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him.
GEN.21.6	Then Sarah said, God has made me to laugh so that all that hear will laugh with me.
GEN.21.7	And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? For I have born him a son in his old age.
GEN.21.8	And the child grew and was weaned, and Abraham made a great banquet the day that Isaac was weaned.
GEN.21.9	And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had born unto Abraham, mocking.
GEN.21.10	Therefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son; for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son, even with Isaac.
GEN.21.11	And the thing was very grievous in Abraham’s sight because of his son.
GEN.21.12	Then God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman; in all that Sarah has said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called.
GEN.21.13	And also of the son of the bondwoman I will make a nation because he is thy seed.
GEN.21.14	So Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder, and the child and sent her away; and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.
GEN.21.15	And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child under a tree.
GEN.21.16	And she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as it were a bowshot; for she said, Let me not see the death of the child. And she sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept.
GEN.21.17	And God heard the voice of the lad, and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her, What ails thee, Hagar? Fear not, for God has heard the voice of the lad where he is.
GEN.21.18	Arise, lift up the lad and hold him in thy hand, for I will make him a great nation.
GEN.21.19	And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad drink.
GEN.21.20	And God was with the lad, and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer.
GEN.21.21	And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took a wife for him out of the land of Egypt.
GEN.21.22	And it came to pass at that time that Abimelech and Phichol, the prince of his host, spoke unto Abraham, saying, God is with thee in all that thou doest.
GEN.21.23	Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son’s son; but according to the mercy that I have done unto thee, thou shalt do unto me and to the land in which thou hast sojourned.
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, I will swear.
GEN.21.25	And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water which Abimelech’s slaves had violently taken away.
GEN.21.26	And Abimelech said, I know not who has done this thing; neither didst thou tell me, neither have I heard of it, but today.
GEN.21.27	And Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them unto Abimelech; and both of them made a covenant.
GEN.21.28	And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.
GEN.21.29	And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe lambs which thou hast set by themselves?
GEN.21.30	And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my hand that they may be a witness unto me that I have dug this well.
GEN.21.31	Therefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they swore, both of them.
GEN.21.32	Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba; then Abimelech rose up and Phichol, the prince of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines.
GEN.21.33	And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba and called there on the name of the 
GEN.21.34	And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines’ land many days.
GEN.22.1	And it came to pass after these things that God proved Abraham and said unto him, Abraham; and he said, Behold, here I am.
GEN.22.2	And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou dost love, and go to the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
GEN.22.3	And Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son, and cut the wood for the burnt offering and rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him.
GEN.22.4	Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off.
GEN.22.5	And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide here with the ass, and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you.
GEN.22.6	And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac, his son; and he took the fire in his hand and the knife; and they both went together.
GEN.22.7	Then Isaac spoke unto Abraham his father and said, My father; and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?
GEN.22.8	And Abraham answered, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering, so they both went together.
GEN.22.9	And when they came to the place which God had told him of, Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood.
GEN.22.10	And Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son.
GEN.22.11	Then the angel of the 
GEN.22.12	And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto him; for now I know that thou doest fear God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.
GEN.22.13	And Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and beheld behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns; and Abraham went and took the ram and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son.
GEN.22.14	And Abraham called the name of that place The 
GEN.22.15	And the angel of the 
GEN.22.16	and said, By myself I have sworn, said the 
GEN.22.17	that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies;
GEN.22.18	and in thy seed shall all the Gentiles of the earth be blessed because thou hast hearkened unto my voice.
GEN.22.19	So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.
GEN.22.20	And it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she has also born sons unto thy brother Nahor;
GEN.22.21	Huz, his firstborn, and Buz, his brother, and Kemuel, the father of Aram
GEN.22.22	and Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.
GEN.22.23	And Bethuel begat Rebekah. Milcah gave birth to these eight unto Nahor, Abraham’s brother.
GEN.22.24	And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, also gave birth to Tebah and Gaham and Thahash and Maachah.
GEN.23.1	And Sarah was one hundred and twenty-seven years old; these were the years of the life of Sarah.
GEN.23.2	And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan; and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
GEN.23.3	And Abraham stood up from before his dead and spoke unto the sons of Heth, saying,
GEN.23.4	I am a stranger and a sojourner with you; give me a possession of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight.
GEN.23.5	And the sons of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,
GEN.23.6	Hear us, my lord; thou art a prince of God among us; in the best of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre so that thou may bury thy dead.
GEN.23.7	And Abraham stood up and bowed himself to the people of the land, even to the sons of Heth.
GEN.23.8	And he communed with them, saying, If it is your desire that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me and intercede for me to Ephron, the son of Zohar,
GEN.23.9	that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it to me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you.
GEN.23.10	This Ephron dwelt among the sons of Heth; and Ephron, the Hittite, answered Abraham in the audience of the sons of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying,
GEN.23.11	No, my lord, hear me; I give thee the field, and the cave that is therein, I give it to thee; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to thee; bury thy dead.
GEN.23.12	And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.
GEN.23.13	And he spoke unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me; I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I will bury my dead there.
GEN.23.14	And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,
GEN.23.15	My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between me and thee? bury therefore thy dead.
GEN.23.16	Then Abraham hearkened unto Ephron, and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.
GEN.23.17	And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field that were in all the borders round about were made sure
GEN.23.18	unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the sons of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.
GEN.23.19	And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre; the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.
GEN.23.20	And the field and the cave that is therein were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.
GEN.24.1	And Abraham was old and well stricken in age, and the 
GEN.24.2	And Abraham said unto his eldest slave of his house, who ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh,
GEN.24.3	and I will make thee swear by the 
GEN.24.4	but thou shalt go unto my country and to my kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac.
GEN.24.5	And the slave said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land, must I therefore bring thy son again unto the land from which thou didst come?
GEN.24.6	And Abraham said unto him, Beware that thou not bring my son there again.
GEN.24.7	The 
GEN.24.8	And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be free from this my oath; only do not bring my son there again.
GEN.24.9	Then the slave put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning that matter.
GEN.24.10	And the slave took ten camels of the camels of his master and departed with the best of what his master had in his hand; and he arose and went to Aram-naharaim, unto the city of Nahor.
GEN.24.11	And he made his camels kneel down outside the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water.
GEN.24.12	And he said, O 
GEN.24.13	Behold, I stand here by the fountain of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come out for water:
GEN.24.14	And let it come to pass that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels to drink also; let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy slave Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shown mercy unto my master.
GEN.24.15	And it came to pass before he had done speaking that, behold, Rebekah came out (who was born to Bethuel, son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham’s brother) with her pitcher upon her shoulder.
GEN.24.16	And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, whom no man had known; and she went down to the fountain and filled her pitcher and was coming back up.
GEN.24.17	Then the slave ran to meet her and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.
GEN.24.18	And she said, Drink, my lord, and she hastened to let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him drink.
GEN.24.19	And when she had finished giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also until they have finished drinking.
GEN.24.20	And she hastened and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water and drew for all his camels.
GEN.24.21	And the man marveled at her in silence, to see whether the 
GEN.24.22	And it came to pass as the camels had finished drinking that the man took a golden pendant of half a shekel weight and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold
GEN.24.23	and said, Whose daughter art thou? Tell me, I pray thee; is there room in thy father’s house for us to lodge in?
GEN.24.24	And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, whom she gave birth unto Nahor.
GEN.24.25	She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and fodder enough and room to lodge in.
GEN.24.26	Then the man bowed down his head and worshipped the 
GEN.24.27	And he said, Blessed be the 
GEN.24.28	And the damsel ran and told those of her mother’s house these things.
GEN.24.29	And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban; and Laban ran out unto the man to the fountain.
GEN.24.30	And it came to pass when he saw the pendant and the bracelets upon his sister’s hands, she said, Thus spoke the man unto me; then he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the fountain.
GEN.24.31	And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the 
GEN.24.32	Then the man came into the house, and Laban ungirded his camels and gave straw and fodder for the camels and water to wash his feet and the men’s feet that were with him.
GEN.24.33	And they set food before him to eat, but he said, I will not eat until I have told my errand. And he said unto him, Speak on.
GEN.24.34	And he said, I am Abraham’s slave.
GEN.24.35	And the 
GEN.24.36	And Sarah, my master’s wife, bore a son to my master when she was old, unto whom he has given all that he has.
GEN.24.37	And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell;
GEN.24.38	but thou shalt go unto my father’s house and to my kindred and take from there a wife for my son.
GEN.24.39	And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me.
GEN.24.40	And he said unto me, The 
GEN.24.41	then shalt thou be free from this my oath, when thou hast come unto my lineage; and if they give her not unto thee, thou shalt be free from my oath.
GEN.24.42	And I came this day unto the fountain and said, O 
GEN.24.43	behold, I stand by the fountain of water; let it come to pass, therefore, that the virgin who comes forth to draw water unto whom I say, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink;
GEN.24.44	and if she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels, let the same be the woman whom the 
GEN.24.45	And before I had finished speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder, and she went down unto the fountain and drew water, and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee.
GEN.24.46	And she made haste and let down her pitcher from her shoulder and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also; so I drank, and she gave to drink unto the camels also.
GEN.24.47	And I asked her and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore unto him. Then I put the pendant over her nose and the bracelets upon her hands.
GEN.24.48	And I bowed down my head and worshipped the 
GEN.24.49	And now if ye will deal in mercy and truth with my master, tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand or to the left.
GEN.24.50	Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceeds from the 
GEN.24.51	Behold, Rebekah is before thee; take her and go and let her be thy master’s son’s wife, as the 
GEN.24.52	And it came to pass that when Abraham’s slave heard their words, he worshipped the 
GEN.24.53	And the slave brought forth vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and to her mother.
GEN.24.54	And they ate and drank, he and the men that were with him, and slept; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master.
GEN.24.55	Then her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.
GEN.24.56	And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the 
GEN.24.57	Then they said, We will call the damsel and enquire at her mouth.
GEN.24.58	And they called Rebekah and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go.
GEN.24.59	So they sent away Rebekah, their sister, and her nurse and Abraham’s slave and his men.
GEN.24.60	And they blessed Rebekah and said unto her, Thou art our sister; be thou the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let thy seed possess the gate of those who hate them.
GEN.24.61	And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels and followed the man; and the slave took Rebekah and went away.
GEN.24.62	And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the land of the Negev.
GEN.24.63	And Isaac had gone out to pray in the field at the evening hour; and he lifted up his eyes and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming.
GEN.24.64	And Rebekah also lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she lighted off the camel.
GEN.24.65	For she had asked the slave, What man is this that walks in the field to meet us? And the slave had said, This is my master; therefore she took a veil and covered herself.
GEN.24.66	Then the slave told Isaac all the things that he had done.
GEN.24.67	And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent and took Rebekah as his wife; and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.
GEN.25.1	Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
GEN.25.2	And she bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
GEN.25.3	And Jokshan begat Sheba and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.
GEN.25.4	And the sons of Midian: Ephah, Epher, Enoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah.
GEN.25.5	And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
GEN.25.6	But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
GEN.25.7	And these were the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he lived, one hundred seventy-five years.
GEN.25.8	Then Abraham expired and died in a good old age, an old man and full of years, and was gathered to his people.
GEN.25.9	And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is in front of Mamre;
GEN.25.10	the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth, there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
GEN.25.11	And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi. {Heb. the Living One who sees me}
GEN.25.12	Now these are the generations of Ishmael, son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s handmaid, gave birth unto Abraham:
GEN.25.13	And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their lineages: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth, and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
GEN.25.15	Hadar, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
GEN.25.16	These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns and by their palaces; twelve princes according to their families.
GEN.25.17	And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, one hundred thirty-seven years; and Ishmael expired and died and was gathered unto his people.
GEN.25.18	And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria; and he fell in the presence of all his brethren.
GEN.25.19	And these are the generations of Isaac, son of Abraham. Abraham begat Isaac;
GEN.25.20	and Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel, the Aramean of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Aramean.
GEN.25.21	And Isaac prayed unto the 
GEN.25.22	And the sons struggled together within her; and she said, If this is so, why should I live? And she went to enquire of the 
GEN.25.23	And the 
GEN.25.24	And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
GEN.25.25	And the first came out red, all over like a hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
GEN.25.26	And afterwards his brother came out with Esau’s heel grasped in his hand; and his name was called Jacob. And Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.
GEN.25.27	And the boys grew, and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was an upright man, remaining in the tents.
GEN.25.28	And Isaac loved Esau because he ate of his venison; but Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	And Jacob boiled pottage; and Esau came from the field, and he was faint;
GEN.25.30	and Esau said to Jacob, Give me to eat, I pray thee, of that red pottage; for I am faint. Therefore was his name called Edom.
GEN.25.31	And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
GEN.25.32	And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die; and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
GEN.25.33	And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he swore unto him and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau of the bread and of the pottage of lentils; and he ate and drank, and rose up, and went away. Thus Esau despised his birthright.
GEN.26.1	And there was a famine in the land, in addition to the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech, king of the Philistines, unto Gerar.
GEN.26.2	And the 
GEN.26.3	abide in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these lands, and I will confirm the oath which I swore unto Abraham thy father;
GEN.26.4	and I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven and will give unto thy seed all these lands, and in thy seed shall all the Gentiles of the earth be blessed
GEN.26.5	because Abraham hearkened unto my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
GEN.26.6	Therefore Isaac dwelt in Gerar.
GEN.26.7	And the men of that place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister, for he feared to say, She is my wife, lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah because she was fair to look upon.
GEN.26.8	And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time that Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looking out a window, saw Isaac sporting with Rebekah, his wife.
GEN.26.9	And Abimelech called Isaac and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife; and how didst thou say, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die because of her.
GEN.26.10	And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? One of the people might easily have slept with thy wife, and thou should have brought the sin upon us.
GEN.26.11	Then Abimelech charged all the people, saying, He that touches this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
GEN.26.12	Then Isaac sowed in that land and received in the same year one hundred-fold, and the 
GEN.26.13	And the man waxed great and went forward and grew until he became very great,
GEN.26.14	for he had possession of flocks, possession of herds, great store of servants, and the Philistines envied him.
GEN.26.15	For all the wells which his father’s slaves had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them and filled them with earth.
GEN.26.16	And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us, for thou art become much mightier than we.
GEN.26.17	And Isaac departed from there and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar and dwelt there.
GEN.26.18	And Isaac reopened the wells of water, which they had opened in the days of Abraham his father, for the Philistines had stopped them up after the death of Abraham, and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
GEN.26.19	And Isaac’s slaves dug in the valley and found there a well of living waters.
GEN.26.20	And the pastors of Gerar strove with Isaac’s pastors, saying, The water is ours; therefore he called the name of the well Esek, because they strove with him.
GEN.26.21	And they opened another well and strove for that one also; and he called the name of it Sitnah.
GEN.26.22	And he left there and opened another well; and for that one they did not strive and he called the name of it Rehoboth, and he said, For now the 
GEN.26.23	And he went up from there unto Beersheba.
GEN.26.24	And the 
GEN.26.25	And he built an altar there and called upon the name of the 
GEN.26.26	Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar and Ahuzzath, one of his friends, and Phichol, the chief captain of his army.
GEN.26.27	And Isaac said unto them, Why come ye to me, seeing ye hate me and have sent me away from you?
GEN.26.28	And they said, We have seen certainly that the 
GEN.26.29	that thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee and as we have done unto thee nothing but good and have sent thee away in peace; thou art now the blessed of the 
GEN.26.30	And he made them a banquet, and they ate and drank.
GEN.26.31	And they rose up early in the morning and swore one to another; and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
GEN.26.32	And it came to pass the same day that Isaac’s slaves came and told him concerning the well which they had opened and said unto him, We have found water.
GEN.26.33	And he called it Shebah, therefore the name of the city is Beersheba unto this day.
GEN.26.34	And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith, the daughter of Beeri, the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon, the Hittite:
GEN.26.35	Who were bitterness of spirit unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	And it came to pass, that when Isaac became old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau, his eldest son, and said unto him, My son, and he said unto him, Behold, here am I.
GEN.27.2	And he said, Behold now, I am old: I know not the day of my death.
GEN.27.3	Now, therefore, take I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow and go out to the field and take me some venison
GEN.27.4	and make me savoury food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat, that my soul may bless thee before I die.
GEN.27.5	And Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau, his son. And Esau went to the field to hunt for venison and to bring it.
GEN.27.6	Then Rebekah spoke unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto Esau, thy brother, saying,
GEN.27.7	Bring me venison and make me savoury food that I may eat and bless thee before the 
GEN.27.8	Now, therefore, my son, hearken unto my voice according to that which I command thee.
GEN.27.9	Go now to the flock and bring me from there two good kids of the goats, and I will make them savoury food for thy father, such as he loves;
GEN.27.10	and thou shalt bring it to thy father that he may eat and that he may bless thee before his death.
GEN.27.11	And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau, my brother, is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man;
GEN.27.12	my father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon myself, and not a blessing.
GEN.27.13	And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son; only obey my voice and go bring me them.
GEN.27.14	And he went and took them and brought them to his mother, and his mother made savoury food, such as his father loved.
GEN.27.15	And Rebekah took good clothes of her eldest son Esau, which were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob, her younger son:
GEN.27.16	And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands and upon the smooth of his neck,
GEN.27.17	and she gave the savoury food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.
GEN.27.18	And he came unto his father and said, My father, and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son?
GEN.27.19	And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau, thy firstborn; I have done according as thou didst command me; arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.
GEN.27.20	Then Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the 
GEN.27.21	And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.
GEN.27.22	And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him and said, The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.
GEN.27.23	And he discerned him not because his hands were hairy, as his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him.
GEN.27.24	And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.
GEN.27.25	And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son’s venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.
GEN.27.26	And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now and kiss me, my son.
GEN.27.27	And he came near and kissed him, and he smelled the smell of his clothing and blessed him and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the 
GEN.27.28	Therefore let God give thee of the dew of heaven and of the fatness of the earth and plenty of wheat and new wine.
GEN.27.29	Let the peoples serve thee and nations bow down to thee; be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother’s sons bow down to thee; cursed be every one that curses thee, and blessed be he that blesses thee.
GEN.27.30	And it came to pass as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the presence of Isaac his father that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.
GEN.27.31	And he also had made savory food and brought it unto his father and said unto his father, Let my father arise and eat of his son’s venison that thy soul may bless me.
GEN.27.32	And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.
GEN.27.33	Then Isaac trembled very exceedingly and said, Who is he that has taken venison and brought it to me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest? I have blessed him and he shall be blessed.
GEN.27.34	And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father.
GEN.27.35	And he said, Thy brother came with deceit and has taken away thy blessing.
GEN.27.36	And he said, Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times; he took away my birthright, and, behold, now he has taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?
GEN.27.37	And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren I have given to him for slaves, and with wheat and new wine I have sustained him. What shall I do now unto thee, my son?
GEN.27.38	And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.
GEN.27.39	Then Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of the heavens from above,
GEN.27.40	and by thy sword shalt thou live and shalt serve thy brother; yet there shall be a time when thou shalt have dominion, and thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.
GEN.27.41	And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him, and Esau said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then I will slay my brother Jacob.
GEN.27.42	And these words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah; and she sent and called Jacob her younger son and said unto him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as concerning thee, does comfort himself, purposing to kill thee.
GEN.27.43	Now therefore, my son, hear my voice and arise; flee unto Laban, my brother, to Haran
GEN.27.44	and dwell with him a few days until thy brother’s fury turns away,
GEN.27.45	until thy brother’s anger turns away from thee, and he forgets that which thou hast done to him; then I will send, and bring thee from there; for why should I be deprived of you both in one day?
GEN.27.46	And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of Heth. If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters of Heth, such as these who are of the daughters of this land, why should I want to live?
GEN.28.1	Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.
GEN.28.2	Arise, go to Padanaram to the house of Bethuel, thy mother’s father, and take thee a wife from there of the daughters of Laban, thy mother’s brother.
GEN.28.3	And may God Almighty bless thee and make thee fruitful and multiply thee that thou may be a congregation of peoples
GEN.28.4	and give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee and to thy seed with thee; that thou may inherit the land in which thou art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.
GEN.28.5	Thus Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Padanaram unto Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s and Esau’s mother.
GEN.28.6	And Esau saw how Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Padanaram, to take a wife from there for himself, and that as he blessed him, he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob had hearkened unto his father and his mother and had gone to Padanaram;
GEN.28.8	and Esau, seeing that the daughters of Canaan did not please Isaac his father,
GEN.28.9	Esau went unto Ishmael and took unto the wives which he had, Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife.
GEN.28.10	And Jacob went out from Beersheba and went toward Haran.
GEN.28.11	And he found a certain place and slept there all night because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep.
GEN.28.12	And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it.
GEN.28.13	And, behold, the 
GEN.28.14	and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt multiply to the west and to the east and to the Aquilon and to the Negev; and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
GEN.28.15	And, behold, I am with thee and will keep thee in all places where thou goest and will bring thee again into this land; for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of.
GEN.28.16	And Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the 
GEN.28.17	And he was afraid and said, How dreadful is this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.
GEN.28.18	And Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil upon the top of it.
GEN.28.19	And he called the name of that place Bethel, since the name of that city was called Luz at first.
GEN.28.20	And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and clothing to put on
GEN.28.21	so that I come again to my father’s house in peace, then shall the 
GEN.28.22	and this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God’s house; and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth part unto thee.
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob walked on and came into the land of the people of the east.
GEN.29.2	And he looked and saw a well in the field, and, behold, there were three flocks of sheep lying by it, for out of that well they watered the flocks, and a great stone was upon the well’s mouth.
GEN.29.3	And all the flocks gathered there; and they would roll the stone from the well’s mouth and water the sheep and put the stone again upon the well’s mouth in its place.
GEN.29.4	And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, where are you from? And they said, We are from Haran.
GEN.29.5	And he said unto them, Do you know Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.
GEN.29.6	And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well, and, behold, Rachel, his daughter, comes with the sheep.
GEN.29.7	And he said, behold, it is yet high day; neither is it time that the livestock should be gathered together; water the sheep and go and feed them.
GEN.29.8	And they said, We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together and until they roll the stone from the well’s mouth, that we may water the sheep.
GEN.29.9	And while he yet spoke with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was the pastor.
GEN.29.10	And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother’s brother, that Jacob went near and rolled the stone from the well’s mouth and watered the flock of Laban, his mother’s brother.
GEN.29.11	And Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted up his voice and wept.
GEN.29.12	And Jacob told Rachel that he was of her father’s brethren, and that he was Rebekah’s son, and she ran and told her father.
GEN.29.13	And it came to pass when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister’s son that he ran to meet him and embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. And he told Laban all these things.
GEN.29.14	And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he abode with him the space of a month.
GEN.29.15	And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art of my brethren, should thou therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall thy wages be?
GEN.29.16	And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
GEN.29.17	Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well favoured.
GEN.29.18	And Jacob loved Rachel and said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel, thy younger daughter.
GEN.29.19	And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee than that I should give her to another man; abide with me.
GEN.29.20	And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed unto him but a few days, for the love he had to her.
GEN.29.21	And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled that I may go in unto her.
GEN.29.22	So Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a banquet.
GEN.29.23	And it came to pass in the evening that he took Leah, his daughter, and brought her to him, and he went in unto her.
GEN.29.24	And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah, his maid, for a handmaid.
GEN.29.25	And it came to pass that in the morning, behold, it was Leah; and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? Why then hast thou beguiled me?
GEN.29.26	And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country to give the younger before the firstborn.
GEN.29.27	Fulfil her week, and we will give thee the other also for another seven years of service which thou shalt serve with me.
GEN.29.28	And Jacob did so and fulfilled her week; and he gave him Rachel his daughter to wife also.
GEN.29.29	And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid, to be her maid.
GEN.29.30	And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah and served with him yet another seven years.
GEN.29.31	And when the 
GEN.29.32	And Leah conceived and gave birth to a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, Surely the 
GEN.29.33	And she conceived again and gave birth to a son; and said, Because the 
GEN.29.34	And she conceived again and gave birth to a son; and said, Now this time will my husband be joined unto me because I have born him three sons; therefore his name was called Levi.
GEN.29.35	And she conceived again and gave birth a son; and she said, Now I will praise the 
GEN.30.1	And when Rachel saw that she gave Jacob no children, Rachel envied her sister and said unto Jacob, Give me sons, or else I will die.
GEN.30.2	And Jacob’s anger was kindled against Rachel; and he said, Am I in God’s stead, who has withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?
GEN.30.3	And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her.
GEN.30.4	And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife; and Jacob went in unto her.
GEN.30.5	And Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a son unto Jacob.
GEN.30.6	And Rachel said, God has judged me, and has also heard my voice, and has given me a son. Therefore she called his name Dan.
GEN.30.7	And Bilhah Rachel’s maid conceived again and gave birth to a second son unto Jacob.
GEN.30.8	And Rachel said, With great wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed; and she called his name Naphtali.
GEN.30.9	When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing children, she took Zilpah, her maid and gave her Jacob to wife.
GEN.30.10	And Zilpah, Leah’s maid, gave birth to a son unto Jacob.
GEN.30.11	And Leah said, Good venture has come; and she called his name Gad.
GEN.30.12	And Zilpah, Leah’s maid, gave birth to a second son unto Jacob.
GEN.30.13	And Leah said, Blessed am I, for the daughters will call me blessed; and she called his name Asher.
GEN.30.14	And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest and found mandrakes in the field and brought them unto his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son’s mandrakes.
GEN.30.15	And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband and would thou take away my son’s mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son’s mandrakes.
GEN.30.16	And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son’s mandrakes. And he lay with her that night.
GEN.30.17	And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived and gave birth to a fifth son unto Jacob.
GEN.30.18	And Leah said, God has given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband; and she called his name Issachar.
GEN.30.19	And Leah conceived again and gave birth to the sixth son unto Jacob.
GEN.30.20	And Leah said, God has endued me with a good dowry; now my husband will dwell with me because I have born him six sons; and she called his name Zebulun.
GEN.30.21	And afterwards she gave birth to a daughter and called her name Dinah.
GEN.30.22	And God remembered Rachel and God hearkened to her and opened her womb.
GEN.30.23	And she conceived and gave birth to a son and said, God has taken away my reproach;
GEN.30.24	and she called his name Joseph, saying, Let the 
GEN.30.25	And it came to pass when Rachel had given birth to Joseph, that Jacob said unto Laban, Send me away, and I shall go unto my place and to my land.
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go, for thou knowest my service which I have done thee.
GEN.30.27	And Laban said unto him, Let me now find grace in thine eyes, I have learned by experience that the 
GEN.30.28	And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.
GEN.30.29	And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee and how many livestock thou hast with me.
GEN.30.30	For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude, and the 
GEN.30.31	And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me anything; if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.
GEN.30.32	I will pass through all thy flock today, setting apart all the speckled and spotted sheep, and all the brown rams among the rams, and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and of such shall be my hire.
GEN.30.33	So shall my righteousness answer for me tomorrow, when my hire shall come before thy face; each one that is not speckled and spotted among my goats and brown among my sheep shall be counted stolen with me.
GEN.30.34	And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word.
GEN.30.35	And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep and gave them into the hand of his sons.
GEN.30.36	And he set three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob fed the rest of Laban’s flocks.
GEN.30.37	And Jacob took rods of green poplar and of the almond and chestnut tree and peeled white strakes in them and made the white appear which was in the rods.
GEN.30.38	And he set the rods which he had peeled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink that they should conceive when they came to drink.
GEN.30.39	And the flocks conceived before the rods and brought forth ringstraked, speckled, and spotted sheep.
GEN.30.40	And Jacob separated the lambs, and put with his flock the ringstraked and all the brown in the flock of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves and did not put them together with Laban’s sheep.
GEN.30.41	And it came to pass, whenever the stronger sheep conceived, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the sheep in the gutters that they might conceive among the rods.
GEN.30.42	But when the sheep were feeble, he did not put them in; so the feebler were Laban’s, and the stronger Jacob’s.
GEN.30.43	And the man increased exceedingly, and had many sheep, and maidslaves and menslaves, and camels, and asses.
GEN.31.1	And he heard the words of the sons of Laban, saying, Jacob has taken away all that was our father’s; and of that which was our father’s, he has gotten all this glory.
GEN.31.2	And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was not toward him as before.
GEN.31.3	Also the 
GEN.31.4	And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto his sheep
GEN.31.5	and said unto them, I see your father’s countenance, that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father has been with me.
GEN.31.6	And ye know that with all my strength I have served your father.
GEN.31.7	And your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not allow him to hurt me.
GEN.31.8	If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the sheep bore speckled; and if he said thus, The ringstraked shall be thy hire; then all the sheep bore ringstraked.
GEN.31.9	Thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me.
GEN.31.10	And it came to pass at the time that the sheep conceived, that I lifted up my eyes and saw in dreams, and, behold, the rams which leaped upon the females were ringstraked, speckled, and grisled.
GEN.31.11	And the angel of God spoke unto me in dreams, saying, Jacob: And I said, Here am I.
GEN.31.12	And he said, Lift up now thine eyes and see, all the rams which leap upon the sheep are ringstraked, speckled, and grisled; for I have seen all that Laban has done unto thee.
GEN.31.13	I am the God of Bethel, where thou didst anoint the pillar and where thou didst vow a vow unto me. Now arise, go out from this land and return unto the land of thy nature.
GEN.31.14	And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house?
GEN.31.15	Are we not counted of him strangers? For he has sold us and has even devoured all our price.
GEN.31.16	For all the riches which God has taken from our father, is ours and our son’s; now then, whatever God has said unto thee, do.
GEN.31.17	Then Jacob rose up and set his sons and his wives upon the camels;
GEN.31.18	and he carried away all his livestock and all his goods which he had gotten, the livestock of his getting, which he had gotten in Padanaram, to return unto Isaac his father in the land of Canaan.
GEN.31.19	And Laban had gone to shear his sheep; and Rachel stole the idols of her father.
GEN.31.20	And Jacob stole away the heart of Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he fled.
GEN.31.21	So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up and passed the river and set his face toward Mount Gilead.
GEN.31.22	And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled.
GEN.31.23	Then he took his brethren with him and pursued after him seven days’ journey; and they overtook him in Mount Gilead.
GEN.31.24	And God came to Laban the Aramean in dreams by night, and said unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
GEN.31.25	Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the mount; and Laban with his brethren pitched in Mount Gilead.
GEN.31.26	And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast stolen away my heart and carried away my daughters as captives taken with the sword?
GEN.31.27	Why didst thou flee away secretly and steal away from me and didst not tell me that I might have sent thee away with mirth and with songs with tambourine and with harp?
GEN.31.28	And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters? Thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.
GEN.31.29	It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt, but the God of your father spoke unto me last night, saying, Take thou heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.
GEN.31.30	And now, that thou art leaving, because thy desire is after thy father’s house, yet why hast thou stolen my gods?
GEN.31.31	And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid; for I said, Peradventure thou would take by force thy daughters from me.
GEN.31.32	With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let them not live; before our brethren discern what is thine with me and take it to thee. For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.
GEN.31.33	And Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent, and into the two maidservants’ tents, but he did not find them. Then he went out of Leah’s tent and came to Rachel’s tent.
GEN.31.34	Now Rachel took the images and put them in a camel’s saddle and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent but did not find them.
GEN.31.35	And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon me. And he searched, but did not find the images.
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob was wroth and contended with Laban, and Jacob answered and said to Laban, What is my trespass? What is my sin that thou hast so hotly pursued after me?
GEN.31.37	Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found of all thy household stuff? Set it here before my brethren and thy brethren that they may judge between us both.
GEN.31.38	These twenty years I have been with thee; thy ewes and thy she goats have not aborted their young, and I have not eaten the rams of thy flock.
GEN.31.39	That which was torn of beasts I did not bring unto thee; I bore the sin; thou didst require of my hand that which was stolen, whether by day or by night.
GEN.31.40	By day the drought consumed me, and by night, the frost; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.
GEN.31.41	Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee fourteen years for thy two daughters and six years for thy flock; and thou hast changed my wages ten times.
GEN.31.42	If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear of Isaac, were not with me, surely thou would send me away now empty. God has seen my affliction and the work of my hands and rebuked thee last night.
GEN.31.43	And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my daughters, and these sons are my sons, and these sheep are my sheep, and all that thou seest is mine; and what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their sons unto whom they have given birth?
GEN.31.44	Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou, and let it be for a witness between me and thee.
GEN.31.45	Then Jacob took a stone and set it up for a pillar.
GEN.31.46	And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took stones and made a heap; and they ate there upon the heap.
GEN.31.47	And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.
GEN.31.48	And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;
GEN.31.49	and Mizpah; for he said, The 
GEN.31.50	If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God is witness between me and thee.
GEN.31.51	And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this pillar, which I have raised up between me and thee;
GEN.31.52	let this heap be witness and this pillar be witness that I will not pass over this heap against thee and that thou shalt not pass over this heap and this pillar against me, for harm.
GEN.31.53	The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their fathers, judge between us. And Jacob swore by the fear of his father Isaac.
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount and called his brethren to eat bread; and they ate bread and slept in the mount.
GEN.31.55	And early in the morning Laban rose up and kissed his sons and his daughters and blessed them; and Laban departed and returned unto his place.
GEN.32.1	And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.
GEN.32.2	And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God’s host; and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
GEN.32.4	And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my lord Esau: Thy slave Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with Laban and stayed there until now;
GEN.32.5	and I have oxen and asses, flocks, and menslaves, and womenslaves; and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find grace in thy sight.
GEN.32.6	And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy brother Esau, and also he comes to meet thee, and four hundred men with him.
GEN.32.7	Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed, and he divided the people that were with him, and the sheep and the cows and the camels, into two bands
GEN.32.8	and said, If Esau comes to the one company and smites it, then the other company which is left shall escape.
GEN.32.9	And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the 
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth which thou hast showed unto thy slave; for with my staff I passed over this Jordan and now I am become two bands.
GEN.32.11	Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him lest he come and smite me and the mother with the children.
GEN.32.12	And thou hast said, I will surely do thee good and make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.
GEN.32.13	And he lodged there that same night and took of that which came to his hand as a present for Esau his brother:
GEN.32.14	two hundred she goats and twenty he goats, two hundred sheep and twenty rams,
GEN.32.15	thirty milk camels with their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.
GEN.32.16	And he delivered them into the hand of his slaves, every drove by themselves and said unto his slaves, Pass before me and put a space between drove and drove.
GEN.32.17	And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau, my brother, meets thee and asks thee, saying, Whose art thou? And where goest thou? And for whom are these before thee?
GEN.32.18	Then thou shalt say, They are thy slave Jacob’s; it is a present sent unto my lord Esau; and, behold, also he is behind us.
GEN.32.19	And so commanded he the second and the third and all that followed those droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak unto Esau when ye find him.
GEN.32.20	And ye shall also say, Behold, thy slave Jacob is behind us. For he said, I will reconcile his wrath with the present that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he will accept me.
GEN.32.21	So the present went over before him, and he lodged that night in the company.
GEN.32.22	And he rose up that night and took his two wives and his two womenservants and his eleven sons and passed over the ford Jabbok.
GEN.32.23	And he took them and sent them over the brook and sent over all that he had.
GEN.32.24	And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.
GEN.32.25	And when the man saw that he did not prevail against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob’s thigh was disjointed as he wrestled with him.
GEN.32.26	And he said, Let me go, for the day breaks. And he said, I will not let thee go except thou bless me.
GEN.32.27	And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
GEN.32.28	And he said, Thy name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel; for thou hast fought with God and with men, and hast prevailed.
GEN.32.29	And Jacob asked him and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name. And he said, Why dost thou ask after my name? And he blessed him there.
GEN.32.30	And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel; for I have seen God face to face, and my soul was saved.
GEN.32.31	And as he passed over Penuel, the sun rose upon him, and he limped upon his thigh.
GEN.32.32	Therefore the sons of Israel do not eat of the sinew which shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day, because he touched the hollow of Jacob’s thigh in the sinew that shrank.
GEN.33.1	And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, Esau came and with him four hundred men. And he divided the children unto Leah and unto Rachel and unto the two handmaids.
GEN.33.2	And he put the handmaids and their children in front, and Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
GEN.33.3	And he passed over in front of them and bowed himself to the ground seven times until he came near to his brother.
GEN.33.4	And Esau ran to meet him and embraced him and fell on his neck and kissed him, and they wept.
GEN.33.5	And he lifted up his eyes and saw the women and the children and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children whom God hath graciously given thy slave.
GEN.33.6	Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and they bowed themselves.
GEN.33.7	And Leah also with her children came near and bowed themselves; and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they also bowed themselves.
GEN.33.8	And he said, What meanest thou by all these droves which I met? And he said, To find grace in the sight of my lord.
GEN.33.9	And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep what thou hast unto thyself.
GEN.33.10	And Jacob said, No, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in thy sight, then receive my present from my hand, that for this I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God; and do me the pleasure.
GEN.33.11	Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee because God has dealt graciously with me, and all that is here is mine. And he urged him, and he took it.
GEN.33.12	And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I will go before thee.
GEN.33.13	And he said unto him, My lord knows that the children are tender, and the sheep and cows with young are with me; and if men should overdrive them, in one day all the sheep will die.
GEN.33.14	Let my lord, I pray thee, pass before his slave; and I will lead on softly, according as the property that goes before me and the children are able to endure until I come unto my lord unto Seir.
GEN.33.15	And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk that are with me. And he said, What for? Let me find grace in the sight of my lord.
GEN.33.16	So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.
GEN.33.17	And Jacob journeyed to Succoth and built himself a house and made booths for his livestock; therefore the name of the place is called Succoth.
GEN.33.18	And Jacob came safe and sound to the city of Shechem, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram, and pitched his tent before the city.
GEN.33.19	And he bought part of the field where he had spread his tent, from the hand of the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for one hundred ewes.
GEN.33.20	And there he erected an altar, and called it Elelohe-Israel (the Strong God of Israel).
GEN.34.1	And Dinah, the daughter of Leah, which she gave birth unto Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
GEN.34.2	And when Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her and lay with her and defiled her.
GEN.34.3	And his soul was joined unto Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he fell in love with the damsel and spoke unto her heart.
GEN.34.4	And Shechem spoke unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this damsel to wife.
GEN.34.5	And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter; now his sons were with his cattle in the field, and Jacob remained silent until they were come.
GEN.34.6	And Hamor, the father of Shechem, went out unto Jacob to speak with him.
GEN.34.7	And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it; and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob’s daughter, a thing which ought not to be done.
GEN.34.8	And Hamor spoke with them, saying, The soul of my son Shechem is joined to your daughter; I pray you give her to him as wife.
GEN.34.9	And make ye marriages with us and give your daughters unto us and take our daughters unto you.
GEN.34.10	And ye shall dwell with us, and the land shall be before you; dwell and trade ye therein and take you possessions therein.
GEN.34.11	And Shechem also said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will give.
GEN.34.12	Ask me for as much dowry and gift as ye desire, and I will give according as ye shall say unto me; but give me the damsel to wife.
GEN.34.13	And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully and talked because he had defiled Dinah their sister:
GEN.34.14	And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our sister to one that is uncircumcised, for among us that is a reproach.
GEN.34.15	But with this condition we will consent unto you: If ye will become as we are that every male of you be circumcised,
GEN.34.16	then we will give our daughters unto you, and we will take your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will become one people.
GEN.34.17	But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter, and we will be gone.
GEN.34.18	And their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor’s son.
GEN.34.19	And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had delight in Jacob’s daughter and he was the most honourable of all the house of his father.
GEN.34.20	Then Hamor and Shechem, his son, came unto the gate of their city and communed with the men of their city, saying,
GEN.34.21	These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in the land and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give them our daughters.
GEN.34.22	Only with this condition will these men consent to dwell with us that we may be one people: if every male among us be circumcised as they are circumcised.
GEN.34.23	Shall not their livestock and their substance and every beast of theirs be ours? Only let us consent unto them, and they will dwell with us.
GEN.34.24	And unto Hamor and unto Shechem, his son, hearkened all that went out of the gate of his city; and every male was circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.
GEN.34.25	And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s brethren, took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males.
GEN.34.26	And they slew Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house, and went out.
GEN.34.27	The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister.
GEN.34.28	They took their sheep and their oxen and their asses and that which was in the city and that which was in the field
GEN.34.29	and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives they took captive and spoiled even all that was in the house.
GEN.34.30	And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites; and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.
GEN.34.31	And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with a harlot?
GEN.35.1	And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto God, who appeared unto thee when thou didst flee from the face of Esau, thy brother.
GEN.35.2	Then Jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him, Put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments:
GEN.35.3	And let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will make there an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress, and has been with me in the way which I have gone.
GEN.35.4	So they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their power and all their earrings which were in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.
GEN.35.5	And they journeyed, and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob.
GEN.35.6	And Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is, Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.
GEN.35.7	And there he built an altar and called the place Elbethel because there God had appeared unto him when he fled from the face of his brother.
GEN.35.8	Then Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died, and she was buried beneath Bethel under an oak, and the name of it was called Allonbachuth.
GEN.35.9	And God appeared unto Jacob again when he came out of Padanaram and blessed him.
GEN.35.10	And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob; thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name, and he called his name Israel.
GEN.35.11	And God said unto him, I am God Almighty; be fruitful and multiply, a nation and a company of nations (Gentiles) shall come out of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins;
GEN.35.12	and the land which I have given to Abraham and to Isaac, to thee will I give it and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.
GEN.35.13	And God went up from him in the place where he talked with him.
GEN.35.14	And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him, even a pillar of stone; and he poured a drink offering upon it, and he poured oil upon it.
GEN.35.15	And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him, Bethel.
GEN.35.16	And they journeyed from Bethel, and there was but a little way to come to Ephrath when Rachel travailed, and she had hard labour.
GEN.35.17	And it came to pass when she was in hard labour, that the midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son also.
GEN.35.18	And it came to pass as her soul was departing, (for she died) that she called his name Benoni, but his father called him Benjamin.
GEN.35.19	Thus Rachel died and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
GEN.35.20	And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave unto this day.
GEN.35.21	And Israel journeyed and spread his tent beyond the tower of Edar.
GEN.35.22	And it came to pass when Israel dwelt in that land, that Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, and Israel heard of it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:
GEN.35.23	The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
GEN.35.24	The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.35.25	And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s handmaid: Dan and Naphtali.
GEN.35.26	And the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s handmaid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Padanaram.
GEN.35.27	And Jacob came unto Isaac, his father, unto Mamre, unto the city of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.
GEN.35.28	And the days of Isaac were one hundred and eighty years.
GEN.35.29	And Isaac expired and died and was gathered unto his people, being old and full of days, and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.
GEN.36.2	Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon, the Hittite; Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite;
GEN.36.3	and Bashemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebajoth.
GEN.36.4	And Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz, and Bashemath bore Reuel,
GEN.36.5	and Aholibamah bore Jeush and Jaalam and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, who were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
GEN.36.6	And Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the persons of his house and his cattle and all his beasts and all his substance, which he had got in the land of Canaan, and went into another country from the face of his brother Jacob.
GEN.36.7	For their riches were more than that they might dwell together, and the land in which they were strangers could not bear them because of their livestock.
GEN.36.8	Thus dwelt Esau in Mount Seir; Esau is Edom.
GEN.36.9	And these are the lineages of Esau, the father of the Edomites in Mount Seir.
GEN.36.10	These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, the wife of Esau; Reuel, the son of Bashemath, the wife of Esau.
GEN.36.11	And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
GEN.36.12	And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau’s son, and she bore to Eliphaz Amalek: these are the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife.
GEN.36.13	And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah; these were the sons of Bashemath, Esau’s wife.
GEN.36.14	And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon, Esau’s wife: she gave birth unto Esau Jeush, Jaalam, and Korah.
GEN.36.15	These are dukes of the sons of Esau. The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn son of Esau: duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke Kenaz,
GEN.36.16	duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Adah.
GEN.36.17	And these are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son; duke Nahath, duke Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of Bashemath Esau’s wife.
GEN.36.18	And these are the sons of Aholibamah, Esau’s wife: duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah; these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife.
GEN.36.19	These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their dukes.
GEN.36.20	These are the sons of Seir, the Horite, who inhabited the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan; these are the dukes of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.
GEN.36.22	And the sons of Lotan were Hori and Hemam, and Lotan’s sister was Timna.
GEN.36.23	And the sons of Shobal were these: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
GEN.36.24	And these are the sons of Zibeon: both Ajah and Anah; this was that Anah that invented mules in the wilderness as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.
GEN.36.25	And the children {Heb. sons} of Anah were these: Dishon and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah.
GEN.36.26	And these are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran.
GEN.36.27	The sons of Ezer are these: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
GEN.36.28	The sons of Dishan are these: Uz and Aran.
GEN.36.29	These are the dukes that came of the Horites: duke Lotan, duke Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,
GEN.36.30	duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan; these are the dukes that came of Hori; by their dukedoms in the land of Seir.
GEN.36.31	And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the sons of Israel.
GEN.36.32	And Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah.
GEN.36.33	And Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah, reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.34	And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.35	And Husham died, and Hadad, the son of Bedad, who smote Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Avith.
GEN.36.36	And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.37	And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.38	And Saul died, and Baalhanan, the son of Achbor, reigned in his stead.
GEN.36.39	And Baalhanan, the son of Achbor, died, and Hadar reigned in his stead; and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife’s name was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
GEN.36.40	And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau, according to their families, after their places, by their names: duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,
GEN.36.41	duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,
GEN.36.42	duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,
GEN.36.43	duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these were the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations in the land of their possession. This is the Esau, the father of Edom.
GEN.37.1	And Jacob dwelt in the land in which his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
GEN.37.2	These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives; and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.
GEN.37.3	Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his other sons because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat of many colours.
GEN.37.4	And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him.
GEN.37.5	And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren; and they hated him yet the more.
GEN.37.6	And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
GEN.37.7	For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, behold, my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about and made obeisance to my sheaf.
GEN.37.8	And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? Or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words.
GEN.37.9	And he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brethren, saying, Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and, behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars made obeisance to me.
GEN.37.10	And he told it to his father and to his brethren; and his father reprehended him and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
GEN.37.11	And his brethren envied him; but his father kept the word.
GEN.37.12	And his brethren went to feed their father’s sheep in Shechem.
GEN.37.13	And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the sheep in Shechem? Come and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
GEN.37.14	And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it is well with thy brethren and well with the sheep and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
GEN.37.15	And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field; and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
GEN.37.16	And he said, I seek my brethren; tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
GEN.37.17	And the man said, They are departed from here; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren and found them in Dothan.
GEN.37.18	And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
GEN.37.19	And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer comes;
GEN.37.20	now therefore, come and let us slay him and cast him into a cistern, and we will say, Some evil beast has devoured him; and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
GEN.37.21	When Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands and said, Let us not kill him.
GEN.37.22	And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood but cast him into this cistern that is in the wilderness and lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again.
GEN.37.23	And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stripped Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
GEN.37.24	and they took him and cast him into the cistern; and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
GEN.37.25	And they sat down to eat bread; and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing aromas and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
GEN.37.26	Then Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?
GEN.37.27	Come and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
GEN.37.28	And when the Midianite merchantmen passed by, they took and lifted up Joseph out of the cistern and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver. And they brought Joseph into Egypt.
GEN.37.29	And Reuben returned unto the cistern; and, behold, Joseph was not inside, and he rent his clothes.
GEN.37.30	And he returned unto his brethren and said, The young man is not; and I, where shall I go?
GEN.37.31	Then they took Joseph’s coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood;
GEN.37.32	and they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father and said, We have found this, recognize now whether it is thy son’s coat or not.
GEN.37.33	And he knew it and said, It is my son’s coat; an evil beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
GEN.37.34	Then Jacob rent his clothes and put sackcloth upon his loins and mourned for his son many days.
GEN.37.35	And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted, and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
GEN.37.36	And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh’s and captain of the guard.
GEN.38.1	And it came to pass at that time that Judah went down from his brethren and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
GEN.38.2	And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah, and he took her and went in unto her.
GEN.38.3	And she conceived and gave birth to a son, and he called his name Er.
GEN.38.4	And she conceived again and gave birth to a son, and she called his name Onan.
GEN.38.5	And she yet again conceived and gave birth to a son and called his name Shelah. And he was at Chezib, when she gave birth to him.
GEN.38.6	And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was Tamar.
GEN.38.7	And Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the 
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother’s wife and marry her and raise up seed to thy brother.
GEN.38.9	And Onan knew that the seed would not be his, and it came to pass when he went in unto his brother’s wife, that he corrupted it on the ground, to not give seed to his brother.
GEN.38.10	And the thing which he did displeased the 
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, Remain a widow at thy father’s house until Shelah, my son, is grown; for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father’s house.
GEN.38.12	And many days passed and Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shuah, died; and Judah was comforted and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.
GEN.38.13	And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold, thy father-in-law goes up to Timnath to shear his sheep.
GEN.38.14	And she took off her widow’s garments and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself and sat by the gate to the waters by the way to Timnath, for she saw that Shelah was grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot because she had covered her face.
GEN.38.16	And he turned unto her by the way and said, Come now, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee (for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law). And she said, What wilt thou give me that thou may come in unto me?
GEN.38.17	And he said, I will send thee from the sheep a kid from the goats. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge until thou send it?
GEN.38.18	Then he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy signet and thy mantel and thy staff that is in thine hand. And he gave them to her, and came in unto her, and she conceived by him.
GEN.38.19	And she arose and went away and took off her veil and put on the garments of her widowhood.
GEN.38.20	And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend, the Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman’s hand; but he did not find her.
GEN.38.21	Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the cult prostitute of the waters by the way side? And they said, There was no cult prostitute in this place.
GEN.38.22	And he returned to Judah and said, I cannot find her; and also the men of the place said that there was no cult prostitute in this place.
GEN.38.23	And Judah said, Let her take the things for herself lest we be shamed; behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.
GEN.38.24	And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar, thy daughter-in-law, has played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth and let her be burnt.
GEN.38.25	When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, By the man whose these are, am I with child; and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet and mantel and staff.
GEN.38.26	Then Judah acknowledged them, and said, She has been more righteous than I because I did not give her to Shelah, my son. And he knew her again no more.
GEN.38.27	And it came to pass in the time of her travail that, behold, twins were in her womb.
GEN.38.28	And it came to pass when she travailed, that the one put out his hand, and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
GEN.38.29	And it came to pass as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out; and she said, Why hast thou brought this breach upon thee? Therefore his name was called Pharez.
GEN.38.30	And afterward his brother that had the scarlet thread upon his hand came out, and his name was called Zarah.
GEN.39.1	And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the hands of the Ishmeelites, who had brought him down there.
GEN.39.2	But the 
GEN.39.3	And his master saw that the 
GEN.39.4	So Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand.
GEN.39.5	And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had, that the 
GEN.39.6	And he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and with him knew of nothing more than of the bread which he ate. And Joseph was handsome and well favoured.
GEN.39.7	And it came to pass after these things, that his master’s wife cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.
GEN.39.8	But he refused and said unto his master’s wife, Behold, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand;
GEN.39.9	there is none greater in this house than I; neither has he kept back anything from me but thee because thou art his wife; how then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?
GEN.39.10	And it came to pass as she spoke to Joseph day by day, that he did not hearken unto her, to lie by her or to be with her.
GEN.39.11	And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the house to do his business, and none of those of the house were there within.
GEN.39.12	And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me; and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got outside.
GEN.39.13	And it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and had fled forth,
GEN.39.14	that she called unto those of her house and spoke unto them, saying, See, he has brought in a Hebrew unto us to mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice;
GEN.39.15	and it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left his garment with me and fled and left.
GEN.39.16	And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home.
GEN.39.17	And she spoke unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew slave, whom thou hast brought unto us, came in unto me to dishonour me;
GEN.39.18	and when I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me and fled out.
GEN.39.19	And it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife, which she spoke unto him, saying, After this manner did thy slave treat me, that his wrath was kindled.
GEN.39.20	And Joseph’s master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were bound; and he was there in the prison.
GEN.39.21	But the 
GEN.39.22	And the prince of the house of the prison committed to Joseph’s hand all the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatever they did there, he was the doer of it.
GEN.39.23	The prince of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the 
GEN.40.1	And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker had sinned against their lord, the king of Egypt.
GEN.40.2	And Pharaoh was angry against his two officers, against the chief of the butlers and against the chief of the bakers.
GEN.40.3	And he put them in prison in the house of the captain of the guard, into the house of the prison where Joseph was bound.
GEN.40.4	And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he served them; and they continued for days in prison.
GEN.40.5	And both of them dreamed a dream, each man his dream in the same night, each man according to the interpretation of his dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were bound in the prison.
GEN.40.6	And Joseph came in unto them in the morning and looked upon them, and, behold, they were sad.
GEN.40.7	And he asked Pharaoh’s officers that were with him in the prison of his lord’s house, saying, Why look ye so sad today?
GEN.40.8	And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell me the dreams, I pray you.
GEN.40.9	Then the chief butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me,
GEN.40.10	and in the vine were three branches, and it was as though it budded and her blossoms shot forth, and the clusters thereof brought forth ripe grapes;
GEN.40.11	and Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh’s cup, and I gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
GEN.40.12	And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it: The three branches are three days;
GEN.40.13	yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head and restore thee unto thy place, and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh’s cup into his hand after the former manner when thou wast his butler.
GEN.40.14	Therefore thou shalt think of me within thyself when it shall be well with thee, and show mercy, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto Pharaoh and bring me out of this house;
GEN.40.15	for indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; neither have I done anything here that they should put me into the prison.
GEN.40.16	When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head;
GEN.40.17	and in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of baked foods for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket upon my head.
GEN.40.18	Then Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation thereof: The three baskets are three days.
GEN.40.19	Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off thee and shall hang thee on a tree, and the birds shall eat thy flesh from off thee.
GEN.40.20	And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh’s birthday, that he made a banquet unto all his slaves, and he lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker among his slaves.
GEN.40.21	And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again, and he gave the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.
GEN.40.22	But he hanged the chief baker; as Joseph had interpreted to them.
GEN.40.23	Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph but forgot him.
GEN.41.1	And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
GEN.41.2	And, behold, there came up out of the river seven beautiful cows and very fat, and they fed in a meadow.
GEN.41.3	And, behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the river, ugly and lean-fleshed, and stood by the other cows upon the brink of the river.
GEN.41.4	And the ugly and lean-fleshed cows ate up the seven beautiful and fat cows. So Pharaoh awoke.
GEN.41.5	And he slept and dreamed the second time; and, behold, seven heads of wheat came up upon one stalk, full and beautiful.
GEN.41.6	And, behold, seven thin heads, blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
GEN.41.7	And the seven thin heads devoured the seven full and beautiful heads. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
GEN.41.8	And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled, and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all the wise men thereof; and Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
GEN.41.9	Then the chief butler spoke unto Pharaoh, saying, I remember my sins today;
GEN.41.10	Pharaoh was angry with his slaves and put me in the prison of the captain of the guard’s house, both me and the prince of the bakers.
GEN.41.11	And we both dreamed a dream in one night; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
GEN.41.12	And there was there with us a young man, a Hebrew, slave to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams to us; he interpreted to each man according to his dream.
GEN.41.13	And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto my office, and him he hanged.
GEN.41.14	Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and they cut his hair and changed his clothes, and he came in unto Pharaoh.
GEN.41.15	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one that can interpret it; but I have heard say of thee that thou canst hear dreams to interpret them.
GEN.41.16	And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me; God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
GEN.41.17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river;
GEN.41.18	and, behold, there came up out of the river seven cows, fat-fleshed and beautiful in appearance; and they fed in a meadow.
GEN.41.19	And, behold, seven other cows came up after them, lean and very ugly in appearance, and thin, such as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt for ugliness.
GEN.41.20	And the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows;
GEN.41.21	and when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ugly, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
GEN.41.22	And I also saw in my dream, and, behold, seven heads came up in one stalk, full and beautiful;
GEN.41.23	and, behold, seven heads, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them.
GEN.41.24	And the thin heads devoured the seven good heads; and I told this unto the magicians, but there was no one that could declare it to me.
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God has showed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
GEN.41.26	The seven beautiful cows are seven years; and the seven good heads are seven years; the dream is one and the same.
GEN.41.27	Also the seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty heads blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine.
GEN.41.28	This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh. What God is about to do he has shown unto Pharaoh.
GEN.41.29	Behold, seven years of great plenty are coming throughout all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.30	And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and the famine shall consume the land;
GEN.41.31	and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
GEN.41.32	And that the dream came unto Pharaoh twice, it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
GEN.41.33	Now therefore let Pharaoh find a discreet and wise man and set him over the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.34	Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
GEN.41.35	And let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up wheat under the hand of Pharaoh to feed the cities, and let them store it up.
GEN.41.36	And let that food be stored for the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; and the land shall not perish through the famine.
GEN.41.37	And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his slaves.
GEN.41.38	And Pharaoh said unto his slaves, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?
GEN.41.39	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God has showed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art.
GEN.41.40	Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled; only in the throne will I be greater than thou.
GEN.41.41	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.42	Then Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph’s hand and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck;
GEN.41.43	and he made him to ride in his second chariot; and they cried before him, Abrech Tender Father-honour this one as a precious father; and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.44	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee no one shall lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.45	And Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphnathpaaneah, and he gave him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.46	And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.47	And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls.
GEN.41.48	And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of Egypt and laid up the food in the cities, placing in each city the food of the field, which was round about.
GEN.41.49	And Joseph gathered wheat as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left off numbering; for it was without number.
GEN.41.50	And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came, which Asenath, the daughter of Potipherah, prince of On, bore unto him.
GEN.41.51	And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh; For God, said he, has made me forget all my toil and all my father’s house.
GEN.41.52	And the name of the second he called Ephraim, For God, said he, has caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.
GEN.41.53	And the seven years of the abundance that was in the land of Egypt were ended.
GEN.41.54	And the seven years of famine began to come, according as Joseph had said; and the famine was in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.
GEN.41.55	And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread. And Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.
GEN.41.56	And the famine was over all the face of the earth. Then Joseph opened all the storehouses and sold unto the Egyptians; for the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.57	And all the earth came into Egypt to buy from Joseph because the famine was so sore in all lands.
GEN.42.1	Now when Jacob saw that there was food in Egypt, Jacob said unto his sons, Why are ye looking upon one another?
GEN.42.2	And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is food in Egypt; go down there and buy for us from there that we may live, and not die.
GEN.42.3	And Joseph’s ten brethren went down to buy wheat in Egypt.
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with his brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure disaster befall him.
GEN.42.5	And the sons of Israel came to buy among those that came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.
GEN.42.6	And Joseph was the lord over the land, and he it was that sold the wheat to all the people of the land; and Joseph’s brethren came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth.
GEN.42.7	And when Joseph saw his brethren, he knew them, but made himself strange unto them and spoke roughly unto them; and he said unto them, Where have you come from? And they said, From the land of Canaan to buy food.
GEN.42.8	And Joseph knew his brethren but they did not know him.
GEN.42.9	Then Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them and said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
GEN.42.10	And they said unto him, No, my lord, but to buy food are thy slaves come.
GEN.42.11	We are all one man’s sons; we are men of the truth, thy slaves have never been spies.
GEN.42.12	And he said unto them, No, but to see the nakedness of the land ye are come.
GEN.42.13	And they said, Thy slaves are twelve brethren, the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is this day with our father, and one is not.
GEN.42.14	And Joseph said unto them, That is it that which I spoke unto you, saying, Ye are spies:
GEN.42.15	Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not go forth from here unless your youngest brother comes here.
GEN.42.16	Send one of you and let him bring your brother, and ye shall be kept in prison that your words may be proved, whether there is any truth in you; or else by the life of Pharaoh surely ye are spies.
GEN.42.17	And he put them all together into prison for three days.
GEN.42.18	And Joseph said unto them the third day, Do this and live, for I fear God.
GEN.42.19	If ye are men of the truth, let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison; go ye, carry food for the famine of your houses
GEN.42.20	but bring your youngest brother unto me, so shall your words be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.
GEN.42.21	And they said one to another, We are truly guilty concerning our brother in that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress come upon us.
GEN.42.22	Then Reuben answered them, saying, Did I not speak unto you, saying, Do not sin against the young man, and ye would not hear? Therefore, behold, his blood is also required.
GEN.42.23	And they did not know that Joseph understood them, for he spoke unto them by an interpreter.
GEN.42.24	And he turned himself about from them and wept and returned to them again and spoke with them and took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
GEN.42.25	Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with wheat and to restore each man’s money into his sack and to give them provisions for the way; and thus it was done unto them.
GEN.42.26	And they laded their asses with the wheat and departed from there.
GEN.42.27	And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass fodder in the inn, he saw his money; for, behold, it was in his sack’s mouth.
GEN.42.28	And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, behold, it is even in my sack. And their heart failed them, and they were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God has done unto us?
GEN.42.29	And they came unto Jacob, their father, unto the land of Canaan and told him all that had befallen them, saying,
GEN.42.30	The man, who is the lord of the land, spoke roughly to us and took us for spies of the country.
GEN.42.31	And we said unto him, We are men of the truth; we have never been spies.
GEN.42.32	We are twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.
GEN.42.33	And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby I shall know that ye are men of the truth; leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the famine of your households and go
GEN.42.34	and bring your youngest brother unto me; then I shall know that ye are not spies, but that ye are men of the truth; thus I will deliver you your brother, and ye shall trade in the land.
GEN.42.35	And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, each man’s bundle of money was in his sack; and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.
GEN.42.36	And Jacob, their father, said unto them, Ye have bereaved me of my sons: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away; all these things are upon me.
GEN.42.37	And Reuben spoke unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I do not bring him to thee; deliver him into my hand, and I will bring him to thee again.
GEN.42.38	And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left; if some disaster should befall him by the way in which ye go, then shall ye bring my gray hairs with sorrow down to Sheol.
GEN.43.1	And the famine was sore in the land.
GEN.43.2	And it came to pass when they had eaten up the wheat which they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food.
GEN.43.3	And Judah spoke unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.
GEN.43.4	If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food:
GEN.43.5	But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down; for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face unless your brother is with you.
GEN.43.6	And Israel said, Why did ye such evil unto me as to tell the man that ye had another brother?
GEN.43.7	And they said, The man asked us expressly of our state and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? Have ye another brother? And we told him according to the tenor of these words. Could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down?
GEN.43.8	Then Judah said unto Israel, his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go, that we may live, and not die, both we and thou and also our little ones.
GEN.43.9	I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him; if I do not bring him unto thee and set him before thee, then let me bear the sin for ever;
GEN.43.10	for if we had not lingered, surely by now we would have returned this second time.
GEN.43.11	Then their father Israel answered them, If it must be so now, do this: take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels and take the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, aromas, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds.
GEN.43.12	And take double money in your hands and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks; carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight.
GEN.43.13	Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man.
GEN.43.14	And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may let your other brother go, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved of my sons, I am bereaved.
GEN.43.15	Then the men took the present, and they took double money in their hand, and Benjamin, and rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
GEN.43.16	And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home and slay an animal and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon.
GEN.43.17	And the man did as Joseph bade, and the man brought the men into Joseph’s house.
GEN.43.18	And the men were afraid because they were brought into Joseph’s house, and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time we are brought in here that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us and take us for slaves and our asses.
GEN.43.19	And they came near to the steward of Joseph’s house, and they spoke with him at the door of the house
GEN.43.20	and said, my lord, we came indeed down the first time to buy food;
GEN.43.21	and it came to pass when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, each man’s money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; and we have brought it again in our hand.
GEN.43.22	And we brought down other money in our hands to buy food; we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.
GEN.43.23	And he said, Peace be to you, fear not; your God, and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks; I had your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.
GEN.43.24	And the man brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet, and he gave their asses fodder.
GEN.43.25	And they made ready the present waiting until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.
GEN.43.26	And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which they had in their hand in the house and bowed themselves to him to the earth.
GEN.43.27	And he asked them of their welfare and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spoke? Is he yet alive?
GEN.43.28	And they answered, Thy slave our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads and made obeisance.
GEN.43.29	And he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spoke unto me? And he said, God be merciful unto thee, my son.
GEN.43.30	Then Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother; and he sought where to weep, and he entered into his chamber and wept there.
GEN.43.31	And he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said, Serve bread.
GEN.43.32	And they served for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, who ate with him, by themselves; because the Egyptians may not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
GEN.43.33	And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men marvelled one at another.
GEN.43.34	And he took and sent portions unto them from before him; but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were drunk with him.
GEN.44.1	And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill these men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s money in his sack’s mouth;
GEN.44.2	and put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack’s mouth of the youngest, with the money of his wheat. And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.
GEN.44.3	As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.
GEN.44.4	And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Rise up, follow after those men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Why have ye rewarded evil for good?
GEN.44.5	Is this not the one in which my lord drinks and in which indeed he divines? Ye have done evil in so doing.
GEN.44.6	When he overtook them, he spoke unto them these same words.
GEN.44.7	And they said unto him, Why saith my lord these words? In no wise should thy slaves do according to this thing.
GEN.44.8	Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks’ mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan; how then should we steal out of thy lord’s house silver or gold?
GEN.44.9	With whoever of thy slaves it is found, both let him die and we also will be my lord’s bond slaves.
GEN.44.10	And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, and ye shall be blameless.
GEN.44.11	Then they made haste, and each one took his sack down to the ground, and each one opened his sack.
GEN.44.12	And he searched and began at the eldest and finished at the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack.
GEN.44.13	Then they rent their clothes, and each one laded his ass, and they returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph’s house, for he was yet there; and they fell before him on the ground.
GEN.44.15	And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done? Know ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?
GEN.44.16	Then Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? What shall we speak or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of thy slaves; behold, we are my lord’s slaves, both we and he also with whom the cup is found.
GEN.44.17	And he said, in no wise should I do so; but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my slave; and as for you, go up in peace unto your father.
GEN.44.18	Then Judah came near unto him and said, Oh my lord, let thy slave, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord’s ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy slave; for thou art even as Pharaoh.
GEN.44.19	My lord asked his slaves, saying, Have ye a father or a brother?
GEN.44.20	And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a young man of his old age, yet a lad; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loves him.
GEN.44.21	And thou didst say unto thy slaves, Bring him down unto me that I may set my eyes upon him.
GEN.44.22	And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father; for if he should leave his father, his father would die.
GEN.44.23	And thou didst say unto thy slaves, Unless your youngest brother comes down with you, ye shall see my face no more.
GEN.44.24	And it came to pass when we came up unto thy slave my father, we told him the words of my lord.
GEN.44.25	And our father said, Go again and buy us a little food.
GEN.44.26	And we said, We cannot go down; if our youngest brother is with us, then will we go down; for we may not see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.
GEN.44.27	Then thy slave my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bore me two sons;
GEN.44.28	and the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces, and I have not seen him since;
GEN.44.29	and if ye take this one also from me and some disaster should befall him, ye shall bring my gray hairs with sorrow down to Sheol.
GEN.44.30	Now therefore when I come to thy slave my father, and the lad is not with us, seeing that his soul is bound up in the lad’s soul,
GEN.44.31	it shall come to pass when he sees that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy slaves shall bring the gray hairs of thy slave our father down with sorrow to Sheol.
GEN.44.32	For thy slave became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the sin before my father for ever.
GEN.44.33	Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy slave remain instead of the lad as a bond slave to my lord, and let the lad go up with his brethren.
GEN.44.34	For how shall I go up to my father and the lad not be with me? I cannot go lest I see the evil that shall come on my father.
GEN.45.1	Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all those that stood by him, and he cried, Cause everyone to go out from me. And no one stood with him while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.
GEN.45.2	And he wept aloud; and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh heard.
GEN.45.3	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; does my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him, for they were terrified at his presence.
GEN.45.4	Then Joseph said unto his brethren, Now come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.
GEN.45.5	Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me here, for God sent me before you for life.
GEN.45.6	For these two years the famine has been in the land, and yet there are five years in which there shall neither be plowing nor harvest.
GEN.45.7	And God sent me before you that you might remain in the earth and that you might be given life by great liberty.
GEN.45.8	So now it was not you that sent me here, but God; and he has made me as a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.
GEN.45.9	Make haste and go up to my father and say unto him: Thus saith thy son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down unto me, tarry not.
GEN.45.10	And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou and thy sons and thy sons’ sons and thy herds and thy cows and all that thou hast.
GEN.45.11	And there I will nourish thee, for yet there are five years of famine, lest thou and thy household and all that thou hast perish of poverty.
GEN.45.12	And, behold, your eyes see and the eyes of my brother Benjamin that it is my mouth that speaks unto you.
GEN.45.13	And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt and of all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father here.
GEN.45.14	And he fell upon his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept upon his neck.
GEN.45.15	Moreover he kissed all his brethren and wept upon them, and after that his brethren talked with him.
GEN.45.16	And the fame of this was heard in Pharaoh’s house, saying, Joseph’s brethren have come; and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his slaves.
GEN.45.17	And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, Do this: lade your beasts and go, return unto the land of Canaan
GEN.45.18	and take your father and your households and come unto me; and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.
GEN.45.19	Now thou art commanded, do this: take wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives and bring your father and come.
GEN.45.20	Also regard not your stuff, for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.
GEN.45.21	And the sons of Israel did so, and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the way.
GEN.45.22	To each one of them all he gave changes of clothing; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.
GEN.45.23	And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the best of Egypt and ten she asses laden with wheat and bread and food for his father on the way.
GEN.45.24	So he sent his brethren away, and they departed. And he said unto them, See that ye do not fight along the way.
GEN.45.25	And they went up out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob, their father,
GEN.45.26	and told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is lord over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he did not believe them.
GEN.45.27	And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them; and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived:
GEN.45.28	Then Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive; I will go and see him before I die.
GEN.46.1	And Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac.
GEN.46.2	And God spoke unto Israel in visions of the night and said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.
GEN.46.3	And he said, I am the God, the God of thy father; fear not to go down into Egypt; for there I will make of thee a great people.
GEN.46.4	I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely bring thee up again; and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.
GEN.46.5	And Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel took Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.
GEN.46.6	And they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt, Jacob and all his seed with him,
GEN.46.7	his sons, and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters, and his sons’ daughters, and all his seed he brought with him into Egypt.
GEN.46.8	And these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn.
GEN.46.9	And the sons of Reuben: Enoch, Phallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
GEN.46.10	And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Saul the son of a Canaanite woman.
GEN.46.11	And the sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
GEN.46.12	And the sons of Judah: Er and Onan and Shelah and Pharez and Zerah; but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.
GEN.46.13	And the sons of Issachar: Tola, Phuvah, Job, and Shimron.
GEN.46.14	And the sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
GEN.46.15	These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore unto Jacob in Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah; all the souls of his sons and his daughters were thirty-three.
GEN.46.16	And the sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
GEN.46.17	And the sons of Asher: Jimnah, Ishuah, Isui, Beriah, and Serah, their sister. The sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel.
GEN.46.18	These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter, and these she gave birth unto Jacob: sixteen souls.
GEN.46.19	The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.46.20	And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On gave birth unto him.
GEN.46.21	And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
GEN.46.22	These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob, in all, fourteen souls.
GEN.46.23	And the sons of Dan: Hushim.
GEN.46.24	And the sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
GEN.46.25	These are the sons of Bilhah, who Laban gave unto Rachel his daughter, and she gave birth to these unto Jacob; in all seven souls.
GEN.46.26	All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out of his loins, besides Jacob’s sons’ wives, all the souls were sixty-six;
GEN.46.27	and the sons of Joseph, who were born him in Egypt, were two souls. All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt, were seventy.
GEN.46.28	And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.
GEN.46.29	And Joseph made ready his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father, to Goshen, and manifested himself unto him; and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while.
GEN.46.30	Then Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die since I have seen thy face because thou art yet alive.
GEN.46.31	And Joseph said unto his brethren and unto his father’s house, I will go up and tell Pharaoh and say unto him, My brethren and my father’s house, who were in the land of Canaan, are come unto me;
GEN.46.32	and the men are pastors of sheep, for their trade has been to feed livestock; and they have brought their sheep and their cows and all that they have.
GEN.46.33	And it shall come to pass when Pharaoh shall call you and shall say, What is your occupation?
GEN.46.34	Then ye shall say, Thy slaves’ trade has been about livestock from our youth even until now, both we and also our fathers, that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every pastor of sheep is an abomination unto the Egyptians.
GEN.47.1	Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh and said, My father and my brethren and their sheep and their cows and all that they have are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they are in the land of Goshen.
GEN.47.2	And of the least of his brethren he took five men and presented them unto Pharaoh.
GEN.47.3	And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation? And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy slaves are pastors of sheep, both we and also our fathers.
GEN.47.4	They said moreover unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are we come, for thy slaves have no pasture for their sheep, for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan; now therefore, we pray thee, let thy slaves dwell in the land of Goshen.
GEN.47.5	And Pharaoh spoke unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee;
GEN.47.6	the land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let them dwell; and if thou knowest any men of valour among them, then make them rulers over my livestock.
GEN.47.7	And Joseph brought in Jacob his father and set him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
GEN.47.8	And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?
GEN.47.9	And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are one hundred and thirty years; few and evil have the days of the years of my life been and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.
GEN.47.10	And Jacob blessed Pharaoh and went out from before Pharaoh.
GEN.47.11	Thus Joseph placed his father and his brethren and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.
GEN.47.12	And Joseph nourished his father and his brethren, and all his father’s household with bread, according to their families.
GEN.47.13	And there was no bread in all the land, for the famine was very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.
GEN.47.14	And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the food which they bought from him; and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.
GEN.47.15	And when money failed in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in thy presence for the money fails?
GEN.47.16	And Joseph said, Give your livestock, and I will give you for your livestock if the money has failed.
GEN.47.17	And they brought their livestock unto Joseph, and Joseph gave them bread in exchange for horses and for the sheep and for the bovine livestock and for the asses, and he fed them with bread for all their livestock that year.
GEN.47.18	When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord how that the money is gone; my lord also has our herds of cattle; there is not nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies and our lands.
GEN.47.19	Why shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be slaves unto Pharaoh, and give us seed that we may live, and not die, that the land not be desolate.
GEN.47.20	Then Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for each one of the Egyptians sold his field because the famine prevailed over them; so the land became Pharaoh’s.
GEN.47.21	And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.
GEN.47.22	Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them; therefore they did not sell their lands.
GEN.47.23	Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh; behold, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.
GEN.47.24	And it shall come to pass in the increase that ye shall give the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own for seed of the field and for your food and for those of your households and for food for your little ones.
GEN.47.25	And they said, Thou hast saved our lives; let us find grace in the sight of my lord that we might be Pharaoh’s slaves.
GEN.47.26	And Joseph made it a statute over the land of Egypt unto this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth part; except the land of the priests only, which did not become Pharaoh’s.
GEN.47.27	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they had possessions therein and grew and multiplied exceedingly.
GEN.47.28	And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the whole age of Jacob was one hundred forty-seven years.
GEN.47.29	And the time drew nigh that Israel must die; and he called his son Joseph and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh and deal with me in mercy and truth; do not bury me, I pray thee, in Egypt;
GEN.47.30	but I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said.
GEN.47.31	And he said, Swear unto me. And he swore unto him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the bed’s head.
GEN.48.1	And it came to pass after these things that it was told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick; and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
GEN.48.2	And one told Jacob and said, Behold, thy son Joseph comes unto thee. Then Israel strengthened himself and sat upon the bed
GEN.48.3	and said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me
GEN.48.4	and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of peoples and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.
GEN.48.5	And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.
GEN.48.6	And those whom thou hast begotten after them shall be thine and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.
GEN.48.7	Because when I came from Padanaram, Rachel died unto me in the land of Canaan in the way when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath; and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, which is Bethlehem.
GEN.48.8	And Israel beheld Joseph’s sons and said, Who are these?
GEN.48.9	And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God has given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.
GEN.48.10	Now the eyes of Israel were so dim for age that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him, and he kissed them and embraced them.
GEN.48.11	And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face, and, behold, God has showed me also thy seed.
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.
GEN.48.13	And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel’s left hand and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel’s right hand and brought them near unto him.
GEN.48.14	Then Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraim’s head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh’s head, guiding his hands with understanding; for Manasseh was the firstborn.
GEN.48.15	And he blessed Joseph and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long unto this day,
GEN.48.16	the Angel who frees me from all evil, bless these young men, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.
GEN.48.17	Then Joseph seeing that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him; and he held up his father’s hand, to remove it from Ephraim’s head unto Manasseh’s head.
GEN.48.18	And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.
GEN.48.19	And his father refused and said, I know it, my son, I know it; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of Gentiles.
GEN.48.20	And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.
GEN.48.21	And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die; but God shall be with you and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.
GEN.48.22	Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.
GEN.49.1	And Jacob called unto his sons and said, Gather yourselves together that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
GEN.49.2	Gather yourselves together and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and hearken unto Israel your father.
GEN.49.3	Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, principal in dignity, and the principal in power.
GEN.49.4	Unstable as water, thou shalt not be principal because thou didst go up to thy father’s bed; then thou became defiled, going up to my couch.
GEN.49.5	Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of injustice are their weapons.
GEN.49.6	Let my soul not enter into their secret; nor let my honour join their assembly; for in their anger they slew a man, and in their own will they dug down a wall.
GEN.49.7	Cursed be their anger, which is strong, and their wrath, which is hard; I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.
GEN.49.8	Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise; thy hand shall be on the neck of thine enemies; thy father’s sons shall bow down before thee.
GEN.49.9	Judah is a lion’s whelp; from the prey, my son, thou art gone up; he stooped down, he couched as a lion and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
GEN.49.10	The sceptre shall not be taken from Judah, nor the lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh comes; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
GEN.49.11	Binding his foal unto the vine and his ass’s colt unto the choice roots; he washed his garments in wine and his covering in the blood of grapes;
GEN.49.12	His eyes red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
GEN.49.13	Zebulun shall dwell at the port of the sea; and he shall be for a port of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.
GEN.49.14	Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens;
GEN.49.15	and he saw that rest was good and the land that it was pleasant and bowed his shoulder to bear and became a servant unto tribute.
GEN.49.16	Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that bites the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
GEN.49.18	I have waited for thy saving health, O 
GEN.49.19	Gad, an army shall invade him, but he shall invade at the last.
GEN.49.20	Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield delight unto the king.
GEN.49.21	Naphtali is a hind let loose, who shall give forth a good word.
GEN.49.22	Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a fountain, whose daughters run over the wall.
GEN.49.23	The arches have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him;
GEN.49.24	but his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the Mighty one of Jacob; from there did the stone of Israel shepherd,
GEN.49.25	by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of the heavens above, with blessings of the deep that lies under, with blessings of the breasts and of the womb.
GEN.49.26	The blessings of thy father were greater than the blessings of my progenitors; unto the borders of the eternal hills they shall be upon the head of Joseph and on the crown of the Nazarite of his brethren.
GEN.49.27	Benjamin, ravening wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and in the evening he shall divide the spoil.
GEN.49.28	All these were the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father spoke unto them and blessed them; each one according to his blessing he blessed them.
GEN.49.29	And he charged them and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron, the Hittite,
GEN.49.30	in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron, the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
GEN.49.31	There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife; and there I buried Leah.
GEN.49.32	The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the sons of Heth.
GEN.49.33	And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed and expired and was gathered unto his people.
GEN.50.1	Then Joseph fell upon his father’s face and wept upon him and kissed him.
GEN.50.2	And Joseph commanded his slaves, the physicians, to embalm his father; and the physicians embalmed Israel.
GEN.50.3	And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those who are embalmed; and the Egyptians mourned for him seventy days.
GEN.50.4	And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spoke unto those of the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
GEN.50.5	My father made me swear, saying, Behold, I die; in my grave which I have dug for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee and bury my father, and I will come again.
GEN.50.6	And Pharaoh said, Go up and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
GEN.50.7	Then Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went up all the slaves of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
GEN.50.8	and all the house of Joseph and his brethren and his father’s house; only their little ones and their sheep and their cows, they left in the land of Goshen.
GEN.50.9	And both chariots and horsemen went up with him, and it was a very great company.
GEN.50.10	And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation; and Joseph made a mourning for his father seven days.
GEN.50.11	And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a great mourning of the Egyptians; therefore the name of it was called Abelmizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.
GEN.50.12	And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them;
GEN.50.13	for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
GEN.50.14	And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
GEN.50.15	And when Joseph’s brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
GEN.50.16	And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
GEN.50.17	So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren and their sin, for they did unto thee evil; and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the slaves of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spoke unto him.
GEN.50.18	And his brethren also went and fell down before his face, and they said, Behold, we are thy slaves.
GEN.50.19	And Joseph said unto them, Fear not; for am I in the place of God?
GEN.50.20	But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God thought it out unto good, to bring to pass that which we see this day, to give life to many people.
GEN.50.21	Now therefore fear ye not; I will nourish you and your little ones. Thus he comforted them and spoke to their heart.
GEN.50.22	And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father’s house: and Joseph lived one hundred and ten years.
GEN.50.23	And Joseph saw Ephraim’s sons unto the third generation; the sons also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were brought up upon Joseph’s knees.
GEN.50.24	And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die; but God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
GEN.50.25	And Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from here.
GEN.50.26	So Joseph died, being one hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in an ark in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt with Jacob; each one came in with his household.
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
EXO.1.4	Dan and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
EXO.1.5	And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.
EXO.1.6	And Joseph died and all his brethren and all that generation.
EXO.1.7	And the sons of Israel were fruitful and increased abundantly and multiplied and waxed exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them.
EXO.1.8	Now there arose up a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
EXO.1.9	And he said unto his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we.
EXO.1.10	Now, therefore, let us be wise concerning him, that he not multiply and it come to pass that when war comes, he shall also join with our enemies and fight against us and so leave the land.
EXO.1.11	Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built the supply cities for Pharaoh: Pithom and Raamses.
EXO.1.12	But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew, so much that they loathed the sons of Israel.
EXO.1.13	And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel serve with rigor,
EXO.1.14	and they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, making mortar and brick and in all manner of service in the field; all their service, in which they made them serve, was with rigor.
EXO.1.15	And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah and another named Puah;
EXO.1.16	and he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see the sex, if it is a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, then she shall live.
EXO.1.17	But the midwives feared God and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them but gave the men children their lives.
EXO.1.18	And the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said unto them, Why have ye done this thing and have given the men children their lives?
EXO.1.19	And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women, for they are lively and are delivered before the midwives come in unto them.
EXO.1.20	Therefore God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied and waxed very mighty.
EXO.1.21	And it came to pass because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses.
EXO.1.22	Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall give them their lives.
EXO.2.1	And a man of the house of Levi went and took to wife a daughter of Levi,
EXO.2.2	who conceived and gave birth to a son, and seeing that he was beautiful, she hid him three months.
EXO.2.3	And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes and daubed it with slime and with pitch and put the child in it, and she laid it in the reeds by the river’s brink.
EXO.2.4	And his sister stood afar off to see what would happen to him.
EXO.2.5	And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river, and walking with her maidens along by the river’s side, she saw the ark among the reeds; she sent her maid to bring it.
EXO.2.6	And when she had opened it, she saw the child, and, behold, the babe wept. And having compassion on him, she said, This is one of the Hebrews’ children.
EXO.2.7	Then his sister said unto Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women that she may nurse the child for thee?
EXO.2.8	And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child’s mother.
EXO.2.9	And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it.
EXO.2.10	And when the child grew, she brought him unto Pharaoh’s daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, for she said, Because I drew him out of the water.
EXO.2.11	And it came to pass in those days when Moses was grown, that he went out unto his brethren and looked on their burdens, and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.
EXO.2.12	And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no one, he slew the Egyptian and hid him in the sand.
EXO.2.13	And when he went out the next day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together, and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smitest thou thy fellow?
EXO.2.14	And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Doest thou intend to kill me as thou killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared and said, Surely this thing is known.
EXO.2.15	Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh and dwelt in the land of Midian; and he sat down by a well.
EXO.2.16	Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters who came and drew water to fill the troughs to water their father’s sheep.
EXO.2.17	But the pastors came and drove them away. Then Moses stood up and defended them and watered their sheep.
EXO.2.18	And when they returned unto Reuel, their father, he said, How is it that ye are come so soon today?
EXO.2.19	And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the pastors and also drew water enough for us and watered the sheep.
EXO.2.20	And he said unto his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.
EXO.2.21	And Moses was content to dwell with the man; and he gave Moses Zipporah, his daughter.
EXO.2.22	And she gave birth to a son, and he called his name Gershon, for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land.
EXO.2.23	And it came to pass in process of time that the king of Egypt died, and the sons of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up unto God from their bondage.
EXO.2.24	And God heard their groaning and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
EXO.2.25	And God looked upon the sons of Israel, and God recognized them.
EXO.3.1	Now as Moses shepherded the sheep of Jethro, his father-in-law, the priest of Midian, he led the flock to the backside of the desert and came to Horeb, the mountain of God.
EXO.3.2	And the Angel of the 
EXO.3.3	Then Moses said, I will now turn aside and see this great vision, why the bush is not burnt.
EXO.3.4	And when the 
EXO.3.5	And he said, Do not come near; take off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place upon which thou dost stand is holy ground.
EXO.3.6	Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses covered his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.
EXO.3.7	And the 
EXO.3.8	and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of that land unto a good and broad land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey, unto the places of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite.
EXO.3.9	Therefore, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has now come before me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.
EXO.3.10	Come now therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh that thou may bring forth my people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.
EXO.3.11	Then Moses said unto God, Who am I that I should go unto Pharaoh and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?
EXO.3.12	And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token unto thee that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.
EXO.3.13	And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, The God of your fathers has sent me unto you, and if they say to me, What is his name? What shall I say unto them?
EXO.3.14	And God answered unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel: I AM (YHWH) has sent me unto you.
EXO.3.15	And God said moreover unto Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel: The 
EXO.3.16	Go and gather the elders of Israel together and say unto them, The 
EXO.3.17	and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt unto the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite unto a land flowing with milk and honey.
EXO.3.18	And they shall hearken to thy voice, and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye shall say unto him, The 
EXO.3.19	For I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go except by a mighty hand.
EXO.3.20	But I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof, and after that he will let you go.
EXO.3.21	And I will give this people grace in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty;
EXO.3.22	but every woman shall demand of her neighbour and of her that sojourns in her house, vessels of silver and vessels of gold and clothing; and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters, and ye shall spoil Egypt.
EXO.4.1	Then Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken unto my voice, for they will say, The 
EXO.4.2	And the 
EXO.4.3	And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from before it.
EXO.4.4	And the 
EXO.4.5	Therefore they will believe that the 
EXO.4.6	And the 
EXO.4.7	And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again and plucked it out of his bosom, and, behold, it was turned again as his other flesh.
EXO.4.8	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.
EXO.4.9	And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river and pour it upon the dry land; and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land.
EXO.4.10	Then Moses said unto the 
EXO.4.11	And the 
EXO.4.12	Now therefore go and I will be with thy mouth and teach thee what thou shalt say.
EXO.4.13	And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send.
EXO.4.14	Then the anger of the 
EXO.4.15	And thou shalt speak unto him and put words in his mouth; and I will be with thy mouth and with his mouth and will teach you what ye shall do.
EXO.4.16	And he shall be thy spokesman unto the people; and he shall be unto thee as thy mouth, and thou shalt be unto him as God.
EXO.4.17	And thou shalt take this rod in thy hand with which thou shalt do the signs.
EXO.4.18	Thus Moses went and returned unto Jethro, his father-in-law, and said unto him, I shall go now and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt and see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.
EXO.4.19	And the 
EXO.4.20	Then Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt; and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.
EXO.4.21	And the 
EXO.4.22	And thou shalt say unto Pharaoh, The 
EXO.4.23	And I have said unto thee, Let my son go that he may serve me, but thou hast refused to let him go; therefore, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy firstborn.
EXO.4.24	And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the 
EXO.4.25	Then Zipporah took a sharp flint and cut off the foreskin of her son and cast it at his feet, saying, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me.
EXO.4.26	So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision.
EXO.4.27	And the 
EXO.4.28	Then Moses told Aaron all the words of the 
EXO.4.29	And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel:
EXO.4.30	And Aaron spoke all the words which the 
EXO.4.31	And the people believed; and hearing that the 
EXO.5.1	And afterward Moses and Aaron went in and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the 
EXO.5.2	And Pharaoh said, Who is the 
EXO.5.3	And they said, The God of the Hebrews has found us; therefore we shall go three days’ journey into the desert and sacrifice unto the 
EXO.5.4	Then the king of Egypt said unto them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, keep the people from their works? Go unto your burdens.
EXO.5.5	Pharaoh also said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them cease from their burdens.
EXO.5.6	And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the people and their officers, saying,
EXO.5.7	Ye shall no longer give the people firewood to make brick as until now; let them go and gather firewood for themselves.
EXO.5.8	And the tally of the bricks which they made before, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish any of it; for they are idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.
EXO.5.9	Let more work be laid upon them that they may occupy themselves with it; and let them not regard words of deception.
EXO.5.10	And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you firewood.
EXO.5.11	Go ye, gather firewood where ye can find it; yet none of your work shall be diminished.
EXO.5.12	So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather brush for firewood.
EXO.5.13	And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Fulfil your works, your daily quotas, as when there was firewood.
EXO.5.14	And the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and they demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your quotas in making brick both yesterday and today, as until now?
EXO.5.15	Then the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Why doest thou deal thus with thy slaves?
EXO.5.16	There is no firewood given unto thy slaves, yet they say to us, Make brick. Behold, thy slaves are beaten; and thy people sin.
EXO.5.17	And he replied, Ye are idle, ye are idle, therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice unto the 
EXO.5.18	Go therefore now and work, for no firewood shall be given you, yet ye shall deliver the tally of bricks.
EXO.5.19	Then the officers of the sons of Israel saw that they were afflicted after it was said, Ye shall not diminish any from the bricks of your daily quota.
EXO.5.20	And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh;
EXO.5.21	and they said unto them, The 
EXO.5.22	Then Moses returned unto the 
EXO.5.23	For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he has afflicted this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all.
EXO.6.1	Then the 
EXO.6.2	And God spoke unto Moses and said unto him, I am the 
EXO.6.3	and I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as God Almighty, but by my name the 
EXO.6.4	And I also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers.
EXO.6.5	And likewise I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.
EXO.6.6	Therefore say unto the sons of Israel, I am the 
EXO.6.7	And I will take you as my people, and I will be your God: and ye shall know that I am the 
EXO.6.8	And I will bring you in unto the land, concerning which I raised my hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it unto you for a heritage: I am the 
EXO.6.9	In this manner Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel, but they did not hearken unto Moses because of their anguish of spirit and cruel bondage.
EXO.6.10	And the 
EXO.6.11	Go in, speak unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.
EXO.6.12	And Moses answered before the 
EXO.6.13	Then the 
EXO.6.14	These are the heads of their fathers’ families: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Enoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben.
EXO.6.15	And the sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Saul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon.
EXO.6.16	And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their lineages: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty-seven years.
EXO.6.17	The sons of Gershon: Libni, and Shimi, according to their families.
EXO.6.18	And the sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were one hundred thirty-three years.
EXO.6.19	And the sons of Merari: Mahali and Mushi; these are the families of Levi according to their lineages.
EXO.6.20	And Amram took Jochebed, his father’s sister to wife; and she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were one hundred thirty-seven years.
EXO.6.21	And the sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri.
EXO.6.22	And the sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Zithri.
EXO.6.23	And Aaron took Elizabeth, daughter of Amminadab, sister of Naashon, to wife; and she bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
EXO.6.24	And the sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph; these are the families of the Korhites.
EXO.6.25	And Eleazar, Aaron’s son, took one of the daughters of Putiel to wife; and she bore him Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers of the Levites according to their families.
EXO.6.26	These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom the 
EXO.6.27	These are those who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt: these are that Moses and Aaron.
EXO.6.28	And it came to pass on the day when the 
EXO.6.29	that the 
EXO.6.30	And Moses said before the 
EXO.7.1	The 
EXO.7.2	Thou shalt speak all that I shall command thee; and Aaron, thy brother, shall speak unto Pharaoh that he send the sons of Israel out of his land.
EXO.7.3	And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.
EXO.7.4	And Pharaoh shall not hearken unto you, but I shall lay my hand upon Egypt and bring forth my hosts, and my people, the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.
EXO.7.5	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.7.6	And Moses and Aaron did as the 
EXO.7.7	And Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke unto Pharaoh.
EXO.7.8	And the 
EXO.7.9	If Pharaoh shall answer you, saying, Show a miracle, then thou shalt say unto Aaron, Take thy rod and cast it before Pharaoh, that it shall become a dragon.
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did as the 
EXO.7.11	Then Pharaoh also called wise men and sorcerers; now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their fire worship.
EXO.7.12	For each one cast down his rod, and they became dragons; but Aaron’s rod swallowed up their rods.
EXO.7.13	And Pharaoh’s heart became hard, that he hearkened not unto them as the 
EXO.7.14	Then the 
EXO.7.15	Go unto Pharaoh in the morning; behold, he goes out unto the water; and thou shalt stand by the river’s brink before him and take in thy hand the rod which was turned to a serpent
EXO.7.16	and say unto him, The 
EXO.7.17	Thus hath the 
EXO.7.18	And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall stink; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink the water of the river.
EXO.7.19	And the 
EXO.7.20	And Moses and Aaron did so, as the 
EXO.7.21	And the fish that were in the river died; and the river became corrupted, so that the Egyptians could not drink the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt.
EXO.7.22	And the magicians of Egypt did the same with their enchantments; and Pharaoh’s heart hardened itself, and he did not hearken unto them, as the 
EXO.7.23	And Pharaoh turned and returned to his house, and even with all this he did not take this to heart.
EXO.7.24	And in all Egypt they dug wells round about the river for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the river.
EXO.7.25	And seven days were fulfilled after the 
EXO.8.1	Then the 
EXO.8.2	And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs:
EXO.8.3	And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thy house and into thy bedchamber and upon thy bed and into the houses of thy slaves and upon thy people and into thine ovens and into thy kneadingtroughs;
EXO.8.4	and the frogs shall come up upon thee and upon thy people and upon all thy slaves.
EXO.8.5	And the 
EXO.8.6	And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt; and frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.7	And the magicians did the same with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said unto them, Intreat the 
EXO.8.9	And Moses said unto Pharaoh, Tell me: when shall I intreat for thee and for thy slaves and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee and thy houses, that they may remain only in the river?
EXO.8.10	And he said, Tomorrow. And Moses replied, Be it according to thy word, that thou may know that there is none like unto the 
EXO.8.11	And the frogs shall depart from thee and from thy houses and from thy slaves and from thy people; they shall remain only in the river.
EXO.8.12	Then Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried unto the 
EXO.8.13	And the 
EXO.8.14	And they gathered them together in heaps; and the land was corrupted.
EXO.8.15	But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart and did not hearken unto them as the 
EXO.8.16	Then the 
EXO.8.17	And they did so; for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.18	And the magicians did the same with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. And there were lice upon man and upon beast.
EXO.8.19	Then the magicians said unto Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. But Pharaoh’s heart hardened, and he did not hearken unto them as the 
EXO.8.20	And the 
EXO.8.21	For if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee and upon thy slaves and upon thy people and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of all kinds of flies and also the ground upon which they are.
EXO.8.22	And I will separate in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no kind of flies shall be there to the end that thou may know that I am the 
EXO.8.23	And I will put redemption between my people and thy people. Tomorrow shall this sign be.
EXO.8.24	And the 
EXO.8.25	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.26	And Moses replied, It is not convenient to do so; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the 
EXO.8.27	We will go three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.28	And Pharaoh said, I will let you go that ye may sacrifice to the 
EXO.8.29	And Moses answered, Behold, as I go out from thy presence, I will intreat the 
EXO.8.30	Then Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed unto the 
EXO.8.31	And the 
EXO.8.32	And Pharaoh even hardened his heart this time and did not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the 
EXO.9.2	For if thou refuse to let them go and wilt hold them still,
EXO.9.3	behold, the hand of the 
EXO.9.4	And the 
EXO.9.5	And the 
EXO.9.6	And the next day the 
EXO.9.7	Then Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not one of the livestock of the sons of Israel dead. But the heart of Pharaoh hardened, and he did not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	And the 
EXO.9.9	And it shall become dust upon all the land of Egypt, which shall cause boils breaking forth with blisters upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.
EXO.9.10	And they took the soot of the furnace and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven; and boils breaking forth with blisters came upon man and upon beast
EXO.9.11	until the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils; for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.
EXO.9.12	And the 
EXO.9.13	Then the 
EXO.9.14	For otherwise this time I will send all my plagues upon thine heart and upon thy slaves and upon thy people that thou may know that there is none like me in all the earth.
EXO.9.15	For now I will stretch out my hand that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence, and thou shalt be cut off from the earth.
EXO.9.16	For in truth I have placed thee to declare my power in thee, and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth.
EXO.9.17	Thou even so dost exalt thyself against my people that thou wilt not let them go.
EXO.9.18	Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the foundation thereof even until now.
EXO.9.19	Send therefore now and gather thy livestock and all that thou hast in the field; for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.
EXO.9.20	He that feared the word of the 
EXO.9.21	and he that did not regard the word of the 
EXO.9.22	And the 
EXO.9.23	And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven, and the 
EXO.9.24	So there was hail and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there was none like it in all the land of Egypt since it became inhabited.
EXO.9.25	And that hail smote throughout all the land of Egypt all that was in the field, both men and beasts; and the hail smote all the grass of the field and broke all the trees of the field.
EXO.9.26	Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, was there no hail.
EXO.9.27	Then Pharaoh sent and called for Moses and Aaron and said unto them, I have sinned this time; the 
EXO.9.28	Intreat the 
EXO.9.29	And Moses replied unto him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will extend my hands unto the 
EXO.9.30	But I know thee and thy slaves from before ye began to fear the presence of the 
EXO.9.31	The flax, therefore, and the barley were smitten, for the barley was headed out, and the flax was in stalk.
EXO.9.32	But the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they were late.
EXO.9.33	And Moses went out from the presence of Pharaoh and out of the city and extended his hands unto the 
EXO.9.34	And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders were ceased, he persevered in his sin and hardened his heart, he and his slaves.
EXO.9.35	And the heart of Pharaoh hardened, and he did not let the sons of Israel go as the 
EXO.10.1	And the 
EXO.10.2	and that thou may tell in the ears of thy sons and of thy son’s sons the things I did in Egypt and my signs which I gave among them and that ye may know that I am the 
EXO.10.3	Then Moses and Aaron came in unto Pharaoh and said unto him, Thus hath the 
EXO.10.4	For if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I will bring the locusts into thy borders,
EXO.10.5	and they shall cover the face of the earth that one will not be able to see the earth, and they shall eat the residue of that which is escaped, which remains unto you from the hail and shall eat every tree which produces fruit for you out of the field:
EXO.10.6	And they shall fill thy houses and the houses of all thy slaves and the houses of all the Egyptians, which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers’ fathers have seen since the day that they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned himself and went out from Pharaoh.
EXO.10.7	Then Pharaoh’s slaves said unto him, How long shall this man be a snare unto us? Let the men go that they may serve the 
EXO.10.8	And Moses and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh; and he said unto them, Go, serve the 
EXO.10.9	And Moses replied, We must go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our sheep and with our cows we must go; for we have a solemn feast unto the 
EXO.10.10	And he said unto them, Even if the 
EXO.10.11	It shall not be so: go now ye that are men and serve the 
EXO.10.12	Then the 
EXO.10.13	And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the 
EXO.10.14	And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt and landed in all the borders of Egypt. Very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them shall there be such.
EXO.10.15	For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate all the grass of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left; and there did not remain any green thing in the trees or in the grass of the field, through all the land of Egypt.
EXO.10.16	Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the 
EXO.10.17	Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and intreat the 
EXO.10.18	And he went out from Pharaoh and intreated the 
EXO.10.19	And the 
EXO.10.20	But the 
EXO.10.21	And the 
EXO.10.22	And Moses stretched forth his hand toward heaven, and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.
EXO.10.23	They did not see one another, neither did any rise from his place for three days; but all the sons of Israel had light in their dwellings.
EXO.10.24	Then Pharaoh called unto Moses and said, Go, serve the 
EXO.10.25	And Moses replied, Thou also must give us sacrifices and burnt offerings that we may sacrifice unto the 
EXO.10.26	Our cattle shall also go with us; not a hoof shall be left behind; for we must take thereof to serve the 
EXO.10.27	But the 
EXO.10.28	And Pharaoh said unto him, Go from me, take heed to thyself to see my face no more; for in the day that thou seest my face thou shalt die.
EXO.10.29	And Moses replied, Thou hast spoken well, I will not see thy face again.
EXO.11.1	And the 
EXO.11.2	Speak now to the people and let each man demand of his neighbour and each woman of her neighbour, vessels of silver and of gold.
EXO.11.3	And the 
EXO.11.4	And Moses said, The 
EXO.11.5	and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sits upon his throne even unto the firstborn of the maidservant that is behind the mill and all the firstborn of beasts.
EXO.11.6	And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there has never been one like it, nor shall there ever be any like it again.
EXO.11.7	But among all the sons of Israel, from man to beast, not a dog shall move his tongue, that ye may know that the 
EXO.11.8	And all these thy slaves shall come down unto me and bow down themselves unto me, saying, Go out, and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will go out. And he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger.
EXO.11.9	And the 
EXO.11.10	And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh: but the 
EXO.12.1	And the 
EXO.12.2	This month shall be unto you the beginning of the months; it shall be the first month of the year to you.
EXO.12.3	Speak unto all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month let each man take a lamb according to the families of the fathers, a lamb per family;
EXO.12.4	and if the household is too small and is not able to eat the lamb, let him and his neighbour next unto his house take it according to the number of persons; each one according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb.
EXO.12.5	The lamb shall be without blemish, a male of one year; ye shall take it out from the sheep or from the goats;
EXO.12.6	and ye shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it between the two evenings.
EXO.12.7	And they shall take of the blood and put it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses in which they shall eat it.
EXO.12.8	And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire, and unleavened bread; and with bitter herbs they shall eat it.
EXO.12.9	Eat none of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roast with fire, his head with his legs, and with the entrails thereof.
EXO.12.10	And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning; and that which remains of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.
EXO.12.11	And thus shall ye eat it: with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the 
EXO.12.12	For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both among man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the 
EXO.12.13	And this blood shall be to you for a sign upon the houses where ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.
EXO.12.14	And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it as a feast unto the 
EXO.12.15	Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses, for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.
EXO.12.16	And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you; no manner of work shall be done in them, except that which every person must eat, that only may be done of you.
EXO.12.17	And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread, for in this same day have I brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt; therefore, shall ye observe this day for your ages by an ordinance forever.
EXO.12.18	In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening.
EXO.12.19	For seven days there shall be no leaven found in your houses; for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he is a stranger or born in the land.
EXO.12.20	Ye shall eat nothing leavened; in all your habitations ye shall eat unleavened bread.
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them, Draw out and take lambs according to your families and sacrifice the passover.
EXO.12.22	And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and touch the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.
EXO.12.23	For the 
EXO.12.24	And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever.
EXO.12.25	And it shall come to pass, when ye have entered into the land which the 
EXO.12.26	And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What do you mean by this service?
EXO.12.27	That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the 
EXO.12.28	And the sons of Israel went away, and as the 
EXO.12.29	And it came to pass, that at midnight the 
EXO.12.30	And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his slaves and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not one dead.
EXO.12.31	And he called for Moses and Aaron by night and said, Rise up, and get you forth from among my people, both ye and the sons of Israel, and go, serve the 
EXO.12.32	Also take your sheep and your cows, as ye have said, and be gone; and bless me also.
EXO.12.33	And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people that they might send them out of the land in haste, for they said, We are all dead men.
EXO.12.34	And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneadingtroughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders.
EXO.12.35	And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses; and they asked the Egyptians for vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and clothing.
EXO.12.36	And the 
EXO.12.37	And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, not counting the children.
EXO.12.38	And a mixed multitude went up also with them and many sheep and cows.
EXO.12.39	And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought forth out of Egypt, for it was not leavened because they were thrust out of Egypt and could not tarry nor prepare food for themselves.
EXO.12.40	Now the time that the sons of Israel dwelt in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.
EXO.12.41	And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even that same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the 
EXO.12.42	It is a night to be much observed unto the 
EXO.12.43	And the 
EXO.12.44	but every man’s slave that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.
EXO.12.45	The foreigner and the hired servant shall not eat of it.
EXO.12.46	It shall be eaten in one house; thou shalt not carry forth any of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye break a bone thereof.
EXO.12.47	All the congregation of Israel shall make this sacrifice.
EXO.12.48	And if a stranger shall sojourn with thee and desire to make the passover to the 
EXO.12.49	The same law shall be for the one who is natural, and for the stranger that sojourns among you.
EXO.12.50	Thus did all the sons of Israel; as the 
EXO.12.51	And it came to pass that same day that the 
EXO.13.1	And the 
EXO.13.2	Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatever opens the womb among the sons of Israel, both of man and of beast; for it is mine.
EXO.13.3	And Moses said unto the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of slavery; for the 
EXO.13.4	This day ye came out in the month Abib.
EXO.13.5	And when the 
EXO.13.6	Thou shalt eat without leaven for seven days, and the seventh day shall be a feast unto the 
EXO.13.7	Bread without leaven shall be eaten the seven days; and nothing leavened shall be seen with thee, neither shall there be any leaven in all thy borders.
EXO.13.8	And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the 
EXO.13.9	And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand and for a memorial before thine eyes, that the 
EXO.13.10	Thou shalt, therefore, keep this ordinance in its season from year to year.
EXO.13.11	And it shall be when the 
EXO.13.12	that thou shalt set apart unto the 
EXO.13.13	And every firstborn of an ass thou shalt ransom with a lamb; and if thou wilt not ransom it, then thou shalt cut off its head; and in the same manner thou shalt ransom all the human firstborn among thy sons.
EXO.13.14	And it shall be when thy son asks thee in time to come, saying, What is this? Thou shalt say unto him, With a strong hand the 
EXO.13.15	and it came to pass when Pharaoh was hardening himself to not let us go that the 
EXO.13.16	And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for a memorial before thine eyes: That the 
EXO.13.17	And it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God did not lead them through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near; for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt;
EXO.13.18	but God led the people round about through the way of the wilderness of the Red sea. And the sons of Israel went up armed out of the land of Egypt.
EXO.13.19	And Moses also took the bones of Joseph with him, who had made the sons of Israel swear, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones away from here with you.
EXO.13.20	And they took their journey from Succoth and encamped in Etham in the edge of the wilderness.
EXO.13.21	And the 
EXO.13.22	He never took away the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night from before the people.
EXO.14.1	And the 
EXO.14.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel that they turn and set up their camp before Pihahiroth between Migdol and the sea over against Baalzephon; before it shall ye set up camp by the sea.
EXO.14.3	For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, They are entangled in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.
EXO.14.4	And I will harden Pharaoh’s heart that he shall follow after them; and I will be glorified in Pharaoh and in all his host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.14.5	And it was told the king of Egypt how the people fled; and the heart of Pharaoh and of his slaves was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us?
EXO.14.6	And he made ready his chariot and took his people with him;
EXO.14.7	and he took six hundred chosen chariots and all the chariots of Egypt and the captains over them.
EXO.14.8	And the 
EXO.14.9	The Egyptians, nevertheless, pursued after them with all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and all his army, and overtook them setting up camp by the sea beside Pihahiroth before Baalzephon.
EXO.14.10	And when Pharaoh drew near, the sons of Israel lifted up their eyes, and, behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they feared greatly, and the sons of Israel cried out unto the 
EXO.14.11	And they said unto Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to bring us forth out of Egypt?
EXO.14.12	Is this not what we told thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians? For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness.
EXO.14.13	And Moses said unto the people, Fear ye not, stand still and see the saving health of the 
EXO.14.14	The 
EXO.14.15	Then the 
EXO.14.16	And lift up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it; and the sons of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea.
EXO.14.17	And behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians that they shall follow them: and I will be glorified in Pharaoh and in all his host, in his chariots, and in his horsemen.
EXO.14.18	And the Egyptians shall know that I am the 
EXO.14.19	And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed and went behind them; and likewise the pillar of cloud went from before their face and stood behind them.
EXO.14.20	And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it lit up the night unto Israel; and all that night the one side never came near the other.
EXO.14.21	And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the 
EXO.14.22	Then the sons of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left.
EXO.14.23	And the Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh’s horses, his chariots, and his horsemen.
EXO.14.24	And it came to pass that in the morning watch the 
EXO.14.25	and took off their chariot wheels and overturned them grievously, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the 
EXO.14.26	And the 
EXO.14.27	And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned in its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the 
EXO.14.28	And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them.
EXO.14.29	But the sons of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left.
EXO.14.30	Thus the 
EXO.14.31	And Israel saw that great work which the 
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song unto the 
EXO.15.2	The 
EXO.15.3	The 
EXO.15.4	Pharaoh’s chariots and his host he has cast into the sea; his chosen princes also are drowned in the Red sea.
EXO.15.5	The depths have covered them; they sank into the bottom as a stone.
EXO.15.6	Thy right hand, O 
EXO.15.7	And in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown those that rose up against thee; thou didst send forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble.
EXO.15.8	And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea.
EXO.15.9	The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my soul shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.
EXO.15.10	Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them. They sank as lead in the mighty waters.
EXO.15.11	Who is like unto thee, O 
EXO.15.12	Thou didst stretch out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them.
EXO.15.13	Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed; thou hast guided them in thy strength unto the habitation of thy holiness.
EXO.15.14	The peoples shall hear and be afraid; sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Philistia.
EXO.15.15	Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling, shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away.
EXO.15.16	Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone, until thy people pass over, O 
EXO.15.17	Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place of thy dwelling which thou hast made ready, O 
EXO.15.18	The 
EXO.15.19	For Pharaoh went in on horseback with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the 
EXO.15.20	And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her with timbrels and with dances.
EXO.15.21	And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the 
EXO.15.22	So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness and found no water.
EXO.15.23	And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah, for they were bitter; therefore the name of it was called Marah.
EXO.15.24	Then the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink?
EXO.15.25	And he cried unto the 
EXO.15.26	and said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the 
EXO.15.27	And they came to Elim, where there were twelve fountains of water and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the waters.
EXO.16.1	And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel came unto the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.
EXO.16.2	And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness;
EXO.16.3	and the sons of Israel said unto them, It would have been better if we had died by the hand of the 
EXO.16.4	Then the 
EXO.16.5	And it shall come to pass that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in, which shall be twice as much as they gather daily.
EXO.16.6	Then Moses and Aaron said unto all the sons of Israel, At evening ye shall know that the 
EXO.16.7	And in the morning ye shall see the glory of the 
EXO.16.8	And Moses said, This shall be when the 
EXO.16.9	And Moses spoke unto Aaron, Say unto all the congregation of the sons of Israel, Come near before the 
EXO.16.10	And it came to pass as Aaron spoke unto the whole congregation of the sons of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the 
EXO.16.11	And the 
EXO.16.12	I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel; speak unto them, saying, Between the two evenings ye shall eat flesh, and tomorrow ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the 
EXO.16.13	And it came to pass, that in the evening quail came up, and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew descended round about the host.
EXO.16.14	And when the dew ceased to descend, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing as small as the hoar frost on the ground.
EXO.16.15	And when the sons of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna (What is it?): for they did not know what it was. Then Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the 
EXO.16.16	This is the thing which the 
EXO.16.17	And the sons of Israel did so and gathered, some more, some less.
EXO.16.18	And when they did measure it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered each one according to his eating.
EXO.16.19	And Moses said, Let no one leave of it until the morning.
EXO.16.20	Notwithstanding they did not hearken unto Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms and stank; and Moses was angry with them.
EXO.16.21	And they gathered it early in the morning, each one according to his eating; and when the sun waxed hot, it melted.
EXO.16.22	And it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each one; and all the princes of the congregation came and told Moses.
EXO.16.23	And he said unto them, This is what the 
EXO.16.24	And they laid it up until the morning as Moses bade; and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in it.
EXO.16.25	And Moses said, Eat that today; for today is a sabbath unto the 
EXO.16.26	Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none.
EXO.16.27	And it came to pass that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, and they found none.
EXO.16.28	And the 
EXO.16.29	See that the 
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	And the house of Israel called its name Manna; and it was like coriander seed, white, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.
EXO.16.32	And Moses said, This is what the 
EXO.16.33	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer full of manna in it and lay it up before the 
EXO.16.34	As the 
EXO.16.35	Thus the sons of Israel ate manna forty years until they came to a land inhabited; they ate manna until they came unto the borders of the land of Canaan.
EXO.16.36	Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.
EXO.17.1	And all the congregation of the sons of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the 
EXO.17.2	And the people chided with Moses and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said unto them, Why chide ye with me? Why do ye tempt the 
EXO.17.3	So the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses and said, Why hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?
EXO.17.4	Then Moses cried unto the 
EXO.17.5	And the 
EXO.17.6	Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock in Horeb, and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out of it that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel.
EXO.17.7	And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah because of the chiding of the sons of Israel and because they tempted the 
EXO.17.8	Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.
EXO.17.9	And Moses said unto Joshua, Choose us out men and go out, fight with Amalek; tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand.
EXO.17.10	So Joshua did as Moses had said to him and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.
EXO.17.11	And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed; but when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.
EXO.17.12	And Moses’ hands were heavy, so they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat upon it; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side and the other on the other side; thus his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.
EXO.17.13	And Joshua disabled Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
EXO.17.14	And the 
EXO.17.15	And Moses built an altar and called the name of it The 
EXO.17.16	for he said, Because Amalek lifted his hand against the throne of the 
EXO.18.1	When Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done with Moses and with Israel his people and how the 
EXO.18.2	then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses’ wife, after he had sent her back,
EXO.18.3	and her two sons, of which the name of the one was Gershon, for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land,
EXO.18.4	and the name of the other was Eliezer, for the God of my father, said he, helped me and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh;
EXO.18.5	and Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife unto Moses into the wilderness, where he was camped next to the mount of God;
EXO.18.6	and he said unto Moses, I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am come unto thee and thy wife and her two sons with her.
EXO.18.7	And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and did obeisance and kissed him; and they asked each other of their peace; and they came into the tent.
EXO.18.8	And Moses told his father-in-law all that the 
EXO.18.9	And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the 
EXO.18.10	And Jethro said, Blessed be the 
EXO.18.11	Now I know that the 
EXO.18.12	And Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took burnt offerings and sacrifices for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses’ father-in-law before God.
EXO.18.13	And it came to pass another day that Moses sat to judge the people, and the people stood before Moses from the morning unto the evening.
EXO.18.14	And when Moses’ father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this that thou doest to the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone and all the people stand before thee from morning unto evening?
EXO.18.15	And Moses said unto his father-in-law, Because the people come unto me to enquire of God.
EXO.18.16	When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one and another, and I declare unto them the statutes of God and his laws.
EXO.18.17	Then Moses’ father-in-law said unto him, The thing that thou doest is not good.
EXO.18.18	Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou and this people that is with thee; for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone.
EXO.18.19	Hearken now unto my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people before God that thou may submit the causes unto God.
EXO.18.20	And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws and shalt show them the way in which they must walk and the work that they must do.
EXO.18.21	Moreover thou shalt consider out of all the people men of virtue, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness, and place princes over them, of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens.
EXO.18.22	And let them judge the people at all seasons; and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee, but every small matter they shall judge, so shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee.
EXO.18.23	If thou shalt do this thing and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace.
EXO.18.24	So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law and did all that he had said.
EXO.18.25	And Moses chose men of virtue out of all Israel and made them heads over the people, princes over thousands, over hundreds, over fifties, and over tens.
EXO.18.26	And they judged the people at all seasons; the hard causes they brought unto Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.
EXO.18.27	And Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went to his own land.
EXO.19.1	In the third month from when the sons of Israel had gone forth out of the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai.
EXO.19.2	For they had departed from Rephidim and were come to the desert of Sinai and had pitched in the wilderness, and there Israel camped before the mount.
EXO.19.3	And Moses went up unto God, and the 
EXO.19.4	Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles’ wings and brought you unto myself.
EXO.19.5	Now therefore, if ye will give ear to hearken unto my voice and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a special treasure unto me above all peoples; for all the earth is mine.
EXO.19.6	And ye shall be my kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel.
EXO.19.7	Then Moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the 
EXO.19.8	And all the people answered together and said, All that the 
EXO.19.9	And the 
EXO.19.10	And the 
EXO.19.11	and be ready for the third day; for the third day the 
EXO.19.12	And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves that ye go not up into the mount or touch the border of it; whoever touches the mount shall surely die:
EXO.19.13	Not a hand shall touch it, but that he shall surely be stoned or shot through; whether it be beast or man, it shall not live. When the jubilee sounds long, they shall come up to the mount.
EXO.19.14	And Moses went down from the mount unto the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes.
EXO.19.15	And he said unto the people, Be ready against the third day; come not at your women.
EXO.19.16	And it came to pass on the third day when the morning came, that there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud upon the mount and the voice of the shofar {ram’s horn} exceeding loud, so that all the people that were in the camp trembled.
EXO.19.17	And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the lower part of the mount.
EXO.19.18	And all Mount Sinai smoked because the 
EXO.19.19	And the voice of the shofar sounded long and waxed louder and louder; Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.
EXO.19.20	And the 
EXO.19.21	And the 
EXO.19.22	And also let the priests who come near to the 
EXO.19.23	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.19.24	And the 
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down unto the people and spoke unto them.
EXO.20.1	And God spoke all these words, saying,
EXO.20.2	I am the 
EXO.20.3	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
EXO.20.4	Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath nor that is in the water under the earth.
EXO.20.5	Thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them; for I the 
EXO.20.6	and showing mercy unto thousands of generations of those that love me and keep my commandments.
EXO.20.7	Thou shalt not take the name of the 
EXO.20.8	Thou shalt remember the sabbath day, to sanctify it.
EXO.20.9	Six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work;
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day shall be the sabbath of the 
EXO.20.11	for in six days the 
EXO.20.12	Honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be lengthened upon the land which the 
EXO.20.13	Thou shalt not murder.
EXO.20.14	Thou shalt not commit adultery.
EXO.20.15	Thou shalt not steal.
EXO.20.16	Thou shalt not give false testimony against thy neighbour.
EXO.20.17	Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manslave, nor his maidslave, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.
EXO.20.18	And all the people saw the thunderings and the lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountain smoking; and when the people saw it, they trembled and stood afar off.
EXO.20.19	And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us, and we will hear; but let not God speak with us lest we die.
EXO.20.20	Then Moses said unto the people, Fear not, for God is come to prove you and that his fear may be before your faces, that ye sin not.
EXO.20.21	Then the people stood afar off, and Moses drew near unto the thick darkness where God was.
EXO.20.22	And the 
EXO.20.23	Ye shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall ye make unto you gods of gold.
EXO.20.24	An altar of earth thou shalt make unto me and shalt sacrifice thereon thy burnt offerings and thy peace offerings, thy sheep and thine oxen; in whatever place where I cause my name to be remembered, I will come unto thee, and I will bless thee.
EXO.20.25	And if thou wilt make me an altar of stone, thou shalt not build it of hewn stone; for if thou lift up thy tool upon it, thou hast polluted it.
EXO.20.26	Neither shalt thou go up by steps unto my altar that thy nakedness not be discovered thereon.
EXO.21.1	Now these are the rights which thou shalt set before them.
EXO.21.2	If thou should buy a Hebrew slave, he shall serve six years; and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.
EXO.21.3	If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself; if he was married, then his wife shall go out with him.
EXO.21.4	If his master has given him a wife, and she has born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master’s, and he shall go out by himself.
EXO.21.5	And if the slave shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free.
EXO.21.6	Then his master shall bring him unto the judges; he shall also bring him to the door or unto the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an aul; and he shall serve him forever.
EXO.21.7	And if a man should sell his daughter to be a maidslave, she shall not go out as the menslaves do.
EXO.21.8	If she pleases not her master, who therefore took her not unto himself to wife, then it is permitted that she be ransomed; and he may not sell her unto a strange nation when he rejects her.
EXO.21.9	And if he has betrothed her unto his son, he shall deal with her after the manner of daughters.
EXO.21.10	If he takes another wife, her food, her raiment, and her duty of marriage, he shall not diminish.
EXO.21.11	And if he does not do these three things unto her, then shall she go out free without money.
EXO.21.12	He that smites a man so that he dies shall be surely put to death.
EXO.21.13	And if a man did not lie in wait but God delivered him into his hand, then I will appoint thee a place where he shall flee.
EXO.21.14	But if a man comes presumptuously upon his neighbour to slay him with prudence, thou shalt take him from my altar that he may die.
EXO.21.15	And he that smites his father or his mother shall be surely put to death.
EXO.21.16	Likewise he that steals a man and sells him, or if he is found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.
EXO.21.17	In the same manner he that curses his father or his mother shall surely be put to death.
EXO.21.18	And if men strive together and one smites another with a stone or with his fist and he dies not, but keeps his bed,
EXO.21.19	if he rises again and walks abroad upon his staff, then shall he that smote him be absolved, only he shall pay for the loss of his time and shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.
EXO.21.20	And if a man smites his slave or his maid with a rod and he dies under his hand, he shall be surely punished.
EXO.21.21	Notwithstanding, if he continues a day or two, he shall not be punished, for he is his money.
EXO.21.22	If men strive and hurt a woman with child so that she aborts but without death, he shall be surely punished according as the woman’s husband will lay upon him, and he shall pay by the judges.
EXO.21.23	And if there is death, then thou shalt pay life for life,
EXO.21.24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,
EXO.21.25	burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.
EXO.21.26	And if someone smites the eye of their slave or the eye of their maid that it perishes, he shall let them go free for their eye’s sake.
EXO.21.27	And if he smites out his manslave’s tooth or his maidslave’s tooth, he shall let them go free for their tooth’s sake.
EXO.21.28	If an ox gores a man or a woman that they die, then the ox shall surely be stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be absolved.
EXO.21.29	But if the ox were wont to push with his horn in time past and it has been testified to his owner, and he has not kept him in, but that he has killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his owner also shall be put to death.
EXO.21.30	If there is laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid upon him.
EXO.21.31	Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done unto him.
EXO.21.32	If the ox shall gore a manslave or a maidslave, he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.
EXO.21.33	And if someone shall open a pit or if someone shall dig a pit and not cover it and an ox or an ass falls in it,
EXO.21.34	the owner of the pit shall make it good and give money unto their owner, and the dead beast shall be his.
EXO.21.35	And if one man’s ox hurts another’s that he dies; then they shall sell the live ox and divide the money of it, and the dead ox they shall also divide.
EXO.21.36	Or if it is known that the ox used to push in time past and his owner has not kept him in, he shall surely pay ox for ox, and the dead shall be his own.
EXO.22.1	If a man shall steal an ox or a sheep and kill it or sell it he shall restore five oxen for an ox and four sheep for a sheep.
EXO.22.2	If a thief is found breaking into a house and is smitten so he dies, he that killed him shall not be guilty of his blood.
EXO.22.3	If the sun is risen upon him, he that killed him is guilty of his blood; the thief should make full restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold for his theft.
EXO.22.4	If he is found with the theft in his hand, whether it be ox or ass or sheep, he shall restore double.
EXO.22.5	If a man shall cause a field or vineyard to be eaten and shall put in his beast and shall feed in another man’s field; of the best of his own field and of the best of his own vineyard shall he make restitution.
EXO.22.6	When fires are lit and in burning the thorns burn also the stacks of sheaves or the standing grain, or the field is consumed; he that kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.
EXO.22.7	When a man shall deliver unto his neighbour money or stuff to keep, and it is stolen out of the man’s house; if the thief is found, let him pay double.
EXO.22.8	If the thief is not found, then the master of the house shall be brought unto the judges to see whether he has put his hand unto his neighbour’s goods.
EXO.22.9	For all manner of fraud, whether it be for an ox, for an ass, for a sheep, for raiment, or for any manner of lost thing, which another challenges to be his, the cause of both parties shall come before the judges; and whom the judges shall condemn, he shall pay double unto his neighbour.
EXO.22.10	If a man delivers unto his neighbour an ass or an ox or a sheep or any beast to keep, and it dies or is hurt or driven away, no man seeing it,
EXO.22.11	then shall an oath of the 
EXO.22.12	And if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution unto its owner.
EXO.22.13	If it is torn in pieces, then let him bring witness, and he shall not make good that which was torn.
EXO.22.14	And if anyone borrows anything of his neighbour, and it is hurt or dies, its owner not being with it, he shall surely make it good.
EXO.22.15	But if its owner is with it, he shall not make it good; if it was hired, it came for its hire.
EXO.22.16	If a man should entice a virgin that is not betrothed and lie with her, he shall surely endow her and take her to be his wife.
EXO.22.17	If her father utterly refuses to give her unto him, he shall pay money according to the dowry of virgins.
EXO.22.18	Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.
EXO.22.19	Whoever lies with a beast shall surely be put to death.
EXO.22.20	He that sacrifices unto any god, except unto the 
EXO.22.21	Thou shalt neither mistreat a stranger nor oppress him; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
EXO.22.22	Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.
EXO.22.23	If thou afflict them in any manner, and they cry at all unto me, I will surely hear their cry;
EXO.22.24	and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you with the sword; and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.
EXO.22.25	If thou should lend money to my people, to the poor who is with thee, thou shalt not be to him as a usurer, neither shalt thou lay upon him usury.
EXO.22.26	If thou at all take thy neighbour’s clothing as a pledge, thou shalt deliver it unto him before the sun goes down;
EXO.22.27	for only that is his covering, it is his clothing to cover his flesh, in which he must sleep; and it shall come to pass, when he cries unto me, that I will hear, for I am merciful.
EXO.22.28	Thou shalt not revile the judges nor curse the prince of thy people.
EXO.22.29	Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits and of thy liquors; the firstborn of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.
EXO.22.30	Likewise shalt thou do with thine oxen and with thy sheep; seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day thou shalt give it to me.
EXO.22.31	And ye shall be holy men unto me; neither shall ye eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; ye shall cast it to the dogs.
EXO.23.1	Thou shalt not admit a false rumour; put not thine hand with the wicked to be a false witness.
EXO.23.2	Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause hiding behind many to wrest judgment;
EXO.23.3	neither shalt thou honour a poor man in his cause.
EXO.23.4	If thou should encounter thine enemy’s ox or his ass astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again.
EXO.23.5	If thou see the ass of him that hates thee lying under his burden, will thou forbear to help him? Thou shalt surely help him to raise it up.
EXO.23.6	Thou shalt not pervert the rights of thy poor in his cause.
EXO.23.7	Keep thee far from a false matter; and slay thou not the innocent and righteous; for I will not justify the wicked.
EXO.23.8	And thou shalt take no bribe; for the bribe blinds the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.
EXO.23.9	Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger, for ye know the state of the soul of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
EXO.23.10	And six years thou shalt sow thy land and shalt gather in its increase,
EXO.23.11	but the seventh year thou shalt leave it free and release it, that the poor of thy people may eat, and what they leave the beasts of the field shall eat. In like manner thou shalt deal with thy vineyard and with thy oliveyard.
EXO.23.12	Six days thou shalt do thy work, and on the seventh day thou shalt rest, that thine ox and thine ass may rest, and the son of thy handmaid and the stranger may be refreshed.
EXO.23.13	And in all things that I have said unto you, be circumspect and make no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth.
EXO.23.14	Three times thou shalt celebrate a feast unto me in the year:
EXO.23.15	Thou shalt keep the feast of unleavened bread (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib, for in it thou didst come out from Egypt; and none shall appear before me empty),
EXO.23.16	And the feast of the harvest of the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field, and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field.
EXO.23.17	Three times in the year all thy males shall appear before the Lord GOD.
EXO.23.18	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my lamb remain until the morning.
EXO.23.19	The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the 
EXO.23.20	Behold, I send the Angel before thee, to keep thee in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared.
EXO.23.21	Keep thyself before him and hear his voice, grieve him not; for he will not pardon your rebellion, for my name is in him.
EXO.23.22	But if thou shalt indeed hear his voice and do all that I speak, then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto those that afflict thee.
EXO.23.23	For my Angel shall go before thee and bring thee in unto the land of the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite the Hivite and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off.
EXO.23.24	Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works; but thou shalt utterly overthrow them and completely break down their images.
EXO.23.25	But ye shall serve the 
EXO.23.26	No women shall abort, nor be barren, in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfil.
EXO.23.27	I will send my fear before thee and will trouble all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee.
EXO.23.28	And I will send hornets before thee, which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite from before thee.
EXO.23.29	I will not drive them out from before thee in one year lest the land become desolate and the beasts of the field multiply against thee.
EXO.23.30	Little by little I will drive them out from before thee until thou be multiplied and take the land by inheritance.
EXO.23.31	And I will set thy borders from the Red sea even unto the sea of the Philistines and from the desert unto the river; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and thou shalt drive them out before thee.
EXO.23.32	Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.
EXO.23.33	They shall not dwell in thy land lest peradventure they make thee sin against me by serving their gods, for it will be a snare unto thee.
EXO.24.1	And he said unto Moses, Come up unto the 
EXO.24.2	And Moses alone shall approach the 
EXO.24.3	And Moses came and told the people all the words of the 
EXO.24.4	And Moses wrote all the words of the 
EXO.24.5	And he sent the young men of the sons of Israel, who had offered burnt offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of bullocks unto the 
EXO.24.6	And Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.
EXO.24.7	And he took the book of the covenant and read in the audience of the people, and they said, All that the 
EXO.24.8	Then Moses took the blood and sprinkled it on the people and said, Behold the blood of the covenant, which the 
EXO.24.9	Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel went up,
EXO.24.10	and they saw the God of Israel; and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone like unto the heaven when it is clear.
EXO.24.11	But he did not lay his hand upon the princes of the sons of Israel, and they saw God and ate and drank.
EXO.24.12	Then the 
EXO.24.13	And Moses rose up, and his minister Joshua, and Moses went up into the mount of God.
EXO.24.14	And he said unto the elders, wait here for us until we come again unto you; and, behold, Aaron and Hur are with you; if anyone has any matters to settle, let him come unto them.
EXO.24.15	Then Moses went up into the mount, and a cloud covered the mount.
EXO.24.16	And the glory of the 
EXO.24.17	And the sight of the glory of the 
EXO.24.18	And Moses entered into the midst of the cloud and went up into the mount, and Moses was in the mount forty days and forty nights.
EXO.25.1	And the 
EXO.25.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel that they bring me an offering; of every man that gives it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.
EXO.25.3	And this shall be the offering which ye shall take of them: gold and silver and brass
EXO.25.4	and blue and purple and scarlet and fine linen and goats’ hair
EXO.25.5	and rams’ skins dyed red and badgers’ skins and cedar wood,
EXO.25.6	oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense,
EXO.25.7	onyx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and in the pectoral.
EXO.25.8	And let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.
EXO.25.9	According to all that I show thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its vessels, even so shall ye make it.
EXO.25.10	And they shall make an ark of cedar wood; two cubits and a half shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.
EXO.25.11	And thou shalt cover it with pure gold; within and without shalt thou cover it and shalt make upon it a moulding of gold round about.
EXO.25.12	And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it and put them in the four corners thereof, and two rings shall be in the one side of it and two rings in the other side of it.
EXO.25.13	And thou shalt make staves of cedar wood and overlay them with gold.
EXO.25.14	And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.
EXO.25.15	The staves shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken from it.
EXO.25.16	And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.
EXO.25.17	And thou shalt make a seat of reconciliation of pure gold; two cubits and a half shall be its length and a cubit and a half its breadth.
EXO.25.18	And thou shalt make two cherubim of gold; of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the seat of reconciliation.
EXO.25.19	And make one cherub on the one end and the other cherub on the other end: even of the seat of reconciliation shall ye make the cherubim on the two ends thereof.
EXO.25.20	And the cherubim shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the seat of reconciliation with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the seat of reconciliation shall the faces of the cherubim be.
EXO.25.21	And thou shalt put the seat of reconciliation above upon the ark, and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
EXO.25.22	And there I will meet with thee, and I will speak with thee from above the seat of reconciliation, from between the two cherubim which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the sons of Israel.
EXO.25.23	Thou shalt likewise make a table of cedar wood; two cubits shall be its length and a cubit its breadth, and a cubit and a half its height.
EXO.25.24	And thou shalt cover it with pure gold and make a moulding of gold round about it.
EXO.25.25	And thou shalt make unto it a border of a handbreadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden moulding to its border round about.
EXO.25.26	And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.

EXO.31.11	and the anointing oil and aromatic incense for the sanctuary; they shall do according to all that I have commanded thee.
EXO.31.12	And the 
EXO.31.13	And thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, With all this ye shall keep my sabbaths; for it is a sign between me and you throughout your ages; that ye may know that I am the 
EXO.31.14	Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore; for it is holy unto you; those that defile it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people.
EXO.31.15	Six days shall work be done; but the seventh, the sabbath of rest, shall be holy to the 
EXO.31.16	Therefore the sons of Israel shall keep the sabbath, to observe the sabbath throughout their ages for a perpetual covenant.
EXO.31.17	It is a sign between me and the sons of Israel for ever; for in six days the 
EXO.31.18	And he gave unto Moses, when he finished speaking with him upon Mount Sinai, two tables of the testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
EXO.32.1	And when the people saw that Moses delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto Aaron and said unto him, Rise up, make us gods which shall go before us; for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
EXO.32.2	And Aaron said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me.
EXO.32.3	Then all the people broke off the golden earrings which were in their ears and brought them unto Aaron,
EXO.32.4	who took them from their hands and fashioned it with a graving tool and made of it a molten calf. Then they said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
EXO.32.5	And seeing this, Aaron built an altar before the calf; and Aaron made a proclamation and said, Tomorrow shall be a feast unto the 
EXO.32.6	And they rose up early on the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play.
EXO.32.7	Then the 
EXO.32.8	They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them; they have made themselves a molten calf and have worshipped it and have sacrificed unto it and said, These are thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
EXO.32.9	The 
EXO.32.10	Now therefore let me alone that my wrath may wax hot in them and consume them; and I will put thee over a great nation.
EXO.32.11	Then Moses grieved before the 
EXO.32.12	Why should the Egyptians speak and say, For evil did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains and to consume them from upon the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath and repent of the evil of thy people.
EXO.32.13	Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, thy slaves, to whom thou didst sware by thine own self and hast said unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall take it for inheritance for ever.
EXO.32.14	Then the 
EXO.32.15	And Moses turned and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand; the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written.
EXO.32.16	And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables.
EXO.32.17	And Joshua, hearing the noise of the people as they shouted, said unto Moses, There is a noise of war in the camp.
EXO.32.18	And he answered, It is not the voice of those that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of those that cry for being overcome, but the noise of those that sing that I hear.
EXO.32.19	And it came to pass as soon as he came near unto the camp and he saw the calf and the dances, anger caused Moses to wax hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands and broke them at the foot of the mount.
EXO.32.20	And he took the calf which they had made and burnt it in the fire and ground it to powder and scattered it upon the waters and made the sons of Israel drink it.
EXO.32.21	And Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people do unto thee that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them?
EXO.32.22	And Aaron answered, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot; thou knowest the people that they are inclined to evil.
EXO.32.23	For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us, for as for this Moses, the man that brought us up out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what is become of him.
EXO.32.24	And I answered unto them, Whoever has any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it to me and I cast it into the fire, and this calf came out.
EXO.32.25	And when Moses saw that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies),
EXO.32.26	Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, Who is on the 
EXO.32.27	And he said unto them, Thus hath the 
EXO.32.28	And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.
EXO.32.29	Then Moses had said, Today you have consecrated yourselves to the 
EXO.32.30	And it came to pass on the next day that Moses said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin, but now I will go up unto the 
EXO.32.31	Then Moses returned unto the 
EXO.32.32	that thou wilt forgive their sin; and if not, blot me now out of thy book which thou hast written.
EXO.32.33	And the 
EXO.32.34	Therefore go now, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee; behold, my Angel shall go before thee; nevertheless in the day of my visitation I will visit their sin in them.
EXO.32.35	And the 
EXO.33.1	And the 
EXO.33.2	(And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.)
EXO.33.3	Unto the land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiffnecked people lest I consume thee in the way.
EXO.33.4	And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned, and no one put on their ornaments.
EXO.33.5	For the 
EXO.33.6	Then the sons of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments from Mount Horeb on.
EXO.33.7	And Moses took the tabernacle and pitched it outside the camp, afar off from the camp, and called it the tabernacle of the testimony. And it came to pass that every one who sought the 
EXO.33.8	And it came to pass when Moses would go out unto the tabernacle, that all the people would rise up and stand each one at the door of their tent, with their gaze following Moses until he was gone into the tabernacle.
EXO.33.9	And when Moses would enter into the tabernacle, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the door of the tabernacle, and the 
EXO.33.10	And when all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door, all the people would rise up, each one in the door of their tent, and worship.
EXO.33.11	And the 
EXO.33.12	And Moses said unto the 
EXO.33.13	Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight; and consider that this nation is thy people.
EXO.33.14	And he said, My presence {Heb. faces} shall go with thee, and I will give thee rest.
EXO.33.15	And he said unto him, If thy presence {Heb. faces} is not to go before us, do not bring us out of here.
EXO.33.16	For in what shall it be known here that I have found grace in thy sight, I and thy people, but in that thou goest with us, and I and thy people will be separated from all the peoples that are upon the face of the earth?
EXO.33.17	And the 
EXO.33.18	Then he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory.
EXO.33.19	And he replied, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name that I AM before thee; and I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and will show clemency on whom I will show clemency.
EXO.33.20	He further said, Thou canst not see my face; for no man shall see me and live.
EXO.33.21	And the 
EXO.33.22	and it shall come to pass while my glory passes by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock and will cover thee with my hand until I have passed by.
EXO.33.23	Then I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts, but my face {Heb. faces} shall not be seen.
EXO.34.1	And the 
EXO.34.2	And be ready for tomorrow and come up in the morning unto Mount Sinai and present thyself there to me in the top of the mount.
EXO.34.3	And no man shall come up with thee; neither let anyone be seen throughout all the mount; neither let the sheep nor the cows feed before the mount.
EXO.34.4	And he hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and Moses rose up early in the morning and went up unto Mount Sinai, as the 
EXO.34.5	And the 
EXO.34.6	And as the 
EXO.34.7	keeping mercy for thousands, letting go of iniquity and rebellion and sin; and by no means will I absolve the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the sons and upon the sons’ sons, unto the third and to the fourth generation.
EXO.34.8	Then Moses made haste and bowed his head toward the earth and worshipped.
EXO.34.9	And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us, for this is a stiffnecked people, and forgive our iniquity and our sin and possess us.
EXO.34.10	And he said, Behold, I make a covenant before all thy people: I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation; and all the people among whom thou art shall see the work of the 
EXO.34.11	Keep that which I command thee this day; behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.
EXO.34.12	Keep thyself lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land where thou must enter lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee;
EXO.34.13	but ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves;
EXO.34.14	for thou shalt worship no other god; for the 
EXO.34.15	Therefore thou shalt not make a covenant with the inhabitants of that land because they shall fornicate after their gods and do sacrifice unto their gods, and they shall call thee, and thou shalt eat of their sacrifices
EXO.34.16	or take of their daughters unto thy sons, and when their daughters go fornicating after their gods they shall make thy sons also fornicate after their gods.
EXO.34.17	Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.
EXO.34.18	The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib; for in the month Abib thou didst come out from Egypt.
EXO.34.19	All that opens the womb is mine; and every firstborn among thy livestock, whether of cow or of sheep, that is male.
EXO.34.20	But the firstborn of an ass thou shalt ransom with a lamb, and if thou ransom him not, then shalt thou cut off his head. All the firstborn of thy sons thou shalt ransom, and none shall appear before me empty.
EXO.34.21	Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt cease; in ploughing time and in harvest thou shalt cease.
EXO.34.22	And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks, of the firstfruits of the reaping of the wheat, and the feast of ingathering at the year’s end.
EXO.34.23	Three times in the year shall all your males appear before the GOD who is Lord of all, the God of Israel.
EXO.34.24	For I will cast the Gentiles out of thy presence and enlarge thy borders; neither shall anyone covet thy land when thou shalt go up to be seen before the 
EXO.34.25	Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice upon anything leavened; neither shall any of the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left unto the morning.
EXO.34.26	The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the 
EXO.34.27	And the 
EXO.34.28	And he was there with the 
EXO.34.29	And it came to pass, as Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, while he came down from the mount, that Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone after he had talked with him.
EXO.34.30	And when Aaron and all the sons of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.
EXO.34.31	And Moses called them, and Aaron and all the princes of the congregation returned unto him, and Moses talked with them.
EXO.34.32	And afterward all the sons of Israel came near, and he gave them in commandment all that the 
EXO.34.33	And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face.
EXO.34.34	But when Moses went in before the 
EXO.34.35	And the sons of Israel would see the face of Moses that the skin of Moses’ face shone, and Moses would put the veil upon his face again until he would go in to speak with him.
EXO.35.1	And Moses gathered all the congregation of the sons of Israel together and said unto them, These are the words which the 
EXO.35.2	Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day shall be holy unto you, a sabbath of rest to the 
EXO.35.3	Ye shall kindle no fire in any of your habitations upon the sabbath day.
EXO.35.4	And Moses spoke unto all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, This is what the 
EXO.35.5	Take ye from among you an offering unto the 
EXO.35.6	blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats’ hair;
EXO.35.7	rams’ skins dyed red, badgers’ skins, cedar wood;
EXO.35.8	oil for the light, spices for anointing oil and for the aromatic incense;
EXO.35.9	onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and for the pectoral.
EXO.35.10	And everyone that is wise hearted among you shall come and make all that the 
EXO.35.11	The tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its hooks, and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;
EXO.35.12	the ark and its staves, the seat of reconciliation, and the veil of the tent,
EXO.35.13	the table and its staves and all its vessels, and the showbread;
EXO.35.14	the lampstand also for the light and its vessels and its lamps, and the oil for the light;
EXO.35.15	and the altar of incense and its staves, and the anointing oil, and the aromatic incense, and the hanging for the door at the entrance of the tabernacle,
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering with its brasen grate, its staves, and all its vessels, the laver and its base,
EXO.35.17	the hangings of the court, its pillars, and their sockets, and the hanging for the door of the court,
EXO.35.18	the stakes of the tabernacle and the stakes of the court, and their cords,
EXO.35.19	the clothing of service to minister in the sanctuary, that is, the holy garments of Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons to serve in the priesthood.
EXO.35.20	And all the congregation of the sons of Israel departed from the presence of Moses.
EXO.35.21	And they came, every man whose heart stirred him up, and every one whose spirit made them willing, and they brought the 
EXO.35.22	And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing hearted, and brought chains and earrings, rings and bracelets, and all jewels of gold; and anyone that offered an offering of gold unto the 
EXO.35.23	Every man who had blue or purple or scarlet or fine linen or goats’ hair or red skins of rams or badgers’ skins brought them.
EXO.35.24	Anyone that offered an offering of silver or brass brought the offering unto the 
EXO.35.25	And all the women that were wise hearted spun with their hands and brought that which they had spun: blue or purple or scarlet or fine linen.
EXO.35.26	And all the women whose heart lifted them up in wisdom spun goats’ hair.
EXO.35.27	And the princes brought onyx stones and the stones to be set for the ephod and for the pectoral;
EXO.35.28	and aromatic spice and oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the aromatic incense.
EXO.35.29	Of the sons of Israel, men and women, all that had a willing heart to bring for all the work, which the Lord had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses, brought a voluntary offering unto the 
EXO.35.30	And Moses said unto the sons of Israel, See, the 
EXO.35.31	and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in intelligence, in science, and in all manner of workmanship;
EXO.35.32	to invent and devise, to work in gold and in silver and in brass,
EXO.35.33	and in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of cunning work.
EXO.35.34	And he has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.
EXO.35.35	And he has filled them with wisdom of heart to work all manner of work of the engraver and of the cunning workman and of the embroiderer, in blue and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver: that they may do any work, and invent every design.
EXO.36.1	Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab and every wise hearted man unto whom the 
EXO.36.2	And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab and every wise hearted man in whose heart the 
EXO.36.3	and they took from the presence of Moses all the offering which the sons of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it with. And they brought yet unto him free will offerings every morning.
EXO.36.4	So much that all the wise men that wrought all the work of the sanctuary came every man from his work which they made,
EXO.36.5	and they spoke with Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the work of the ministry which the 
EXO.36.6	And Moses commanded it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing,
EXO.36.7	for they had abundant material for all the work; more than enough to make it with.
EXO.36.8	And everyone with a wise heart among those that wrought the work made the tabernacle of ten curtains of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet, which they made of cunning work, with cherubim.
EXO.36.9	The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits; the curtains were all of one size.
EXO.36.10	And he coupled the five curtains one unto another; and the other five curtains he coupled one unto another.
EXO.36.11	And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain in the border in the coupling; likewise he made in the border of the second curtain in the coupling.
EXO.36.12	Fifty loops made he in one curtain, and fifty loops made he in the edge of the second curtain in the border in the coupling, the loops in front of the others.
EXO.36.13	And he made fifty hooks of gold and coupled the curtains one unto another with the hooks, so it became one tabernacle.
EXO.36.14	Likewise he made curtains of goats’ hair for the tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains.
EXO.36.15	The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain; the eleven curtains were of one size.
EXO.36.16	And he coupled five curtains by themselves and six curtains by themselves.
EXO.36.17	And he made fifty loops upon the edge of the uttermost curtain in the coupling, and he made another fifty loops upon the edge of the other curtain in the coupling.
EXO.36.18	And he also made fifty hooks of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one.
EXO.36.19	And he made a covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and another covering of badgers’ skins above that.
EXO.36.20	And he made the boards for the tabernacle of cedar wood, standing up.
EXO.36.21	The length of each board was ten cubits, and the breadth one cubit and a half.
EXO.36.22	Each board had two tenons, equally distant one from another; thus did he make all the boards of the tabernacle.
EXO.36.23	He made, therefore, the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards for the south side towards the Negev.
EXO.36.24	He also made the forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards: two sockets under one board for its two tenons and two sockets under another board for its two tenons.
EXO.36.25	And for the other side of the tabernacle, on the side of the Aquilon, {the north wind} he made twenty boards,
EXO.36.26	with their forty sockets of silver: two sockets under one board, and two sockets under another board.
EXO.36.27	And for the westward side of the tabernacle he made six boards.
EXO.36.28	And he made two boards for the corners of the tabernacle in the two sides,
EXO.36.29	which were coupled beneath and likewise coupled together above to a ring; thus he did to both of them in both the corners.
EXO.36.30	There were, therefore, eight boards; and their sockets were sixteen sockets of silver, under every board two sockets.
EXO.36.31	And he also made bars of cedar wood: five for the boards of the one side of the tabernacle,
EXO.36.32	and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle for the westward side.
EXO.36.33	And he made the middle bar to pass through the boards from the one end to the other.
EXO.36.34	And he covered the boards with gold and made their rings of gold for the bars to pass through and covered the bars with gold also.
EXO.36.35	Likewise he made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twined linen, which he made with cherubim of cunning work.
EXO.36.36	And for it he made four pillars of cedar and covered them with gold; their capitals were of gold; and he cast for them four sockets of silver.
EXO.36.37	Likewise he made the veil for the tabernacle door of blue and purple and scarlet and fine twined linen, of needlework,
EXO.36.38	and its five pillars with their capitals; and he covered their heads and their fillets with gold; and their five sockets he made of brass.
EXO.37.1	Bezaleel also made the ark of cedar wood; two cubits and a half was the length of it, a cubit and a half the breadth of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it;
EXO.37.2	and he covered it with pure gold within and without and made a moulding of gold to it round about.
EXO.37.3	And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four corners of it: even two rings upon the one side of it and two rings upon the other side of it.
EXO.37.4	He also made the staves of cedar wood and covered them with gold.
EXO.37.5	And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, to bear the ark.
EXO.37.6	He made the seat of reconciliation likewise of pure gold; two cubits and a half was its length, and one cubit and a half its breadth.
EXO.37.7	He also made the two cherubim of gold, beaten out of one piece he made them, on the two ends of the seat of reconciliation;
EXO.37.8	one cherub on the end on this side and another cherub on the other end on that side of the seat of reconciliation; he made the cherubim on the two ends thereof.
EXO.37.9	And the cherubim spread out their wings above, covering with their wings the seat of reconciliation, with their faces one to another; the faces of the cherubim were facing the covering.
EXO.37.10	And he made the table of cedar wood; two cubits was the length thereof and a cubit the breadth thereof and a cubit and a half the height thereof;
EXO.37.11	and he covered it with pure gold and made it a moulding of gold round about.
EXO.37.12	He also made it a border of a handbreadth round about and made a moulding of gold for the border thereof round about.
EXO.37.13	And he cast for it four rings of gold and put the rings upon the four corners that correspond to the four feet thereof.
EXO.37.14	Over against the border were the rings, the places for the staves to bear the table.
EXO.37.15	And he made the staves of cedar wood and covered them with gold, to bear the table.
EXO.37.16	He also made the vessels which were upon the table, its dishes, its spoons, its bowls, and its covers to cover the bread, of pure gold.
EXO.37.17	He made the lampstand likewise of pure gold; of beaten work he made the lampstand, its shaft and its branch, its bowls, its knops, and its flowers were of the same.
EXO.37.18	Out of the sides thereof went six branches, three branches out of one side of the lampstand and three branches out of the other side of the lampstand;
EXO.37.19	in one branch there were three bowls made after the fashion of almonds, a knop and a flower; and in the other branch there were three bowls made like almonds, a knop and a flower, so throughout the six branches going out of the lampstand.
EXO.37.20	And in the lampstand were four bowls made like almonds, their knops, and their flowers,
EXO.37.21	and a knop under the two branches of the same and another knop under two branches of the same and a knop under the two other branches of the same, according to the six branches going out of it.
EXO.37.22	Their knops and their branches were of the same; all of it was one beaten work of pure gold.
EXO.37.23	He made likewise its seven lamps and its snuffers and its snuff dishes of pure gold.
EXO.37.24	Of a talent of pure gold he made it and all its vessels.
EXO.37.25	He also made the altar of incense of cedar wood: the length of it was a cubit and the breadth of it a cubit; it was square; and two cubits was the height of it; its horns were of the same piece.
EXO.37.26	And he covered it with pure gold, its top and its sides round about and its horns; and he made it a moulding of gold round about.
EXO.37.27	He also made two rings of gold for it under the moulding thereof, by the two corners of it, upon its two sides, to be places for the staves to bear it with.
EXO.37.28	And he made the staves of cedar wood and covered them with gold.
EXO.37.29	He made likewise the oil of the holy anointing and the pure aromatic incense, according to the work of the apothecary.
EXO.38.1	And he made the altar of burnt offering of cedar wood: five cubits was its length and five cubits its breadth; it was square, and its height was three cubits.
EXO.38.2	And he made its horns on the four corners of it; its horns were of the same piece; and he covered it with brass.
EXO.38.3	He made likewise all the vessels of the altar: the pots and the shovels and the basins and the fleshhooks, and the firepans; all its vessels he made of brass.
EXO.38.4	And he made for the altar the brasen grate of network under the circumference thereof beneath unto the midst of it.
EXO.38.5	He also cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of brass, to be places for the staves.
EXO.38.6	And he made the staves of cedar wood and covered them with brass.
EXO.38.7	And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the altar, to bear it with; he made the altar hollow with boards.
EXO.38.8	He also made the laver of brass and the base of it of brass, of the looking glasses of the women who were vigilant at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
EXO.38.9	He made the court likewise; on the south side towards the Negev the hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, one hundred cubits;
EXO.38.10	their pillars were twenty with their twenty brasen sockets; the capitals of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.
EXO.38.11	And for the side of the Aquilon, the hangings were one hundred cubits, their pillars twenty with their twenty sockets of brass, the capitals of the pillars and their fillets of silver.
EXO.38.12	On the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten and their sockets ten, the capitals of the pillars and their fillets of silver,
EXO.38.13	and for the east side eastward fifty cubits
EXO.38.14	the hangings of the one side fifteen cubits, their pillars three, and their sockets three;
EXO.38.15	and for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits, their pillars three and their sockets three.
EXO.38.16	All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined linen.
EXO.38.17	And the sockets for the pillars were of brass, the capitals of the pillars and their fillets of silver and the coverings of their heads of silver; likewise all the pillars of the court were filleted with silver.
EXO.38.18	And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen; twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth was five cubits, the same as the hangings of the court.
EXO.38.19	And its pillars were four with its four sockets of brass, their capitals of silver, and the coverings of their heads and their fillets of silver.
EXO.38.20	And all the stakes of the tabernacle and of the court round about were of brass.
EXO.38.21	This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of Moses, for the ministry of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar, son to Aaron the priest.
EXO.38.22	And Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made all that the 
EXO.38.23	And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a master workman, an engineer, and an embroiderer in blue and in purple and in scarlet and fine linen.
EXO.38.24	All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of the sanctuary, which was gold of offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
EXO.38.25	And the silver of those that were numbered of the congregation was one hundred talents and one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary:
EXO.38.26	A half per head, that is, half a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be numbered, from twenty years old and upward, which were six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty.
EXO.38.27	And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil: one hundred sockets of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.
EXO.38.28	And of the thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels he made the capitals for the pillars and covered their heads and filleted them.
EXO.38.29	And the brass of the offering was seventy talents and two thousand four hundred shekels,
EXO.38.30	with which he made the sockets to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony and the brasen altar and the brasen grate for it and all the vessels of the altar
EXO.38.31	and the sockets of the court round about and the sockets of the court gate and all the stakes of the tabernacle, and all the stakes of the court round about.

EXO.39.2	He also made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.
EXO.39.3	And they beat the gold into thin plates and cut it into wires to work it in the blue and in the purple and in the scarlet and in the fine linen, with cunning work.
EXO.39.4	They made the shoulder pieces for it to couple it together; by the two edges was it coupled together.
EXO.39.5	And the special girdle of his ephod, that was over it, was of the same, according to the work thereof: of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen as the 
EXO.39.6	And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in settings of gold, graven, as seals are graven, with the names of the sons of Israel.
EXO.39.7	And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod that they should be stones for a memorial to the sons of Israel, as the 
EXO.39.8	He also made the pectoral of cunning work, like the work of the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.
EXO.39.9	It was square; they made the pectoral double; a span was the length thereof and a span the breadth thereof, being doubled.
EXO.39.10	And they set in it four orders of stones. The order was a ruby, an emerald, and a chrysolite: this was the first order.
EXO.39.11	The second order, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a diamond.
EXO.39.12	The third order, a topaz, a turquoise, and an amethyst.
EXO.39.13	And the fourth order, a tarshish (or beryl), an onyx, and a jasper; they were set and inclosed in their settings of gold.
EXO.39.14	The stones were in agreement with the names of the sons of Israel, twelve, in agreement with their names, like the engravings of a seal, each one in agreement with his name, according to the twelve tribes.
EXO.39.15	They also made the small chains upon the pectoral of wreathen work of pure gold.
EXO.39.16	In the same manner they made two settings of gold and two gold rings and put the two rings in the two ends of the pectoral.
EXO.39.17	And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in those two rings on the ends of the pectoral.
EXO.39.18	And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two settings, which they put on the shoulder pieces of the ephod, on the front part of it.
EXO.39.19	And they made two rings of gold and put them on the two ends of the pectoral upon the border of it, which was on the lower side of the ephod.
EXO.39.20	And they made two other golden rings and put them on the two sides of the ephod underneath toward the front part of it, in the front of its coupling, above the special girdle of the ephod.
EXO.39.21	And they bound the pectoral by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue lace, that it might be above the special girdle of the ephod and that the pectoral might not be loosed from the ephod, as the 
EXO.39.22	And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue,
EXO.39.23	with its collar in the midst of the robe, as the collar of a habergeon, with a band round about the collar that it should not rend.
EXO.39.24	And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue, purple, scarlet, and twined linen.
EXO.39.25	They also made the bells of pure gold and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between the pomegranates;
EXO.39.26	A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round about the hem of the robe to minister in, as the 
EXO.39.27	And they made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron and for his sons,
EXO.39.28	likewise the mitre of fine linen and the decorations of the tiaras of fine linen and the linen underwear of fine twined linen,
EXO.39.29	also the girdle of fine twined linen and blue and purple and scarlet of needlework, as the 
EXO.39.30	And they made the open flower, the crown of holiness, of pure gold and wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a seal, HOLINESS UNTO THE 
EXO.39.31	And they tied unto it a lace of blue to fasten it over the mitre, as the 
EXO.39.32	Thus was all the work of the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony finished, and the sons of Israel did according to all that the 
EXO.39.33	And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tabernacle and all its furniture, its hooks, its boards, its bars and its pillars and its sockets,
EXO.39.34	and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red and the covering of badgers’ skins and the veil of the curtain,
EXO.39.35	the ark of the testimony and its staves, and the seat of reconciliation,

EXO.39.41	the clothing of service for ministry in the sanctuary, and the holy garments for Aaron the priest and his sons’ garments, to minister in the priesthood.
EXO.39.42	According to all that the 
EXO.39.43	And Moses looked upon all the work, and, behold, they had done it as the 
EXO.40.1	And the 
EXO.40.2	In the day of the first month, the first of the month shalt thou set up the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the testimony.
EXO.40.3	And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony and cover the ark with the veil.
EXO.40.4	And thou shalt bring in the table and set in order the things that are to be set in order upon it, and thou shalt bring in the lampstand and light its lamps.
EXO.40.5	And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before the ark of the testimony and put the hanging of the door to the tabernacle.
EXO.40.6	Then thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the door of the tabernacle, of the tabernacle of the testimony.
EXO.40.7	And thou shalt set the laver between the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar and shalt put water therein.
EXO.40.8	Last, thou shalt set up the court round about and hang up the hanging at the court gate.
EXO.40.9	And thou shalt take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it and shalt sanctify it with all its vessels, and it shall be holy.
EXO.40.10	And thou shalt also anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all its vessels and sanctify the altar, and it shall be an altar most holy.
EXO.40.11	In the same manner thou shalt anoint the laver and its base and sanctify it.
EXO.40.12	And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony and wash them with water.
EXO.40.13	And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments and anoint him and sanctify him, that he may be my priest.
EXO.40.14	And thou shalt bring his sons and clothe them with coats.
EXO.40.15	And thou shalt anoint them as thou didst anoint their father, and they shall be my priests; and it shall be that their anointing shall be unto them for a perpetual priesthood throughout their generations.
EXO.40.16	Thus did Moses; according to all that the 
EXO.40.17	And it came to pass in the first month in the second year on the first day of the month that the tabernacle was raised up.
EXO.40.18	And Moses caused the tabernacle to be raised up and fastened its sockets and set up its boards and put in its bars and caused its pillars to be raised up.
EXO.40.19	And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent above upon it, as the 
EXO.40.20	And he took and put the testimony into the ark and set the staves on the ark and put the seat of reconciliation upon the ark above,
EXO.40.21	and he brought the ark into the tabernacle and set up the veil of the curtain and covered the ark of the testimony, as the 
EXO.40.22	And he put the table in the tabernacle of the testimony, upon the side of the Aquilon of the tabernacle, outside the veil.
EXO.40.23	And he set the bread in order upon it before the 
EXO.40.24	And he put the lampstand in the tabernacle of the testimony, over against the table, on the side of the Negev of the tabernacle.
EXO.40.25	And he lighted the lamps before the 
EXO.40.26	He also put the golden altar in the tabernacle of the testimony before the veil.
EXO.40.27	And he burnt aromatic incense on it, as the 
EXO.40.28	In the same manner he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.
EXO.40.29	And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the tabernacle, of the tabernacle of the testimony, and offered upon it the burnt offering and the present, as the 
EXO.40.30	And he set the laver between the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar and put water in it, to wash with.
EXO.40.31	And Moses and Aaron and his sons would wash their hands and their feet in it.
EXO.40.32	When they would enter into the tabernacle of the testimony and when they would come near unto the altar, they washed themselves, as the 
EXO.40.33	Last he raised up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar and set up the hanging of the court gate. Thus Moses finished the work.
EXO.40.34	Then a cloud covered the tabernacle of the testimony, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.35	And Moses was not able to enter into the tabernacle of the testimony because the cloud was upon it, and the glory of the 
EXO.40.36	And when the cloud lifted itself up from over the tabernacle, the sons of Israel went onward in all their journeys;
EXO.40.37	but if the cloud did not lift itself up, then they did not journey until the day that it lifted itself up.
EXO.40.38	For the cloud of the 
LEV.1.1	And the 
LEV.1.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When any of you offers an offering unto the 
LEV.1.3	If his offering is a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it of his own free will at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the 
LEV.1.4	And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and he shall accept it to reconcile him.
LEV.1.5	Then he shall kill the bullock before the 
LEV.1.6	And he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into its pieces.
LEV.1.7	And the sons of Aaron, the priest, shall put fire upon the altar and lay the wood in order upon the fire.
LEV.1.8	Then the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which shall be upon the altar;
LEV.1.9	but he shall wash its intestines and its legs in water, and the priest shall incense it all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice, an offering on fire, of a very acceptable aroma unto the 
LEV.1.10	And if his offering is of the sheep, namely of the lambs or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice, he shall offer a male without blemish.
LEV.1.11	And he must kill it on the side of the altar, to the Aquilon before the 
LEV.1.12	And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat; and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which shall be upon the altar;
LEV.1.13	and he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water; and the priest shall offer it all and incense it upon the altar; it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering on fire, of a very acceptable aroma unto the 
LEV.1.14	And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the 
LEV.1.15	And the priest shall offer it upon the altar and wring off its head and incense it on the altar; and its blood shall be wrung out upon the side of the altar:
LEV.1.16	And he shall pluck away its crop and its feathers and cast them beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes with the burnt fat.
LEV.1.17	And he shall cleave it by its wings but shall not divide it in two; and the priest shall incense it upon the altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire; it is a burnt sacrifice, an offering on fire of a very acceptable aroma unto the 
LEV.2.1	And when any person will offer a present unto the 
LEV.2.2	and he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests, who shall take out a handful of the flour thereof, with its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall incense it upon the altar, to be an offering on fire, of an aroma very acceptable unto the 
LEV.2.3	And that which is left of the present shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the offerings on fire of the 
LEV.2.4	And if thou shall offer a present baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
LEV.2.5	And if thy present is an offering baked in a pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
LEV.2.6	Thou shalt part it in pieces and pour oil thereon; it shall be a present.
LEV.2.7	And if thy present is an offering cooked in a pot, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.
LEV.2.8	And thou shalt bring the present that is made of these things unto the 
LEV.2.9	And the priest shall take from that present a memorial thereof and shall incense it upon the altar; it shall be an offering on fire, of a very acceptable aroma unto the 
LEV.2.10	And that which is left of the present shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; it is a thing most holy of the offerings on fire of the 
LEV.2.11	No present which ye shall offer unto the 
LEV.2.12	In the offering of the firstfruits ye shall offer them unto the 
LEV.2.13	And every offering of thy present shalt thou season with salt, and thou shalt never allow the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy present; with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.
LEV.2.14	And if thou offer a present of thy firstfruits unto the 
LEV.2.15	And thou shalt put oil upon it and lay frankincense thereon: this shall be a present.
LEV.2.16	And the priest shall incense the memorial of it, part of the beaten grain thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: this shall be an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.3.1	And if his offering is a sacrifice of peace, if he offers it of the bovine cattle, whether it is male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the 
LEV.3.2	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering and kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
LEV.3.3	Then he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace for an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.3.4	and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks and with the kidneys; he shall take away the caul above the liver.
LEV.3.5	And Aaron’s sons shall incense it on the altar with the burnt sacrifice, which shall be upon the wood that is on the fire; and this shall be an offering on fire, of a very acceptable aroma unto the 
LEV.3.6	And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace unto the 
LEV.3.7	If he offers a lamb for his offering, he shall offer it before the 
LEV.3.8	and he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering and then kill it before the tabernacle of the testimony; and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood round about upon the altar.
LEV.3.9	And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.3.10	likewise the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them and that which is upon the flanks and with the kidneys he shall take away the caul above the liver.
LEV.3.11	And the priest shall incense it upon the altar, and this shall be the food of the offering on fire unto the 
LEV.3.12	And if his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before the 
LEV.3.13	and he shall lay his hand upon the head of it and kill it before the tabernacle of the testimony; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood upon the altar round about.
LEV.3.14	Then he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.3.15	and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them and that which is upon the flanks and with the kidneys he shall take away the caul above the liver.
LEV.3.16	And the priest shall incense them upon the altar; and this shall be the food of the offering on fire of a very acceptable aroma unto the 
LEV.3.17	It shall be a perpetual statute for your ages; throughout all your dwellings that ye shall eat no fat and no blood.
LEV.4.1	And the 
LEV.4.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the 
LEV.4.3	if the priest that is anointed sins according to the guiltiness of the people, he shall offer for his sin, which he has committed, a young bullock without blemish unto the 
LEV.4.4	And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony before the 
LEV.4.5	And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood and bring it to the tabernacle of the testimony;
LEV.4.6	and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the 
LEV.4.7	And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of aromatic incense before the 
LEV.4.8	And he shall take off all the fat of the bullock for the sin: the fat that covers the intestines and all the fat that is upon the inwards,
LEV.4.9	and the two kidneys and the fat that is upon them, and that which is upon the flanks and with the kidneys he shall take away the caul above the liver,
LEV.4.10	as it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace; and the priest shall incense them upon the altar of the burnt offering.
LEV.4.11	And the skin of the bullock and all its flesh, with its head and with its legs, and his intestines and his dung,
LEV.4.12	even the whole bullock he shall carry forth outside the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes with the burnt fat are poured out and burn it on the wood with fire, where the ashes with the burnt fat are poured out shall it be burnt.
LEV.4.13	And if the whole congregation of Israel sins through ignorance and the thing was hid from the eyes of the assembly and they have done something against any of the commandments of the 
LEV.4.14	when the sin, which they have committed, is understood, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock as the sin and bring it before the tabernacle of the testimony.
LEV.4.15	And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the 
LEV.4.16	And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock’s blood to the tabernacle of the testimony.
LEV.4.17	And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood and sprinkle it seven times before the 
LEV.4.18	And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar which is before the 
LEV.4.19	And he shall take all the fat and incense it upon the altar.
LEV.4.20	And he shall do with this bullock as he did with the bullock of the sin, so shall he do with this; and thus the priest shall reconcile them, and they shall obtain forgiveness.
LEV.4.21	And he shall carry forth the bullock outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bullock; it is the sin of the congregation.
LEV.4.22	When the prince has sinned and done something through ignorance against any of the commandments of the 
LEV.4.23	as soon as he is notified of his sin, which he has committed, then he shall bring his offering, a he goat, a male without blemish.
LEV.4.24	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the he goat and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the 
LEV.4.25	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin with his finger and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering and shall pour out its blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering;
LEV.4.26	and he shall burn all its fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace; thus shall the priest reconcile him as concerning his sin, and he shall have forgiveness.
LEV.4.27	And if any one of the people of the land sins through ignorance, by doing something against any of the commandments of the 
LEV.4.28	as soon as his sin, which he has committed, comes to his knowledge, then he shall bring as his offering, a she goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed.
LEV.4.29	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin and slay the sin in the place of the burnt offering.
LEV.4.30	Then the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering and shall pour out all its blood at the bottom of the altar.
LEV.4.31	And he shall take away all its fat, as the fat was taken away from off the sacrifice of peace; and the priest shall incense it upon the altar in a very acceptable aroma unto the 
LEV.4.32	And if he brings a lamb as his offering, as the sin, he shall bring a female without blemish.
LEV.4.33	And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin and slay the sin in the place where they kill the burnt offering.
LEV.4.34	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering and shall pour out all its blood at the bottom of the altar.
LEV.4.35	And he shall take away all its fat, as the fat of the lamb of the sacrifice of peace was taken away; and the priest shall incense it upon the altar in an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.5.1	And when a person commits sin, because they were called to testify under oath, and he was a witness that has seen or known of it, if he does not declare it, then he shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.5.2	Likewise the person who touches any unclean thing, whether it is a carcase of an unclean beast or a carcase of unclean animal or the carcase of an unclean serpent, even if it is hidden from him, he shall be unclean and guilty.
LEV.5.3	Or if he touches the uncleanness of man, whatever uncleanness it is that a man shall be defiled with, and it is hid from him, if afterward he should know of it, then he shall be guilty.
LEV.5.4	Also the person who swears, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or to do good, whatever it is that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it is hid from him, when he knows of it, then he shall be guilty in one of these.
LEV.5.5	And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these things, that he shall confess that he has sinned;
LEV.5.6	and he shall bring for his guilt unto the 
LEV.5.7	And if he is not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for the guilt of his sin two turtledoves or two young pigeons unto the 
LEV.5.8	And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that which is for the sin first and wring off its head from its neck but shall not divide it asunder;
LEV.5.9	and he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar; it is sin.
LEV.5.10	And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to the ordinance; and thus shall the priest reconcile him for his sin in which he has sinned, and he shall have forgiveness.
LEV.5.11	But if he is not able to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for his sin; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any frankincense thereon, for it is sin.
LEV.5.12	Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and incense it on the altar upon the other offerings on fire unto the 
LEV.5.13	Thus shall the priest reconcile him from his sin in which he has sinned in one of these things, and he shall have forgiveness; and that which remains shall be the priest’s, as with a present.
LEV.5.14	And the 
LEV.5.15	When any person commits a trespass and sins through ignorance, in the holy things of the 
LEV.5.16	And he shall pay for the sin that he has done in the holy thing and shall add the fifth part thereto and give it unto the priest; and the priest shall reconcile him with the ram of the expiation of his guilt, and he shall have forgiveness.
LEV.5.17	Finally, if a person commits a sin by doing any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the 
LEV.5.18	And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, in thy estimation, for the expiation of his guilt, unto the priest; and the priest shall reconcile him from his error which he committed in ignorance, and he shall have forgiveness.
LEV.5.19	It is for his guilt; he is certainly guilty against the 
LEV.6.1	And the 
LEV.6.2	If a person commits a sin, a trespass against the 
LEV.6.3	or has found that which was lost and then denies it and swears falsely, in any of all these in which a man can sin,
LEV.6.4	then it shall be that because he has sinned and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he stole, or for the damage of the slander, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,
LEV.6.5	or all that about which he has sworn falsely, he shall even restore it in the principal and shall add the fifth part more to it, for the one to whom it belongs, and he shall pay in the day of his guiltiness.
LEV.6.6	And he shall bring for the expiation of his guilt unto the 
LEV.6.7	and the priest shall reconcile him before the 
LEV.6.8	And the 
LEV.6.9	Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the burnt offering (it is the burnt offering because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it):
LEV.6.10	And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen underwear shall he put upon his flesh, and when the fire has consumed the burnt offering, he shall take up the ashes with the burnt fat on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
LEV.6.11	Then he shall put off his garments and put on other garments and carry forth the ashes with the burnt fat outside the camp unto a clean place.
LEV.6.12	And the fire burning upon the altar shall not be put out, but the priest shall put wood on it every morning and lay the burnt offering in order upon it, and he shall burn upon it the fat of the peace.
LEV.6.13	The fire shall burn continuously upon the altar; it shall not be put out.
LEV.6.14	And this is the law of the present: the sons of Aaron shall offer it before the 
LEV.6.15	And he shall take of it a handful of the flour of the present and of the oil thereof and all the frankincense which is upon the present and shall incense it upon the altar in an aroma of rest unto the 
LEV.6.16	And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat; without leaven it shall be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the testimony they shall eat it.
LEV.6.17	It shall not be baked with leaven. I have given it unto them for their portion of my offerings on fire; it is most holy, as is the atonement for sin and the expiation of guilt.
LEV.6.18	All the males among the sons of Aaron shall eat of it. It shall be a perpetual statute in your generations concerning the offerings on fire of the 
LEV.6.19	And the 
LEV.6.20	This shall be the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the 
LEV.6.21	In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is fried, thou shalt bring it in; and the cooked pieces of the present shalt thou offer in a very acceptable aroma unto the 
LEV.6.22	And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it; it is a perpetual statute unto the 
LEV.6.23	And every present of a priest shall be completely burnt; it shall not be eaten.
LEV.6.24	And the 
LEV.6.25	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This shall be the law of sin: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the atonement as sin be killed before the 
LEV.6.26	The priest that offers it for the sin shall eat it; in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the testimony.
LEV.6.27	Whatever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be sanctified; and when some of the blood thereof is sprinkled upon any garment, thou shalt wash whatever it was sprinkled on in the holy place.
LEV.6.28	But the earthen vessel wherein it is cooked shall be broken; and if it is cooked in a brazen pot, it shall be both scoured and rinsed in water.
LEV.6.29	All the males among the priests shall eat of it; it is most holy.
LEV.6.30	And no atonement as sin, of which any of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the testimony to reconcile in the sanctuary, shall be eaten; it shall be burnt in the fire.
LEV.7.1	Likewise this shall be the law of the expiation of guilt; it shall be most holy.
LEV.7.2	In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the expiation of guilt, and he shall sprinkle its blood round about upon the altar.
LEV.7.3	And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof, the tail and the fat that covers the intestines
LEV.7.4	and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them and that which is on the flanks and with the kidneys he shall take away the caul that is above the liver.
LEV.7.5	And the priest shall incense them upon the altar for an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.7.6	Every male among the priests shall eat thereof; it shall be eaten in the holy place for it is most holy.
LEV.7.7	As with the sin, so shall it be with the guilt; they shall have the same law; the priest that has made the reconciliation shall have that which was offered.
LEV.7.8	And the priest that offers anyone’s burnt offering, even the priest shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which he has offered.
LEV.7.9	Likewise every present that is baked in the oven and all that is dressed in the fryingpan or in the pot shall be the priest’s that offers it.
LEV.7.10	And every present mingled with oil and dry shall all the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.
LEV.7.11	And this shall be the law of the sacrifice of peace, which shall be offered unto the 
LEV.7.12	If it is offered in thanksgiving, then he shall offer for the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil and unleavened wafers anointed with oil and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.
LEV.7.13	With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his offering in the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace.
LEV.7.14	And out of the whole offering he shall offer part to be elevated in offering unto the 
LEV.7.15	And the flesh of his sacrifice of peace for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
LEV.7.16	But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow, or voluntary, it shall be eaten the same day that he offers his sacrifice; and that which is left of it shall be eaten the next day;
LEV.7.17	but that which is left of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
LEV.7.18	And if any of the flesh of his sacrifice of peace is eaten at all on the third day, he that offers it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him; it shall be an abomination, and the person that eats of it shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.7.19	And the flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire; but every clean person shall eat of this flesh.
LEV.7.20	And the person that eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace, which is of the 
LEV.7.21	Moreover the person that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man or any unclean beast or any abominable unclean thing and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace, which is of the 
LEV.7.22	And the 
LEV.7.23	Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox or of sheep or of goat.
LEV.7.24	And the fat of the beast that died of itself and the fat of that which is torn by beasts may be used in any other use, but ye shall not eat of it.
LEV.7.25	For whosoever eats fat of an animal, of which an offering is made on fire unto the 
LEV.7.26	Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it is of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
LEV.7.27	Whatever person it is that eats any manner of blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.
LEV.7.28	And the 
LEV.7.29	Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, He that offers his sacrifice of peace unto the 
LEV.7.30	his own hands shall bring the offerings which must be burned unto the 
LEV.7.31	And the priest shall incense the fat upon the altar; but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.
LEV.7.32	And ye shall give unto the priest to be elevated in offering the right shoulder of the sacrifices of your peace.
LEV.7.33	He among the sons of Aaron that offers the blood of the peace and the fat shall have the right shoulder for his part;
LEV.7.34	for I have taken from the sons of Israel of their sacrifices of peace the breast that is waved and the shoulder that is set apart and have given them unto Aaron, the priest, and unto his sons by a perpetual statute among the sons of Israel.
LEV.7.35	This is the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of his sons of the offerings on fire unto the 
LEV.7.36	which portions the 
LEV.7.37	This is the law of the burnt offering, of the present, of sin, of guilt, of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of peace,
LEV.7.38	which the 
LEV.8.1	And the 
LEV.8.2	Take Aaron and his sons with him and the garments and the anointing oil and the bullock for the sin and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread
LEV.8.3	and gather all the congregation together at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
LEV.8.4	And Moses did as the 
LEV.8.5	And Moses said unto the congregation, This is what the 
LEV.8.6	Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water.
LEV.8.7	And he put upon him the coat and girded him with the girdle and then clothed him with the robe and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the special girdle of the ephod and bound it unto him therewith.
LEV.8.8	Then he put the pectoral upon him, and he put in the pectoral the Urim and the Thummim.
LEV.8.9	After that he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even upon his forefront, he put the open flower of gold, the crown of holiness, as the 
LEV.8.10	And Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all the things that were therein and sanctified them.
LEV.8.11	And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its vessels, and the laver and its base, to sanctify them.
LEV.8.12	And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head and anointed him, to sanctify him.
LEV.8.13	Then Moses brought Aaron’s sons and put coats upon them and girded them with girdles and put tiaras upon them, as the 
LEV.8.14	Next he brought the bullock of the sin, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock of the sin,
LEV.8.15	and he slew it; and Moses took the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger and removed the sin from the altar and poured the remaining blood at the bottom of the altar and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.
LEV.8.16	After that he took all the fat that was upon the intestines and the caul above the liver and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses incensed it upon the altar.
LEV.8.17	But the bullock and its hide, its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire outside the camp, as the 
LEV.8.18	After that, he brought the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram,
LEV.8.19	and he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
LEV.8.20	And he cut the ram into pieces, and Moses incensed the head and the pieces and the fat.
LEV.8.21	Then he washed the intestines and the legs in water, and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar; it was a burnt sacrifice in a very acceptable aroma, an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.8.22	After that, he brought the other ram, the ram of the consecrations, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram,
LEV.8.23	and he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it and put it upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot.
LEV.8.24	And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ears and upon the thumbs of their right hands and upon the great toes of their right feet; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about;
LEV.8.25	and after that, he took the fat and the tail, and all the fat that was upon the intestines and the caul above the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat and the right shoulder;
LEV.8.26	and out of the basket of unleavened bread that was before the 
LEV.8.27	and he put all of it in Aaron’s hands and in his sons’ hands and caused them to be waved for a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.28	After that Moses took them from their hands and incensed them on the altar upon the burnt offering; they are the consecrations in a very acceptable aroma, an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.8.29	And Moses took the breast and waved it for a wave offering before the 
LEV.8.30	Then Moses took of the anointing oil and of the blood which was upon the altar and sprinkled it upon Aaron and upon his garments and upon his sons and upon his sons’ garments with him and sanctified Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.
LEV.8.31	And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Cook the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and eat it there with the bread that is in the basket of the consecrations, as I have commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
LEV.8.32	And that which remains of the flesh and of the bread ye shall burn with fire.
LEV.8.33	And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the testimony in seven days, until the day that the days of your consecration are fulfilled; because for seven days ye shall be consecrated.
LEV.8.34	As has been done this day, so the 
LEV.8.35	Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony day and night for seven days and keep the charge of the 
LEV.8.36	So Aaron and his sons did all things which the 
LEV.9.1	And it came to pass on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel,
LEV.9.2	and he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf as the sin and a ram as a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before the 
LEV.9.3	And unto the sons of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a he goat as the sin and a calf and a lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;
LEV.9.4	likewise a bullock and a ram for a sacrifice of peace, to kill before the 
LEV.9.5	And they brought that which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the testimony, and all the congregation drew near and stood before the 
LEV.9.6	Then Moses said, This is the thing which the 
LEV.9.7	And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin, and thy burnt offering, and make reconciliation for thyself and for the people; and offer the offering of the people and make reconciliation for them, as the 
LEV.9.8	Then Aaron went unto the altar and slew the calf of his own sin.
LEV.9.9	And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him, and he dipped his finger in the blood and put it upon the horns of the altar and poured out the remaining blood at the bottom of the altar;
LEV.9.10	and the fat and the kidneys and the caul above the liver of the sin, he incensed upon the altar, as the 
LEV.9.11	And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire outside the camp.
LEV.9.12	Likewise he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
LEV.9.13	After that they presented the burnt offering unto him, by its pieces, and the head; and he incensed them upon the altar.
LEV.9.14	Then he washed the intestines and the legs and burnt them with the burnt offering on the altar.
LEV.9.15	He also offered the people’s offering and took the he goat, which was the sin of the people, and slew it and offered it for their sin, as the first.
LEV.9.16	And he brought the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance.
LEV.9.17	Likewise he offered the present and took a handful thereof and incensed it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
LEV.9.18	He also slew the bullock and the ram in sacrifice of peace, which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood (which he sprinkled upon the altar round about)
LEV.9.19	and the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the tail and that which covers the inwards and the kidneys and the caul above the liver;
LEV.9.20	and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar.
LEV.9.21	But the breasts, with the right shoulder, Aaron waved, waving them before the 
LEV.9.22	After that, Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them and came down from offering the sin and the burnt offering and the peace.
LEV.9.23	And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the testimony and came out and blessed the people; and the glory of the 
LEV.9.24	And there came a fire out from before the 
LEV.10.1	And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took each of them his censer and put fire therein and put incense thereon and offered strange fire before the 
LEV.10.2	And there went out fire from the 
LEV.10.3	Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is what the 
LEV.10.4	And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
LEV.10.5	So they went near and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.
LEV.10.6	Then Moses said unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Do not uncover your heads, neither rend your clothes lest ye die and lest wrath come upon the whole congregation; but your brethren, the whole house of Israel, shall lament the burning which the 
LEV.10.7	And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, lest ye die; for the anointing oil of the 
LEV.10.8	And the 
LEV.10.9	Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee when ye go into the tabernacle of the testimony, lest ye die; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations;
LEV.10.10	and this is that ye may discern between the holy and the profane and between the unclean and the clean
LEV.10.11	and that ye may teach the sons of Israel all the statutes which the 
LEV.10.12	And Moses spoke unto Aaron and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the present that remains of the offerings on fire unto the 
LEV.10.13	Ye must, therefore, eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due and thy sons’ due of the offerings of the 
LEV.10.14	And the waved breast and elevated shoulder shall ye likewise eat in a clean place, thou and thy sons and thy daughters with thee; for they are thy due and thy sons’ due, which are given out of the sacrifices of the peace of the sons of Israel.
LEV.10.15	With the offerings of the fat which are to be lit on fire, they shall bring the shoulder which is to be elevated and the breast which shall be waved as a wave offering before the 
LEV.10.16	And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin, and, behold, it was burnt up, and he was angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left alive, saying,
LEV.10.17	Why have ye not eaten of the atonement for sin in the holy place? For it is most holy, and God has given it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, that they may be reconciled before the 
LEV.10.18	Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the inner sanctuary; ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I commanded.
LEV.10.19	And Aaron replied unto Moses, Behold, today they have offered their sin and their burnt offering before the 
LEV.10.20	And when Moses heard that, he was content.
LEV.11.1	And the 
LEV.11.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, These are the animals which ye shall eat among all the animals that are on the earth.
LEV.11.3	Whatever divides the hoof and is clovenfooted and chews the cud, among the animals, that shall you eat.
LEV.11.4	Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of those that chew the cud or of those that divide the hoof: the camel because it chews the cud but divides not the hoof; it is unclean unto you.
LEV.11.5	And the coney because it chews the cud, but divides not the hoof: it is unclean unto you.
LEV.11.6	And the hare because it chews the cud, but divides not the hoof: it is unclean unto you.
LEV.11.7	And the swine though it divides the hoof and is clovenfooted, yet it chews not the cud: it is unclean to you.
LEV.11.8	Of their flesh ye shall not eat, and their carcase you shall not touch: they are unclean to you.
LEV.11.9	These shall you eat of all that are in the waters: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, those shall you eat.
LEV.11.10	But all that have not fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, of any reptile in the waters, and of any living thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination unto you;
LEV.11.11	they shall be an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, and ye shall have their carcasses in abomination.
LEV.11.12	Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall be an abomination unto you.
LEV.11.13	And these ye shall have in abomination among the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they shall be an abomination: the eagle, the ossifrage, the ospray,
LEV.11.14	the vulture, and the kite according to his species,
LEV.11.15	every raven according to his species,
LEV.11.16	the owl, the night hawk, the cuckow, and the hawk according to his species;
LEV.11.17	the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,
LEV.11.18	the swan, the pelican, the gier eagle,
LEV.11.19	the stork, the heron according to her species, the lapwing, and the bat.
LEV.11.20	Every flying insect that creeps, going upon all four, shall be an abomination unto you.
LEV.11.21	Yet these may ye eat of every flying insect that goes upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap with them upon the earth;
LEV.11.22	these of them ye may eat: the locust according to his species and the bald locust according to his species and the beetle according to his species and the grasshopper according to his species.
LEV.11.23	But all other flying insects, which have four feet, shall be an abomination unto you.
LEV.11.24	And for these ye shall be unclean: whoever touches their carcase shall be unclean until the evening.
LEV.11.25	And whoever bears any part of their carcase shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.11.26	The carcasses of every animal which divides the hoof and is not clovenfooted, nor chews the cud, are unclean unto you; everyone that touches them shall be unclean.
LEV.11.27	And of all the animals that go on all four, any that walk upon their paws are unclean unto you; whoever touches their carcase shall be unclean until the evening.
LEV.11.28	And he that bears their carcase shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean unto you.
LEV.11.29	These also shall be unclean unto you among the animals that creep upon the earth: the weasel and the mouse and the frog according to his species
LEV.11.30	and the ferret and the lizard and the snail and the slug and the mole.
LEV.11.31	These are unclean to you among all the animals; whoever touches them, when they are dead, shall be unclean until the evening.
LEV.11.32	And everything upon which any of them falls when they are dead shall be unclean, whether it be any vessel of wood or clothing or skin or sack, whatever instrument with which work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening; and thus it shall be cleansed.
LEV.11.33	And every earthen vessel into which any of them falls, whatever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break the vessel.
LEV.11.34	All food which may be eaten upon which shall come water from any such vessel shall be unclean; and any drink that may be drunk shall be unclean in every such vessel.
LEV.11.35	And everything upon which any part of their carcase falls shall be unclean: the oven or the chimney shall be broken down, for they are unclean and shall be unclean unto you.
LEV.11.36	Nevertheless a fountain or cistern where water is collected shall be clean; but that which touches their carcase shall be unclean.
LEV.11.37	And if any part of their carcase falls upon any sown seed which is sown, it shall be clean.
LEV.11.38	But if any water is put upon the seed and any part of their carcase falls thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.
LEV.11.39	And if any animal of which ye may eat dies, he that touches the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the evening;
LEV.11.40	and he that eats of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; likewise he that bears the carcase of it shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.11.41	And every reptile that creeps upon the earth is an abomination; it shall not be eaten.
LEV.11.42	Whatever goes upon the belly and whatever goes upon four or more feet among all reptiles that creep upon the earth, ye shall not eat; for it is abomination.
LEV.11.43	Ye shall not defile your souls with any reptile that creeps, neither shall ye contaminate yourselves with them, that ye should be unclean with them.
LEV.11.44	For I am the 
LEV.11.45	For I am the 
LEV.11.46	This is the law of the animals and of the fowls and of every living creature that moves in the waters and of every animal that creeps upon the earth:
LEV.11.47	to make a difference between the unclean and the clean and between the animals that may be eaten and the animals that may not be eaten.
LEV.12.1	And the 
LEV.12.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, If a woman has conceived seed and gives birth to a man child, then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her menses shall she be unclean.
LEV.12.3	And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.
LEV.12.4	And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying thirty-three days; she shall touch no holy thing, nor come to the sanctuary until the days of her purifying are fulfilled.
LEV.12.5	But if she gives birth to a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, according to her separation, and she shall be purifying herself for sixty-six days from her blood.
LEV.12.6	And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove as sin, unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, unto the priest,
LEV.12.7	who shall offer it before the 
LEV.12.8	And if she is not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons: the one for the burnt offering and the other as sin; and the priest shall reconcile her, and she shall be clean.
LEV.13.1	And the 
LEV.13.2	When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a scab, or bright spot, and it is in the skin of his flesh like the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron, the priest, or unto one of his sons, the priests,
LEV.13.3	and the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the flesh, and if the hair in the plague is turned white and the plague looks deeper than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy; and the priest shall recognize him and pronounce him unclean.
LEV.13.4	If the bright spot is white in the skin of his flesh and looks to be not deeper than the skin and the hair thereof is not turned white; then the priest shall shut up the one that has the plague seven days;
LEV.13.5	and the priest shall look on him the seventh day and see if the plague in his sight is stayed and the plague is not spread in the skin, then the priest shall shut him up seven days the second time.
LEV.13.6	After this the priest shall look on him again the seventh day and see if the plague has darkened and that the plague is not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is but a scab, and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
LEV.13.7	But if the scab spreads much abroad in the skin after he has been shown unto the priest for his cleansing, he shall be seen of the priest again;
LEV.13.8	and if the priest recognizes that the scab has spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is leprosy.
LEV.13.9	When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be brought unto the priest;
LEV.13.10	and the priest shall see him; and if the rising looks white in the skin and it has turned the hair white and there is quick raw flesh in the rising,
LEV.13.11	it is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean and shall not shut him up, for he is unclean.
LEV.13.12	But if the leprosy breaks out abroad in the skin and the leprosy covers all the skin of him that has the plague from his head even to his feet wherever the priest looks,
LEV.13.13	then the priest shall consider; and if the leprosy has covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce the one that has the plague clean; it is all turned white; he is clean.
LEV.13.14	But the day that raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.
LEV.13.15	And the priest shall see the raw flesh and pronounce him to be unclean, for the raw flesh is unclean: it is leprosy.
LEV.13.16	But when the raw flesh turns again and is changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;
LEV.13.17	and the priest shall see him; and if the plague is turned white; then the priest shall pronounce the one that has the plague clean, and he shall be clean.
LEV.13.18	And when in the flesh, in the skin thereof, there was a boil and is healed,
LEV.13.19	and in the place of the boil there is a white rising or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, it shall be shown to the priest;
LEV.13.20	and the priest shall look, and if it appears to be lower than the skin and the hair thereof is turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.
LEV.13.21	But if the priest considers it and there appear to be no white hairs in it and it is not lower than the skin, but somewhat dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days;
LEV.13.22	and if it spreads much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.
LEV.13.23	But if the bright spot stays in its place and does not spread, it is the scab of a boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV.13.24	Likewise when the flesh has in its skin a burn from fire, and in the place healed from the burn there a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white,
LEV.13.25	then the priest shall look upon it; and if the hair in the bright spot is turned white and it looks deeper than the skin, it is a leprosy broken out of the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the plague of leprosy.
LEV.13.26	But if the priest looks on it and there is no white hair in the bright spot and it is no lower than the other skin, but dark, then the priest shall shut him up seven days;
LEV.13.27	and the priest shall recognize it the seventh day; and if it is spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the plague of leprosy.
LEV.13.28	And if the bright spot stays in its place and has not spread in the skin, but it is dark, it is a rising of the burn; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is an inflammation of the burn.
LEV.13.29	If a man or woman has a plague upon the head or the beard,
LEV.13.30	then the priest shall see the plague; and if it looks deeper than the skin and the hair in it is yellowish and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a dry scall, leprosy of the head or beard.
LEV.13.31	But when the priest looks on the plague of the scall and if it does not look deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, then the priest shall shut up the one that has the plague of the scall seven days;
LEV.13.32	and in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague; and if the scall appears not to have spread and there is no yellowish hair in it and the scall appears not to be deeper than the skin,
LEV.13.33	he shall be shaven, but the place of the scall he shall not shave; and the priest shall shut up the one that has the scall for seven days the second time.
LEV.13.34	And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall; and if the scall is not spread in the skin nor in appearance deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.
LEV.13.35	But if the scall spreads much in the skin after his cleansing,
LEV.13.36	then the priest shall look at it; and if the scall is spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellowish hair; he is unclean.
LEV.13.37	But if the scall appears to him to be stayed and there is black hair grown up in it, the scall is healed; he is clean; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
LEV.13.38	Likewise if a man or a woman has in the skin of their flesh bright spots, even white bright spots,
LEV.13.39	the priest shall look; and if the bright spots in the skin of their flesh are darkish white, it is a freckled spot that grew in the skin; the person is clean.
LEV.13.40	And the man whose hair has fallen off his head is bald; yet he is clean.
LEV.13.41	And if his hair has fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he is forehead bald; yet is he clean.
LEV.13.42	But if in the bald head, or bald forehead, there is a white reddish sore, it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
LEV.13.43	Then the priest shall look upon it; and if the rising of the sore is white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the appearance of leprosy in the skin of the flesh,
LEV.13.44	he is a leprous man, he is unclean; the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.
LEV.13.45	And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be rent and his head uncovered, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
LEV.13.46	All the days in which the plague shall be in him he shall be defiled; he shall be unclean; he shall dwell alone; outside the camp shall his habitation be.
LEV.13.47	The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it is a woolen garment or a linen garment;
LEV.13.48	whether it is in the warp or woof; of linen or of woolen; whether in a skin or in anything made of skin;
LEV.13.49	and if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the skin, either in the warp or in the woof or in any thing of skin, it is a plague of leprosy and shall be shown unto the priest.
LEV.13.50	And the priest shall look upon the plague and shut up the thing that has the plague seven days.
LEV.13.51	And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day; if the plague is spread in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof or in a skin or in any work that is made of skins; the plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.
LEV.13.52	He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woolen or in linen, or anything of skin, in which the plague is; for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
LEV.13.53	And if the priest shall look and it appears that the plague has not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin,
LEV.13.54	then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which the plague is, and he shall shut it up again for seven days.
LEV.13.55	And the priest shall look on it after the plague has been washed; and if it appears that the plague has not changed its colour, even if the plague is not spread, it is unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether the bare spot is within or without.
LEV.13.56	And if the priest looks and the plague appears to be darker after the washing of it, then he shall cut it out of the garment or out of the skin or out of the warp or out of the woof.
LEV.13.57	And if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof or in anything of skin, springing up again in it, thou shalt burn whatever the plague is in with fire.
LEV.13.58	But the garment, either warp or woof or whatever thing of skin which thou shalt wash and from which the plague is removed, shall be washed the second time, and then it shall be clean.
LEV.13.59	This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, either in the warp or woof or anything of skins, to pronounce it clean or to pronounce it unclean.
LEV.14.1	And the 
LEV.14.2	This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest.
LEV.14.3	And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look and seeing that the plague of leprosy is healed in the leper,
LEV.14.4	the priest shall command to take for the one that is to be purified two birds, alive and clean, and cedar wood and scarlet and hyssop;
LEV.14.5	and the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel upon living water;
LEV.14.6	then he shall take the living bird and the cedar wood, and the scarlet and the hyssop and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the living water;
LEV.14.7	and he shall sprinkle upon the one that is to be purified from the leprosy seven times and shall pronounce him clean and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.
LEV.14.8	And he that is to be purified shall wash his clothes and shave off all his hair and wash himself with water, and he shall be clean; and after that he shall come into the camp and shall dwell outside of his tent seven days.
LEV.14.9	But it shall be that on the seventh day he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows; finally he shall shave off all his hair, and he shall wash his clothes; also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
LEV.14.10	And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish and three tenth deals of fine flour for a present, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.
LEV.14.11	And the priest that purifies him shall present the one that is to be made clean with those things, before the 
LEV.14.12	and the priest shall take one he lamb and offer him for expiation of the guilt, with the log of oil, and wave them for a waved offering before the 
LEV.14.13	And he shall slay the lamb in the place where they kill the sin and the burnt offering, in the place of the sanctuary, for that offered as sin is the priest’s, together with that offered as guilt; it is most holy.
LEV.14.14	And the priest shall take some of the blood of the expiation for the guilt, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the right ear of the one that is to be purified and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot.
LEV.14.15	Likewise the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand;
LEV.14.16	and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left hand and shall sprinkle of the oil with his finger seven times before the 
LEV.14.17	And of that which is left of the oil that is in his hand shall the priest put upon the tip of the right ear of the one that is to be purified and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the expiation for the guilt;
LEV.14.18	and that which is left of the oil that is in the priest’s hand, he shall pour upon the head of the one that is to be purified; and thus shall the priest reconcile him before the 
LEV.14.19	And the priest shall offer the sin and reconcile the one that is to be purified from his uncleanness; and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering.
LEV.14.20	And the priest shall cause the burnt offering and the present to be lifted upon the altar, and thus shall the priest reconcile him, and he shall be clean.
LEV.14.21	But if he is poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for expiation of the guilt to be waved, to reconcile himself, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a present, and a log of oil;
LEV.14.22	and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able to get; and the one shall be as the sin, and the other as a burnt offering.
LEV.14.23	And he shall bring these things on the eighth day of his purification unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, before the 
LEV.14.24	And the priest shall take the lamb of the expiation of the guilt, and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a waved offering before the 
LEV.14.25	then he shall kill the lamb of the expiation of the guilt, and the priest shall take some of the blood of the expiation of the guilt and put it upon the tip of the right ear of the one that is to be purified and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot.
LEV.14.26	And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own left hand,
LEV.14.27	and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the 
LEV.14.28	The priest shall also put of the oil that is in his hand upon the tip of the right ear of the one that is to be purified and upon the thumb of his right hand and upon the great toe of his right foot in the place of the blood of the expiation for the guilt.
LEV.14.29	And what is left of the oil that is in the priest’s hand he shall put upon the head of the one that is to be purified, to reconcile him before the 
LEV.14.30	Likewise he shall offer one of the turtledoves or of the young pigeons, such as he can get,
LEV.14.31	one of such as he is able to get as sin, and the other for a burnt offering, with the present; and thus shall the priest reconcile the one that is to be purified before the 
LEV.14.32	This is the law of the one who has had the plague of leprosy, whose hand is not able to get that which is prescribed for his purification.
LEV.14.33	And the 
LEV.14.34	When ye are entered into the land of Canaan, which I give to you in possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house of the land of your possession,
LEV.14.35	the one that owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, Something like unto a plague has appeared in my house.
LEV.14.36	Then the priest shall command that they empty the house before the priest goes into it to see the plague so that all that is in the house is not contaminated; and afterward the priest shall go in to recognize the house.
LEV.14.37	And he shall look on the plague, and if the plague is seen in the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish, which appear to be lower than the wall,
LEV.14.38	the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house and shut up the house seven days.
LEV.14.39	And the priest shall come again the seventh day and shall look; and if the plague has spread in the walls of the house,
LEV.14.40	then the priest shall command that they remove the stones in which the plague is, and they shall cast them outside the city into an unclean place;
LEV.14.41	And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off outside the city into an unclean place;
LEV.14.42	and they shall take other stones and put them in the place of the stones that were removed; and he shall take other mortar and shall plaster the house.
LEV.14.43	And if the plague comes again and breaks out in the house after he has taken away the stones and after he has scraped the house and after it is plastered,
LEV.14.44	then the priest shall come in and look; and if the plague appears to have spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the house; it is unclean.
LEV.14.45	Then he shall break down the house, its stones, and its timbers, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.
LEV.14.46	Moreover he that enters into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the evening.
LEV.14.47	And he that sleeps in the house shall wash his clothes, and he that eats in the house shall wash his clothes.
LEV.14.48	But if the priest shall come in and look upon it, and see that the plague has not spread in the house after the house was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean because the plague is healed.
LEV.14.49	Then to remove the sin from the house he shall take two birds and cedar wood and scarlet and hyssop,
LEV.14.50	and he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel over living water,
LEV.14.51	and he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet and the living bird and dip them all in the blood of the slain bird and in the living water and sprinkle the house seven times.
LEV.14.52	And he shall remove the sin from the house with the blood of the bird and with the living water and with the living bird and with the cedar wood and with the hyssop and with the scarlet.
LEV.14.53	Then he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the open fields; and thus shall he reconcile the house, and it shall be clean.
LEV.14.54	This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy and scall
LEV.14.55	and for the leprosy of a garment and of a house
LEV.14.56	and for a rising and for a scab and for a bright spot,
LEV.14.57	to teach when it is unclean and when it is clean: this is the law of leprosy.
LEV.15.1	And the 
LEV.15.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, Any man when his seed issues forth out of his flesh, he shall be unclean.
LEV.15.3	And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his flesh drips because of his issue or his flesh is stopped because of his issue, he shall be unclean.
LEV.15.4	Every bed on which the one that has the issue lies shall be unclean; and everything upon which he sits shall be unclean.
LEV.15.5	And whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.6	And he that sits on any thing upon which the one that has the issue sat shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.7	Likewise he that touches the flesh of the one that has the issue shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.8	And if the one that has the issue spits upon him that is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.9	And any saddle that he that has the issue rides upon shall be unclean.
LEV.15.10	And whoever touches any thing that was under him shall be unclean until the evening, and he that bears any of those things shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.11	And whoever the one that has the issue touches and has not washed his hands with water, he shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.12	And the vessel of earth that the one that has the issue touches shall be broken, and every vessel of wood shall be washed with water.
LEV.15.13	And when the one that has an issue is cleansed of his issue; then he shall number to himself seven days from his purification and wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in living water, and he shall be clean.
LEV.15.14	And on the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before the 
LEV.15.15	and the priest shall offer the one as sin and the other as a burnt offering; and the priest shall reconcile him from his issue before the 
LEV.15.16	And the man, when his seed shall go forth from him, then shall wash all his flesh in water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.17	And every garment and every skin upon which the seed of a man has come shall be washed with water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.18	The woman also with whom the man shall have sexual contact with seed, they shall both bathe themselves in water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.19	And when the woman has an issue of blood and her issue is in her flesh, she shall be put apart seven days, and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.20	And everything that she lies upon in her separation shall be unclean; everything also that she sits upon shall be unclean.
LEV.15.21	And whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe himself with water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.22	Also whoever touches any thing that she sat upon shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.23	And if any thing was on the bed or on any thing upon which she sat, he that touches it shall be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.24	And if any man sleeps with her and her uncleanness comes upon him, he shall be unclean seven days; and any bed upon which he sleeps shall be unclean.
LEV.15.25	And the woman when she has an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation or if it runs beyond the time of her separation, all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.
LEV.15.26	Every bed upon which she sleeps all the days of her issue shall be unto her as the bed of her separation; and whatever she sits upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her separation.
LEV.15.27	Whoever touches these things shall be unclean and shall wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening.
LEV.15.28	But when she is clean of her issue, then she shall number to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.
LEV.15.29	And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them unto the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony;
LEV.15.30	and the priest shall offer the one as sin and the other as a burnt offering; and the priest shall reconcile her before the 
LEV.15.31	Thus shall ye separate the sons of Israel from their uncleanness; and they shall not die for their uncleanness defiling my tabernacle that is among them.
LEV.15.32	This is the law of the one that has an issue and of him whose seed goes forth from him, causing him to be unclean because of it,
LEV.15.33	and of her that is suffering her menstruation, and of the one that has an issue, male or female, and of the man that lies with an unclean woman.
LEV.16.1	And the 
LEV.16.2	and the 
LEV.16.3	Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young bullock as sin and a ram as a burnt offering.
LEV.16.4	He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen underwear upon his flesh and shall be girded with a linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he cover himself. These are holy garments; and he shall wash his flesh with water and put them on.
LEV.16.5	And he shall take of the congregation of the sons of Israel two he goats as the sin and one ram as a burnt offering.
LEV.16.6	And Aaron shall cause the bullock of his sin to be brought, and make reconciliation for himself and for his house.
LEV.16.7	After that, he shall take the two goats and present them before the 
LEV.16.8	And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two he goats, one lot for the 
LEV.16.9	And Aaron shall cause the he goat upon which the 
LEV.16.10	But the he goat on which the lot fell for Azazel shall be presented alive before the 
LEV.16.11	And Aaron shall cause the bullock of his own sin to be brought and shall make the reconciliation for himself and for his house and shall kill the bullock of his own sin.
LEV.16.12	After that he shall take the censer full of burning coals of fire from off the altar before the 
LEV.16.13	And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the 
LEV.16.14	Then he shall take of the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it with his finger towards the seat of reconciliation eastward; towards the seat of reconciliation he shall sprinkle of the blood with his finger seven times.
LEV.16.15	After that, he shall kill the goat of the sin of the people and bring its blood inside the veil and do with that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock and sprinkle it upon the seat of reconciliation and before the seat of reconciliation;
LEV.16.16	and he shall cleanse the sanctuary of the uncleanness of the sons of Israel and of their rebellions and of all their sins; in the same manner so shall he do for the tabernacle of the testimony, which dwells among them in the midst of their uncleanness.
LEV.16.17	And no man shall be in the tabernacle of the testimony when he enters in to make reconciliation in the sanctuary until he comes out and has made reconciliation for himself and for his household and for all the congregation of Israel.
LEV.16.18	And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the 
LEV.16.19	And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger seven times and cleanse it and sanctify it from the uncleanness of the sons of Israel.
LEV.16.20	And when he has made an end of reconciling the sanctuary and the tabernacle of the testimony and the altar, he shall cause the live he goat to be brought;
LEV.16.21	and Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live he goat and confess over it all the iniquities of the sons of Israel and all their rebellions and all their sins, putting them thus upon the head of the he goat and shall send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man prepared for this;
LEV.16.22	and that he goat shall bear upon itself all their iniquities unto an uninhabitable land; and he shall send the he goat into the wilderness.
LEV.16.23	After that, Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the testimony and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on to enter into the sanctuary, and shall put them there.
LEV.16.24	Then he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place and put on his garments and come forth after that and make his burnt offering and the burnt offering of the people and make reconciliation for himself and for the people.
LEV.16.25	And the fat of the sin he shall incense upon the altar.
LEV.16.26	And he that took the he goat to Azazel shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh with water and afterward come into the camp.
LEV.16.27	And he shall take outside the camp the bullock of the sin and the goat of the sin, whose blood was brought in to make the reconciliation in the sanctuary; and they shall burn in the fire their skins and their flesh and their dung.
LEV.16.28	And he that burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.
LEV.16.29	And you shall hold this as a perpetual statute: In the seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict your souls and do no work at all, whether it is a natural of your own country or a stranger that sojourns among you;
LEV.16.30	for on that day he shall reconcile you to cleanse you that ye may be clean from all your sins before the 
LEV.16.31	It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict your souls, by a perpetual statute.
LEV.16.32	And the reconciliation shall be made by the priest who is anointed and whose hand has been filled to be priest in the place of his father; and he shall put on the linen clothes, the holy garments;
LEV.16.33	and he shall reconcile the holy sanctuary and reconcile the tabernacle of the testimony; he shall also reconcile the altar and the priests and all the people of the congregation.
LEV.16.34	And you shall hold this as a perpetual statute to reconcile the sons of Israel of all their sins once a year. And Moses did as the 
LEV.17.1	And the 
LEV.17.2	Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons and unto all the sons of Israel and say unto them: This is what the 
LEV.17.3	any man of the house of Israel that kills an ox or lamb or goat in the camp or that kills it out of the camp
LEV.17.4	and does not bring it unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony to offer an offering unto the 
LEV.17.5	to the end that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they sacrifice in the open field, even that they may bring them unto the 
LEV.17.6	And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the 
LEV.17.7	And they shall never again offer their sacrifices unto devils, after whom they fornicate. They shall have this as a perpetual statute throughout their ages.
LEV.17.8	And thou shalt also say unto them: Any man of the house of Israel or of the strangers who sojourn among you that offers a burnt offering or sacrifice
LEV.17.9	and does not bring it unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony to offer it unto the 
LEV.17.10	And any man of the house of Israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you that eats any blood at all, I will set my face against that person that eats blood and will cut them off from among his people.
LEV.17.11	For the soul (or life) of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you to reconcile your persons (or souls) upon the altar; therefore the same blood reconciles the person.
LEV.17.12	Therefore I have said unto the sons of Israel: No person of you shall eat blood; neither shall any stranger that sojourns among you eat blood.
LEV.17.13	And any man of the sons of Israel or of the strangers that sojourn among you who hunts and catches any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with dust.
LEV.17.14	For the soul of all flesh, its life, is in its blood; therefore, I have said unto the sons of Israel, Ye shall not eat the blood of any flesh, for the soul (or the life) of all flesh is its blood; whoever eats it shall be cut off.
LEV.17.15	And any person that eats that which died of itself or that which was torn by beasts whether it is a natural of your own country or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and be unclean until the evening; then he shall be clean.
LEV.17.16	But if he washes them not, nor bathes his flesh; then he shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.18.1	And the 
LEV.18.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, I AM your God.
LEV.18.3	You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, in which ye dwelt; nor shall you do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I bring you; neither shall ye walk in their statutes.
LEV.18.4	Ye shall comply with my rights and keep my statutes, walking in them. I AM your God.
LEV.18.5	Therefore you shall keep my rights and my statutes, of which the man doing them, shall live in them. I am the 
LEV.18.6	No man shall approach any woman that is near of kin to him, to uncover her nakedness. I am the 
LEV.18.7	The nakedness of thy father or the nakedness of thy mother, thou shalt not uncover; she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
LEV.18.8	The nakedness of thy father’s wife thou shalt not uncover; it is thy father’s nakedness.
LEV.18.9	The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father or daughter of thy mother, whether she is born at home or born abroad, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
LEV.18.10	The nakedness of thy son’s daughter or of thy daughter’s daughter, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; for theirs is thine own nakedness.
LEV.18.11	The nakedness of thy father’s wife’s daughter, begotten of thy father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
LEV.18.12	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s sister; she is thy father’s near kinswoman.
LEV.18.13	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister; for she is thy mother’s near kinswoman.
LEV.18.14	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father’s brother, thou shalt not approach to his wife; she is thine aunt.
LEV.18.15	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law; she is thy son’s wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
LEV.18.16	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother’s wife; it is thy brother’s nakedness.
LEV.18.17	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter; neither shalt thou take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter to uncover her nakedness; for they are her near kinswomen; it is wickedness.
LEV.18.18	Neither shalt thou take a woman together with her sister, to make her a rival, to uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her lifetime.
LEV.18.19	Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her nakedness as long as she is separated for her uncleanness.
LEV.18.20	Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour’s wife, contaminating thyself with her.
LEV.18.21	And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech; neither shalt thou contaminate the name of thy God: I am the 
LEV.18.22	Thou shalt not lie with males as with women; it is abomination.
LEV.18.23	Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself therewith; neither shall any woman stand before a beast to join herself with it; it is mixture.
LEV.18.24	Do not defile yourselves in any of these things; for in all these things the Gentiles which I cast out before you have defiled themselves;
LEV.18.25	and the land became defiled; therefore, I visited its iniquity upon it, and the land itself vomited out her inhabitants.
LEV.18.26	Ye shall, therefore, keep my statutes and my rights and shall not commit any of these abominations, neither the natural of your own nor any stranger that sojourns among you.
LEV.18.27	(For all these abominations were done by the men of the land who were before you, and the land was contaminated.)
LEV.18.28	And will the land not vomit you out also for having contaminated it, as it vomited out the Gentiles that were before you?
LEV.18.29	For whoever shall commit any of these abominations, the persons that commit them shall be cut off from among his people.
LEV.18.30	Keep, therefore, my ordinance that ye commit not any one of these abominable laws which were committed before you, and do not defile yourselves in them; I am the 
LEV.19.1	And the 
LEV.19.2	Speak unto all the congregation of the sons of Israel and say unto them, Ye shall be holy, for I the 
LEV.19.3	Ye shall fear, every man his mother and his father and keep my sabbaths. I AM your God.
LEV.19.4	Do not return unto idols nor make to yourselves molten gods. I AM your God.
LEV.19.5	And when ye offer a sacrifice of peace unto the 
LEV.19.6	It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it and on the next day, and any remaining until the third day shall be burnt in the fire.
LEV.19.7	And if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable; it shall not be accepted;
LEV.19.8	and whoever eats it shall bear his iniquity because he has profaned the holiness of the 
LEV.19.9	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not completely reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleanings of thy harvest.
LEV.19.10	And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the fallen grapes of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for the poor and the stranger. I AM your God.
LEV.19.11	Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to another.
LEV.19.12	And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou defile the name of thy God. I am the 
LEV.19.13	Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him. Do not detain the wages of the work of the hired man in thy house until the morning.
LEV.19.14	Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before the blind, but shalt fear thy God. I am the 
LEV.19.15	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, neither pleasing the poor, nor favoring the mighty; but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
LEV.19.16	Thou shalt not travel about as a talebearer among thy people; neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy neighbour. I am the 
LEV.19.17	Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart; thou shalt rebuke thy neighbour in sincerity, that thou not bear sin for him.
LEV.19.18	Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the sons of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. I am the 
LEV.19.19	Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy animal join with a diverse kind for mixtures; thou shalt not sow thy field with mixture, neither shalt thou wear garments of a mixture of different things.
LEV.19.20	And when a man lies carnally with a woman that is a bondmaid, betrothed to a husband and has not been completely ransomed nor been given her freedom, both shall be scourged; they shall not be put to death because she is not free.
LEV.19.21	And he shall bring in expiation for his guilt unto the 
LEV.19.22	And the priest shall reconcile him with the ram of the guilt before the 
LEV.19.23	And when ye have come into the land and shall have planted all manner of trees for food, then ye shall circumcise the foreskin of the fruit; three years it shall be uncircumcised unto you; it shall not be eaten of.
LEV.19.24	But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holiness of rejoicing unto the 
LEV.19.25	And in the fifth year ye shall eat of the fruit thereof that it may yield unto you the increase thereof. I AM your God.
LEV.19.26	Ye shall not eat any thing with blood. Ye shall not be fortunetellers, nor diviners.
LEV.19.27	Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard.
LEV.19.28	Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks upon you. I am the 
LEV.19.29	Do not contaminate thy daughter, causing her to commit fornication, lest the land be prostituted, and the land become full of wickedness.
LEV.19.30	Ye shall keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary. I am the 
LEV.19.31	Do not return unto spiritists or seek after diviners, to be defiled by them. I AM your God.
LEV.19.32	Thou shalt rise up before grey hair and honour the face of the elder and fear thy God. I am the 
LEV.19.33	And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not oppress him.
LEV.19.34	But the stranger that dwells with you shall be as the natural of yourselves, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. I AM your God.
LEV.19.35	Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in measurement of land, in weight, or in other measure.
LEV.19.36	Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin shall ye have. I AM your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
LEV.19.37	Keep, therefore, all my statutes and all my rights and do them. I am the 
LEV.20.1	And the 
LEV.20.2	Likewise, thou shalt say to the sons of Israel, Any man of the sons of Israel or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel that gives any of his seed unto Molech shall surely die; the people of the land shall stone him with stones.
LEV.20.3	And I will set my face against that man and will cut him off from among his people because he has given of his seed unto Molech, contaminating my sanctuary and defiling my holy name.
LEV.20.4	And if the people of the land should hide their eyes from the man, when he gives of his seed unto Molech, to not kill him,
LEV.20.5	then I will set my face against that man and against his family and will cut him off with all those that fornicated after him, prostituting themselves after Molech.
LEV.20.6	And the person that turns after spiritists or after diviners to prostitute themselves after them, I will even set my face against that person and will cut him off from among his people.
LEV.20.7	Sanctify yourselves, therefore, and be ye holy, for I am the 
LEV.20.8	And keep my statutes and do them. I AM he who sanctifies you.
LEV.20.9	For any man that curses his father or his mother shall be surely put to death: he has cursed his father or his mother; his blood shall be upon him.
LEV.20.10	And the man that commits adultery with another man’s wife, he that commits adultery with his neighbour’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely die.
LEV.20.11	And the man that lies with his father’s wife has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall surely die; their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.20.12	And if a man lies with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall surely be put to death; they have wrought mixture; their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.20.13	If a man shall join himself with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.20.14	And if a man takes a wife and her mother, it is wickedness; they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be no wickedness among you.
LEV.20.15	And if a man copulates with a beast, he shall surely be put to death, and ye shall slay the beast.
LEV.20.16	And if a woman approaches any animal, to join herself with it, thou shalt kill the woman and the animal; they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon themselves.
LEV.20.17	And if a man shall take his sister, his father’s daughter, or his mother’s daughter and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be killed in the sight of the sons of their people; he has uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.
LEV.20.18	And if a man shall lie with a woman having her menstruation and shall uncover her nakedness, he has discovered her fountain, and she has uncovered the fountain of her blood; both of them shall be cut off from among their people.
LEV.20.19	Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother’s sister, nor of thy father’s sister; for he uncovers his near kin; they shall bear their iniquity.
LEV.20.20	And if a man shall lie with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness; they shall bear their sin; they shall die childless.
LEV.20.21	And if a man shall take his brother’s wife, it is an unclean thing; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness; they shall be childless.
LEV.20.22	Keep, therefore, all my statutes and all my rights and do them, and the land where I bring you to dwell therein will not vomit you out.
LEV.20.23	And ye shall not walk in the practices of the Gentiles which I shall cast out before you; for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them.
LEV.20.24	But I have said unto you, Ye shall possess their land, and I will give it unto you in possession of inheritance, a land that flows with milk and honey. I AM your God, who have separated you from the other peoples.
LEV.20.25	Therefore, ye shall differentiate between clean animals and unclean and between unclean fowls and clean; and ye shall not defile your persons by animals or by fowl or by any manner of living thing that moves on the ground which I have separated from you as unclean.
LEV.20.26	Ye must, therefore, be holy unto me, for I the 
LEV.20.27	And the man or the woman that consults with spiritists, or that is a diviner, shall surely die; they shall stone them with stones; their blood shall be upon them.
LEV.21.1	And the 
LEV.21.2	But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his mother and for his father and for his son and for his daughter and for his brother
LEV.21.3	and for his virgin sister, that is near unto him, who has had no husband; for her he may be defiled.
LEV.21.4	He shall not defile himself for the prince among his people, to profane himself.
LEV.21.5	They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.
LEV.21.6	They shall be holy unto their God and not profane the name of their God; for the offerings of the 
LEV.21.7	They shall not take a wife that is a whore or profane; neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband; for he is holy unto his God.
LEV.21.8	Thou shalt sanctify him, therefore, for he offers the bread of thy God; he shall be holy unto thee; for I the 
LEV.21.9	And the daughter of the man who is a priest, if she begins to fornicate, she profanes her father; she shall be burnt with fire.
LEV.21.10	And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose head the anointing oil was poured and that is consecrated to put on the garments, shall not uncover his head nor rend his clothes;
LEV.21.11	neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself for his father or for his mother;
LEV.21.12	neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the sanctuary of his God, for the crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him. I am the 
LEV.21.13	And he shall take a wife in her virginity.
LEV.21.14	A widow or a divorced woman or profane or a harlot, these he shall not take, but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife.
LEV.21.15	Neither shall he profane his seed among his people, for I AM he that sanctifies him.
LEV.21.16	And the 
LEV.21.17	Speak unto Aaron, saying, The man of thy seed in their generations that has any blemish, let him not approach to offer the bread of his God.
LEV.21.18	For no man in whom there is a blemish, shall approach: a blind man or a lame or he that lacks any thing or has any thing superfluous
LEV.21.19	or a man that is brokenfooted or brokenhanded
LEV.21.20	or crookbacked or a dwarf or that has a blemish in his eye or has scurvy or is scabbed or has his stones broken.
LEV.21.21	No man that has a blemish of the seed of Aaron, the priest, shall come near to offer the offerings of the 
LEV.21.22	He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy and of the sanctified things.
LEV.21.23	Only he shall not go inside the veil nor come near unto the altar because he has a blemish, that he not profane my sanctuary; for I AM he that sanctifies them.
LEV.21.24	And Moses told it unto Aaron and to his sons and unto all the sons of Israel.
LEV.22.1	And the 
LEV.22.2	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons that they abstain from the holy things of the sons of Israel and that they not profane my holy name in those things which they sanctify unto me. I am the 
LEV.22.3	Say unto them, Any man of all your seed among your generations that goes in unto the holy things, which the children of Israel sanctify unto the 
LEV.22.4	Whatever man of the seed of Aaron who is a leper or has a running issue shall not eat of the holy things until he is clean. And whosoever touches any thing that is unclean by the dead or a man whose seed has gone out from him
LEV.22.5	or the man who has touched any reptile, by which he shall be unclean, or a man of whom he shall become unclean, according to whatever uncleanness he has,
LEV.22.6	the person who has touched any such shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat of the holy things until he has washed his flesh with water.
LEV.22.7	And when the sun is down, he shall be clean and shall afterward eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.
LEV.22.8	That which dies of itself or is torn by beasts, he shall not eat to defile himself therewith. I am the 
LEV.22.9	They shall therefore keep my ordinance lest they bear sin for it and die therefore, if they profane it. I AM he who sanctifies them.
LEV.22.10	No stranger shall eat of the holy thing; a guest of the priest or a hired servant shall not eat of the holy thing.
LEV.22.11	But when the priest shall buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of it, and he that is born in his house, they shall eat of his bread.
LEV.22.12	If the priest’s daughter becomes married unto a stranger, she may not eat of that which is set apart of the holy things.
LEV.22.13	But if the priest’s daughter becomes a widow or divorced and has no child and is returned unto her father’s house as in her youth, she shall eat of her father’s bread; but no stranger shall eat thereof.
LEV.22.14	And if a man eats of the holy thing by error, then he shall add the fifth part thereof unto it and shall give it unto the priest with the offering that he ate.
LEV.22.15	And they shall not profane the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they set apart unto the 
LEV.22.16	or suffer them to bear the iniquity of their guilt, when they eat their holy things. For I AM he who sanctifies them.
LEV.22.17	And the 
LEV.22.18	Speak unto Aaron and to his sons and unto all the sons of Israel and say unto them, Any man of the house of Israel or of the strangers in Israel that will offer his oblation for all his vows and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the 
LEV.22.19	ye shall offer of your own free will a male without blemish of the bovine cattle of the sheep or of the goats.
LEV.22.20	But ye shall not offer any thing that has a blemish, for it shall not be acceptable for you.
LEV.22.21	Likewise when anyone offers a sacrifice of peace unto the 
LEV.22.22	Blind or broken or maimed or having a running sore or scurvy or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the 
LEV.22.23	A bullock or a lamb that has any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, thou may offer for a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
LEV.22.24	Ye shall not offer unto the 
LEV.22.25	Neither from the son of a stranger’s hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these because their corruption is in them and blemishes are in them; they shall not be accepted for you.
LEV.22.26	And the 
LEV.22.27	When a bullock or a sheep or a goat is born, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.22.28	And whether it is cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
LEV.22.29	And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the 
LEV.22.30	On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow. I am the 
LEV.22.31	Keep, therefore, my commandments and do them. I am the 
LEV.22.32	Profane ye not my holy name, and I will sanctify myself in the midst of the sons of Israel. I AM he who sanctifies you
LEV.22.33	and who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the 
LEV.23.1	And the 
LEV.23.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, The feasts of the 
LEV.23.3	Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day shall be a sabbath of rest, a holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein; it is the sabbath of the 
LEV.23.4	These are the feasts of the 
LEV.23.5	On the fourteenth of the first month between the two evenings is the 
LEV.23.6	And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the 
LEV.23.7	The first day ye shall have a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work therein.
LEV.23.8	And ye shall offer an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.23.9	And the 
LEV.23.10	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When ye have entered into the land which I give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest;
LEV.23.11	and he shall wave the sheaf before the 
LEV.23.12	And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf a he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the 
LEV.23.13	And the present thereof shall be two-tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil in an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.23.14	And ye shall eat neither bread nor parched grain nor green ears until this same day until ye have offered the offering of your God; it shall be a statute for ever throughout your ages in all your dwellings.
LEV.23.15	And ye shall count unto you from the day after the sabbath, from the day that ye offered the sheaf of the wave offering; seven sabbaths shall be complete;
LEV.23.16	unto the day after the seventh sabbath, ye shall number fifty days; then ye shall offer a new present unto the 
LEV.23.17	Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two-tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour, they shall be baked with leaven, they are the firstfruits unto the 
LEV.23.18	And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year and one young bullock and two rams; they shall be for a burnt offering unto the 
LEV.23.19	Then ye shall also sacrifice one he goat as the sin and two lambs of the first year as a sacrifice of peace.
LEV.23.20	And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the 
LEV.23.21	And ye shall be summoned on that same day; it shall be a holy convocation unto you; ye shall do no servile work: a perpetual statute in all your dwellings throughout your ages.
LEV.23.22	And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest; thou shalt leave them for the poor and for the stranger. I AM your God.
LEV.23.23	And the 
LEV.23.24	Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, In the seventh month in the first day of the month, ye shall have a rest, an alarm for a reminder, and a holy convocation.
LEV.23.25	Ye shall do no servile work therein; but ye shall offer an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.23.26	And the 
LEV.23.27	But the tenth day of this seventh month shall be the day of reconciliations; it shall be a holy convocation unto you; and ye shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made on fire unto the 
LEV.23.28	And ye shall do no work in this same day; for it is a day of reconciliations, to reconcile you before the 
LEV.23.29	For every person that shall not afflict themselves in that same day, shall be cut off from among his people.
LEV.23.30	And any person that does any work in that same day, the same person will I destroy from among his people.
LEV.23.31	Ye shall do no manner of work; it shall be a perpetual statute throughout your ages in all your dwellings.
LEV.23.32	It shall be unto you a sabbath of sabbaths, and ye shall afflict your souls, beginning in the ninth day of the month in the evening, from evening unto evening, shall ye rest on your sabbath.
LEV.23.33	And the 
LEV.23.34	Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles unto the 
LEV.23.35	The first day shall be a holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.
LEV.23.36	Seven days ye shall offer an offering on fire unto the 
LEV.23.37	These are the feasts of the 
LEV.23.38	in addition the sabbaths of the 
LEV.23.39	But in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto the 
LEV.23.40	And on the first day ye shall take branches with fruit of a beautiful tree, palm branches and the boughs of thick trees and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the 
LEV.23.41	And ye shall keep this feast unto the 
LEV.23.42	Ye shall dwell in tabernacles seven days; all that are natural of Israel shall dwell in booths,
LEV.23.43	that your descendants may know that I made the sons of Israel to dwell in tabernacles when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I AM your God.
LEV.23.44	Thus Moses declared unto the sons of Israel the feasts of the 
LEV.24.1	And the 
LEV.24.2	Command the sons of Israel that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.
LEV.24.3	Outside the veil of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the testimony, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the 
LEV.24.4	He shall order the lamps upon the pure lampstand before the 
LEV.24.5	And thou shalt take fine flour and bake twelve cakes thereof; each cake shall be of two-tenth deals.
LEV.24.6	And thou shalt set them in two orders, six in each order, upon the clean table before the 
LEV.24.7	And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each order, that it may be on the bread for an aroma and incense unto the 
LEV.24.8	Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the 
LEV.24.9	And it shall belong to Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in the holy place, for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the 
LEV.24.10	In that season the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the sons of Israel; and this son of the Israelite woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
LEV.24.11	and the Israelite woman’s son pronounced the Name and cursed; and they brought him unto Moses. And his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
LEV.24.12	And they put him in ward that the mind of the 
LEV.24.13	And the 
LEV.24.14	Bring forth the one that has blasphemed outside the camp and let all that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
LEV.24.15	And thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, The man that speaks evil of his God shall bear his sin.
LEV.24.16	And he that pronounces the name of the 
LEV.24.17	Likewise he that kills any man shall surely be put to death.
LEV.24.18	And he that kills an animal shall make it good: animal for animal.
LEV.24.19	And if a man causes a blemish in his neighbour; as he has done, so shall it be done to him;
LEV.24.20	breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he has caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.
LEV.24.21	He that kills an animal shall restore it, but he that kills a man shall be put to death.
LEV.24.22	Ye shall have one manner of law: as for the stranger, so shall it be for the natural; for I am the 
LEV.24.23	And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel that they should bring forth the one that had blasphemed out of the camp and stone him with stones. And the sons of Israel did as the 
LEV.25.1	And the 
LEV.25.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When ye have come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the 
LEV.25.3	Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and gather in the fruit thereof,
LEV.25.4	but the seventh year the land shall have a sabbath of rest, a sabbath unto the 
LEV.25.5	That which grows of its own accord in thy land that was harvested, thou shalt not reap; neither fence in the grapes of thy consecrated vine; for it is a year of rest unto the land.
LEV.25.6	But the sabbath of the land shall be food for you, for thee and for thy slave and for thy maid and for thy hired servant and for thy stranger that sojourns with thee
LEV.25.7	and for thy beast and for the animals that are in thy land shall all the fruit thereof be food.
LEV.25.8	And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty-nine years.
LEV.25.9	Then shalt thou cause the shofar to sound an alarm on the tenth day of the seventh month; in the day of the reconciliations shall ye cause the shofar to sound throughout all your land.
LEV.25.10	And ye shall sanctify the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof; it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every one unto his possession, and ye shall return each one unto his family.
LEV.25.11	A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you; ye shall not sow nor reap that which grows of itself in it nor fence in thy consecrated vine.
LEV.25.12	For it is the jubilee; it shall be holy unto you; ye shall eat the fruit of the land.
LEV.25.13	In this year of jubilee ye shall return each one unto his possession.
LEV.25.14	And if thou sell anything unto thy neighbour or buy anything of thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not oppress one another.
LEV.25.15	According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee.
LEV.25.16	According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it; for according to the number of the years of the fruits does he sell unto thee.
LEV.25.17	Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God; for I am the 
LEV.25.18	Execute, therefore, my statutes and keep my rights and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety;
LEV.25.19	and the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill and dwell therein in safety.
LEV.25.20	And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow nor gather in our fruits,
LEV.25.21	then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
LEV.25.22	And ye shall sow the eighth year and eat yet of old fruit; until the ninth year, until her fruits come in ye shall eat of the old store.
LEV.25.23	The land shall not be sold for ever, for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.
LEV.25.24	Therefore, in all the land of your possession, ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
LEV.25.25	If thy brother becomes poor and has sold away some of his possession, his redeemer shall come, his closest kinsman, and shall redeem that which his brother sold.
LEV.25.26	And when the man has no redeemer and is able to stretch forth his hand and find enough for his redemption,
LEV.25.27	then he shall count the years from the sale thereof and pay that which remains unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
LEV.25.28	But if he is not able to stretch forth his hand and find enough to return unto it, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of the one that has bought it until the year of jubilee; and in the jubilee the land shall go out free, and he shall return unto his possession.
LEV.25.29	And if a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a full year may he redeem it.
LEV.25.30	And if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to the one that bought it for his descendants; it shall not go out in the jubilee.
LEV.25.31	But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country; they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
LEV.25.32	Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites and the houses of the cities of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.
LEV.25.33	And if a man makes a purchase from the Levites, then the house that was sold and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year of jubilee; for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the sons of Israel.
LEV.25.34	But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold, for it is their perpetual possession.
LEV.25.35	And if thy brother becomes poor and comes unto thee, then thou shalt receive him; as a stranger, or a sojourner, he shall live with thee.
LEV.25.36	Take thou no usury of him, or increase; but thou shalt have the fear of thy God, and thy brother shall live with thee.
LEV.25.37	Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy food for increase.
LEV.25.38	I AM your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
LEV.25.39	And when thy brother becomes poor, being with thee, and if he should sell himself unto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serve as a slave.
LEV.25.40	As a hired servant and as a sojourner, he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee.
LEV.25.41	Then he shall depart free from thy house, both he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he be restored.
LEV.25.42	For they belong to me, I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold as slaves.
LEV.25.43	Thou shalt not rule over him with rigor, but shalt fear thy God.
LEV.25.44	Both thy menslaves and thy maidslaves, which thou shalt have, shall be of the Gentiles that are round about you; of them shall ye buy slaves.
LEV.25.45	Ye may also buy of the children of the strangers that live among you and of those of their lineage that are born in your land, who are with you, and they shall be your possession.
LEV.25.46	And ye shall possess them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit as a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever; but over your brethren, the sons of Israel, ye shall not rule over one another with rigor.
LEV.25.47	And if a sojourner or stranger who is with thee becomes rich and thy brother who is with him becomes poor and sells himself unto the stranger or sojourner who is with thee or to the race of the lineage of the stranger,
LEV.25.48	after he is sold he shall have redemption; one of his brethren shall redeem him;
LEV.25.49	either his uncle or his uncle’s son shall redeem him; or any that is near of kin unto him of his lineage shall redeem him; or if he is able, he may redeem himself.
LEV.25.50	And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee; and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of a hired servant shall it be with him.
LEV.25.51	If there are yet many years, according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
LEV.25.52	And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
LEV.25.53	And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him; and the other shall not rule with rigor over him in thy sight.
LEV.25.54	And if he is not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, both he and his children with him.
LEV.25.55	For the sons of Israel are mine; they are my slaves whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt. I AM your God.
LEV.26.1	Ye shall make no idols for yourselves nor graven image, neither shall you raise up a title, neither shall ye place any painted stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I AM your God.
LEV.26.2	Keep my sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am the 
LEV.26.3	If ye walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them,
LEV.26.4	then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit.
LEV.26.5	And your threshing shall last unto the vintage, and the vintage shall last unto the sowing time; and ye shall eat your bread to the full and dwell in your land safely.
LEV.26.6	For I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and no one shall make you afraid; and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.
LEV.26.7	And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you by the sword.
LEV.26.8	And five of you shall chase one hundred, and one hundred of you shall put ten thousands to flight; and your enemies shall fall before you by the sword.
LEV.26.9	For I will return unto you and make you fruitful and multiply you and establish my covenant with you.
LEV.26.10	And ye shall eat old store and bring forth the old because of the new.
LEV.26.11	And I will set my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not abhor you.
LEV.26.12	And I will walk among you and will be your God, and ye shall be my people.
LEV.26.13	I AM your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, that ye should not be their slaves; and I have broken the bands of your yoke and made you walk with your faces uplifted.
LEV.26.14	But if ye will not hearken unto me and will not do all these my commandments;
LEV.26.15	and if ye shall despise my statutes or if your soul should abhor my rights so that ye will not do all my commandments but that ye break my covenant,
LEV.26.16	I also will do this unto you: I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague that shall consume the eyes and torment the soul, and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
LEV.26.17	And I will place my wrath upon you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies; those that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when no one pursues you.
LEV.26.18	And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
LEV.26.19	And I will break the pride of your stronghold, and I will make your heaven as iron and your earth as bronze.
LEV.26.20	And your strength shall be spent in vain; for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
LEV.26.21	And if ye walk contrary unto me and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
LEV.26.22	I will also send wild beasts among you which shall rapture your children and destroy your animals and make you few in number, and your ways shall be desolate.
LEV.26.23	And if ye will not be corrected by me by these things, but will walk contrary unto me,
LEV.26.24	then will I also walk contrary unto you and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
LEV.26.25	And I will bring an avenging sword upon you, in vindication of the covenant; and ye shall gather together within your cities; but I will send pestilence among you, and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.
LEV.26.26	When I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you your bread again by weight, and ye shall eat and not be satisfied.
LEV.26.27	And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me but walk contrary unto me,
LEV.26.28	then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury, and I, even I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.
LEV.26.29	And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall ye eat.
LEV.26.30	And I will destroy your high places and cut down your images and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols, and my soul shall abhor you.
LEV.26.31	And I will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the aroma of your suave incense.
LEV.26.32	And I will bring the land into desolation, and your enemies who dwell therein shall be astonished at it.
LEV.26.33	And I will scatter you among the Gentiles and will draw out a sword after you, and your land shall be desolate and your cities waste.
LEV.26.34	Then shall the land rest for her sabbaths all the days that it lies desolate, while you are in your enemies’ land; even then shall the land rest and enjoy her sabbaths.
LEV.26.35	All the time that it shall be desolate, it shall rest that which it did not rest in your sabbaths when ye dwelt upon it.
LEV.26.36	And upon those that are left alive of you I will send such cowardice into their hearts in the lands of their enemies, that the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursue.
LEV.26.37	And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursue; and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.
LEV.26.38	And ye shall perish among the Gentiles, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
LEV.26.39	And those that are left of you shall pine away for their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and for the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
LEV.26.40	And they shall confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers for their trespass which they trespassed against me and that also they have walked contrary unto me,
LEV.26.41	and that I also have walked contrary unto them and have brought them into the land of their enemies; and then their uncircumcised hearts shall be humbled, and they shall plead because of their iniquity;
LEV.26.42	and I will remember my covenant with Jacob and likewise my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember, and I will remember the land.
LEV.26.43	That the land shall be without them and shall rest her sabbaths, being desolate because of them; and they shall plead because of their iniquity because they despised my rights and their soul abhorred my statutes.
LEV.26.44	And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them to destroy them utterly and to break my covenant with them; for I AM their God.
LEV.26.45	But I will remember them because of the old covenant, when I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the Gentiles, that I might be their God: I am the 
LEV.26.46	These are the statutes and rights and laws, which the 
LEV.27.1	And the 
LEV.27.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When someone shall make a special vow unto the 
LEV.27.3	Regarding the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
LEV.27.4	And if it is a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
LEV.27.5	And if it is from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.

LEV.27.7	And if it is from sixty years old and above, if it is a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
LEV.27.8	But if he is poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of the one that vowed shall the priest value him.
LEV.27.9	And if it is an animal which is offered unto the 
LEV.27.10	He shall not alter it nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; and if he shall exchange one animal for another, then it and the one exchanged thereof shall belong to the sanctuary.
LEV.27.11	And if it is an unclean animal, which cannot be offered as a sacrifice unto the 
LEV.27.12	and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad; according to the estimation of the priest, so shall it be.
LEV.27.13	But if it must be redeemed, then they shall add a fifth part thereof unto thy estimation.
LEV.27.14	And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the 
LEV.27.15	And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
LEV.27.16	And if a man shall sanctify unto the 
LEV.27.17	If he sanctifies his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
LEV.27.18	But if he sanctifies his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain until the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
LEV.27.19	And if he that sanctified the field desires to redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
LEV.27.20	But if he should not redeem the field, and if the field is sold to another, it shall not be redeemed any more;
LEV.27.21	but the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the 
LEV.27.22	And if anyone sanctifies unto the 
LEV.27.23	then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation until the year of the jubilee; and that day he shall give thy assigned price, as a holy thing unto the 
LEV.27.24	In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto the one of whom it was bought, unto whom the inheritance of the land did belong.
LEV.27.25	And all thy values shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary; twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
LEV.27.26	But the firstborn of the animals, which because it is firstborn belongs to the 
LEV.27.27	And if it is of an unclean beast, it shall be ransomed according to thy estimation, and they shall add a fifth part unto it; or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
LEV.27.28	But no anathema, that anyone shall devote unto the 
LEV.27.29	Any anathema of men which is devoted shall not be ransomed, but shall surely be put to death.
LEV.27.30	And all the tithes of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the 
LEV.27.31	And if anyone desires to redeem anything of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.
LEV.27.32	And concerning the tithe of the cows or of the sheep, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holiness unto the 
LEV.27.33	He shall not search whether it is good or bad, neither shall he change it; and if he changes it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
LEV.27.34	These are the commandments, which the 
NUM.1.1	And the 
NUM.1.2	Take the sum of all the congregation of the sons of Israel by their families, by the houses of their fathers, with the number of their names, every male by their polls,

NUM.3.43	And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.
NUM.3.44	And the 
NUM.3.45	Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel and the animals of the Levites instead of their animals, and the Levites shall be mine; I am the 
NUM.3.46	And for the ransoms of the two hundred seventy-three of the firstborn of the sons of Israel, who are more than the Levites,
NUM.3.47	thou shalt take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them (the shekel is of twenty gerahs).
NUM.3.48	And thou shalt give the money, of the ransoms of the odd number of them, unto Aaron and to his sons.
NUM.3.49	And Moses took the ransom money of those that were over and above the ones that were redeemed by the Levites
NUM.3.50	and received of the firstborn of the sons of Israel, in money, a thousand three hundred and sixty-five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
NUM.3.51	And Moses gave the money of the ransoms unto Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the 
NUM.4.1	And the 
NUM.4.2	Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, after their families, by the houses of their fathers,
NUM.4.3	from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do work in the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.4.4	This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the testimony, in the holy of holies:
NUM.4.5	When the camp is to be moved, Aaron shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering veil and cover the ark of testimony with it
NUM.4.6	and shall put thereon the covering of badgers’ skins and shall spread over it a cloth entirely of blue and shall put in the staves thereof.
NUM.4.7	And upon the table of showbread they shall spread a cloth of blue and put thereon the dishes and the spoons and the bowls and covers to cover withal; and the continual bread shall be thereon.
NUM.4.8	And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet and cover the same with a covering of badgers’ skins and shall put in the staves thereof.
NUM.4.9	And they shall take a cloth of blue and cover the lampstand of the light and its lamps and its tongs and its snuffdishes and all the oil vessels thereof with which they minister unto it;
NUM.4.10	and they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers’ skins and shall put it upon a bar.
NUM.4.11	And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue and cover it with a covering of badgers’ skins and shall put in the staves thereof;
NUM.4.12	and they shall take all the vessels of ministry with which they minister in the sanctuary and put them in a cloth of blue and cover them with a covering of badgers’ skins and shall put them on a bar.
NUM.4.13	And they shall take away the ashes with the burnt fat from the altar and spread a purple cloth thereon
NUM.4.14	and they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof with which they minister about it: the censers, the fleshhooks, the shovels, and the basins, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers’ skins and put in the staves of it.
NUM.4.15	And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary and all the vessels of the sanctuary when the camp is to set forward, after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to bear it, but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.4.16	But unto the care of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, shall be the oil of the light and the aromatic incense and the daily present and the anointing oil and the care of all the tabernacle and of all that is therein, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.
NUM.4.17	And the 
NUM.4.18	Ye shall not cut off the tribe of the families of Kohath from among the Levites,
NUM.4.19	but thus do unto them that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the holy of holies: Aaron and his sons shall come and place each one of them in his ministry and to his burden.
NUM.4.20	They shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die.
NUM.4.21	And the 
NUM.4.22	Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families;
NUM.4.23	from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them, all that enter in to the host to do work in the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.4.24	This shall be the service of the families of Gershon, to minister and to bear burdens:
NUM.4.25	They shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle and the tabernacle of the testimony, its covering, and the covering of badgers’ skins that is over it above and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the testimony
NUM.4.26	and the hangings of the court and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords and all the instruments of their service and all that is made for them; so shall they serve.
NUM.4.27	According to the word of Aaron and his sons shall be all the ministry of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens and in all their service; and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens.
NUM.4.28	This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the testimony, and their charge shall be under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
NUM.4.29	As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their families, by the houses of their fathers.
NUM.4.30	From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, all that enters into the host, to do work in the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.4.31	And this shall be the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the testimony: the boards of the tabernacle and the bars thereof and the pillars thereof and sockets thereof,
NUM.4.32	and the pillars of the court round about and their sockets and their stakes and their cords with all their instruments and with all their service; and ye shall number by name the vessels of the charge of their burden.
NUM.4.33	This shall be the service of the families of the sons of Merari for all their ministry, in the tabernacle of the testimony, under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
NUM.4.34	So Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation numbered the sons of Kohath after their families and after the houses of their fathers,
NUM.4.35	from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to minister in the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.4.36	And those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty.
NUM.4.37	These were the numbered of the families of Kohath, all that minister in the tabernacle of the testimony, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the 
NUM.4.38	And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their families and by the houses of their fathers,
NUM.4.39	from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to minister in the tabernacle of the testimony,
NUM.4.40	those that were numbered of them, throughout their families, by the houses of their fathers, were two thousand six hundred and thirty.
NUM.4.41	These were numbered of the families of the sons of Gershon, all that minister in the tabernacle of the testimony, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the 
NUM.4.42	And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, throughout their families, by the houses of their fathers,
NUM.4.43	from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to minister in the tabernacle of the testimony,
NUM.4.44	those that were numbered of them after their families, were three thousand two hundred.
NUM.4.45	These were those that were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word of the 
NUM.4.46	All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered, after their families and after the houses of their fathers,
NUM.4.47	from thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entered in to serve in the service and to bear a burden in the tabernacle of the testimony,
NUM.4.48	those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand five hundred and eighty.
NUM.4.49	As the 
NUM.5.1	And the 
NUM.5.2	Command the sons of Israel that they put out of the camp every leper and every one that has an issue and anyone who is defiled by the dead.
NUM.5.3	Both male and female shall ye put out; ye shall put them outside the camp; that they not defile the camp of those among whom I dwell.
NUM.5.4	And the sons of Israel did so and put them outside the camp; as the 
NUM.5.5	And the 
NUM.5.6	Speak unto the sons of Israel, When a man or woman shall commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the 
NUM.5.7	then they shall confess their sin which they have done, and he shall recompense his guilt with the principal thereof and add unto it the fifth part thereof and give it unto him against whom he is guilty.
NUM.5.8	But if that man has no redeemer to recompense the trespass unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the 
NUM.5.9	And every offering of all the holy things of the sons of Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.
NUM.5.10	And every man’s sanctified things shall be his; likewise whatever any man gives the priest, it shall be his.
NUM.5.11	And the 
NUM.5.12	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, If any man’s wife goes astray and betrays him,
NUM.5.13	and a man lies with her carnally, and it is hid from the eyes of her husband because she contaminated herself in secret, and there is no witness against her, neither was she taken in the act;
NUM.5.14	if a spirit of jealousy should come upon him, and he becomes jealous of his wife, and she is defiled; or if a spirit of jealousy comes upon him, and he becomes jealous of his wife, and she is not defiled,
NUM.5.15	then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put frankincense thereon; for it is a present of jealousy, a present of remembrance, which brings iniquity to memory.
NUM.5.16	And the priest shall bring her near and set her before the 
NUM.5.17	Then the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest shall take and put it into the water.
NUM.5.18	And the priest shall cause the woman to stand before the 
NUM.5.19	And the priest shall charge her by an oath and say unto the woman, If no man has lain with thee, and if thou hast not gone astray from thy husband to uncleanness, thou shalt be clean from this bitter water that brings the curse.
NUM.5.20	But if thou hast gone astray from thy husband and hast defiled thyself and some man has placed seed in thee other than thine husband,
NUM.5.21	(the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of cursing) and the priest shall say unto the woman, Let the 
NUM.5.22	and this water that causes the curse shall go into thy bowels and cause thy belly to swell and thy thigh to fail. And the woman shall say, Amen, amen.
NUM.5.23	And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall blot them out with the bitter water;
NUM.5.24	and he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that brings the curse, and the water that brings the curse shall enter into her as bitter.
NUM.5.25	Then the priest shall take the present of jealousy out of the woman’s hand and shall wave the offering before the 
NUM.5.26	And the priest shall take a handful of the present, in memory of her, and incense it upon the altar and afterward shall cause the woman to drink the water.
NUM.5.27	He shall give her, therefore, the water to drink, and it shall come to pass, that if she is defiled and has betrayed her husband, that the water that works the curse shall enter into her in bitterness, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall fail; and that woman shall be a curse among her people.
NUM.5.28	But if the woman is not defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free and shall conceive seed.
NUM.5.29	This is the law of jealousies when a woman goes astray, being under the power of her husband, and is defiled;
NUM.5.30	or of the husband upon whom a spirit of jealousy comes, and he is jealous over his wife; he shall then present the woman before the 
NUM.5.31	And that man shall be free from iniquity, and the woman shall bear her iniquity.
NUM.6.1	And the 
NUM.6.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, to dedicate themselves unto the 
NUM.6.3	they shall separate themselves from wine and strong drink and shall drink no vinegar of wine or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall they drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist grapes or dried.
NUM.6.4	All the days of their Nazariteship they shall eat nothing that is made of the wine vine, from the kernels even to the husk.
NUM.6.5	All the days of the vow of their Nazariteship no razor shall come upon their head, until the days are fulfilled of their separation unto the 
NUM.6.6	All the days that they separate themselves unto the 
NUM.6.7	They shall not make themselves unclean for their father or for their mother, for their brother or for their sister, when they die because the consecration of their God is upon their head.
NUM.6.8	All the days of their Nazariteship they are holy unto the 
NUM.6.9	And if anyone dies very suddenly beside them, and they have defiled the head of their Nazariteship, then they shall shave their head in the day of their cleansing; on the seventh day shall they shave it.
NUM.6.10	And on the eighth day they shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest to the door of the tabernacle of the testimony,
NUM.6.11	and the priest shall offer the one as the sin and the other as a burnt offering and reconcile the one that sinned upon the dead and shall sanctify their head that same day.
NUM.6.12	And they shall consecrate unto the 
NUM.6.13	This is, therefore, the law of the Nazarite, in the day in which their Nazariteship is fulfilled: they shall be brought unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony;
NUM.6.14	and they shall offer their offering unto the 
NUM.6.15	and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled with oil and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil and their present and their drink offerings.
NUM.6.16	And the priest shall bring them before the 
NUM.6.17	and he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace unto the 
NUM.6.18	Then the Nazarite shall shave the head of their Nazariteship at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony and shall take the hair of the head of their Nazariteship and put it upon the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace.
NUM.6.19	Then the priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram and one unleavened cake out of the basket and one unleavened wafer and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite after their Nazariteship is shaven;
NUM.6.20	and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the 
NUM.6.21	This is the law of the Nazarite who made a vow of their offering unto the 
NUM.6.22	And the 
NUM.6.23	Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, Thus shall ye bless the sons of Israel, saying unto them,
NUM.6.24	The 
NUM.6.25	the 
NUM.6.26	the 
NUM.6.27	And they shall place my name upon the sons of Israel, and I will bless them.
NUM.7.1	And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the tabernacle and had anointed it and sanctified it with all its vessels; likewise having anointed and sanctified the altar, with all its vessels;
NUM.7.2	that the princes of Israel, heads of the houses of their fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over those that were numbered, offered;
NUM.7.3	and they brought their offerings before the 
NUM.7.4	And the 
NUM.7.5	Take it from them, and it shall be for the service of the tabernacle of the testimony; and thou shalt give them unto the Levites, to each one according to his ministry.
NUM.7.6	Then Moses received the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the Levites.
NUM.7.7	Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon, according to their ministry;
NUM.7.8	and four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of Merari, according to their ministry, under the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.
NUM.7.9	But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none; because the ministry of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear upon their shoulders.
NUM.7.10	And the princes offered at the dedication of the altar the day that it was anointed; even the princes offered their offering before the altar.
NUM.7.11	And the 
NUM.7.12	And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon, the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah.
NUM.7.13	And his offering was one silver charger, the weight thereof was one hundred and thirty shekels, and one silver bowl of seventy shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them were full of fine flour mingled with oil for a present;

NUM.8.1	And the 
NUM.8.2	Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the face of the lampstand.
NUM.8.3	And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the face of the lampstand, as the 
NUM.8.4	And this work of the lampstand was of beaten gold, from the shaft thereof unto the flowers thereof; it was beaten work; according unto the pattern which the 
NUM.8.5	And the 
NUM.8.6	Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel, and cleanse them.
NUM.8.7	And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of atonement for sin upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and be clean.
NUM.8.8	Then let them take a young bullock with his present, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou offer as sin.
NUM.8.9	And thou shalt offer the Levites before the tabernacle of the testimony, and thou shalt gather the whole congregation of the sons of Israel together;
NUM.8.10	and thou shalt bring the Levites before the 
NUM.8.11	and Aaron shall offer the Levites before the 
NUM.8.12	And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks; and thou shalt offer the one as the sin, and the other as a burnt offering, unto the 
NUM.8.13	And thou shalt cause the Levites to present themselves before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the 
NUM.8.14	And thou shalt separate the Levites from among the sons of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine.
NUM.8.15	Thus shall the Levites go in to minister in the tabernacle of the testimony; and thou shalt cleanse them and wave them for an offering.
NUM.8.16	For they are completely given unto me from among the sons of Israel, instead of each one that opens the womb; instead of the firstborn of all the sons of Israel, I have taken them for myself.
NUM.8.17	For all the firstborn of the sons of Israel are mine, both of man and of animals; from the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.
NUM.8.18	And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the sons of Israel.
NUM.8.19	And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the sons of Israel, that they may serve the ministry of the sons of Israel in the tabernacle of the testimony and reconcile the sons of Israel, that there be no plague in the sons of Israel when the sons of Israel come near unto the sanctuary.
NUM.8.20	And Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the sons of Israel did to the Levites according unto all that the 
NUM.8.21	And the sin was removed from the Levites, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before the 
NUM.8.22	And thus went the Levites in to serve in their ministry in the tabernacle of the testimony before Aaron and before his sons; in the manner that the 
NUM.8.23	And the 
NUM.8.24	This regarding the Levites from twenty-five years old and upward, they shall go in to serve in the host of the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.8.25	And from the age of fifty years they shall return from their ministry unto the host and shall never serve again,
NUM.8.26	but shall serve with their brethren in the tabernacle of the testimony, to stand guard, even though they do not serve in the ministry. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.
NUM.9.1	And the 
NUM.9.2	Let the sons of Israel also keep the passover at its appointed season.
NUM.9.3	In the fourteenth day of this month, between the two evenings, ye shall keep it in its appointed season; according to all its ordinance and according to all the laws thereof, shall ye keep it.
NUM.9.4	And Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel that they should keep the passover.
NUM.9.5	And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month between the two evenings in the wilderness of Sinai; according to all that the 
NUM.9.6	And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day;
NUM.9.7	and those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man; why are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the 
NUM.9.8	And Moses said unto them, Wait, and I will hear what the 
NUM.9.9	And the 
NUM.9.10	Speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your generations should be unclean by reason of a dead body or be on a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the 
NUM.9.11	The fourteenth day of the second month, between the two evenings they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.
NUM.9.12	They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it; according to all the ordinance of the passover they shall keep it.
NUM.9.13	But the man that is clean and is not on a journey and forbears to keep the passover, that same soul shall be cut off from among his people; because he did not bring the offering of the 
NUM.9.14	And if a stranger shall sojourn among you and will keep the passover unto the 
NUM.9.15	And on the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle over the tent of the testimony; and in the evening there was upon the tabernacle, as it were, the appearance of fire until the morning.
NUM.9.16	So it was always: the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.
NUM.9.17	And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the sons of Israel journeyed; and in the place where the cloud abode, there the sons of Israel pitched their tents.
NUM.9.18	At the commandment of the 
NUM.9.19	And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the sons of Israel kept the charge of the 
NUM.9.20	And so it was, when the cloud was a determined number of days upon the tabernacle, according to the commandment of the 
NUM.9.21	And so it was that when the cloud remained from evening unto the morning, and in the morning the cloud was taken up, then they journeyed; or if it had remained during the day and the cloud was taken up by night, they journeyed.
NUM.9.22	Or if it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the sons of Israel camped and did not journey; but when it was taken up, they journeyed.
NUM.9.23	At the commandment of the 
NUM.10.1	And the 
NUM.10.2	Make thee two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shalt thou make them that thou may use them for the convocation of the congregation and for the moving of the camp.
NUM.10.3	And when they shall blow them, all the congregation shall join themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.10.4	But when they blow only one, then the princes, who are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee.
NUM.10.5	When ye blow an alarm, then ye shall move the camp of those that are lodged towards the east.
NUM.10.6	And when ye blow an alarm the second time, then ye shall move the camp of those that are lodged on the side of the Negev; they shall blow an alarm for their journeys.
NUM.10.7	But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.
NUM.10.8	And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and you shall have them as a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
NUM.10.9	And when ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresses you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the 
NUM.10.10	Also in the day of your gladness and in your solemn days and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and over the sacrifices of your peace, that they may be to you for a memorial before your God; I AM your God.
NUM.10.11	And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.10.12	And the sons of Israel moved out of the wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.10.13	And they moved the first time according to the commandment of the 
NUM.10.14	In the first place went the standard of the camp of the sons of Judah according to their armies, and over his host was Nahshon, the son of Amminadab.
NUM.10.15	And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethaneel, the son of Zuar.
NUM.10.16	And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab, the son of Helon.
NUM.10.17	And the tabernacle was already taken down, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.
NUM.10.18	Then the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to their armies, and over his host was Elizur, the son of Shedeur.
NUM.10.19	And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Simeon was Shelumiel, the son of Zurishaddai.
NUM.10.20	And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph, the son of Deuel.
NUM.10.21	Then the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary, and while they were coming, the others set up the tabernacle.
NUM.10.22	After them the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set forward according to their armies, and over his host was Elishama, the son of Ammihud.
NUM.10.23	And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel, the son of Pedahzur.
NUM.10.24	And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan, the son of Gideoni.
NUM.10.25	Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan set forward according to their armies, gathering together all the camps, and over his host was Ahiezer, the son of Ammishaddai.
NUM.10.26	And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel, the son of Ocran.
NUM.10.27	And over the host of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira, the son of Enan.
NUM.10.28	Thus were the journeyings of the sons of Israel according to their armies when they set forward.
NUM.10.29	Then Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, We are journeying unto the place of which the 
NUM.10.30	And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land and to my kindred.
NUM.10.31	And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; for thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou shalt be to us instead of eyes.
NUM.10.32	And it shall be, if thou go with us, that when we come into the goodness that the 
NUM.10.33	Thus they departed from the mount of the 
NUM.10.34	And the cloud of the 
NUM.10.35	And it came to pass, when the ark was moved, that Moses said, Rise up, 
NUM.10.36	And when it rested, he said, Return, O 
NUM.11.1	And it came to pass that the people complained in an evil manner in the ears of the 
NUM.11.2	Then the people cried unto Moses, and when Moses prayed unto the 
NUM.11.3	And he called the name of the place Taberah because the fire of the 
NUM.11.4	And the vulgar who were mixed in among them returned to their lust; and even the sons of Israel wept and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat?
NUM.11.5	We remember the fish, which we freely ate in Egypt, the cucumbers and the melons and the leeks and the onions and the garlic,
NUM.11.6	but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all besides this manna before our eyes.
NUM.11.7	And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium.
NUM.11.8	And the people scattered about and gathered it and ground it in mills or beat it in a mortar and baked it in pans and made cakes of it, and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.
NUM.11.9	And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it.
NUM.11.10	Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, each man in the door of his tent; and the anger of the 
NUM.11.11	And Moses said unto the 
NUM.11.12	Have I conceived all these people? Have I begotten them, that thou should say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nurse carries a sucking child, unto the land which thou hast sworn unto their fathers?
NUM.11.13	Where should I find flesh to give unto all these people? For they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh that we may eat.
NUM.11.14	I am not able to bear all these people alone because it is too heavy for me.
NUM.11.15	And if thou must deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found grace in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.
NUM.11.16	Then the 
NUM.11.17	And I will come down and talk with thee there, and I will take of the spirit which is in thee and will put it upon them, and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone.
NUM.11.18	But thou shalt say unto the people, Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow, and ye shall eat flesh, for ye have wept in the ears of the 
NUM.11.19	Ye shall not eat one day nor two days nor five days neither ten days nor twenty days,
NUM.11.20	But even a whole month, until it comes out of your nostrils and it becomes loathsome unto you, because ye have despised the 
NUM.11.21	Then Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen, and thou hast said, I will give them flesh that they may eat a whole month!
NUM.11.22	Shall sheep and oxen be slain for them, to suffice them? Or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them?
NUM.11.23	Then the 
NUM.11.24	And Moses went out and told the people the words of the 
NUM.11.25	Then the 
NUM.11.26	But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad and the name of the other Medad, upon whom the spirit also rested; and they were of those that were written, but they had not gone unto the tabernacle; and they began to prophesy in the camp.
NUM.11.27	And a young man ran and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad prophesy in the camp.
NUM.11.28	Then Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.
NUM.11.29	And Moses said unto him, Art thou jealous for my sake? It would be good that all the 
NUM.11.30	And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.
NUM.11.31	And there went forth a wind from the 
NUM.11.32	Then the people stood up all that day and all that night and all the next day, and they gathered the quail; he that gathered least gathered ten heaps, and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.
NUM.11.33	And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the wrath of the 
NUM.11.34	And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah because there they buried the people that lusted.
NUM.11.35	From Kibrothhattaavah he moved the people unto Hazeroth, and they abode at Hazeroth.
NUM.12.1	And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had taken; for he had taken an Ethiopian woman.
NUM.12.2	And they said, Has the 
NUM.12.3	(Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.)
NUM.12.4	And the 
NUM.12.5	Then the 
NUM.12.6	And he said, Hear now my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the 
NUM.12.7	My slave Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.
NUM.12.8	With him I will speak mouth to mouth and by sight not by enigmas; he shall see the similitude of the 
NUM.12.9	Then the anger of the 
NUM.12.10	And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle, and, behold, Miriam was leprous as the snow; and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.
NUM.12.11	And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly, and we have sinned.
NUM.12.12	Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother’s womb.
NUM.12.13	Then Moses cried unto the 
NUM.12.14	And the 
NUM.12.15	So Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days, and the people did not journey until Miriam was brought in again.
NUM.12.16	And afterward he moved the people from Hazeroth, and they pitched camp in the wilderness of Paran.
NUM.13.1	And the 
NUM.13.2	Send thou men that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give unto the sons of Israel; of every tribe of their fathers ye shall send a man, each one a prince among them.
NUM.13.3	And Moses by the commandment of the 
NUM.13.4	And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua, the son of Zaccur.
NUM.13.5	Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat, the son of Hori.
NUM.13.6	Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh.
NUM.13.7	Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal, the son of Joseph.
NUM.13.8	Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hosea, the son of Nun.
NUM.13.9	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti, the son of Raphu.
NUM.13.10	Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel, the son of Sodi.
NUM.13.11	Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi, the son of Susi.
NUM.13.12	Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel, the son of Gemalli.
NUM.13.13	Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur, the son of Michael.
NUM.13.14	Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi, the son of Vophsi.
NUM.13.15	Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel, the son of Machi.
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Hosea, the son of Nun, Joshua.
NUM.13.17	And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto them, Go up this way towards the Negev and go up into the mountain
NUM.13.18	and see the land, what it is, and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, few or many,
NUM.13.19	and how the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad, and what cities there are that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds,
NUM.13.20	And what the land is, whether it is fertile or sterile, whether there are trees therein, or not. And be ye of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe grapes.
NUM.13.21	So they went up and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.
NUM.13.22	And they ascended by the Negev and came unto Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the sons of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)
NUM.13.23	And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and from there they cut down a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates and of the figs.
NUM.13.24	The place was called the brook Eshcol because of the cluster of grapes which the sons of Israel cut down from there.
NUM.13.25	And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.
NUM.13.26	And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran to Kadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land.
NUM.13.27	And they told him and said, We came unto the land where thou didst send us, and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
NUM.13.28	Nevertheless the people are strong that dwell in that land, and the cities are very great and strong; and moreover we saw the sons of Anak there.
NUM.13.29	Amalek dwells in the land of the Negev, and the Hittite and the Jebusite and the Amorite dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanite dwells by the sea and by the side of the Jordan.
NUM.13.30	Then Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.
NUM.13.31	But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against that people, for they are stronger than we.
NUM.13.32	And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out unto the sons of Israel, saying, The land, through which we have gone through to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature.
NUM.13.33	And there we saw giants, the sons of Anak, of the race of the giants; and we were in our own sight as locusts, and so we were in their sight.
NUM.14.1	Then all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried, and the people wept that night.
NUM.14.2	And all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, and the whole congregation said unto them, Oh, that we might die in the land of Egypt or that we might die in this wilderness!
NUM.14.3	And why has the 
NUM.14.4	And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt.
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel.
NUM.14.6	And Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, who were of those that had spied out the land, rent their clothes;
NUM.14.7	and they spoke unto all the company of the sons of Israel, saying, The land which we passed through to spy out is an exceeding good land.
NUM.14.8	If the 
NUM.14.9	Therefore, do not be rebels against the 
NUM.14.10	Then all the multitude spoke of stoning them with stones. But the glory of the 
NUM.14.11	And the 
NUM.14.12	I will smite them with the pestilence and disinherit them and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.
NUM.14.13	And Moses said unto the 
NUM.14.14	and the inhabitants of this land will say, for they have already heard that thou, oh 
NUM.14.15	and that thou hast caused all this people to die as one man; and the Gentiles who have heard of thy fame will speak, saying,
NUM.14.16	Because the 
NUM.14.17	And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying,
NUM.14.18	The 
NUM.14.19	Pardon now the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy and as thou hast forgiven this people from Egypt even until now.
NUM.14.20	Then the 
NUM.14.21	But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the 
NUM.14.22	Because all those men who saw my glory and my signs which I have done in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these ten times and have not hearkened to my voice,
NUM.14.23	surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their fathers, neither shall any of those that provoked me see it.
NUM.14.24	But my slave Caleb, because there was another spirit in him, and he proved to follow after me, I will bring him into the land that he entered into, and his seed shall receive it by inheritance,
NUM.14.25	and even the Amalekite and the Canaanite who dwell in the valley. Turn around tomorrow and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
NUM.14.26	And the 
NUM.14.27	How long shall I hear this evil congregation, which murmurs against me, the complaints of the sons of Israel, which they murmur against me?
NUM.14.28	Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the 
NUM.14.29	Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness, all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me;
NUM.14.30	doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.
NUM.14.31	But your little ones, whom ye said should be a prey, I will bring them in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.
NUM.14.32	But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.
NUM.14.33	And your children shall be shepherded in the wilderness forty years and bear your fornications until your carcasses are wasted in the wilderness.
NUM.14.34	After the number of the days in which ye spied out the land, even forty days, each day for a year, ye shall bear your iniquities forty years, and ye shall know my reason for annulling my promise.
NUM.14.35	I, the 
NUM.14.36	And the men, whom Moses had sent to spy out the land, who returned and made all the congregation to murmur against him by bringing up a slander upon the land,
NUM.14.37	even those men that brought an evil report of the land, died by the plague before the 
NUM.14.38	But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of the men that went to spy out the land.
NUM.14.39	And Moses told these things unto all the sons of Israel, and the people mourned greatly.
NUM.14.40	And they rose up early in the morning and climbed up into the top of the mountain, saying, Here we are prepared to go up unto the place of which the 
NUM.14.41	And Moses said, Why do ye break the commandment of the 
NUM.14.42	Do not go up, for the 
NUM.14.43	For the Amalekite and the Canaanite are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; because ye are turned away from following the 
NUM.14.44	But they presumed to go up unto the hill top; nevertheless, the ark of the covenant of the 
NUM.14.45	Then the Amalekite came down and the Canaanite who dwelt in that hill and smote them and defeated them, pursuing them unto Hormah.
NUM.15.1	And the 
NUM.15.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When you have entered into the land of your habitations, which I give unto you
NUM.15.3	and will make an offering on fire unto the 
NUM.15.4	then he that offers his offering unto the 
NUM.15.5	and of wine for a drink offering shalt thou offer the fourth part of a hin in addition to the burnt offering or the sacrifice, for each lamb.
NUM.15.6	And for each ram, thou shalt prepare as a present two tenth deals of flour mingled with the third part of a hin of oil;
NUM.15.7	and of wine for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of a hin, for an acceptable savour unto the 
NUM.15.8	And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering or for a sacrifice, to offer a vow or a sacrifice of peace unto the 
NUM.15.9	thou shalt offer with the bullock a present of three tenth deals of flour mingled with half of a hin of oil;
NUM.15.10	and of wine for a drink offering thou shalt offer half of a hin, for an offering on fire, of an acceptable savour unto the 
NUM.15.11	Thus shall it be done for each bullock or for each ram or for each lamb, the same for sheep as for goats.
NUM.15.12	According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to each one according to their number.
NUM.15.13	All that are natural born shall do these things after this manner, to offer an offering on fire, of an acceptable savour unto the 
NUM.15.14	And when a stranger sojourns with you or whoever is among you, for your ages, if they will offer an offering on fire of an acceptable savour unto the 
NUM.15.15	One statute shall be both for you of the congregation and also for the stranger that sojourns with you, a perpetual statute, for your ages; as ye are, so shall the stranger be before the 
NUM.15.16	One same law and the same right shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourns with you.
NUM.15.17	The 
NUM.15.18	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When ye have come into the land where I bring you,
NUM.15.19	then it shall be that when ye begin to eat of the bread of the land, ye shall offer up an offering unto the 
NUM.15.20	Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an offering; as the offering of the threshingfloor, so shall ye offer it.
NUM.15.21	Of the firstfruits of your dough ye shall give unto the 
NUM.15.22	And when ye err and do not observe all these commandments which the 
NUM.15.23	even all that the 
NUM.15.24	then it shall be, if the sin was committed by ignorance without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bullock as a burnt offering, for an acceptable savour unto the 
NUM.15.25	And the priest shall reconcile all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them, for it is ignorance; and they shall bring their offering, an offering on fire unto the 
NUM.15.26	And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the sons of Israel and the stranger that sojourns among them, seeing all the people were in ignorance.
NUM.15.27	And if any person sins through ignorance, then he shall bring a she goat of the first year as the sin.
NUM.15.28	And the priest shall reconcile the soul that errs ignorantly, when he sins by ignorance before the 
NUM.15.29	Ye shall have the same law for the one that sins through ignorance, both for the natural born among the sons of Israel and for the stranger that sojourns among them.
NUM.15.30	But the person that does something consciously, whether they are natural born or a stranger, the same reproaches the 
NUM.15.31	Because he has despised the word of the 
NUM.15.32	And while the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man that gathered firewood upon the sabbath day.
NUM.15.33	And those that found him gathering firewood brought him unto Moses and Aaron and unto all the congregation.
NUM.15.34	And they put him in ward because it was not declared what should be done to him.
NUM.15.35	And the 
NUM.15.36	Then all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died, as the 
NUM.15.37	And the 
NUM.15.38	Speak unto the sons of Israel and bid them that they make for themselves fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations and that they put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue.
NUM.15.39	And it shall be unto you for a fringe that ye may look upon it and remember all the commandments of the 
NUM.15.40	That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy unto your God.
NUM.15.41	I am the 
NUM.16.1	Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, of the sons of Reuben, took men;
NUM.16.2	and they rose up against Moses, with two hundred and fifty men of the sons of Israel, princes of the congregation, of the council, men of renown;
NUM.16.3	and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them, We have had enough of you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the 
NUM.16.4	And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face;
NUM.16.5	and he spoke unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Tomorrow the 
NUM.16.6	Do this: Take censers, Korah, and all his company,
NUM.16.7	and put fire in them and put incense in them before the 
NUM.16.8	And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:
NUM.16.9	Does it seem but a small thing unto you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to minister in the service of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.16.10	And that he has brought thee near to him and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee, and ye seek the priesthood also?
NUM.16.11	For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the 
NUM.16.12	And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they replied, We will not come up.
NUM.16.13	Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that flowed with milk and honey to make us die in the wilderness, but thou must also make thyself lord to rule over us?
NUM.16.14	Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards; wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? We will not come up.
NUM.16.15	Then Moses was very angry and said unto the 
NUM.16.16	And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the 
NUM.16.17	and let each man take his censer and put incense in them and let each man bring his censer before the 
NUM.16.18	And each man took his censer and put fire in them and laid incense in them and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the testimony with Moses and Aaron.
NUM.16.19	And Korah had gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony; then the glory of the 
NUM.16.20	And the 
NUM.16.21	Separate yourselves from among this congregation, and I will consume them in a moment.
NUM.16.22	And they fell upon their faces and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation?
NUM.16.23	Then the 
NUM.16.24	Speak unto the congregation, saying, Separate yourselves now from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.
NUM.16.25	And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him.
NUM.16.26	And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart from the tents of these wicked men and touch nothing of theirs lest peradventure ye be consumed in all their sins.
NUM.16.27	So they removed themselves from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side; and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, with their wives and their sons and their little children.
NUM.16.28	And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the 
NUM.16.29	If these men die the common death of all men or if they are visited after the visitation of all men, then the 
NUM.16.30	But if the 
NUM.16.31	And it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words that the ground broke open under them;
NUM.16.32	the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up, and their houses and all the men of Korah and all their goods.
NUM.16.33	They and all that they had went down alive into Sheol, and the earth closed upon them, and they perished from among the congregation.
NUM.16.34	And all Israel, those that were round about them, fled at the cry of them, for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.
NUM.16.35	And fire came out from the 
NUM.16.36	Then the 
NUM.16.37	Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning and scatter thou the fire yonder, for
NUM.16.38	the censers of these sinners are sanctified against their own souls, and broad plates shall be made of them for a covering of the altar, for they offered with them before the 
NUM.16.39	And Eleazar, the priest, took the brass censers with which those that were burnt had offered, and they were made into a broad covering of the altar
NUM.16.40	to be a memorial unto the sons of Israel, that no stranger who is not of the seed of Aaron come near to offer incense before the 
NUM.16.41	But on the next day all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the 
NUM.16.42	And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron that they looked toward the tabernacle of the testimony; and, behold, the cloud had covered it, and the glory of the 
NUM.16.43	And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.16.44	And the 
NUM.16.45	Depart from among this congregation, and I will consume them in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.
NUM.16.46	And Moses said unto Aaron, Take the censer and put fire in it from off the altar and put incense upon it and go quickly unto the congregation and reconcile them; for the wrath has gone out from before the face of the 
NUM.16.47	Then Aaron took his censer as Moses said and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people; and he put on incense and reconciled the people.
NUM.16.48	And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.
NUM.16.49	Now those that died in that plague were fourteen thousand seven hundred, besides those that died concerning the matter of Korah.
NUM.16.50	And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, when the plague was stayed.
NUM.17.1	And the 
NUM.17.2	Speak unto the sons of Israel and take of each of them a rod according to the houses of their fathers, of all their princes, twelve rods according to the houses of their fathers, and write thou each man’s name upon his rod.
NUM.17.3	And thou shalt write Aaron’s name upon the rod of Levi, for each head of family of their fathers shall have one rod.
NUM.17.4	And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the testimony, before the testimony, where I will testify of myself unto you.
NUM.17.5	And it shall come to pass regarding the man whom I shall choose that his rod shall blossom; and I will resolve the complaints of the sons of Israel, with which they murmur against you.
NUM.17.6	And Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel, and all their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers’ houses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.
NUM.17.7	And Moses laid up the rods before the 
NUM.17.8	And it came to pass that on the next day Moses went into the tabernacle of the testimony; and, behold, the rod of Aaron of the house of Levi had budded and blossomed and brought forth open flowers and yielded almonds.
NUM.17.9	Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the 
NUM.17.10	And the 
NUM.17.11	And Moses did as the 
NUM.17.12	Then the sons of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying, Behold, we are dead, we are lost, we are all lost.
NUM.17.13	Anyone who comes near unto the tabernacle of the 
NUM.18.1	And the 
NUM.18.2	And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee and serve thee; but thou and thy sons with thee shall serve before the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.18.3	And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle; only they shall not come near the holy vessels or the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.
NUM.18.4	And they shall join themselves unto thee and keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony in all the service of the tabernacle; and no stranger shall come near unto you.
NUM.18.5	And ye shall have the charge of the sanctuary and the charge of the altar, that there be no more wrath upon the sons of Israel.
NUM.18.6	For behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the sons of Israel, given unto you as a gift of the 
NUM.18.7	Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priesthood for every thing of the altar and within the veil, and ye shall minister; for I have given the service of your priesthood as a gift, and the stranger that comes near shall die.
NUM.18.8	The 
NUM.18.9	This shall be thine of the holy things, reserved from the fire: every offering of theirs, every present of theirs, and every offering that represents their sin, and every offering that represents their guilt, which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons.
NUM.18.10	In the sanctuary shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it; it shall be holy unto thee.
NUM.18.11	This also shall be thine: the heave offering of their gifts. All the wave offerings of the sons of Israel, I have given them unto thee and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever; everyone that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.
NUM.18.12	All the best of the oil and all the best of the wine and of the wheat, the firstfruits of this, which they shall present unto the 
NUM.18.13	The firstfruits of theirs of all the things of the land, which they shall bring unto the 
NUM.18.14	Every anathema in Israel shall be thine.
NUM.18.15	Every thing that opens the womb in all flesh, which they shall offer unto the 
NUM.18.16	And from a month old shalt thou effect their ransom, a ransom according to thine estimation, for the price of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.
NUM.18.17	But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep, or the firstborn of a goat, thou shalt not ransom; they are sanctified; thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar and shalt burn their fat for an offering on fire, for an acceptable savour unto the 
NUM.18.18	And the flesh shall be thine, as the wave breast and as the right shoulder shall be thine.
NUM.18.19	All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the sons of Israel offer unto the 
NUM.18.20	And the 
NUM.18.21	And, behold, I have given the sons of Levi all the tithes in Israel for an inheritance, for their ministry because they serve in the ministry of the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.18.22	Neither must the sons of Israel from now on come near the tabernacle of the testimony lest they bear sin and die because of it.
NUM.18.23	But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the testimony, and they shall bear their iniquity by a perpetual statute throughout your ages, and they shall not possess an inheritance among the sons of Israel.
NUM.18.24	For unto the Levites I have given the tithes of the sons of Israel as inheritance, which they shall offer unto the 
NUM.18.25	And the 
NUM.18.26	Thus shalt thou speak unto the Levites and say unto them, When ye take the tithes from the sons of Israel which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye shall present a tithe of the tithes as an offering unto the 
NUM.18.27	And ye shall count your offering as though it were the grain of the threshingfloor and as the fullness of the winepress.
NUM.18.28	Thus ye also shall offer an offering unto the 
NUM.18.29	Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every offering unto the 
NUM.18.30	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye offer the best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the fruit of the threshingfloor and as the fruit of the winepress.
NUM.18.31	And ye shall eat it in any place, ye and your family; for it is your reward for your ministry in the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.18.32	And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have offered from it the best of it; and ye shall not pollute the holy things of the sons of Israel, and ye shall not die.
NUM.19.1	And the 
NUM.19.2	This is the ordinance of the law which the 
NUM.19.3	and ye shall give her unto Eleazar, the priest, that he may bring her forth outside the camp, and he shall cause her to be slain in his presence.
NUM.19.4	And Eleazar, the priest, shall take of her blood with his finger and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the testimony seven times;
NUM.19.5	and he shall cause the heifer to be burnt in his sight; her skin and her flesh and her blood with her dung shall he cause to burn.
NUM.19.6	Then the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.
NUM.19.7	Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.
NUM.19.8	Likewise he that burns her shall wash his clothes in water and bathe his flesh in water and shall be unclean until the evening.
NUM.19.9	And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and lay them up outside the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the sons of Israel for the water of separation; it is sin.
NUM.19.10	And he that gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; and it shall be unto the sons of Israel and unto the stranger that sojourns among them for a perpetual statute.
NUM.19.11	He that touches the dead body of any human person shall be unclean seven days.
NUM.19.12	They shall remove the sin from themselves with that water on the third day, and on the seventh day they shall be clean; but if they do not remove the sin from themselves the third day, then the seventh day they shall not be clean.
NUM.19.13	Whoever touches the dead body of anyone that is dead and does not remove the sin has defiled the tabernacle of the 
NUM.19.14	This is the law when anyone dies in a tent; all that come into the tent and all that are in the tent shall be unclean seven days.
NUM.19.15	And every open vessel which has no lid fastened upon it shall be unclean.
NUM.19.16	And whoever touches one that is slain with a sword in the open fields or a dead body or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean seven days.
NUM.19.17	And for the unclean person they shall take of the dust of the heifer that was burnt as sin and put living water over it in a vessel;
NUM.19.18	and a clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it upon the tent and upon all the stuff and upon the persons that were there and upon the one that touched the bone or the one slain or the one dead or the grave.
NUM.19.19	And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day; and when he has removed the sin from them the seventh day, he shall then wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and shall be clean in the evening.
NUM.19.20	But the man that shall be unclean and shall not cause the sin to be removed from himself, that person shall be cut off from among the congregation because he has defiled the tabernacle of the 
NUM.19.21	And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, also he that sprinkles the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that touches the water of separation shall be unclean until evening.
NUM.19.22	And whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the person that touches it shall be unclean until evening.
NUM.20.1	Then came the sons of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there and was buried there.
NUM.20.2	And there was no water for the congregation; and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.
NUM.20.3	And the people contended with Moses and spoke, saying, Oh, that we had died when our brethren died before the 
NUM.20.4	And why have ye caused the congregation of the 
NUM.20.5	And why have ye made us to come up out of Egypt to bring us in unto this evil place? It is not a place to plant seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates; there is not even any water to drink.
NUM.20.6	And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the congregation unto the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, and they fell upon their faces; and the glory of the 
NUM.20.7	And the 
NUM.20.8	Take the rod and gather the congregation together, thou and Aaron, thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, and it shall give forth its water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock; so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.
NUM.20.9	Then Moses took the rod from before the 
NUM.20.10	And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock?
NUM.20.11	Then Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice; and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.
NUM.20.12	And the 
NUM.20.13	These are the waters of Meribah; over which the sons of Israel strove with the 
NUM.20.14	And Moses sent ambassadors from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that has befallen us:
NUM.20.15	how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we were in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians mistreated us and our fathers;
NUM.20.16	and we cried unto the 
NUM.20.17	Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country; we will not pass through the fields or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells; we will go by the king’s high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left until we have passed thy borders.
NUM.20.18	And Edom replied unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me lest I come out against thee with the sword.
NUM.20.19	And the sons of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way; and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it; I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.
NUM.20.20	And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with many people and with a strong hand.
NUM.20.21	Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border; and thus Israel turned away from him.
NUM.20.22	And the sons of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto Mount Hor.
NUM.20.23	And the 
NUM.20.24	Aaron shall be gathered unto his peoples; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the sons of Israel because ye were rebels to my word at the water of Meribah.
NUM.20.25	Take Aaron and Eleazar, his son, and bring them up unto Mount Hor
NUM.20.26	and cause Aaron to be stripped of his garments and put them upon Eleazar, his son; for Aaron shall be gathered unto his people and shall die there.
NUM.20.27	And Moses did as the 
NUM.20.28	And Moses caused Aaron to be stripped of his garments and put them upon Eleazar, his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount; and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.
NUM.20.29	And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the families of Israel.
NUM.21.1	And when King Arad, the Canaanite, who dwelt toward the Negev, heard tell that Israel came by the way of the sentinels; then he fought against Israel and took some of them prisoners.
NUM.21.2	Then Israel vowed a vow unto the 
NUM.21.3	And the 
NUM.21.4	And they journeyed from Mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to go around the land of Edom, and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.
NUM.21.5	And the people spoke against God and against Moses, Why have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loathes this light bread.
NUM.21.6	And the 
NUM.21.7	Then the people came to Moses and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the 
NUM.21.8	And the 
NUM.21.9	And Moses made a serpent of brass and put it up as a banner, and it came to pass that when a serpent bit anyone, he beheld the serpent of brass, and lived.
NUM.21.10	And the sons of Israel set forward and pitched camp in Oboth.
NUM.21.11	And they journeyed from Oboth and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the rising of the sun.
NUM.21.12	From there they removed and pitched in the valley of Zared.
NUM.21.13	From thence they removed and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the borders of the Amorite; for Arnon is the border of Moab between Moab and the Amorite.
NUM.21.14	Therefore it is said in the book of the battles of the 
NUM.21.15	and at the stream of the brooks that goes down to the dwelling of Ar, and lies upon the border of Moab.
NUM.21.16	And from there they went to Beer; this is the well of which the 
NUM.21.17	Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it.
NUM.21.18	The princes dug the well, the willing people dug it, and the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah.
NUM.21.19	And from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth.
NUM.21.20	And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the fields of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.
NUM.21.21	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,
NUM.21.22	Let me pass through thy land; we will not turn into the fields or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the wells; but we will go along by the king’s high way until we are past thy borders.
NUM.21.23	But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border; instead Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel into the wilderness; and he came to Jahaz and fought against Israel.
NUM.21.24	And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword and possessed his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the sons of Ammon, for the border of the sons of Ammon was strong.
NUM.21.25	And Israel took all these cities; and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites in Heshbon and in all the villages thereof.
NUM.21.26	For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and taken out of his hand all his land unto Arnon.
NUM.21.27	Therefore those that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared;
NUM.21.28	for there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon; it has consumed Ar of Moab and the lords of the high places of Arnon.
NUM.21.29	Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh; he has put thy sons to flight and thy daughters into captivity because of Sihon king of the Amorites.
NUM.21.30	And Heshbon destroyed their kingdom even unto Dibon, and we have laid them waste even unto Nophah and Medeba.
NUM.21.31	Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorite.
NUM.21.32	And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages thereof and drove out the Amorite that was there.
NUM.21.33	And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan; and Og, the king of Bashan, went out against them, he and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
NUM.21.34	Then the 
NUM.21.35	So they smote him and his sons and all his people until there was none left him alive; and they possessed his land.
NUM.22.1	And the sons of Israel set forward and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side Jordan in front of Jericho.
NUM.22.2	And Balak, the son of Zippor, saw all that Israel had done to the Amorite.
NUM.22.3	And Moab was sore afraid of the people because they were many; and Moab was distressed because of the sons of Israel.
NUM.22.4	And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licks up the herbs of the field. And Balak, the son of Zippor, was king of the Moabites at that time.
NUM.22.5	Therefore he sent messengers unto Balaam, the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the river Eufrates in the land of the sons of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt; behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me.
NUM.22.6	Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people, for they are too mighty for me; peradventure I shall be able to smite them and drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom thou blessest shall be blessed, and he whom thou cursest shall be cursed.
NUM.22.7	And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the incantations in their hand; and they came unto Balaam and spoke unto him the words of Balak.
NUM.22.8	And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will recite the words unto you when the 
NUM.22.9	And God came unto Balaam and said, Who are these men with thee?
NUM.22.10	And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent unto me, saying,
NUM.22.11	Behold, this people that has come out of Egypt, covers the face of the earth; come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them and drive them out.
NUM.22.12	Then God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; neither shalt thou curse the people; for they are blessed.
NUM.22.13	So Balaam rose up in the morning and said unto the princes of Balak, Go back to your land; for the 
NUM.22.14	And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak and said, Balaam refused to come with us.
NUM.22.15	And Balak sent yet again princes, more and more honourable than those.
NUM.22.16	And they came to Balaam and said to him, Thus saith Balak, the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me;
NUM.22.17	for I will without a doubt honour thee greatly, and I will do whatever thou sayest unto me; come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people.
NUM.22.18	And Balaam answered and said unto the slaves of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the 
NUM.22.19	Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night that I may know what the 
NUM.22.20	And God came unto Balaam at night and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.
NUM.22.21	So Balaam rose up in the morning and saddled his female ass and went with the princes of Moab.
NUM.22.22	And God’s anger was kindled because he went, and the angel of the 
NUM.22.23	And the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.24	But the angel of the 
NUM.22.25	And when the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.26	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.27	And when the ass saw the angel of the 
NUM.22.28	Then the 
NUM.22.29	And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me. I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee.
NUM.22.30	And the ass said unto Balaam, Am I not thine ass upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? Was I ever accustomed to do so unto thee? And he said, No.
NUM.22.31	Then the 
NUM.22.32	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.33	The ass saw me and turned from me these three times; and if she had not turned from me, I also now would slay thee and leave her alive.
NUM.22.34	Then Balaam said unto the angel of the 
NUM.22.35	And the angel of the 
NUM.22.36	And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of Moab, which is next to the border of Arnon, which is at the limit of his territory.
NUM.22.37	And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? Why hast thou not come unto me? Am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour?
NUM.22.38	And Balaam said unto Balak, Behold, I am come unto thee; may I now say something? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.
NUM.22.39	And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.
NUM.22.40	And Balak killed oxen and sheep and sent to Balaam and to the princes that were with him.
NUM.22.41	And on the next day, Balak took Balaam and brought him up into the high places of Baal, and from there he saw the utmost part of the people.
NUM.23.1	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.
NUM.23.2	And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.
NUM.23.3	And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I will go; peradventure the 
NUM.23.4	And God met Balaam; and he said unto him, I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered upon each altar a bullock and a ram.
NUM.23.5	And the 
NUM.23.6	And he returned unto him, and, behold, he stood by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the princes of Moab.
NUM.23.7	And he took up his parable and said, Balak, the king of Moab, has brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse me Jacob and come, denounce Israel.
NUM.23.8	Why should I curse one whom God has not cursed? And why should I denounce one whom the 
NUM.23.9	For from the top of the rocks I have seen him, and from the hills I beheld him; behold, a people that shall dwell in confidence and shall not be counted among the Gentiles.
NUM.23.10	Who shall count the dust of Jacob and the number of the fourth part of Israel? Let my soul die the death of the righteous, and let my last end be like his!
NUM.23.11	Then Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.
NUM.23.12	And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which the 
NUM.23.13	And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from which thou may see them; thou hast seen but the utmost part of them and hast not seen them all; and from there thou shalt curse them for me.
NUM.23.14	And he brought him into the field of Zophim to the top of Pisgah and built seven altars and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
NUM.23.15	Then he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while I meet the 
NUM.23.16	And the 
NUM.23.17	And he came unto him, and behold, he stood by his burnt offering and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What has the 
NUM.23.18	Then he took up his parable and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:
NUM.23.19	God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent; he said and shall he not do it? He spoke and shall he not execute it?
NUM.23.20	Behold, I have received blessing; and he has blessed; and I cannot reverse it.
NUM.23.21	He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither has he seen rebellion in Israel; the 
NUM.23.22	God brought them out of Egypt; he has, as it were the strength of a unicorn.
NUM.23.23	Because there is no enchantment in Jacob, neither is there any divination in Israel. According to this time, it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What God has made!
NUM.23.24	Behold the people, who shall rise up as a great lion and lift up himself as a young lion; he shall not lie down until he eats of the prey and drinks the blood of the slain.
NUM.23.25	Then Balak said unto Balaam, Now that you do not curse them, do not bless them either.
NUM.23.26	Then Balaam said unto Balak, Did I not tell thee that all that the 
NUM.23.27	And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou may curse them for me from there.
NUM.23.28	And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looks toward Jeshimon.
NUM.23.29	And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars and prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.
NUM.23.30	And Balak did as Balaam had said and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.
NUM.24.1	And when Balaam saw that it pleased the 
NUM.24.2	and lifting up his eyes, he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.
NUM.24.3	Then he took up his parable and said, Balaam, the son of Beor, has said and the man whose eyes are open has said,
NUM.24.4	he who has heard the words of God has said, who saw the vision of the Almighty, fallen, but having his eyes open:
NUM.24.5	How beautiful are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy habitations, O Israel!
NUM.24.6	As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river’s side, as the trees of lign aloes which the 
NUM.24.7	From his branches he shall distil waters, and his seed shall be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted.
NUM.24.8	God brought him forth out of Egypt; he has, as it were, the strength of a unicorn; he shall eat up the Gentiles his enemies and shall break their bones and pierce them through with his arrows.
NUM.24.9	He couched, he lay down as a lion and as a great lion; who shall awaken him? Blessed is he that blesses thee, and cursed is he that curses thee.
NUM.24.10	Then Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and smiting his hands together he said, I called thee to curse my enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three times.
NUM.24.11	Therefore, now flee thou to thy place; I said that I would honour thee; but, behold, the 
NUM.24.12	And Balaam replied unto Balak, Did I not declare also unto thy messengers which thou didst send unto me, saying,
NUM.24.13	If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of the 
NUM.24.14	Therefore, behold, I go now unto my people; come and I will indicate unto thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter days.
NUM.24.15	And he took up his parable and said, Balaam, the son of Beor, has said, the man whose eyes are open has said,
NUM.24.16	he who has heard the words of God has said, and he who knows the knowledge of the most High, he who saw the vision of the Almighty, fallen, but having his eyes open:
NUM.24.17	I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not near by; there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of Israel and shall smite the corners of Moab and destroy all the sons of Seth.
NUM.24.18	And Edom shall be taken; Seir also shall be taken by his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.
NUM.24.19	Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion and shall destroy what remains of the city.
NUM.24.20	And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek, head of the Gentiles; but his latter end shall be that he perish for ever.
NUM.24.21	And he looked on the Kenite and took up his parable and said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock;
NUM.24.22	because the Kenite shall be thrown out, when Asshur shall carry thee away captive.
NUM.24.23	And he took up his parable again and said, Alas, who shall live when God shall do these things!
NUM.24.24	And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim and shall afflict Asshur and shall afflict Eber, but he also shall perish for ever.
NUM.24.25	Then Balaam rose up and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.
NUM.25.1	And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to fornicate with the daughters of Moab,
NUM.25.2	who called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate and bowed down to their gods.
NUM.25.3	And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor; and the anger of the 
NUM.25.4	And the 
NUM.25.5	Then Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.
NUM.25.6	Then, behold, one of the sons of Israel came and brought unto his brethren a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses and in the sight of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
NUM.25.7	And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation and took a javelin in his hand;
NUM.25.8	and he went after the man of Israel into the tent and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel and the woman through her belly. So the plague of the sons of Israel was stayed.
NUM.25.9	And those that died in that plague were twenty-four thousand.
NUM.25.10	Then the 
NUM.25.11	Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the sons of Israel, being zealous for my sake among them, therefore I did not consume the sons of Israel in my jealousy.
NUM.25.12	Because of this say unto them, Behold, I establish my covenant of peace with him;
NUM.25.13	and he shall have, and his seed after him, even the covenant of the everlasting priesthood because he was zealous for his God and reconciled the sons of Israel.
NUM.25.14	Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianite, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a family of the tribe of Simeon.
NUM.25.15	And the name of the Midianite woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur, prince of peoples, of the house of the father, in Midian.
NUM.25.16	And the 
NUM.25.17	Declare war on the Midianites and smite them;
NUM.25.18	for they treated you as enemies with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was slain in the day of the plague for Peor’s sake.
NUM.26.1	And it came to pass after the plague that the 
NUM.26.2	Take the sum of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, from twenty years old and upward, by the houses of their fathers, all that are able to go to war in Israel.
NUM.26.3	And Moses and Eleazar, the priest, spoke with them in the plains of Moab by the Jordan of Jericho, saying,
NUM.26.4	Count the people from twenty years old and upward as the 
NUM.26.5	Reuben, firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben: Enoch, of whom was the family of the Enochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites;

NUM.26.61	And Nadab and Abihu died when they offered strange fire before the 
NUM.26.62	And those that were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand, all males from a month old and upward; for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel because no inheritance was to be given them among the sons of Israel.

NUM.27.2	And they stood before Moses and before Eleazar, the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the testimony, saying,
NUM.27.3	Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of those that gathered themselves together against the 
NUM.27.4	Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family because he has no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father.
NUM.27.5	And Moses brought their cause before the 
NUM.27.6	And the 
NUM.27.7	The daughters of Zelophehad speak right; thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father’s brethren, and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.
NUM.27.8	And thou shalt speak unto the sons of Israel, saying, If a man dies and has no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter.
NUM.27.9	And if he has no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren.
NUM.27.10	And if he has no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father’s brethren.
NUM.27.11	And if his father has no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his lineage, and he shall inherit it; and it shall be unto the sons of Israel a law of rights, as the 
NUM.27.12	And the 
NUM.27.13	And after thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.
NUM.27.14	For ye were rebels to my word in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me in the waters before their eyes. These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
NUM.27.15	Then Moses spoke unto the

NUM.27.20	And thou shalt put some of thy splendour upon him that all the congregation of the sons of Israel may hear him.
NUM.27.21	And he shall stand before Eleazar, the priest, whom he shall consult in the judgment of the Urim before the

NUM.27.23	and he laid his hands upon him and gave him a charge, as the 
NUM.28.1	And the 
NUM.28.2	Command the sons of Israel and say unto them, My offering, my bread with my offerings on fire, for an acceptable savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.
NUM.28.3	And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering on fire which ye shall offer unto the 
NUM.28.4	The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer between the two evenings,
NUM.28.5	and a tenth part of an ephah of flour, mingled with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil as a present.

NUM.30.1	And Moses spoke unto the princes of the tribes concerning the sons of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the 
NUM.30.2	When a man vows a vow unto the 
NUM.30.3	But the woman, when she shall vow a vow unto the 
NUM.30.4	and her father hears her vow and her bond with which she has bound her soul, and her father shall remain silent regarding it, then all her promises shall stand, and every bond with which she has bound her soul shall stand.
NUM.30.5	But if her father disallows her in the day that he hears all of her vows and of her bonds with which she has bound her soul, they shall not stand, and the 
NUM.30.6	But if she had at all a husband when she vowed or pronounced anything out of her lips, with which she bound her soul,
NUM.30.7	if her husband heard it and remained silent regarding it in the day that he heard it, then her vows shall stand, and her bonds with which she bound her soul shall stand.
NUM.30.8	But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it, then her vow which she vowed and that which she pronounced with her lips, with which she bound her soul, shall be of no effect, and the 
NUM.30.9	But every vow of a widow and of her that is divorced, with which they have bound their souls, shall stand.
NUM.30.10	And if she vowed in her husband’s house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
NUM.30.11	if her husband heard it and remained silent regarding it and did not disallow her, then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.
NUM.30.12	But if her husband has utterly made them void on the day he heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand; her husband has made them void, and the 
NUM.30.13	Every vow and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
NUM.30.14	But if her husband remained silent regarding this from day to day; then he establishes all her vows or all her bonds, which are upon her; he confirms them because he remained silent regarding this in the day that he heard them.
NUM.30.15	But if he shall in any way make them void after that he has heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.
NUM.30.16	These are the statutes which the 
NUM.31.1	And the 
NUM.31.2	Avenge the sons of Israel upon the Midianites; afterward thou shalt be gathered unto thy peoples.
NUM.31.3	And Moses spoke unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto the war and let them go against the Midianites and carry out the vengeance of the 
NUM.31.4	A thousand out of every tribe throughout all the tribes of Israel shall ye send to the war.
NUM.31.5	So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.
NUM.31.6	And Moses sent them to the war; he sent a thousand of every tribe; and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, went to the war with the holy instruments, with the trumpets to blow in his hand.
NUM.31.7	And they fought against the Midianites as the 
NUM.31.8	And they also slew the kings of Midian among the rest of those that were slain: namely, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, five kings of Midian; they also slew Balaam, the son of Beor, with the sword.
NUM.31.9	And the sons of Israel took all the women of Midian captives and their little ones and took the spoil of all their beasts and all their flocks and all their goods.
NUM.31.10	And they burnt all their cities in which they dwelt and all their palaces with fire.
NUM.31.11	And they took all the spoil and all the prey, both of men and of beasts.
NUM.31.12	And they brought the captives and the prey and the spoil unto Moses and Eleazar, the priest, and unto the congregation of the sons of Israel, unto the camp in the plains of Moab, which was by Jordan of Jericho.
NUM.31.13	And Moses and Eleazar, the priest, and all the princes of the congregation went forth to meet them outside the camp.
NUM.31.14	And Moses was angry with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands and captains over hundreds who returned from the battle.
NUM.31.15	And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?
NUM.31.16	Behold, these caused the sons of Israel through the counsel of Balaam to commit trespass against the 
NUM.31.17	Now therefore kill every male among the little ones and kill every woman that has known a man by lying with him.
NUM.31.18	But all the female children that have not known a man by lying with him keep alive for yourselves.
NUM.31.19	And ye must abide outside the camp seven days; and whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any dead body ye shall remove the sin from them on the third and on the seventh day, both of yourselves and of your captives.
NUM.31.20	Likewise remove all sin from all your clothing and all that is made of skins and all work of goats’ hair and every vessel made of wood.
NUM.31.21	And Eleazar, the priest, said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the 
NUM.31.22	certainly the gold and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
NUM.31.23	every thing that may endure the fire, ye shall cause to pass through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless, ye shall remove the sin with the water of separation; and all that does not endure the fire ye shall cause to go through the water.
NUM.31.24	Ye shall also wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterwards ye shall come into the camp.
NUM.31.25	And the 
NUM.31.26	Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou and Eleazar, the priest, and the heads of the fathers of the congregation,
NUM.31.27	and divide the prey into two parts between those that took the part in the war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.
NUM.31.28	And offer a tribute unto the 
NUM.31.29	Take it from their half and give Eleazar, the priest, the offering of the 
NUM.31.30	And of the half belonging to the sons of Israel, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of animals and give them unto the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.31.31	And Moses and Eleazar, the priest, did as the 
NUM.31.32	And the prey, that is the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep
NUM.31.33	and seventy-two thousand oxen
NUM.31.34	and sixty-one thousand asses
NUM.31.35	and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known a man by lying with him.
NUM.31.36	And the half which was the portion of those that went out to war was in number three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep.
NUM.31.37	And the tribute for the 
NUM.31.38	And the oxen were thirty-six thousand, of which the tribute for the 
NUM.31.39	And the asses were thirty thousand five hundred, of which the tribute for the 
NUM.31.40	And the persons were sixteen thousand, of which the tribute for the 
NUM.31.41	And Moses gave the tribute, which was the 
NUM.31.42	And of the half pertaining to the sons of Israel, which Moses divided from the men that had gone to war,
NUM.31.43	(now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand five hundred sheep
NUM.31.44	and thirty-six thousand oxen
NUM.31.45	and thirty thousand five hundred asses
NUM.31.46	and sixteen thousand persons)
NUM.31.47	of the half, therefore of the sons of Israel, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, who kept the charge of the tabernacle of the 
NUM.31.48	And the officers who were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses,
NUM.31.49	and they said unto Moses, Thy slaves have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our charge and not one man of us is missing.
NUM.31.50	We have therefore brought an offering for the 
NUM.31.51	And Moses and Eleazar, the priest, took the gold from them, all wrought vessels.
NUM.31.52	And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the 
NUM.31.53	(For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)
NUM.31.54	And Moses and Eleazar, the priest, took the gold from the captains of thousands and of hundreds and brought it into the tabernacle of the testimony, for a memorial of the sons of Israel before the 
NUM.32.1	Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very great multitude of livestock, and when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, it seemed unto them that the place was a place for livestock.
NUM.32.2	And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke unto Moses and to Eleazar, the priest, and unto the princes of the congregation, saying,
NUM.32.3	Ataroth and Dibon and Jazer and Nimrah and Heshbon and Elealeh and Shebam and Nebo and Beon,
NUM.32.4	the country which the 
NUM.32.5	Therefore, they said, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto thy slaves for a possession and do not make us pass the Jordan.
NUM.32.6	And Moses said unto the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?
NUM.32.7	Why do ye discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from going over into the land which the 
NUM.32.8	Thus did your fathers when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.
NUM.32.9	For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the sons of Israel that they should not go into the land which the 
NUM.32.10	And the 
NUM.32.11	Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they were not perfect in following me,
NUM.32.12	except Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua, the son of Nun, for they were perfect in following the 
NUM.32.13	And the 
NUM.32.14	And, behold, ye are risen up in the place of your fathers, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the 
NUM.32.15	For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave you in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.
NUM.32.16	Then they came near unto him and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock and cities for our little ones,
NUM.32.17	but we ourselves will go arm ourselves and go with diligence before the sons of Israel until we have brought them unto their place, and our little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
NUM.32.18	We will not return unto our houses until the sons of Israel have inherited each man his inheritance.
NUM.32.19	For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan or forward because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of Jordan eastward.
NUM.32.20	Then Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will prepare yourselves to go before the 
NUM.32.21	and will all pass the Jordan armed before the 
NUM.32.22	and the land is subdued before the 
NUM.32.23	But if ye will not do so, behold, ye shall have sinned against the 
NUM.32.24	Build cities for your little ones and folds for your sheep and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.
NUM.32.25	And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke unto Moses, saying, Thy slaves will do as my lord commands.
NUM.32.26	Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our beasts, shall be there in the cities of Gilead;
NUM.32.27	but thy slaves, each one armed for war, will pass before the 
NUM.32.28	So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar, the priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the princes of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
NUM.32.29	And Moses said unto them, If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will pass the Jordan with you, each one armed to battle, before the 
NUM.32.30	But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.
NUM.32.31	And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, As the 
NUM.32.32	We will pass over armed before the 
NUM.32.33	Thus Moses gave unto the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and unto half the tribe of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with its cities and borders, even the cities of the country round about.
NUM.32.34	And the sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer
NUM.32.35	and Atroth-shophan and Jaazer and Jogbehah
NUM.32.36	and Bethnimrah and Bethharan, fenced cities, and also folds for sheep.
NUM.32.37	And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kirjathaim
NUM.32.38	and Nebo and Baalmeon (their names being changed) and Shibmah and gave other names unto the cities which they built.
NUM.32.39	And the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, went to Gilead and took it and dispossessed the Amorite who was in it.
NUM.32.40	And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir, the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt therein.
NUM.32.41	Jair, the son of Manasseh also went and took the small towns thereof and called them Havothjair.
NUM.32.42	Likewise Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages and called it Nobah, after his own name.
NUM.33.1	These are the journeys of the sons of Israel who went forth out of the land of Egypt with their hosts under the hand of Moses and Aaron.
NUM.33.2	And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the 
NUM.33.3	And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the second day of the passover the sons of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.
NUM.33.4	For the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn, which the 
NUM.33.5	And the sons of Israel removed from Rameses and pitched in Succoth.
NUM.33.6	And they departed from Succoth and pitched in Etham, which is in the edge of the wilderness.
NUM.33.7	And they removed from Etham and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which is before Baalzephon, and they pitched before Migdol.
NUM.33.8	And they departed from before Pihahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness and went three days’ journey in the wilderness of Etham and pitched in Marah.
NUM.33.9	And they removed from Marah and came unto Elim, and in Elim were twelve fountains of water and seventy palm trees, and they pitched there.

NUM.33.25	And they removed from Haradah and pitched in Makheloth.
NUM.33.26	And they removed from Makheloth and encamped at Tahath.
NUM.33.27	And they departed from Tahath and pitched at Tarah.
NUM.33.28	And they removed from Tarah and pitched in Mithcah.

NUM.33.30	And they departed from Hashmonah and encamped at Moseroth.
NUM.33.31	And they departed from Moseroth and pitched in Benejaakan.
NUM.33.32	And they removed from Benejaakan and encamped at Horhagidgad.
NUM.33.33	And they went from Horhagidgad and pitched in Jotbathah.
NUM.33.34	And they removed from Jotbathah and encamped at Ebronah.
NUM.33.35	And they departed from Ebronah and encamped at Eziongaber.
NUM.33.36	And they removed from Eziongaber and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.
NUM.33.37	And they removed from Kadesh and pitched in Mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.
NUM.33.38	And Aaron, the priest, went up into Mount Hor at the commandment of the 
NUM.33.39	And Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died in Mount Hor.
NUM.33.40	And King Arad, the Canaanite, who dwelt in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard how the sons of Israel had come.
NUM.33.41	And they departed from Mount Hor and pitched in Zalmonah.
NUM.33.42	And they departed from Zalmonah and pitched in Punon.
NUM.33.43	And they departed from Punon and pitched in Oboth.
NUM.33.44	And they departed from Oboth and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the border of Moab.

NUM.33.48	And they departed from the mountains of Abarim and pitched in the plains of Moab by Jordan of Jericho.
NUM.33.49	Finally they pitched by the Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.
NUM.33.50	And the 
NUM.33.51	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When ye have passed the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
NUM.33.52	then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you and abolish all their paintings and abolish all their molten images and destroy all their high places,
NUM.33.53	and ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell therein; for I have given you the land to inherit it.
NUM.33.54	And ye shall inherit the land by lots by your families, and to those with the most ye shall give more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give less inheritance, each one’s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falls; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.
NUM.33.55	But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall come to pass that those whom ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes and thorns in your sides and shall afflict you in the land in which ye dwell.
NUM.33.56	Moreover it shall come to pass that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.
NUM.34.1	And the 
NUM.34.2	Command the sons of Israel and say unto them, When ye have entered into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to its borders),
NUM.34.3	you shall have on the side of the Negev from the wilderness of Zin unto the borders of Edom, and your border towards the Negev shall be the outmost coast of the salt sea eastward.
NUM.34.4	And this border shall turn from the Negev to the ascent of Akrabbim and pass on to Zin, and the going forth thereof shall be from the Negev to Kadeshbarnea and shall go on to Hazaraddar and pass on to Azmon;
NUM.34.5	and the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the western sea.
NUM.34.6	And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great sea for a border; this shall be your west border.
NUM.34.7	And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall point out for you Mount Hor.
NUM.34.8	From Mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of Hamath, and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad,
NUM.34.9	and the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it shall be at Hazarenan; this shall be your north border.
NUM.34.10	And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to Shepham,
NUM.34.11	and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain, and the border shall descend and shall reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward.
NUM.34.12	And the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings out of it shall be at the salt sea; this shall be your land with the borders thereof round about.
NUM.34.13	And Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the 
NUM.34.14	because the tribe of the sons of Reuben, according to the houses of their fathers, and the tribe of the sons of Gad, according to the houses of their fathers, and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance.
NUM.34.15	The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side of the Jordan of Jericho eastward, toward the sunrising.
NUM.34.16	And the 
NUM.34.17	These are the names of the men who shall divide the possession of the land for you: Eleazar, the priest, and Joshua, the son of Nun.
NUM.34.18	And ye shall take one prince of every tribe to divide the possession of the land.
NUM.34.19	And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb, the son of Jephunneh.
NUM.34.20	And of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel, the son of Ammihud.
NUM.34.21	Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad, the son of Chislon.
NUM.34.22	And the of the tribe of the sons of Dan, the prince Bukki, the son of Jogli.
NUM.34.23	Of the sons of Joseph: of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh, the prince Hanniel, the son of Ephod.
NUM.34.24	And of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim, the prince Kemuel, the son of Shiphtan.
NUM.34.25	And of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun, the prince Elizaphan, the son of Parnach.
NUM.34.26	And of the tribe of the sons of Issachar, the prince Paltiel, the son of Azzan.
NUM.34.27	And of the tribe of the sons of Asher, the prince Ahihud, the son of Shelomi.
NUM.34.28	And of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali, the prince Pedahel, the son of Ammihud.
NUM.34.29	These are those whom the 
NUM.35.1	And the 
NUM.35.2	Command the sons of Israel that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in, and ye shall give also unto the Levites the suburbs of those cities round about them.
NUM.35.3	And they shall have the cities to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their animals and for their substance and for all their beasts.
NUM.35.4	And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits round about.
NUM.35.5	Then ye shall measure from outside the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the side of the Negev two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.
NUM.35.6	And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites, there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint so that the manslayer may flee there; and in addition to them ye shall give them forty-two cities.
NUM.35.7	So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty-eight cities, the cities with their suburbs.
NUM.35.8	And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the sons of Israel; from those that have much ye shall give many; but from those that have few ye shall give few, each one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according to his possession which he inherited.
NUM.35.9	And the 
NUM.35.10	Speak unto the sons of Israel and say unto them, When ye have passed the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
NUM.35.11	then ye shall appoint yourselves cities to be cities of refuge for you that the manslayer who kills any person unawares may flee there.
NUM.35.12	And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger {Heb. redeemer} that the manslayer not die until he stands before the congregation in judgment.
NUM.35.13	And of these cities which ye shall give, six cities shall ye have for refuge.
NUM.35.14	Ye shall give three cities on this side of the Jordan and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge.
NUM.35.15	These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the sons of Israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them that anyone that kills another person unawares may flee there.
NUM.35.16	And if he smites him with an instrument of iron so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
NUM.35.17	And if he smites him by throwing a stone with which he may die, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
NUM.35.18	Or if he smites him with a hand weapon of wood with which he may die, and he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall surely be put to death.
NUM.35.19	The kinsman avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood shall slay the murderer; when he meets him, he shall slay him.
NUM.35.20	But if he thrusts him out of hatred or hurls at him by laying in wait, so that he dies
NUM.35.21	or out of enmity smites him with his hand so that he dies, he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer; the kinsman avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood shall slay the murderer when he meets him.
NUM.35.22	But if he thrusts him suddenly without enmity, or has cast upon him any thing without laying in wait,
NUM.35.23	or with any stone, with which a man may die, seeing him not and casts it upon him that he dies, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm,
NUM.35.24	then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the kinsman avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood according to these laws.
NUM.35.25	And the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of the hand of the kinsman avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, where he has fled, and he shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil.
NUM.35.26	But if the manslayer shall at any time come outside the border of the city of his refuge where he has fled,
NUM.35.27	and the kinsman avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood finds him outside the borders of the city of his refuge, and the kinsman avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood slays the manslayer, he shall not be guilty of his blood.
NUM.35.28	He should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest, but after the death of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land of his possession.
NUM.35.29	So these things shall be for a statute of rights unto you throughout your ages in all your dwellings.
NUM.35.30	Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses, but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die.
NUM.35.31	Moreover ye shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer who is guilty of death, but he shall be surely put to death.
NUM.35.32	And ye shall take no ransom for him that is fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest.
NUM.35.33	So ye shall not pollute the land where ye are, for this blood shall defile the land; and the land cannot be reconciled of the blood that is shed therein except by the blood of the one that shed it.
NUM.35.34	Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit in the midst of which I dwell; for I the 
NUM.36.1	And the princes of the fathers of the families of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before Moses and before the princes, the heads of the fathers of the sons of Israel,
NUM.36.2	and they said, The 
NUM.36.3	And if they become married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the sons of Israel, then their inheritance shall be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and shall be put to the inheritance of the tribe unto which they are received; so shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.
NUM.36.4	And when the jubilee of the sons of Israel shall come, then shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe unto which they are received; so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.
NUM.36.5	Then Moses commanded the sons of Israel according to the word of the 
NUM.36.6	This is the thing which the 
NUM.36.7	so that the inheritance of the sons of Israel shall not be passed from tribe to tribe; for each one of the sons of Israel shall cleave to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.
NUM.36.8	And any daughter, that possesses an inheritance in any tribe of the sons of Israel, shall marry one of the family of the tribe of her father so that each man of the sons of Israel may possess the inheritance of his fathers.
NUM.36.9	So that the inheritance shall not change from one tribe to another tribe, each one of the tribes of the sons of Israel shall cleave to his own inheritance.
NUM.36.10	As the 
NUM.36.11	And thus Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, married the sons of their uncles.
NUM.36.12	They were women of the family of the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.
NUM.36.13	These are the commandments and the rights which the 
DEU.1.1	These are the words which Moses spoke unto all Israel on this side of the Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
DEU.1.2	(There are eleven days’ journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)
DEU.1.3	And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel, according unto all that the 
DEU.1.4	after he had slain Sihon, the king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, who dwelt at Astaroth in Edrei;
DEU.1.5	on this side of the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses resolved to declare this law, saying,
DEU.1.6	The 
DEU.1.7	turn and take your journey and go to the mount of the Amorite and unto all the places nearby, in the plain, in the hills, and in the valleys and to the Negev and by the sea side to the land of the Canaanite and unto Lebanon unto the great river, the river Euphrates.
DEU.1.8	Behold, I have given the land in your presence; go in and possess the land which the 
DEU.1.9	And I spoke unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone;
DEU.1.10	the 
DEU.1.11	Let the 
DEU.1.12	How can I myself alone bear your troubles and your burdens and your strife?
DEU.1.13	Give me from among you, of your tribes, wise and understanding and expert men, and I will make them the head over you.
DEU.1.14	And ye answered me and said, The thing which thou hast spoken is good for us to do.
DEU.1.15	So I took the principals of your tribes, wise men and experts, and made them princes over you, princes over thousands and princes over hundreds and princes over fifties and princes over tens and officers among your tribes.
DEU.1.16	And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brethren and judge righteously between every man and his brother and the stranger that is with him.
DEU.1.17	Ye shall not respect persons in judgment, but ye shall hear the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God’s; and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.
DEU.1.18	And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.
DEU.1.19	And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as the 
DEU.1.20	Then I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorite, which the 
DEU.1.21	Behold, the 
DEU.1.22	And ye came near unto me every one of you and said, We will send men before us, and they shall spy us out the land and bring us word again by what way we must go up and into what cities we shall come.
DEU.1.23	And the saying seemed good unto me, and I took twelve men of you, one of each tribe.
DEU.1.24	And they turned and went up into the mountain and came unto the valley of Eshcol and spied out the land.
DEU.1.25	And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down unto us and brought us word again and said, It is a good land which the 
DEU.1.26	Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the commandment of the 
DEU.1.27	and ye murmured in your tents and said, Because the 
DEU.1.28	Where shall we go up? Our brethren have discouraged our heart, saying, This people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakims there.
DEU.1.29	Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.
DEU.1.30	The 
DEU.1.31	and in the wilderness thou hast seen how that the 
DEU.1.32	Yet with all this ye did not believe in the 
DEU.1.33	who went in the way before you to search you out a place to pitch your tents, with fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go, and with a cloud by day.
DEU.1.34	And the 
DEU.1.35	Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see that good land, which I swore to give unto your fathers,
DEU.1.36	except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him will I give the land that he has trodden upon, and to his sons, because he has perfectly followed the 
DEU.1.37	Also the 
DEU.1.38	But Joshua, the son of Nun, who stands before thee, he shall go in there; encourage him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
DEU.1.39	Moreover your little ones, whom ye said should be a prey and your children who in that day had no knowledge between good and evil, they shall go in there, and unto them will I give it, and they shall inherit it.
DEU.1.40	But as for you, return and take your journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea.
DEU.1.41	Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the 
DEU.1.42	And the 
DEU.1.43	So I spoke unto you, and ye would not hear but were rebels against the word of the 
DEU.1.44	And the Amorite, who dwelt in that mountain, came out against you and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah.
DEU.1.45	And ye returned and wept before the 
DEU.1.46	So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye abode there.
DEU.2.1	Then we turned and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the 
DEU.2.2	until the 
DEU.2.3	Ye have gone around this mountain long enough; return unto the Aquilon.
DEU.2.4	And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the border of your brethren, the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you; take care unto yourselves, therefore;
DEU.2.5	do not seek a fight with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as a foot breadth because I have given Mount Seir unto Esau for an inheritance.
DEU.2.6	Ye shall buy food from them for money that ye may eat, and ye shall also buy water from them for money that ye may drink.
DEU.2.7	For the 
DEU.2.8	And when we passed by our brethren, the sons of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.
DEU.2.9	And the 
DEU.2.10	(The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many and tall as the Anakims,
DEU.2.11	which also were accounted giants as the Anakims; but the Moabites call them Emims.
DEU.2.12	The Horims also dwelt in Seir before time, but the sons of Esau inherited from them, and they destroyed them from before them and dwelt in their stead as Israel did in the land of his possession, which the 
DEU.2.13	Now rise up, said I, and pass the brook Zered. And we went over the brook Zered.
DEU.2.14	And the days in which we came from Kadeshbarnea until we were come over the brook Zered, was thirty-eight years until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the camp, as the 
DEU.2.15	For indeed the hand of the 
DEU.2.16	So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people
DEU.2.17	that the 
DEU.2.18	Thou art to pass the border of Moab today unto Ar,
DEU.2.19	and when thou comest near over against the sons of Ammon, do not distress them nor meddle with them, for I will not give thee of the land of the sons of Ammon any possession because I have given it unto the sons of Lot for an inheritance.
DEU.2.20	(That also was accounted a land of giants; giants dwelt therein in another time, and the Ammonites called them Zamzummims,
DEU.2.21	a people great and many and tall as the Anakims; whom the 
DEU.2.22	as he did to the sons of Esau who dwelt in Seir when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they inherited from them and dwelt in their stead even unto this day.
DEU.2.23	And the Avims who dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Gaza, the Caphtorims, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them and dwelt in their stead.)
DEU.2.24	Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass the river Arnon; behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and his land; begin, take possession and contend with him in battle.
DEU.2.25	This day I will begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of thee upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of thee, and shall tremble and be in anguish because of thee.
DEU.2.26	And I sent ambassadors out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,
DEU.2.27	Let me pass through thy land; I will go along by the high way; I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.
DEU.2.28	Thou shalt sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; I will only pass through on my feet
DEU.2.29	(as the sons of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, who dwell in Ar, did unto me) until I shall pass the Jordan into the land which the 
DEU.2.30	But Sihon, king of Heshbon, would not let us pass by him, for the 
DEU.2.31	And the 
DEU.2.32	Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz.
DEU.2.33	But the 
DEU.2.34	And we took all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed all the cities, the men and the women and the little ones; we left none to remain.
DEU.2.35	We took only the beasts for a prey unto ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we took.
DEU.2.36	From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from the city that is by the river even unto Gilead, there was not one city escaped us; the 
DEU.2.37	Only unto the land of the sons of Ammon thou camest not, nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the mountains, nor unto any place that the 
DEU.3.1	Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.
DEU.3.2	And the 
DEU.3.3	So the 
DEU.3.4	And we took all his cities at that time there was not a city which we did not take from them, sixty cities, all the region of Argob, of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
DEU.3.5	All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars besides a great many unwalled towns.
DEU.3.6	And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon, king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city, men, women, and children.
DEU.3.7	But all the beasts and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.
DEU.3.8	And we also took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites the land that was on this side of the Jordan, from the river of Arnon unto Mount Hermon
DEU.3.9	(which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion and the Amorites call it Shenir) and
DEU.3.10	all the cities of the plain and all Gilead and all Bashan unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.
DEU.3.11	For only Og, king of Bashan, had remained of the remnant of giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? Nine cubits was the length thereof and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.
DEU.3.12	And this land, which we inherited at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half of Mount Gilead and the cities thereof, I gave unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.
DEU.3.13	And the rest of Gilead and all Bashan (fertile ground), being the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh: all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.
DEU.3.14	Jair, the son of Manasseh, took all the country of Argob unto the border of Geshuri and Maachathi and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.
DEU.3.15	And I gave Gilead unto Machir.
DEU.3.16	And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from Gilead even unto the river Arnon, half the valley for a border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the sons of Ammon,
DEU.3.17	the plain also and the Jordan and the border thereof from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.
DEU.3.18	And I commanded you at that time, saying, The 
DEU.3.19	Only your wives and your little ones and your livestock (for I know that ye have much livestock) shall abide in your cities which I have given you
DEU.3.20	until the 
DEU.3.21	And I also commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the 
DEU.3.22	Ye shall not fear them, for the 
DEU.3.23	And I besought the 
DEU.3.24	O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to show thy slave thy greatness and thy mighty hand; for what God is there in heaven or in earth that can do according to thy works and according to thy mighty acts?
DEU.3.25	I pray thee, let me go over and see that good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain and Lebanon.
DEU.3.26	But the 
DEU.3.27	Climb up into the top of Pisgah and lift up thine eyes westward and towards the Aquilon and towards the Negev and eastward and behold it with thine eyes, for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
DEU.3.28	But charge Joshua and encourage him and comfort him, for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.
DEU.3.29	So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.
DEU.4.1	Now, therefore, hear, O Israel, the statutes and the rights which I teach you, for in doing them ye shall live and go in and inherit the land which the 
DEU.4.2	Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish anything from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the 
DEU.4.3	Your eyes have seen what the 
DEU.4.4	But ye that did cleave unto the 
DEU.4.5	Behold, I have taught you statutes and rights, even as the 
DEU.4.6	Keep them, therefore, and do them, for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes and say, Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.
DEU.4.7	For what nation is there so great who has God so nigh unto them, as the 
DEU.4.8	And what nation is there so great that has statutes and rights so just as all this law, which I set before you this day?
DEU.4.9	Therefore, take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life, but teach them to thy sons and thy sons’ sons.
DEU.4.10	The day that thou didst stand before the 
DEU.4.11	And ye came near and stood under the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of the heavens, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.
DEU.4.12	And the 
DEU.4.13	And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, the ten words; and he wrote them upon two tables of stone.
DEU.4.14	And the 
DEU.4.15	Diligently guard, therefore, your souls, for ye saw no manner of likeness on the day that the 
DEU.4.16	lest ye corrupt yourselves and make yourselves a graven image, the similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,
DEU.4.17	the likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air,
DEU.4.18	the likeness of any animal that moves on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth,
DEU.4.19	And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the host of heaven, and should be driven to worship them and serve them because the 
DEU.4.20	But the 
DEU.4.21	Furthermore, the 
DEU.4.22	Therefore, I must die in this land and will not pass the Jordan, but ye shall pass and inherit that good land.
DEU.4.23	Keep yourselves, do not forget the covenant of the 
DEU.4.24	For the 
DEU.4.25	When thou shalt beget children and grandchildren and ye shall have remained long in the land and shall corrupt yourselves and make a graven image or the likeness of any thing and shall do evil in the sight of the 
DEU.4.26	I put heaven and earth as witnesses today that ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land unto which ye pass the Jordan to inherit it; ye shall not prolong your days upon it without being utterly destroyed.
DEU.4.27	And the 
DEU.4.28	And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men’s hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.
DEU.4.29	But if from there, thou shalt seek the 
DEU.4.30	When thou art in trouble and all these things are come upon thee, if in the latter days thou shalt turn to the 
DEU.4.31	(for the 
DEU.4.32	Ask, therefore, now of the days that are past, which were before thee, since the day that God created man upon the earth and ask from the one side of heaven unto the other whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has any other been heard like it?
DEU.4.33	Have a people ever heard the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and lived?
DEU.4.34	Or has God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst of another nation, by trials, by signs and by wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by a stretched out arm and by great terrors, according to all that the 
DEU.4.35	Unto thee it was shown that thou mightest know that the 
DEU.4.36	Out of the heavens he made thee to hear his voice that he might instruct thee, and upon earth he showed thee his great fire, and thou hast heard his words out of the midst of the fire.
DEU.4.37	And because he loved thy fathers, therefore, he chose their seed after them and brought thee out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt,
DEU.4.38	to drive out Gentiles from before thee greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day.
DEU.4.39	Know therefore this day and consider it in thine heart that the 
DEU.4.40	Thou shalt keep, therefore, his statutes and his commandments which I command thee this day that it may go well with thee and with thy sons after thee and that thou may prolong thy days upon the land which the 
DEU.4.41	Then Moses separated three cities on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrising
DEU.4.42	that the manslayer might flee there, who should kill his neighbour unawares and hated him not in times past and that fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:
DEU.4.43	Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan, of the Manassites.
DEU.4.44	And this is the law which Moses set before the sons of Israel.
DEU.4.45	These are the testimonies and the statutes and the rights, which Moses spoke unto the sons of Israel after they came forth out of Egypt,
DEU.4.46	on this side of the Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel smote after they were come forth out of Egypt;
DEU.4.47	and they possessed his land and the land of Og, king of Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, who were on this side of the Jordan toward the sunrising.
DEU.4.48	From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto Mount Sion, which is Hermon,
DEU.4.49	and all the plain on this side of the Jordan eastward, even unto the sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	And Moses called all Israel and said unto them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and rights which I speak in your ears this day, that ye may learn them and keep them, to do them.
DEU.5.2	The 
DEU.5.3	Not with our fathers did the 
DEU.5.4	The 
DEU.5.5	(I stood between the 
DEU.5.6	I AM thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt from the house of slavery.
DEU.5.7	Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
DEU.5.8	Thou shalt not make thee any graven image or any likeness of any thing that is in the heavens above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the waters beneath the earth.
DEU.5.9	Thou shalt not bow down to them nor serve them, for I the 
DEU.5.10	and showing mercy unto thousands, to those that love me and keep my commandments.
DEU.5.11	Thou shalt not take the name of the 
DEU.5.12	Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the 
DEU.5.13	Six days thou shalt labour and do all thy work,
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is the sabbath unto the 
DEU.5.15	And remember that thou wast a slave in the land of Egypt and that the 
DEU.5.16	Honour thy father and thy mother, as the 
DEU.5.17	Thou shalt not murder.
DEU.5.18	Thou shalt not commit adultery.
DEU.5.19	Thou shalt not steal.
DEU.5.20	Thou shalt not give false testimony against thy neighbour.
DEU.5.21	Thou shalt not desire thy neighbour’s wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour’s house, his field or his manslave or his maidslave, his ox or his ass or any thing that is thy neighbour’s.
DEU.5.22	These words the 
DEU.5.23	And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness and saw the mountain that burned with fire that ye came near unto me, even all the princes of your tribes and your elders;
DEU.5.24	and ye said, Behold, the 
DEU.5.25	Now, therefore, why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the 
DEU.5.26	For what is all flesh that it should hear the voice of the living God that speaks out of the midst of the fire, as we heard, and live?
DEU.5.27	Go thou near and hear all that the 
DEU.5.28	And the 
DEU.5.29	O that there were such a heart in them that they would fear me and keep all my commandments always that it might be well with them and with their children for ever!
DEU.5.30	Go say to them, Return to your tents.
DEU.5.31	But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments and the statutes and the rights, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to inherit.
DEU.5.32	Ye shall observe to do, therefore, as the 
DEU.5.33	Ye shall walk in all the ways which the 
DEU.6.1	Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the rights, which the 
DEU.6.2	that thou might fear the 
DEU.6.3	Hear, therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it that it may be well with thee and that ye may be multiplied exceedingly (as the 
DEU.6.4	Hear, O Israel: The 
DEU.6.5	And thou shalt love the 
DEU.6.6	And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thy heart,
DEU.6.7	and thou shalt repeat them diligently unto thy sons and shalt talk of them being in thy house and walking by the way, lying down in bed, and rising up;
DEU.6.8	and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thy eyes;
DEU.6.9	and thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house and on thy gates.
DEU.6.10	And it shall be, when the 
DEU.6.11	and houses full of all good things, which thou didst not fill, and hewn out wells, which thou didst not dig, vineyards and olive trees, which thou didst not plant; when thou shalt have eaten and be full,
DEU.6.12	then beware lest thou forget the 
DEU.6.13	Thou shalt fear the 
DEU.6.14	Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are round about you
DEU.6.15	(for the 
DEU.6.16	Ye shall not tempt the 
DEU.6.17	Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the 
DEU.6.18	And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the 
DEU.6.19	so that he will cast out all thine enemies from before thy presence, as the 
DEU.6.20	And when tomorrow thy son asks thee, saying, What are the testimonies and the statutes and the rights, which the 
DEU.6.21	Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt, and the 
DEU.6.22	and the 
DEU.6.23	and he brought us out from there that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore unto our fathers.
DEU.6.24	And the 
DEU.6.25	And we shall have justice when we keep ourselves by doing all these commandments before the 
DEU.7.1	When the 
DEU.7.2	and when the 
DEU.7.3	Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
DEU.7.4	For they will turn away thy son from following me that they may serve other gods; and the anger of the 
DEU.7.5	But thus shall ye deal with them: ye shall destroy their altars and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images in the fire.
DEU.7.6	For thou art a holy people unto the 
DEU.7.7	Not because ye were more than the other peoples has the 
DEU.7.8	but because the 
DEU.7.9	Know, therefore, that the 
DEU.7.10	and repays him that hates him to his face, to destroy him; he will not be slack to him that hates him; he will repay him to his face.
DEU.7.11	Keep, therefore, the commandments and statutes and rights, which I command thee this day, to do them.
DEU.7.12	And it shall come to pass, for having heard these rights and for having kept them by doing them that the 
DEU.7.13	and he will love thee and bless thee and multiply thee; he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy land, thy grain and thy wine and thine oil, the increase of thy cows and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he swore unto thy fathers to give thee.
DEU.7.14	Thou shalt be blessed above all peoples; there shall not be male or female barren among you or among your beasts.
DEU.7.15	And the 
DEU.7.16	And thou shalt consume all the peoples which the 
DEU.7.17	When thou shalt say in thy heart, These Gentiles are more than I; how can I dispossess them?
DEU.7.18	Do not be afraid of them; remember well what the 
DEU.7.19	of the great trials which thine eyes saw and the signs and the wonders and the mighty hand and the outstretched arm, by which the 
DEU.7.20	Moreover the 
DEU.7.21	Thou shalt not faint before them; for the 
DEU.7.22	And the 
DEU.7.23	But the 
DEU.7.24	And he shall deliver their kings into thy hand, and thou shalt destroy their name from under heaven; no one shall be able to stand before thee until thou hast destroyed them.
DEU.7.25	The graven images of their gods ye shall burn in the fire; thou shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them nor take it unto thee lest thou be snared therein; for it is an abomination to the 
DEU.7.26	Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house lest thou become an anathema like it, but thou shalt utterly detest it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is anathema.
DEU.8.1	Take care to do all the commandments which I command thee this day that ye may live and be multiplied and enter in and inherit the land which the 
DEU.8.2	And thou shalt remember all the way by which the 
DEU.8.3	And he afflicted thee and caused thee to hunger and sustained thee with manna, food of which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know, that he might make thee know that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the 
DEU.8.4	Thy raiment never waxed old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell, these forty years.
DEU.8.5	And know in thine heart, that as a man chastens his son, so the 
DEU.8.6	Keep, therefore, the commandments of the 
DEU.8.7	For the 
DEU.8.8	a land of wheat and barley and vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olives, of oil, and honey;
DEU.8.9	a land in which thou shalt eat bread without scarceness; thou shalt not lack any thing in it, a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose mountains thou may dig brass.
DEU.8.10	Thou shalt eat and be full and bless the 
DEU.8.11	Keep thyself, that thou forget not the 
DEU.8.12	lest peradventure when thou hast eaten and art full and hast built goodly houses and dwelt therein,
DEU.8.13	and when thy herds and thy flocks multiply and thy silver and thy gold is multiplied and all that thou hast is multiplied,
DEU.8.14	then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the 
DEU.8.15	who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness of burning serpents and scorpions and drought, where there was no water, who brought thee forth water out of the rock of flint,
DEU.8.16	who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, a food which thy fathers knew not, afflicting thee and proving thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;
DEU.8.17	and thou say in thy heart, My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth.
DEU.8.18	But thou shalt remember the 
DEU.8.19	And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the 
DEU.8.20	As the Gentiles which the 
DEU.9.1	Hear, O Israel: Thou art ready to pass over the Jordan this day to enter in to inherit that of Gentiles greater and mightier than thyself, cities great and fenced up to heaven,
DEU.9.2	A people, great and tall, sons of the Anakims, whom thou knowest and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak!
DEU.9.3	Understand, therefore, this day that the 
DEU.9.4	Think not in thine heart, after the 
DEU.9.5	Not for thy righteousness or for the uprightness of thine heart, dost thou enter in to inherit their land; but for the wickedness of these Gentiles, the 
DEU.9.6	Understand, therefore, that the 
DEU.9.7	Remember, and forget not, how thou hast provoked the 
DEU.9.8	Also in Horeb ye provoked the 
DEU.9.9	When I climbed up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which the 
DEU.9.10	and the 
DEU.9.11	And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights that the 
DEU.9.12	And the 
DEU.9.13	Furthermore, the 
DEU.9.14	Let me alone that I may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven; and I will make of thee a nation mightier and greater than they.
DEU.9.15	So I turned and came down from the mount with the two tables of the covenant in my two hands and the mount burned with fire,
DEU.9.16	and I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the 
DEU.9.17	Then I took the two tables and cast them out of my two hands and broke them before your eyes.
DEU.9.18	And I fell down before the 
DEU.9.19	For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure with which the 
DEU.9.20	And the 
DEU.9.21	And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it with fire and stamped it and ground it very small even until it was as small as dust, and I cast the dust thereof into the brook that descended out of the mount.
DEU.9.22	Also at Taberah and at Massah and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye provoked the 
DEU.9.23	Likewise when the 
DEU.9.24	Ye have been rebels against the 
DEU.9.25	Thus I fell down before the 
DEU.9.26	I prayed, therefore, unto the 
DEU.9.27	Remember thy slaves, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not unto the stubbornness of this people nor to their wickedness nor to their sin,
DEU.9.28	lest those of the land from which thou didst bring us out say, Because the 
DEU.9.29	Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou didst bring out by thy mighty power and by thy outstretched arm.
DEU.10.1	At that time the 
DEU.10.2	and I will write on the tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst brake, and thou shalt put them in the ark.
DEU.10.3	And I made an ark of cedar wood and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.
DEU.10.4	And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten words which the 
DEU.10.5	And I turned and came down from the mount and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are, as the 
DEU.10.6	(After this, the sons of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the sons of Jaakan to Mosera; there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar, his son, received the priesthood in his stead.
DEU.10.7	From there they journeyed unto Gudgodah and from Gudgodah to Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.
DEU.10.8	At that time the 
DEU.10.9	Therefore, Levi had no part nor inheritance with his brethren; the 
DEU.10.10	And I stayed in the mount, like the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the 
DEU.10.11	And the 
DEU.10.12	And now, Israel, what does the 
DEU.10.13	to keep the commandments of the 
DEU.10.14	Behold, the heavens and the heaven of heavens are of the 
DEU.10.15	The 
DEU.10.16	Circumcise, therefore, the foreskin of your heart, and no longer be stiffnecked.
DEU.10.17	For the 
DEU.10.18	he executes the rights of the fatherless and the widow and also loves the stranger, giving him food and clothing.
DEU.10.19	Ye shall love, therefore, the stranger, for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.
DEU.10.20	Thou shalt fear the 
DEU.10.21	He shall be thy praise, and he shall be thy God, that has done with thee these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.
DEU.10.22	Thy fathers went down into Egypt with seventy souls, and now the 
DEU.11.1	Therefore, thou shalt love the 
DEU.11.2	And know ye this day; for I speak not with your children who have not known and who have not seen the chastisement of the 
DEU.11.3	and his miracles and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt unto Pharaoh, the king of Egypt and unto all his land,
DEU.11.4	and what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses and to their chariots, how he made the water of the Red sea to overflow them as they pursued after you and how the 
DEU.11.5	and what he did with you in the wilderness until ye came into this place,
DEU.11.6	and what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up and their households and their tents and all the substance that was in their possession in the midst of all Israel;
DEU.11.7	but your eyes have seen all the great acts of the 
DEU.11.8	Keep, therefore, all the commandments which I command you this day that ye may be strong and enter in and inherit the land, into which ye go to inherit it
DEU.11.9	and that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the 
DEU.11.10	For the land, into which thou goest to inherit it, is not as the land of Egypt, from which ye came out, where thou didst sow thy seed and water it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs.
DEU.11.11	The land, into which ye go to inherit it, is a land of mountains and valleys and drinks water of the rain of heaven,
DEU.11.12	a land which the 
DEU.11.13	And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day: to love the 
DEU.11.14	that I will give you the rain of your land in its due season, the early rain and the latter rain, and thou shalt gather in thy grain and thy wine and thine oil.
DEU.11.15	And I will send grass in thy fields for thy beasts, and thou shalt eat and be full.
DEU.11.16	Keep yourselves, therefore, that your heart not be deceived and ye turn aside and serve other gods and worship them;
DEU.11.17	and then the 
DEU.11.18	Therefore, ye shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul and bind them for a sign upon your hand that they may be as frontlets between your eyes.
DEU.11.19	And ye shall teach them to your children that ye may think of them sitting in thy house and walking by the way, lying down in bed, and rising up.
DEU.11.20	And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house and upon thy gates
DEU.11.21	that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the 
DEU.11.22	For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I command you, to do them, loving the 
DEU.11.23	then the 
DEU.11.24	Every place upon which the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours, from the wilderness and Lebanon; from the river, the river Euphrates, even unto the western sea shall be your border.
DEU.11.25	No one shall be able to stand before you; for the 
DEU.11.26	Behold, I set before you this day the blessing and the curse:
DEU.11.27	The blessing if ye hear the commandments of the 
DEU.11.28	and the curse if ye will not hear the commandments of the 
DEU.11.29	And it shall come to pass when the 
DEU.11.30	which are on the other side of the Jordan, by the way of the west, in the land of the Canaanite, who dwells in the plain over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh.
DEU.11.31	For ye shall pass the Jordan to go in to inherit the land which the 
DEU.11.32	Keep yourselves, therefore, to do all the statutes and rights which I set before you this day.
DEU.12.1	These are the statutes and rights which ye shall keep to do them in the land which the 
DEU.12.2	Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, upon which the Gentiles, of whom ye shall inherit, served their gods, upon the high mountains and upon the hills and under every green tree;
DEU.12.3	and ye shall overthrow their altars and break their images and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the statues of their gods and destroy the names of them out of that place.
DEU.12.4	Ye shall not do so unto the 
DEU.12.5	But ye shall seek the place which the 
DEU.12.6	And there ye shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices and your tithes and the offerings of your hand and your vows and your freewill offerings and the firstborn of your cows and of your sheep;
DEU.12.7	and there ye shall eat before the 
DEU.12.8	Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, each man doing what seems right in his own eyes,
DEU.12.9	For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the 
DEU.12.10	But when ye pass the Jordan and dwell in the land which the 
DEU.12.11	then there shall be a place which the 
DEU.12.12	and ye shall rejoice before the 
DEU.12.13	Keep thyself that thou not offer thy burnt offerings in any place that thou seest
DEU.12.14	but in the place which the 
DEU.12.15	Notwithstanding, thou may kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, according to the desire of thy soul, according to the blessing of the 
DEU.12.16	Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water.
DEU.12.17	Thou may not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy grain or of thy wine or of thy oil or the firstborn of thy cows or of thy sheep nor any of thy vows which thou hast promised nor thy freewill offerings or the heave offerings of thy hands.
DEU.12.18	But thou must eat them before the 
DEU.12.19	Keep thyself that thou not forsake the Levite in all thy days upon thy land.
DEU.12.20	When the 
DEU.12.21	When the place which the 
DEU.12.22	Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat them; the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.
DEU.12.23	Only be sure not to eat the blood; for the blood is the soul (or the life), and thou art not to eat the soul with its flesh.
DEU.12.24	Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as water.
DEU.12.25	Thou shalt not eat it that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the 
DEU.12.26	But the things which thou hast consecrated and thy vows, thou shalt take and go unto the place which the 
DEU.12.27	and thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood, upon the altar of the 
DEU.12.28	Keep and hear all these words which I command thee that it may go well with thee and with thy children after thee for ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the sight of the 
DEU.12.29	When the 
DEU.12.30	keep thyself from being snared by following them, after they are destroyed from before thee; enquire not after their gods, saying, After the manner that these Gentiles served their gods, even so will I do likewise.
DEU.12.31	Thou shalt not do so unto the 
DEU.12.32	Keep thyself, and do all that I command you; thou shalt not add to it nor diminish from it.
DEU.13.1	When there arises among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives thee a sign or a wonder,
DEU.13.2	and the sign or the wonder comes to pass, of which he spoke unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not known, and let us serve them,
DEU.13.3	thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the 
DEU.13.4	Ye shall walk after the 
DEU.13.5	And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death because he has spoken rebellion against the 
DEU.13.6	If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son or thy daughter or the wife of thy bosom or thy friend who is as thine own soul should entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which thou nor thy fathers have known,
DEU.13.7	namely, of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, near unto thee or far off from thee, from the one end of the earth even unto the other end of the earth,
DEU.13.8	thou shalt not consent with him nor hearken unto him; neither shall thine eye pity him; neither shalt thou have compassion; neither shalt thou conceal him,
DEU.13.9	but thou must kill him; thy hand shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterwards the hand of all the people.
DEU.13.10	And thou must stone him with stones, and he shall die because he has sought to thrust thee away from the 
DEU.13.11	so that all Israel shall hear and fear and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.
DEU.13.12	If thou shalt hear in one of thy cities, which the 
DEU.13.13	certain men, the sons of Belial, are gone out from among you and have incited the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known,
DEU.13.14	then shalt thou enquire and search and ask diligently; and, behold, if it is the truth and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought among you,
DEU.13.15	thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly with all that is therein and the beasts thereof, with the edge of the sword.
DEU.13.16	And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of its plaza and shalt burn the city with fire and all the spoil thereof, all of it, unto the 
DEU.13.17	And none of the anathema shall cleave to thine hand that the 
DEU.13.18	when thou shalt hearken to the voice of the 
DEU.14.1	Ye are the sons of the 
DEU.14.2	For thou art a holy people unto the 
DEU.14.3	Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.
DEU.14.4	These are the animals which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep, and the goat,
DEU.14.5	the hart and the roebuck and the buffalo and the wild goat and the unicorn (rhinoceros) and the wild ox and the mountain goat,
DEU.14.6	and every animal that parts the hoof and cleaves the cleft into two claws and chews the cud among the beasts that ye shall eat.
DEU.14.7	Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of those that chew the cud or of those that divide the cloven hoof: the camel and the hare and the coney, for they chew the cud, but do not divide the hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you;
DEU.14.8	and the swine, because it divides the hoof, yet does not chew the cud, it is unclean unto you. Ye shall not eat of their flesh nor touch their dead carcase.
DEU.14.9	These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that have fins and scales shall ye eat,
DEU.14.10	but whatever does not have fins and scales ye may not eat; it is unclean unto you.
DEU.14.11	Of all clean birds ye shall eat.
DEU.14.12	But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle and the ossifrage and the ospray
DEU.14.13	and the glede and the kite and the vulture after his kind
DEU.14.14	and every raven after his kind
DEU.14.15	and the owl and the night hawk and the cuckow and the hawk after his kind
DEU.14.16	the little owl and the great owl and the swan
DEU.14.17	and the pelican and the gier eagle and the cormorant
DEU.14.18	and the stork and the heron after her kind and the lapwing and the bat.
DEU.14.19	And every serpent that flies shall be unclean unto you; they shall not be eaten.
DEU.14.20	But of all clean fowls ye may eat.
DEU.14.21	Ye shall not eat of any thing that died of itself; thou shalt give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates that he may eat it, or thou may sell it unto an alien; for thou art a holy people unto the 
DEU.14.22	Thou shalt without fail tithe all the increase of thy seed that thy field brings forth each year.
DEU.14.23	And thou shalt eat before the 
DEU.14.24	And if the way is too long for thee, so that thou art not able to carry it, or if the place is too far from thee, which the 
DEU.14.25	then shalt thou sell it for money and bind up the money in thy hand and shalt go unto the place which the 
DEU.14.26	and thou shalt give that money for whatever thy soul desires, for cows or for sheep or for wine or for strong drink or for whatever thy soul desires; and thou shalt eat there before the 
DEU.14.27	And thou shalt not forsake the Levite that dwells within thy gates, for he has no part nor inheritance with thee.
DEU.14.28	At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe of thine increase the same year and shalt lay it up within thy gates.
DEU.14.29	And the Levite, who has no part nor inheritance with thee, and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow who are within thy gates, shall come and shall eat and be satisfied, that the 
DEU.15.1	At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.
DEU.15.2	And this is the manner of the release: everyone who has lent anything to his neighbour, causing him to be in debt, shall release it; he shall not exact it any more of his neighbour or of his brother, because the release of the 
DEU.15.3	Of the foreigner thou shalt demand that it be repaid; but that which thy brother has of thine thy hand shall release,
DEU.15.4	so that thus there shall be no poor among you, for the 
DEU.15.5	only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.15.6	For when the 
DEU.15.7	If there should be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within any of thy towns in thy land which the 
DEU.15.8	but thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him and shalt surely lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he lacks.
DEU.15.9	Keep thyself that there not be a thought of Belial in thy heart, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and thine eye be evil against thy poor brother to give him nothing; for he shall cry unto the 
DEU.15.10	Thou shalt surely give unto him, and thine heart shall not be grieved when thou givest unto him because for this thing the 
DEU.15.11	For the poor shall never cease out of the land; therefore, I command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy brother, to thy poor and to thy needy, in thy land.
DEU.15.12	And if thy brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, is sold unto thee and serves thee six years, then in the seventh year thou shalt send him forth from thee free.
DEU.15.13	And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not send him away empty.
DEU.15.14	Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock and out of thy threshing floor and out of thy winepress; of that with which the 
DEU.15.15	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in the land of Egypt, and the 
DEU.15.16	And it shall be, if he says unto thee, I will not go away from thee because he loves thee and thy house because he is well with thee,
DEU.15.17	then thou shalt take an aul and thrust it through his ear unto the door, and he shall be thy slave for ever. And also unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.
DEU.15.18	It shall not seem hard unto thee when thou sendest him away free from thee, for he has served thee for half the cost of a hired servant for six years; and the 
DEU.15.19	All the firstborn males that come of thy herd and of thy flock thou shalt sanctify unto the 
DEU.15.20	Thou shalt eat it before the 
DEU.15.21	And if there is any blemish in it, if it is lame or blind or has any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it unto the 
DEU.15.22	Thou shalt eat it within thy gates; the unclean and the clean person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck and as the hart.
DEU.15.23	Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it upon the ground as water.
DEU.16.1	Keep the month of the new fruit, {Heb. of Abib} and thou shalt do the passover unto the 
DEU.16.2	Thou shalt, therefore, sacrifice the passover unto the 
DEU.16.3	Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for thou didst come forth out of the land of Egypt in haste; that thou may remember the day when thou didst come forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.
DEU.16.4	And there shall be no leavened bread seen in thee within all thy borders for seven days; neither shall any of the flesh which thou didst sacrifice the evening of the first day remain all night until the morning.
DEU.16.5	Thou may not sacrifice the passover within any of thy gates (or within any of thy towns) which the 
DEU.16.6	but at the place which the 
DEU.16.7	And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the 
DEU.16.8	Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day shall be a solemn feast unto the 
DEU.16.9	Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee; begin to number the seven weeks from such time as thou shalt begin to put the sickle to the grain.
DEU.16.10	And thou shalt do the solemn feast of weeks unto the 
DEU.16.11	And thou shalt rejoice before the 
DEU.16.12	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in Egypt; therefore thou shalt keep and do these statutes.
DEU.16.13	Thou shalt observe the solemn feast of the tabernacles seven days after thou hast gathered in the harvest of thy threshing floor and thy winepress.
DEU.16.14	And thou shalt rejoice in thy solemn feast, thou and thy son and thy daughter and thy manslave and thy maidslave and the Levite and the stranger and the fatherless and the widow, that are within thy gates (or within thy towns).
DEU.16.15	Seven days shalt thou celebrate a solemn feast unto the 
DEU.16.16	Three times each year shall all thy males appear before the 
DEU.16.17	Each man with the gift of his hand, according to the blessing of the 
DEU.16.18	Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all the gates of thy cities, which the 
DEU.16.19	Thou shalt not twist that which is right; thou shalt not respect persons neither take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous.
DEU.16.20	Thou shalt follow justice and righteousness, that thou may live and inherit the land which the 
DEU.16.21	Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the altar of the 
DEU.16.22	Neither shalt thou set thee up any image, which the 
DEU.17.1	Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the 
DEU.17.2	If there is found among you, within any of thy gates which the 
DEU.17.3	and has gone and served other gods and worshipped them or the sun or the moon or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded,
DEU.17.4	and it is told unto thee and thou hast heard of it and enquired diligently, and, behold, it is true, and the thing certain that such abomination is wrought in Israel,
DEU.17.5	then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman who has committed that wicked thing unto thy gates, even that man or that woman, and shalt stone them with stones until they die.
DEU.17.6	At the mouth of two witnesses or three witnesses shall he that is worthy of death be put to death, but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.
DEU.17.7	The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him to death and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou shalt put the evil away from among you.
DEU.17.8	If a matter arises that is too difficult for thee in judgment between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates, then thou shalt arise and go up into the place which the 
DEU.17.9	and thou shalt come unto the priests, the Levites, and unto the judge that shall be in those days and enquire, and they shall show thee the word of judgment.
DEU.17.10	And thou shalt do according to the word which those of that place which the 
DEU.17.11	According to the word of the law which they shall show thee and according to the judgment which they shall tell thee, thou shalt do; thou shalt not decline from the word which they shall show thee, to the right hand nor to the left.
DEU.17.12	And the man that will act presumptuously and will not hearken unto the priest that stands to minister there before the 
DEU.17.13	And all the people shall hear and fear and no longer act presumptuously.
DEU.17.14	When thou art come unto the land which the 
DEU.17.15	Thou shalt surely appoint as king over thee the one whom the 
DEU.17.16	Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses; for the 
DEU.17.17	Neither shall he multiply wives unto himself, that his heart turn not away; neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver or gold.
DEU.17.18	And it shall be when he sits upon the throne of his kingdom that he shall cause a copy of this second law to be written in a book in the presence of the priests the Levites;
DEU.17.19	and it shall be near unto him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life that he may learn to fear the 
DEU.17.20	that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren and that he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand or to the left, to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom, he and his sons, in the midst of Israel.
DEU.18.1	The priests the Levites and all the tribe of Levi shall have no part nor shall they inherit with Israel; they shall eat of the offerings on fire unto the 
DEU.18.2	Therefore, shall they have no inheritance among their brethren; the 
DEU.18.3	And this shall be the right of the priest from the people, from those that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; they shall give unto the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the maw.
DEU.18.4	The firstfruits also of thy grain, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstfruits of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give him;
DEU.18.5	for the 
DEU.18.6	And when a Levite comes from any of thy gates out of all Israel, where he sojourned, and comes with all the desire of his soul unto the place which the 
DEU.18.7	then he shall minister unto the name of the 
DEU.18.8	They shall have like portions to eat besides that which comes of the sale of his patrimony.
DEU.18.9	When thou shall have come into the land which the 
DEU.18.10	There shall not be found among you any one that makes his son or his daughter to pass through the fire or that uses divination or an observer of times or an enchanter or a witch
DEU.18.11	or a charmer or a spiritist or a diviner or a necromancer.
DEU.18.12	For anyone that does these things is an abomination unto the 
DEU.18.13	Thou shalt be perfect with the 
DEU.18.14	For these Gentiles, whom thou shalt inherit, hearkened unto observers of times and unto diviners, but as for thee, the 
DEU.18.15	The 
DEU.18.16	according to all that thou didst desire of the 
DEU.18.17	And the 
DEU.18.18	I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.
DEU.18.19	And it shall come to pass that whoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.
DEU.18.20	But the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which I have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.
DEU.18.21	And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the 
DEU.18.22	When a prophet speaks in the name of the 
DEU.19.1	When the 
DEU.19.2	thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy land, which the 
DEU.19.3	Thou shalt prepare thee a way and divide the borders of thy land, which the 
DEU.19.4	And this is the case of the manslayer who is to flee there, that he may live: whoever kills his neighbour by mistake, whom he hated not in time past;
DEU.19.5	and he who went into the woods with his neighbour to cut firewood and his hand fetched a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree and the head slipped from the handle and lighted upon his neighbour so that he died, he shall flee unto one of those cities and live,
DEU.19.6	lest the avenger {Heb. redeemer} of the blood pursue the manslayer, while his heart is hot and overtake him, because the way is long, and slay him, whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he hated him not in time past.
DEU.19.7	Therefore, I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three cities for thee.
DEU.19.8	And if the 
DEU.19.9	when thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I command thee this day: to love the 
DEU.19.10	that innocent blood not be shed in thy land, which the 
DEU.19.11	But when any man hates his neighbour and lies in wait for him and rises up against him and smites him mortally that he dies and flees into one of these cities,
DEU.19.12	then the elders of his city shall send and take him from there and deliver him into the hand of the avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood, and he shall die.
DEU.19.13	Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the guilt of innocent blood from Israel that it may go well with thee.
DEU.19.14	Thou shalt not reduce thy neighbour’s border, which those of old time have marked in thine inheritance, which thou shalt possess in the land that the 
DEU.19.15	One witness shall not be valid against a man for any iniquity or for any sin, in any sin which he should commit. At the mouth of two witnesses or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the matter be established.
DEU.19.16	When a false witness rises up against any man to testify rebellion against him,
DEU.19.17	then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand before the 
DEU.19.18	and the judges shall make diligent inquisition; and, behold, if the witness is a false witness and has testified falsely against his brother,
DEU.19.19	then shall ye do unto him as he had thought to have done unto his brother; so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.
DEU.19.20	And those who remain shall hear and fear and shall never again commit any such evil among you.
DEU.19.21	And thine eye shall not pity, but life shall go for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
DEU.20.1	When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies and seest horses and chariots and a people more than thou, do not be afraid of them; for the 
DEU.20.2	And it shall be, when ye are come near unto the battle that the priest shall approach and speak unto the people
DEU.20.3	and shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day unto battle against your enemies; let not your hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because of them,
DEU.20.4	for the 
DEU.20.5	And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man is there that has built a new house and has not dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house lest peradventure he die in the battle and another man dedicate it.
DEU.20.6	And who has planted a vineyard and has not yet eaten of it? Let him also go and return unto his house lest peradventure he die in the battle and another man eat of it.
DEU.20.7	And what man is there that has betrothed a wife and has not taken her? Let him go and return unto his house lest peradventure he die in the battle and another man take her.
DEU.20.8	And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they shall say, What man is there that is fearful and a coward at heart? Let him go and return unto his house that he not cause his brethren’s hearts to become as his heart.
DEU.20.9	And it shall be when the officers have finished speaking unto the people that the captains of the armies shall lead before the people.
DEU.20.10	When thou comest near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.
DEU.20.11	And it shall be, if it makes thee an answer of peace and opens unto thee, that all the people that are found therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve thee.
DEU.20.12	And if it will make no peace with thee but will make war against thee, and if thou should besiege it,
DEU.20.13	and if the 
DEU.20.14	Only the women and the little ones and the animals and all that is in the city, all the spoil thereof, shalt thou take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat of the spoil of thine enemies, which the 
DEU.20.15	Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off from thee, which are not of the cities of these Gentiles.
DEU.20.16	Only of the cities of these peoples, which the 
DEU.20.17	but thou shalt utterly destroy them: the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite and the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, as the 
DEU.20.18	that they not teach you to do after all their abominations, which they do unto their gods, lest ye should sin against the 
DEU.20.19	When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees thereof by forcing an axe against them, for thou may eat of them; and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the field is man’s life) to employ them in the siege.
DEU.20.20	Only the trees which thou knowest that they are not trees for food, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt build bulwarks against the city that makes war with thee, until it is subdued.
DEU.21.1	When one is found dead in the land which the 
DEU.21.2	then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is dead;
DEU.21.3	and it shall be that the elders of the city which is next unto the dead man shall take a heifer, which has not served, and which has not drawn in the yoke;
DEU.21.4	and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which has neither been plowed nor sown, and shall strike off the heifer’s neck there in the valley.
DEU.21.5	And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for the 
DEU.21.6	And all the elders of that closest city next to the dead man shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded in the valley.
DEU.21.7	And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.
DEU.21.8	Reconcile thy people Israel, whom thou hast ransomed, O 
DEU.21.9	So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of the 
DEU.21.10	When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the 
DEU.21.11	and seest among the captives a beautiful woman and hast a desire unto her that thou would have her to thy wife,
DEU.21.12	then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall shave her head and pare her nails,
DEU.21.13	and she shall put off the clothing of her captivity and shall remain in thine house and bewail her father and her mother a full month, and after that thou shalt go in unto her and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.
DEU.21.14	And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go free, but thou shalt not sell her at all for money; thou shalt not make merchandise of her because thou hast humbled her.
DEU.21.15	When a man has two wives, one beloved and the other hated, and they have born him sons, both the beloved and the hated; and if the firstborn son is of the one that was hated,
DEU.21.16	then it shall be, when he makes his sons to inherit that which he has, that he may not give the right of the firstborn unto the son of the beloved in preference over the son of the hated, who is indeed the firstborn;
DEU.21.17	but he shall acknowledge the son of the hated as the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.
DEU.21.18	When anyone has a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother and when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto them,
DEU.21.19	then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him and bring him out unto the elders of his city and unto the gate of his place;
DEU.21.20	and they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son is stubborn and rebellious; he will not hear our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.
DEU.21.21	Then all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, and he shall die; so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all Israel shall hear and fear.
DEU.21.22	And when a man shall have committed a sin worthy of death, and he is to be put to death, and thou shall have hung him on a tree,
DEU.21.23	his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt without fail bury him that same day (for he that is hanged is accursed of God) that thy land not be defiled, which the 
DEU.22.1	Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ox or his sheep go astray and hide thyself from them; thou shalt in any case bring them again unto thy brother.
DEU.22.2	And even if thy brother is not kin unto thee, or if thou know him not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it shall be with thee until thy brother seeks after it, and thou shalt restore it to him again.
DEU.22.3	In like manner shalt thou do with his ass, and so shalt thou do with his clothing; and with any lost thing of thy brother’s, which he has lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do likewise; thou may not draw back from this.
DEU.22.4	Thou shalt not see thy brother’s ass or his ox fallen down by the way and hide thyself from them; thou shalt surely help him to lift them up again.
DEU.22.5	The woman shall not wear that which pertains unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for all that do so are abomination unto the 
DEU.22.6	If a bird’s nest is encountered before thee in the way in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the mother sitting upon the young or upon the eggs, thou shalt not take the mother with the young.
DEU.22.7	But thou shalt let the mother go and take the young for thyself, that it may be well with thee and that thou may prolong thy days.
DEU.22.8	When thou shall build a new house, then thou shalt make a parapet for thy roof that thou not bring blood upon thine house if anyone should fall from there.
DEU.22.9	Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with mixture lest the fullness of thy seed which thou hast sown and the fruit of thy vineyard be defiled.
DEU.22.10	Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.
DEU.22.11	Thou shalt not wear a garment of mixture, as of woolen and linen together.
DEU.22.12	Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy covering with which thou dost cover thyself.
DEU.22.13	When any man takes a wife and after having gone in unto her, hates her
DEU.22.14	and gives occasions of speech against her and brings up an evil name upon her and says, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a virgin,
DEU.22.15	then shall the father of the damsel and her mother take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel’s virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate.
DEU.22.16	And the damsel’s father shall say unto the elders, I gave my daughter unto this man to wife, and he hates her;
DEU.22.17	and, behold, he has given occasions of speech against her, saying, I found not thy daughter a virgin; and yet these are the tokens of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
DEU.22.18	Then the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise him;
DEU.22.19	and they shall fine him one hundred shekels of silver and give them unto the father of the damsel because he has brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.
DEU.22.20	But if this thing is true and the tokens of virginity are not found for the damsel,
DEU.22.21	then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones, and she shall die because she has wrought folly in Israel, to fornicate in her father’s house; so shalt thou put evil away from among you.
DEU.22.22	If a man is found lying with a woman married to a husband, then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with the woman and the woman; so shalt thou put away evil from Israel.
DEU.22.23	When a damsel that is a virgin is betrothed unto a husband and a man finds her in the city and lies with her,
DEU.22.24	then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city, and ye shall stone them with stones, and they shall die; the damsel because she did not cry out, being in the city, and the man because he has humbled his neighbour’s wife; so thou shalt put away evil from among you.
DEU.22.25	But if the man found a betrothed damsel in the field and the man forced her and lay with her; then only the man that lay with her shall die;
DEU.22.26	but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death; for as when a man rises against his neighbour and murders him, even so is this matter.
DEU.22.27	For he found her in the field and the betrothed damsel cried out, and there was no one to save her.
DEU.22.28	When a man finds a damsel that is a virgin who is not betrothed and lays hold on her and lies with her, and they are found,
DEU.22.29	then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel’s father fifty shekels of silver and she shall be his wife; because he has humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.
DEU.22.30	A man shall not take his father’s wife, nor uncover his father’s skirt.
DEU.23.1	He that is wounded in the stones or is castrated shall not enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.2	A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.3	An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.4	because they did not meet you with bread and with water in the way when ye came forth out of Egypt and because they hired against thee Balaam, the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse thee.
DEU.23.5	Nevertheless the 
DEU.23.6	Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy days for ever.
DEU.23.7	Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, for he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian because thou wast a stranger in his land.
DEU.23.8	The sons that are begotten of them shall enter into the congregation of the 
DEU.23.9	When the host goes forth against thine enemies, then keep thyself from every evil thing.
DEU.23.10	When there is among you any man that is not clean by reason of uncleanness that chances by night, then he shall go abroad out of the camp; he shall not come within the camp.
DEU.23.11	And it shall be when evening comes, he shall wash himself with water, and when the sun is down, he shall come into the camp again.
DEU.23.12	Thou shalt have a place also outside the camp where thou shalt go forth abroad;
DEU.23.13	and thou shalt have a stake among thy weapons; and it shall be when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig with it and shalt turn back and cover thy excrement;
DEU.23.14	for the 
DEU.23.15	Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the slave who is escaped from his master unto thee.
DEU.23.16	He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates where he likes it best; thou shalt not oppress him.
DEU.23.17	There shall be no female cult prostitutes of the daughters of Israel nor any male cult prostitutes of the sons of Israel.
DEU.23.18	Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog, {a male cult prostitute} into the house of the 
DEU.23.19	Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother, usury of money, usury of food, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury.
DEU.23.20	Unto a stranger thou may lend upon usury, but unto thy brother thou shalt not lend upon usury that the 
DEU.23.21	When thou shalt vow a vow unto the 
DEU.23.22	But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall not be sin in thee.
DEU.23.23	That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and perform, that which thou hast promised unto the 
DEU.23.24	When thou comest into thy neighbour’s vineyard, then thou may eat grapes, thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou shalt not put any in thy vessel.
DEU.23.25	When thou comest into the standing grain of thy neighbour, then thou may pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not move a sickle unto thy neighbour’s standing grain.
DEU.24.1	When a man has taken a wife and married her, and it comes to pass that she finds no favour in his eyes because he has found some indecency in her; then let him write her a bill of divorce and give it in her hand and send her out of his house.
DEU.24.2	And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man’s wife.
DEU.24.3	And if the latter husband hates her and writes her a bill of divorce and gives it in her hand and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband who took her to be his wife dies,
DEU.24.4	her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after she is defiled, for that is abomination before the 
DEU.24.5	When a man has taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business; but he shall be free at home one year and shall cheer up his wife whom he has taken.
DEU.24.6	No man shall take the lower or the upper millstone for a pledge, for he takes a man’s life to pledge.
DEU.24.7	When a man is found stealing any of his brethren of the sons of Israel and making merchandise of him or selling him, then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put the evil away from among you.
DEU.24.8	Keep yourselves from the plague of leprosy that thou observe diligently and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you; as I commanded them, so ye shall take care to do.
DEU.24.9	Remember what the 
DEU.24.10	When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to take his pledge.
DEU.24.11	Thou shalt stand outside, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring the pledge out unto thee.
DEU.24.12	And if the man is poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge.
DEU.24.13	Without fail thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goes down that he may sleep in his own clothing and bless thee, and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the 
DEU.24.14	Thou shalt not do violence unto a hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he is of thy brethren or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates.
DEU.24.15	In his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor and with it sustains his life, lest he cry against thee unto the 
DEU.24.16	The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; each one shall be put to death for his own sin.
DEU.24.17	Thou shalt not twist the rights of the stranger nor of the fatherless nor take a widow’s clothing for a pledge,
DEU.24.18	but thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in Egypt, and the 
DEU.24.19	When thou doest reap thy harvest in thy field and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to bring it; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, or for the widow, that the 
DEU.24.20	When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
DEU.24.21	When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward; it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for the widow.
DEU.24.22	And thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore, I command thee to do this thing.
DEU.25.1	If there is a controversy between persons and they come unto judgment and they are judged, then they shall justify the righteous and condemn the wicked.
DEU.25.2	And it shall be if the wicked man is worthy to be beaten the judge shall cause him to lie down and to be beaten in his presence, according to his fault, by a certain number.
DEU.25.3	Forty stripes he may give him and not exceed lest if he should exceed and beat him above these with many stripes, then thy brother should be despised before thee.
DEU.25.4	Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treads out the grain.
DEU.25.5	When brethren dwell together and one of them dies and has no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry outside unto a stranger; her husband’s brother shall go in unto her and take her to him to wife and perform the duty of a husband’s brother unto her.
DEU.25.6	And it shall be that the firstborn which she bears shall be raised up in the name of his brother who is dead that his name be not blotted out of Israel.
DEU.25.7	And if the man does not desire to take his brother’s wife, then let his brother’s wife go up to the gate unto the elders and say, My husband’s brother refuses to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of my husband’s brother.
DEU.25.8	Then the elders of his city shall call him and speak unto him, and if he stands and says, I desire not to take her;
DEU.25.9	then shall his brother’s wife come unto him in the presence of the elders and loose his shoe from off his foot and spit in his face and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto that man that will not build up his brother’s house.
DEU.25.10	And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that is barefoot.
DEU.25.11	When men strive together one with another and the wife of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smites him and puts forth her hand and takes him by his secret parts;
DEU.25.12	then thou shalt cut off her hand; thine eye shall not pity her.
DEU.25.13	Thou shalt not have in thy bag different weights, a great and a small.
DEU.25.14	Thou shalt not have in thy house different measures, a great and a small.
DEU.25.15	But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and just measure shalt thou have, that thy days may be lengthened in the land which the 
DEU.25.16	For all that do such things and all that do unrighteously are an abomination unto the 
DEU.25.17	Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come forth out of Egypt,
DEU.25.18	how he met thee by the way and smote the hindmost of thee, even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint and weary and he did not fear God.
DEU.25.19	Therefore it shall be when the 
DEU.26.1	And it shall be when thou art come in unto the land, which the 
DEU.26.2	thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the 
DEU.26.3	And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days and say unto him, I declare today unto the 
DEU.26.4	And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand and set it down before the altar of the 
DEU.26.5	Then thou shalt speak and say before the 
DEU.26.6	and the Egyptians mistreated us and afflicted us and laid upon us hard bondage.
DEU.26.7	And when we cried unto the 
DEU.26.8	And the 
DEU.26.9	and he has brought us into this place and has given us this land, even a land that flows with milk and honey.
DEU.26.10	And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land which thou, O 
DEU.26.11	And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the 
DEU.26.12	When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thy fruits the third year, which is the year of tithing and hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates and be filled;
DEU.26.13	then thou shalt say before the 
DEU.26.14	I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken out any of it being unclean, nor have I given any of it for the dead; but I have hearkened to the voice of the 
DEU.26.15	Look down from the habitation of thy holiness, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel and the land which thou hast given us, as thou didst sware unto our fathers, a land that flows with milk and honey.
DEU.26.16	Today the 
DEU.26.17	Thou hast lifted up the 
DEU.26.18	And the 
DEU.26.19	and to make thee high above all the Gentiles which he has made, in praise, and in fame, and in glory; and that thou may be a holy people unto the 
DEU.27.1	And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this day.
DEU.27.2	And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass the Jordan unto the land which the 
DEU.27.3	And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law when thou has passed to enter in unto the land which the 
DEU.27.4	Therefore, it shall be when ye have passed the Jordan, that ye shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in Mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster.
DEU.27.5	And there shalt thou build an altar unto the 
DEU.27.6	Thou shalt build the altar of the 
DEU.27.7	and thou shalt offer peace offerings and shalt eat there and rejoice before the 
DEU.27.8	And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law very plainly.
DEU.27.9	And Moses with the priests the Levites spoke unto all Israel, saying, Take heed and hearken, O Israel; today thou art become the people of the 
DEU.27.10	Thou shalt, therefore, hear the voice of the 
DEU.27.11	And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,
DEU.27.12	These shall stand upon Mount Gerizim to bless the people when ye have passed the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin.
DEU.27.13	And these shall stand upon Mount Ebal to pronounce the curse: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.
DEU.27.14	And the Levites shall speak and say unto all the men of Israel with a loud voice:
DEU.27.15	Cursed is the man that makes any graven or molten image, an abomination unto the 
DEU.27.16	Cursed is he that dishonours his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.17	Cursed is he that reduces his neighbour’s border. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.18	Cursed is he that makes the blind to err in the way. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.19	Cursed is he that twists the rights of the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.20	Cursed is he that lies with his father’s wife because he uncovers his father’s skirt. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.21	Cursed is he that lies with any manner of beast. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.22	Cursed is he that lies with his sister, the daughter of his father or the daughter of his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.23	Cursed is he that lies with his mother-in-law. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.24	Cursed is he that smites his neighbour secretly. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.25	Cursed is he that takes a bribe to slay an innocent person. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.27.26	Cursed is he that does not confirm all the words of this law to do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.
DEU.28.1	And it shall come to pass if thou shalt hearken diligently unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.2	and all these blessings shall come upon thee and overtake thee when thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.3	Blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field.
DEU.28.4	Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy beasts, the increase of thy cows, and the flocks of thy sheep.
DEU.28.5	Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.
DEU.28.6	Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out.
DEU.28.7	The 
DEU.28.8	The 
DEU.28.9	The 
DEU.28.10	And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the 
DEU.28.11	And the 
DEU.28.12	The 
DEU.28.13	And the 
DEU.28.14	And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I command thee this day to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them.
DEU.28.15	And it shall come to pass if thou wilt not hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.16	Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field.
DEU.28.17	Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.
DEU.28.18	Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land, the increase of thy cows and the flocks of thy sheep.
DEU.28.19	Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt thou be when thou goest out.
DEU.28.20	The 
DEU.28.21	The 
DEU.28.22	The 
DEU.28.23	And thy heavens which are over thy head shall be brass, and the earth that is under thee shall be iron.
DEU.28.24	The 
DEU.28.25	The 
DEU.28.26	And thy carcase shall be food unto all fowls of the air and unto the beasts of the earth, and there shall be no one to frighten them away.
DEU.28.27	The 
DEU.28.28	The 
DEU.28.29	And thou shalt grope at noonday as the blind grope in the darkness, and thou shalt not be prospered in thy ways; and thou shalt only be oppressed and spoiled all the days, and there shall be no one to save thee.
DEU.28.30	Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her; thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell therein; thou shalt plant a vineyard and shalt not gather the grapes thereof.
DEU.28.31	Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not eat thereof; thine ass shall be violently taken away from before thy face and shall not be restored to thee; thy sheep shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have no one to rescue them.
DEU.28.32	Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people, and thine eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no strength in thine hand.
DEU.28.33	The fruit of thy land and all thy labours shall a people which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt only be oppressed and crushed all the days.
DEU.28.34	So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which thou shalt see.
DEU.28.35	The 
DEU.28.36	The 
DEU.28.37	And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword among all nations where the 
DEU.28.38	Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field and shalt gather but little in, for the locust shall consume it.
DEU.28.39	Thou shalt plant vineyards and dress them, but shalt neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes, for the worms shall eat them.
DEU.28.40	Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy borders, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall fall.
DEU.28.41	Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy them; for they shall go into captivity.
DEU.28.42	All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.
DEU.28.43	The stranger that is in the midst of thee shall get up above thee very high, and thou shalt come down very low.
DEU.28.44	He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him; he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.
DEU.28.45	Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee and shall pursue thee and overtake thee until thou art destroyed because thou shalt not have attended unto the voice of the 
DEU.28.46	and they shall be in thee for a sign and for a wonder, and in thy seed for ever.
DEU.28.47	Because thou didst not serve the 
DEU.28.48	therefore, thou shalt serve thine enemies which the 
DEU.28.49	The 
DEU.28.50	a nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the person of the old nor show favour to the young;
DEU.28.51	and he shall eat the fruit of thy beast and the fruit of thy land until thou art destroyed, which also shall not leave thee either grain, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy cows or flocks of thy sheep until he has destroyed thee.
DEU.28.52	And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates until thy high and fenced walls come down, in which thou dost trust, throughout all thy land; and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates throughout all thy land, which the 
DEU.28.53	And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, which the 
DEU.28.54	The man that is tender among you and very delicate, his eye shall be evil toward his brother and toward the wife of his bosom and toward the remnant of his children which he shall leave,
DEU.28.55	so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his children whom he shall eat, because he shall have nothing left him in the siege and in the straitness with which thine enemies shall distress thee in all thy gates.
DEU.28.56	The tender and delicate woman among you who would not venture to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband of her bosom and toward her son and toward her daughter
DEU.28.57	and toward her young one that comes out from between her feet and toward her children which she shall bear, for she shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege and straitness with which thine enemy shall distress thee in thy gates,
DEU.28.58	if thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that are written in this book that thou may fear this glorious and fearful name; I AM thy God.
DEU.28.59	Then the 
DEU.28.60	Moreover, he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of, and they shall cleave unto thee.
DEU.28.61	Also every sickness and every plague, which is not written in the book of this law, the 
DEU.28.62	And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude, because thou would not hear the voice of the 
DEU.28.63	And it shall come to pass that as the 
DEU.28.64	And the 
DEU.28.65	Neither shalt thou find rest among these Gentiles, neither shall the sole of thy foot have rest; but there the 
DEU.28.66	and thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt fear day and night and shalt have no assurance of thy life.
DEU.28.67	In the morning thou shalt say, I wish it were evening, and in the evening thou shalt say, I wish it were morning! For the fear of thine heart with which thou shalt fear and for that which thine eyes shall see.
DEU.28.68	And the 
DEU.29.1	These are the words of the covenant, which the 
DEU.29.2	Moses, therefore, called unto all Israel and said unto them, Ye have seen all that the 
DEU.29.3	the great trials which thine eyes have seen, the signs and those great miracles.
DEU.29.4	Yet the 
DEU.29.5	And I have brought you forty years through the wilderness; your clothes are not waxed old upon you, and neither has thy shoe waxed old upon thy foot.
DEU.29.6	Ye have never eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong drink that ye might know that I am the 
DEU.29.7	And when ye came unto this place, Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle, and we smote them;
DEU.29.8	and we took their land and gave it for an inheritance unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites and to the half tribe of Manasseh.
DEU.29.9	Thou shalt keep, therefore, the words of this covenant and do them that ye may understand all that ye do.
DEU.29.10	Ye stand today, all of you, before the 
DEU.29.11	your little ones, your wives, and thy strangers that dwell within thy camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water,
DEU.29.12	that thou may enter into covenant with the 
DEU.29.13	to confirm thee today as his people and that he may be unto thee as God, as he has said unto thee, and as he has sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
DEU.29.14	Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,
DEU.29.15	but with those that stand here with us today before the 
DEU.29.16	For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the Gentiles which ye passed by;
DEU.29.17	and ye have seen their abominations and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which they have among them.
DEU.29.18	Peradventure there shall be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the 
DEU.29.19	and it shall be, when that one hears the words of this curse, that he blesses himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst.
DEU.29.20	The 
DEU.29.21	And the 
DEU.29.22	So that the generation to come of your children that shall rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far land shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses which the 
DEU.29.23	and that the whole land thereof is brimstone and salt and burning, that it is not sown, nor shall it produce anything, nor shall any grass grow therein, like in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboim, which the 
DEU.29.24	even all Gentiles shall say, Why has the 
DEU.29.25	Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the 
DEU.29.26	for they went and served other gods and worshipped them, gods whom they knew not and who had not given anything unto them.
DEU.29.27	Therefore, the anger of the 
DEU.29.28	And the 
DEU.29.29	The hidden things of the 
DEU.30.1	And it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee, the blessing and the curse which I have set before thee, and thou shalt return unto thy heart among all the Gentiles, where the 
DEU.30.2	and shalt convert unto the 
DEU.30.3	then the 
DEU.30.4	If thou hast been driven out unto the outmost parts of the heavens, from there will the 
DEU.30.5	and the 
DEU.30.6	And the 
DEU.30.7	And the 
DEU.30.8	And thou shalt return and thou shalt hear the voice of the 
DEU.30.9	And the 
DEU.30.10	when thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the 
DEU.30.11	For this commandment which I command thee today is not hidden unto thee, neither is it far off.
DEU.30.12	It is not in heaven, that thou should say, Who shall go up for us to heaven and take it for us and recite it unto us, that we may fulfil it?
DEU.30.13	Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou should say, Who shall go over the sea for us and take it for us and recite it unto us, that we may fulfil it?
DEU.30.14	But the word is very near unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou may fulfil it.
DEU.30.15	See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death and evil;
DEU.30.16	for I command thee this day to love the 
DEU.30.17	But if thine heart turns away so that thou wilt not hear, but shalt be drawn away and worship other gods and serve them,
DEU.30.18	I declare unto you this day that ye shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, to go unto which thou passest the Jordan to inherit it.
DEU.30.19	I call the heavens and the earth to witness today against you that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore, choose life that both thou and thy seed may live,
DEU.30.20	that thou may love the 
DEU.31.1	And Moses went and spoke these words unto all Israel,
DEU.31.2	and he said unto them, I am one hundred and twenty years old today; I can no longer go out and come in; also the 
DEU.31.3	The 
DEU.31.4	And the 
DEU.31.5	And the 
DEU.31.6	Be strong and of a good courage; fear not, nor be afraid of them, for the 
DEU.31.7	And Moses called unto Joshua and said unto him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage, for thou shalt enter in with this people to the land which the 
DEU.31.8	And the 
DEU.31.9	And Moses wrote this law and delivered it unto the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.10	And Moses commanded them, saying, At the beginning of the seventh year, in the appointed time of the year of release, in the feast of the tabernacles,
DEU.31.11	when all Israel is come to appear before the 
DEU.31.12	Gather the people together, men and women and children and thy strangers that are within thy gates, that they may hear and that they may learn and fear the 
DEU.31.13	and that their children, who have not known any thing, may hear and learn to fear the 
DEU.31.14	And the 
DEU.31.15	And the 
DEU.31.16	And the 
DEU.31.17	Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that same day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall them so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils come upon us because our God is not among us?
DEU.31.18	But I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.
DEU.31.19	Now therefore write ye this song for you and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it in their mouths that this song may be a witness for me against the sons of Israel.
DEU.31.20	For I shall bring them into the land which I swore unto their fathers, that flows with milk and honey, and they shall eat and fill themselves and wax fat; then they will turn unto other gods and serve them and provoke me and break my covenant.
DEU.31.21	And it shall come to pass when many evils and troubles are befallen them, that this song shall reply to them in their face as a witness, for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed; for I know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have brought them into the land which I swore.
DEU.31.22	Moses therefore wrote this song the same day and taught it to the sons of Israel.
DEU.31.23	And he gave Joshua, the son of Nun, a charge and said, Be strong and of a good courage for thou shalt bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore unto them, and I will be with thee.
DEU.31.24	And it came to pass when Moses had finished writing the words of this law in the book until they were finished,
DEU.31.25	that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.26	Take this book of the law and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the 
DEU.31.27	For I know thy rebellion and thy stiff neck; behold, while I am yet alive with you today, ye are rebels against the 
DEU.31.28	Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, and I shall speak these words in their ears and call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against them.
DEU.31.29	For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will befall you in the latter days because ye will have done evil in the sight of the 
DEU.31.30	Then Moses spoke in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were ended.
DEU.32.1	Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.
DEU.32.2	My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb and as the showers upon the grass.
DEU.32.3	Because I will invoke the name of the 
DEU.32.4	The strong One, whose work is perfect: for all his ways are right; a God of truth and without iniquity, just and upright is he.
DEU.32.5	They have corrupted themselves, their spot is that they are not his sons; they are a perverse and crooked generation.
DEU.32.6	Do ye thus repay the 
DEU.32.7	Remember the days of old; consider the years of many generations; ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee;
DEU.32.8	when the most High caused the Gentiles to be inherited, when he separated the sons of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of Israel.
DEU.32.9	For the 
DEU.32.10	He found him in a desert land and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye.
DEU.32.11	As an eagle stirs up her nest, flutters over her young, spreads abroad her wings, takes them, bears them on her wings,
DEU.32.12	so the 
DEU.32.13	He made him ride on the high places of the earth that he might eat the fruits of the field; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock and oil out of the strong flint,
DEU.32.14	butter of cows and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs and rams of the sons of Bashan (or fruitfulness) and goats with the fat of kidneys, of wheat; and thou didst drink the blood of the grape, pure wine.
DEU.32.15	But Jeshurun (the upright one) waxed fat and kicked; (thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou hast covered thyself) and forsook the God who made him and lightly esteemed the strong One of his saving health.
DEU.32.16	They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods; with abominations they provoked him to anger.
DEU.32.17	They sacrificed unto devils, not to God, to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came from nearby, whom your fathers feared not.
DEU.32.18	Of the strong One that begat thee thou art unmindful and hast forgotten the God that travailed for thee.
DEU.32.19	And when the 
DEU.32.20	And he said, I will hide my face from them; I will see what their end shall be: that they are a generation of perversities, sons without faith.
DEU.32.21	They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities; and I also will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with foolish Gentiles.
DEU.32.22	For fire shall be kindled in my anger and shall burn unto the lowest part of Sheol and shall consume the earth with her fruit and burn up the foundations of the mountains.
DEU.32.23	I will heap evils upon them; I will spend my arrows upon them.
DEU.32.24	They shall be consumed with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter destruction; I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.
DEU.32.25	The sword without and terror within shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs.
DEU.32.26	I said I would shatter them in pieces: I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men,
DEU.32.27	if I did not fear the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should become vain and lest they should say, Our high hand has done this and not the 
DEU.32.28	For they are a Gentile void of counsel, neither is there any intelligence in them.
DEU.32.29	O that they were wise, if they were prudent, they would understand their latter end!
DEU.32.30	How could one chase a thousand and two put ten thousands to flight if their strong One had not sold them, and the 
DEU.32.31	For their strong one is not as our strong One, and even our enemies are judges of this.
DEU.32.32	Therefore, their vine is of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are very bitter.
DEU.32.33	Their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of asps.
DEU.32.34	Do I not have this laid up in store, sealed up in my treasuries?
DEU.32.35	Vengeance and recompense are mine, in the time when their foot shall slide; for the day of their calamity is at hand and that which is determined upon them makes haste.
DEU.32.36	For the 
DEU.32.37	And he shall say, Where are their gods, their strong one in whom they trusted,
DEU.32.38	who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? Let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.
DEU.32.39	See now that I, I am he, and there are no gods with me; I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal; and there is not one that can deliver out of my hand.
DEU.32.40	When I shall lift up my hand to the heavens and shall say, I live for ever,
DEU.32.41	if I whet the resplendence of my sword and my hand takes hold on judgment, I will render vengeance to my enemies and will recompense those that hate me.
DEU.32.42	I will make my arrows drunk with blood and my sword shall devour flesh, in the blood of the slain and of the captives of the heads, in revenge as an enemy.
DEU.32.43	Rejoice, O ye Gentiles, with his people, for he will avenge the blood of his slaves and will render vengeance to his enemies and will reconcile his land, to his people.
DEU.32.44	And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hosea, the son of Nun.
DEU.32.45	And Moses finished speaking all these words to all Israel;
DEU.32.46	and he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I protest against you today, to command them unto your children and keep and fulfil all the words of this law.
DEU.32.47	For it is not a vain thing for you because it is your life; and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, which ye shall pass the Jordan to inherit.
DEU.32.48	And the 
DEU.32.49	Climb up into this mountain Abarim, unto Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho, and behold the land of Canaan, which I give as inheritance unto the sons of Israel,
DEU.32.50	and die in the mountain which thou shalt climb and be gathered unto thy peoples, as Aaron thy brother died in Mount Hor and was gathered unto his peoples,
DEU.32.51	because ye trespassed against me among the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin, because ye did not sanctify me in the midst of the sons of Israel.
DEU.32.52	Yet thou shalt see the land before thee, but thou shalt not enter there to the land which I give the sons of Israel.
DEU.33.1	And this is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death.
DEU.33.2	And he said, The 
DEU.33.3	Yea, he loved the peoples; all his saints are in thy hand; they also united at thy feet; they received thy words.
DEU.33.4	Moses commanded us law as inheritance unto the congregation of Jacob.
DEU.33.5	And he was king in Jeshurun when the heads of the people, the tribes of Israel, were gathered together as one.
DEU.33.6	Let Reuben live and not die, and let not his men be few.
DEU.33.7	And this blessing is for Judah, and he said, Hear, 
DEU.33.8	And to Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah,
DEU.33.9	who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen them; neither did he acknowledge his brethren nor know his own children; therefore, they shall keep thy word and guard thy covenant.
DEU.33.10	They shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law; they shall put incense before thy nostrils and a perfect sacrifice upon thine altar.
DEU.33.11	Bless, O 
DEU.33.12	And to Benjamin he said, The beloved of the 
DEU.33.13	And to Joseph he said, Blessed of the 
DEU.33.14	and for the gifts of the fruits of the sun and for the gifts of the influence of the moon,
DEU.33.15	and for the summit of the ancient mountains and for the gifts of the everlasting hills,
DEU.33.16	and for the gifts of the earth and fullness thereof, and may the grace of him that dwelt in the bush come upon the head of Joseph and upon the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren.
DEU.33.17	His beauty is like the firstborn of his bullock, and his horns are like the horns of unicorns; with them he shall push the people together to the ends of the earth; these are the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh.
DEU.33.18	And to Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out; and thou, Issachar, in thy tents.
DEU.33.19	They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall offer sacrifices of righteousness; therefore they shall suck the abundance of the seas and hidden treasures of the sand.
DEU.33.20	And to Gad he said, Blessed is he that caused Gad to be enlarged; he shall dwell as a lion and shall tear the arm with the crown of the head.
DEU.33.21	And he saw the best for himself because there the portion of the lawgiver was enclosed; and he came at the head of the people; he shall execute the righteousness of the 
DEU.33.22	And to Dan he said, Dan is a lion’s whelp; he shall leap from Bashan.
DEU.33.23	And to Naphtali he said, Naphtali, filled with grace and full of the blessing of the 
DEU.33.24	And to Asher he said, Asher, more blessed than the sons, shall be acceptable unto his brethren and shall dip his foot in oil.
DEU.33.25	Thy locks shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.
DEU.33.26	There is no other like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rides upon the heavens for thy help, in the clouds with his excellency.
DEU.33.27	The habitation of God is eternal, and underneath the everlasting arms; he shall thrust out the enemy from before thee and shall say, Destroy them.
DEU.33.28	Then Israel, the fountain of Jacob, shall dwell in safety alone in a land of grain and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.
DEU.33.29	Blessed art thou, O Israel, who is like unto thee, O people saved by the 
DEU.34.1	And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And the 
DEU.34.2	and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,
DEU.34.3	and the Negev and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, unto Zoar.
DEU.34.4	And the 
DEU.34.5	So Moses, the slave of the 
DEU.34.6	And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Bethpeor, but no one knows of his sepulchre unto this day.
DEU.34.7	And Moses was one hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.
DEU.34.8	And the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were fulfilled.
DEU.34.9	And Joshua, the son of Nun, was full of the Spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the sons of Israel hearkened unto him and did as the 
DEU.34.10	And there never arose a prophet since in Israel like Moses, who had known the 
DEU.34.11	in all the signs and the wonders, which the 
DEU.34.12	and in all that mighty hand and in all the great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.
JOS.1.1	Now after the death of Moses, the slave of the 
JOS.1.2	Moses, my slave, is dead; now, therefore, arise, pass this Jordan, thou and all this people, unto the land which I give to the sons of Israel.
JOS.1.3	Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.
JOS.1.4	From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your borders.
JOS.1.5	No one shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee; I will not fail thee nor forsake thee.
JOS.1.6	Be strong and of a good courage; for thou shalt cause this people to inherit the land as an inheritance, which I swore unto their fathers to give them.
JOS.1.7	Only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest keep and do according to all the law, which Moses my slave commanded thee; turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou may be prospered in all the things that thou doest.
JOS.1.8	This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou may keep and do according to all that is written therein; for then thou shalt make thy way to prosper, and then thou shalt understand everything.
JOS.1.9	See that I command thee to be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for I, the 
JOS.1.10	Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
JOS.1.11	Pass through the camp and command the people, saying, Prepare food; for within three days ye shall pass this Jordan, to enter in to inherit the land, which the 
JOS.1.12	Also to the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to half the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua spoke, saying,
JOS.1.13	Remember the word which Moses, the slave of the 
JOS.1.14	Your wives, your little ones, and your beasts shall remain in the land which Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan; but ye, all the mighty men of valour, shall pass before your brethren armed and help them
JOS.1.15	until the 
JOS.1.16	Then they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou hast commanded us we will do, and wherever thou dost send us, we will go.
JOS.1.17	According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we hearken unto thee; only let the 
JOS.1.18	Whoever rebels against thy commandment and will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou doest command him, let him die; only be strong and of a good courage.
JOS.2.1	And Joshua, the son of Nun, sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they went and came into a harlot’s house, named Rahab, and lodged there.
JOS.2.2	And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men of the sons of Israel have come here this night to spy out the land.
JOS.2.3	Then the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men that have come unto thee, who have entered into thy house; for they are come to spy out all the land.
JOS.2.4	And the woman had taken the two men and hidden them and said thus, It is true that some men came unto me, but I did not know where they came from.
JOS.2.5	And at the time of shutting the gate, when it was dark, these men went out, and I do not know where the men went; pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake them.
JOS.2.6	But she had brought them up to the roof of the house and hid them among the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.
JOS.2.7	And the men pursued after them along the way to Jordan unto the fords; and as soon as those who pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.
JOS.2.8	And before they went to sleep, she came up unto them upon the roof;
JOS.2.9	and she said unto the men, I know that the 
JOS.2.10	For we have heard how the 
JOS.2.11	Hearing this has melted our heart, neither has there remained any more spirit in any man because of you, for the 
JOS.2.12	Now, therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the 
JOS.2.13	and that ye will save alive my father and my mother and my brethren and my sisters and all that they have and deliver our lives from death.
JOS.2.14	And the men answered her, Our life for yours if ye do not declare this our business. And it shall be when the 
JOS.2.15	Then she let them down by a cord through the window; for her house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.
JOS.2.16	And she said unto them, Go to the mountain lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; and afterwards ye may go your way.
JOS.2.17	And the men said unto her, We will be exempted of this thine oath which thou hast made us swear in the following manner.
JOS.2.18	Behold, when we come into the land, thou shall have bound this line of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down by, and thou shall have brought thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all thy father’s household home unto thee.
JOS.2.19	And it shall be that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his own head, and we will be guiltless; and whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head if any hand touches him.
JOS.2.20	And if thou should declare this our business, then we will be exempted of thine oath which thou hast made us swear.
JOS.2.21	And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet line in the window.
JOS.2.22	And they went and came unto the mountain and abode there three days until their pursuers had returned; and the pursuers sought them throughout all the way but did not find them.
JOS.2.23	So the two men returned and descended from the mountain and crossed over and came to Joshua, the son of Nun, and told him all the things that had befallen them.
JOS.2.24	And they said unto Joshua, Truly the 
JOS.3.1	And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from Shittim and came to the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel and lodged there before they passed over.
JOS.3.2	And after three days, the officers went through the camp,
JOS.3.3	and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.3.4	Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure; do not come near unto it that ye may know the way by which ye must go; for ye have not passed this way before now.
JOS.3.5	And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow the 
JOS.3.6	And Joshua spoke unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant and pass before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people.
JOS.3.7	And the 
JOS.3.8	Therefore, thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye are entered into the brink of the water of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.
JOS.3.9	And Joshua said unto the sons of Israel, Draw near and hear the words of the 
JOS.3.10	And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite.
JOS.3.11	Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes the Jordan before you.
JOS.3.12	Now, therefore, take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, out of each tribe a man.
JOS.3.13	And when the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the 
JOS.3.14	And it came to pass when the people removed from their tents to pass the Jordan and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,
JOS.3.15	when those that bore the ark entered into the Jordan, as soon as the feet of the priests that bore the ark were dipped in the brim of the water (for Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),
JOS.3.16	that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up in a heap very far from the city of Adam, that is beside Zaretan; and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed and were cut off; and the people passed over right against Jericho.
JOS.3.17	But the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.1	And it came to pass when all the people were finished passing the Jordan, that the 
JOS.4.2	Take twelve men out of the people, out of each tribe a man,
JOS.4.3	and command them, saying, Take from here of the midst of Jordan, out of the place where the priests’ feet stood firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this night.
JOS.4.4	Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the sons of Israel, out of each tribe a man;
JOS.4.5	and Joshua said unto them, Pass before the ark of the 
JOS.4.6	that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What do these stones mean unto you?
JOS.4.7	Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.8	And the sons of Israel did so as Joshua commanded and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as the 
JOS.4.9	Joshua also set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there unto this day.
JOS.4.10	For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the 
JOS.4.11	And when all the people were finished passing, the ark of the 
JOS.4.12	And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh passed armed before the sons of Israel, as Moses had said unto them.
JOS.4.13	About forty thousand men prepared for war passed over before the 
JOS.4.14	On that day the 
JOS.4.15	And the 
JOS.4.16	Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.
JOS.4.17	Joshua, therefore, commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.
JOS.4.18	And it came to pass, when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.4.19	And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped in Gilgal, on the east side of Jericho.
JOS.4.20	And Joshua raised up in Gilgal the twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan.
JOS.4.21	And he spoke unto the sons of Israel, saying, When your children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What do these stones mean unto you?
JOS.4.22	Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.
JOS.4.23	For the 
JOS.4.24	that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the 
JOS.5.1	And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were on the west side of the Jordan, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard that the 
JOS.5.2	At that time the 
JOS.5.3	And Joshua made himself sharp knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.
JOS.5.4	And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: All the people that had come out of Egypt, that were males, even all the men of war, had died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.
JOS.5.5	Now all the people that had come out were circumcised; but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt, were not circumcised.
JOS.5.6	For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness until all the people that were men of war, who had come out of Egypt, were consumed because they did not listen to the voice of the 
JOS.5.7	But their sons, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised by the way.
JOS.5.8	And when they had finished circumcising all the people, they abode in the same place in the camp until they were whole.
JOS.5.9	And the 
JOS.5.10	And the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal and celebrated the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the plains of Jericho.
JOS.5.11	And they ate of the fruit of the land, unleavened cakes, on the next day after the passover and parched new ears of grain in the same day.
JOS.5.12	And the manna ceased on the next day after they had begun to eat of the fruit of the land; and the sons of Israel never had manna again; but they ate of the fruits of the land of Canaan that year.
JOS.5.13	And Joshua, being near Jericho, lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man over against him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went unto him and said unto him, Art thou one of us or one of our adversaries?
JOS.5.14	And he said, No, but I am the Prince of the host of the 
JOS.5.15	And the Prince of the 
JOS.6.1	Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the sons of Israel; no one went out, and no one came in.
JOS.6.2	But the 
JOS.6.3	Therefore, ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, going round about the city once; and thou shalt do this six days.
JOS.6.4	And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven shofarot {or rams horns} of jubilee; and the seventh day ye shall go around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow with the shofarot.
JOS.6.5	And when they make a long sound of jubilee with the horn so that ye hear the voice of the shofar, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city shall fall down flat; then the people shall ascend up each man straight before him.
JOS.6.6	And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said unto them, Take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven shofarot of jubilee before the ark of the 
JOS.6.7	And he said unto the people, Pass on and compass the city and let those that are armed pass on before the ark of the 
JOS.6.8	And when Joshua had spoken unto the people, the seven priests bearing the seven shofarot of jubilee passed on before the 
JOS.6.9	And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the shofarot, and the congregation came after the ark, the priests going on and blowing with the shofarot.
JOS.6.10	And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I tell you, Shout; then ye shall shout.
JOS.6.11	So the ark of the 
JOS.6.12	And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the 
JOS.6.13	And the seven priests bearing the seven shofarot of jubilee before the ark of the 
JOS.6.14	Likewise the second day they compassed the city once and returned into the camp; so they did for six days.
JOS.6.15	And on the seventh day they rose early about the dawning of the day and compassed the city after the same manner seven times; only on that day they compassed the city seven times.
JOS.6.16	And when the priests had blown the shofarot the seventh time, Joshua said unto the people, Shout, for the 
JOS.6.17	And the city shall be anathema unto the 
JOS.6.18	But keep yourselves from the anathema, that ye not touch nor take any thing of the anathema so that ye not make the camp of Israel anathema and trouble it.
JOS.6.19	For all the silver and gold and vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the 
JOS.6.20	Then the people shouted when the priests blew with the shofarot, and it came to pass when the people heard the voice of the shofar, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, each man straight before him and they took the city.
JOS.6.21	And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and ass, with the edge of the sword.
JOS.6.22	But Joshua said unto the two men that had spied out the land, Go into the harlot’s house and bring the woman out of there with all that she has, as ye swore unto her.
JOS.6.23	And the young men that were spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred and put them outside in the camp of Israel.
JOS.6.24	And they burnt the city with fire and all that was in it; only the silver and the gold and the vessels of brass and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the 
JOS.6.25	And Joshua gave Rahab, the harlot, her life and also to her father’s household and to all that she had; and she dwells in Israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers, whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.
JOS.6.26	And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the man before the 
JOS.6.27	So the 
JOS.7.1	But the sons of Israel committed a trespass in the anathema; for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the anathema; and the anger of the 
JOS.7.2	And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which was beside Bethaven, on the east side of Bethel, and spoke unto them, saying, Go up and spy out the land. And the men went up and spied out Ai.
JOS.7.3	And they returned to Joshua and said unto him, Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and smite Ai; do not make all the people to labour there; for they are but few.
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand men of the people went up there; and they fled before the men of Ai.
JOS.7.5	And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men; for they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and smote them in the going down; therefore the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.
JOS.7.6	Then Joshua rent his clothes and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the 
JOS.7.7	And Joshua said, Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou caused this people to pass the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us? We should have been content and dwelt on the other side of the Jordan!
JOS.7.8	O Lord, what shall I say now that Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!
JOS.7.9	For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall hear of it and shall compass us around and cut off our name from upon the earth; then what wilt thou do unto thy great name?
JOS.7.10	And the 
JOS.7.11	Israel has sinned and has even transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; for they have even taken of the anathema and have also stolen and lied also, and they have even put it in their own vessels.
JOS.7.12	Therefore, the sons of Israel could not stand before their enemies, but shall turn their backs before their enemies because they have been in the anathema; neither will I be with you any more, except ye destroy the anathema from among you.
JOS.7.13	Get up, sanctify the people and say, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow; for thus saith the 
JOS.7.14	In the morning, therefore, ye shall come near according to your tribes, and it shall be that the tribe which the 
JOS.7.15	And it shall be that he that is taken in the anathema shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he has because he has broken the covenant of the 
JOS.7.16	So Joshua rose up early in the morning and brought Israel by their tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken;
JOS.7.17	and bringing near the tribe of Judah, the family of the Zarhites was taken; and bringing near the family of the Zarhites man by man, Zabdi was taken;
JOS.7.18	and he caused his household to come near, man by man; and Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.
JOS.7.19	Then Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory now to the 
JOS.7.20	And Achan answered Joshua and said, Indeed I have sinned against the 
JOS.7.21	When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment and two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and, behold, it was hid in his tent and the silver under it.
JOS.7.23	And they took them out of the midst of the tent and brought them unto Joshua and unto all the sons of Israel and laid them out before the 
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan, the son of Zerah, and the silver and the garment and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent and all that he had, and they brought them unto the valley of Achor.
JOS.7.25	And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? The 
JOS.7.26	And they raised over them a great heap of stones unto this day. So the 
JOS.8.1	And the 
JOS.8.2	And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto Jericho and her king; only the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof, ye shall take for yourselves. Lay thee an ambush for the city behind it.
JOS.8.3	So Joshua arose and all the people of war, to go up against Ai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour and sent them away by night.
JOS.8.4	And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait against the city, even behind the city; do not go very far from the city, but all of you be ready.
JOS.8.5	And I and all the people that are with me, will approach the city; and when they come out against us, as at the first, we will flee before them
JOS.8.6	(for they will come out after us) until we have raptured them out of the city; for they will say, They flee before us as at the first. Therefore, we will flee before them.
JOS.8.7	Then ye shall rise up from the ambush and take possession of the city; for the 
JOS.8.8	And when ye have taken the city, ye shall set the city on fire. Ye shall do according to the word of the 
JOS.8.9	Then Joshua sent them forth, and they went to lie in ambush and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; and Joshua lodged that night in the midst of the people.
JOS.8.10	And Joshua rose up early in the morning and numbered the people and went up he and the elders of Israel, before the people against Ai.
JOS.8.11	And all the people of war that were with him, went up, and drew near and came before the city and pitched camp on the north side of Ai; now there was a valley between them and Ai.
JOS.8.12	And he took about five thousand men and set them to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.
JOS.8.13	And the people, all the camp that was on the side of the north came near to the city, and their ambush on the west of the city. And Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.
JOS.8.14	When the king of Ai saw it, he rose up early in the morning and made haste with the men of the city to go out against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time appointed, before the plain; but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.
JOS.8.15	Then Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them and fled by the way of the wilderness.
JOS.8.16	And all the people that were in Ai were called together to pursue after them; and they pursued after Joshua and were raptured from the city.
JOS.8.17	And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel that did not go out after Israel; and because they pursued after Israel, they left the city open.
JOS.8.18	Then the 
JOS.8.19	And those of the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon as he had stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city and took it and made haste to set the city on fire.
JOS.8.20	And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and, behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no power to flee this way or that way; and the people that were fleeing into the wilderness turned back upon their pursuers.
JOS.8.21	Then Joshua and all Israel, seeing that those of the ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned and slew the men of Ai.
JOS.8.22	And the others issued out of the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side; and they smote them so that they let none of them remain or escape.
JOS.8.23	And they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	And when Israel had finished slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the edge of the sword until they were consumed, all the Israelites returned unto Ai and smote it with the edge of the sword.
JOS.8.25	And so it was that all that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.
JOS.8.26	For Joshua did not draw back his hand with which he stretched out the spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.
JOS.8.27	But the Israelites took the beasts and the spoil of the city for themselves, according unto the word of the 
JOS.8.28	And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a perpetual heap, desolate unto this day.
JOS.8.29	And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening, and as soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should take his carcase down from the tree and cast it at the entering of the gate of the city and raise a great heap of stones upon it, that remains unto this day.
JOS.8.30	Then Joshua built an altar unto the 
JOS.8.31	as Moses, the slave, of the 
JOS.8.32	He also wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written in the presence of the sons of Israel.
JOS.8.33	And all Israel and their elders and officers and their judges stood on one side and on the other near the ark, before the priests the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of the 
JOS.8.34	After this he read all the words of the law, the blessings and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of the law.
JOS.8.35	There was not a word of all the things that Moses commanded which Joshua did not read before all the congregation of Israel with the women and the little ones and the strangers that walked among them.
JOS.9.1	And it came to pass when all the kings who were on this side of the Jordan, in the mountains and in the valleys and in all the coast of the great sea over against Lebanon, heard these things, the Hittites and the Amorites the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites
JOS.9.2	gathered themselves together with one accord to fight with Joshua and with Israel.
JOS.9.3	But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done unto Jericho and to Ai,
JOS.9.4	they worked with prudence and went and made as if they had been ambassadors and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old and rent and bound up,
JOS.9.5	and old patched shoes upon their feet, and old garments upon them, and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy.
JOS.9.6	Thus they came unto Joshua to the camp at Gilgal and said unto him and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country; now, therefore, make ye a covenant with us.
JOS.9.7	And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us, and how shall we make a covenant with you?
JOS.9.8	And they said unto Joshua, We are thy slaves. And Joshua said unto them, Who are you and where do you come from?
JOS.9.9	And they said unto him, From very far lands thy slaves are come because of the name of the 
JOS.9.10	and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side of the Jordan, and to Sihon, king of Heshbon, and to Og, king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.
JOS.9.11	Therefore, our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke to us, saying, Take provision with you for the journey and go to meet them and say unto them, We are your slaves; therefore, now make ye a covenant with us.
JOS.9.12	This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to come unto you, but now, behold, it is dry and mouldy.
JOS.9.13	These bottles of wine, we also filled new, and, behold, they are rent, and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey.
JOS.9.14	And the men of Israel took of their provision and did not ask counsel at the mouth of the 
JOS.9.15	And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them, to let them live; also the princes of the congregation swore unto them.
JOS.9.16	At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard how they were their neighbours and that they dwelt among them.
JOS.9.17	And the sons of Israel journeyed and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kirjathjearim.
JOS.9.18	And the sons of Israel did not smite them because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the 
JOS.9.19	But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the 
JOS.9.20	This we will do to them; we will let them live lest wrath come upon us because of the oath which we swore unto them.
JOS.9.21	And the princes said unto them, Let them live but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation, as the princes had said unto them.
JOS.9.22	And Joshua called for them, and spoke unto them saying, Why have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you, when ye dwell among us?
JOS.9.23	Now, therefore, ye are cursed, and ye shall always be slaves and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.
JOS.9.24	And they answered Joshua and said, Because it was certainly told thy slaves how the 
JOS.9.25	And now, behold, we are in thy hand; as it seems good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.
JOS.9.26	And so did he unto them; he delivered them out of the hand of the sons of Israel, so that they did not slay them.
JOS.9.27	And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the 
JOS.10.1	Now it came to pass when Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, heard how Joshua had taken Ai and that he had utterly destroyed it (as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king) and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them;
JOS.10.2	they feared greatly because Gibeon was a great city, as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all the men thereof were mighty.
JOS.10.3	Therefore Adonizedek, king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham, king of Hebron, and unto Piram, king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia, king of Lachish, and unto Debir, king of Eglon, saying,
JOS.10.4	Come up unto me and help me that we may smite Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.
JOS.10.5	Therefore, the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together and went up, they and all their hosts and encamped before Gibeon and made war against it.
JOS.10.6	And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal, saying, Slack not thy hand from thy slaves; come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together against us.
JOS.10.7	So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valour.
JOS.10.8	And the 
JOS.10.9	Joshua, therefore, came unto them suddenly, for he went up from Gilgal all night.
JOS.10.10	And the 
JOS.10.11	And when they were fleeing from before Israel in the descent to Bethhoron, the 
JOS.10.12	Then Joshua spoke unto the 
JOS.10.13	And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed until the nation had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of righteousness? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven and hastened not to go down about a whole day.
JOS.10.14	And there was no day like that before it or after it that the 
JOS.10.15	And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	But the five kings fled and hid themselves in a cave at Makkedah.
JOS.10.17	And it was told unto Joshua that the five kings had been found hidden in a cave at Makkedah.
JOS.10.18	Then Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave and set men by it to guard them;
JOS.10.19	and do not stop, but pursue after your enemies and smite their rearguard without allowing them to enter into their cities; for the 
JOS.10.20	And it came to pass when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished slaying them with a very great slaughter until they were consumed, that those who remained of them entered into strong cities.
JOS.10.21	And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace; there was no one to move his tongue against any of the sons of Israel.
JOS.10.22	Then Joshua said, Open the mouth of the cave and bring out those five kings unto me out of the cave.
JOS.10.23	And they did so and brought forth those five kings unto him out of the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.
JOS.10.24	And when they had brought those kings out unto Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said unto the captains of the men of war who went with him, Come near; put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them.
JOS.10.25	And Joshua said unto them, Do not fear, nor be dismayed, be strong and of good courage; for thus shall the 
JOS.10.26	And afterward Joshua smote them and slew them and caused them to be hanged on five trees; and they hung upon the trees until the evening.
JOS.10.27	And at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded that they take them down off the trees and cast them into the cave in which they had been hid, and they laid great stones in the cave’s mouth, which remain until this very day.
JOS.10.28	In that same day Joshua took Makkedah and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them and all the souls that were therein; he let no one remain; and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of Jericho.
JOS.10.29	Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him unto Libnah and fought against Libnah;
JOS.10.30	and the 
JOS.10.31	And Joshua passed from Libnah and all Israel with him unto Lachish and encamped against it and fought against it;
JOS.10.32	and the 
JOS.10.33	Then Horam, king of Gezer, came up to help Lachish, and Joshua smote him and his people until none of them were left.
JOS.10.34	And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon and all Israel with him, and they encamped against it and fought against it;
JOS.10.35	and they took it that same day and smote it with the edge of the sword, and all the souls that were in it he utterly destroyed that same day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
JOS.10.36	And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto Hebron; and they fought against it;
JOS.10.37	and they took it and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof and all the cities thereof and all the souls that were in it; he left no one remaining, according to all that he had done to Eglon, but destroyed it utterly and all the souls that were therein.
JOS.10.38	And Joshua returned and all Israel with him to Debir and fought against it;
JOS.10.39	and he took it and the king thereof and all the cities thereof, and they smote them with the edge of the sword and utterly destroyed all the souls that were in it; he left no one remaining; as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir and to the king thereof, as he had done also to Libnah and to her king.
JOS.10.40	So Joshua smote all the country of the hills and of the Negev and of the vale and of the springs and all their kings; he left no one remaining, but utterly destroyed all that breathed, as the 
JOS.10.41	And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza and all the country of Goshen even unto Gibeon.
JOS.10.42	All these kings and their lands Joshua took at one time because the 
JOS.10.43	And Joshua returned and all Israel with him unto the camp to Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	Hearing of this, Jabin, king of Hazor, sent a message unto Jobab, king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron and to the king of Achshaph
JOS.11.2	and to the kings that were on the north of the mountains and in the plain southward of Chinneroth and in the valley and in the borders of Dor to the west
JOS.11.3	and to the Canaanite on the east and on the west and to the Amorite and the Hittite and the Perizzite and the Jebusite in the mountains and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpeh.
JOS.11.4	And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, many people even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in multitude, with a great multitude of horses and chariots.
JOS.11.5	All these kings united, and as they came they gathered together the camps near the waters of Merom to fight against Israel.
JOS.11.6	But the 
JOS.11.7	So Joshua came against them with all the people of war and fell upon them suddenly by the waters of Merom.
JOS.11.8	And the 
JOS.11.9	And Joshua did unto them as the 
JOS.11.10	And Joshua at that time returned and took Hazor and smote the king thereof with the sword because Hazor had been the head of all those kingdoms before.
JOS.11.11	And they smote all the souls that were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was not any left to breathe; and he burnt Hazor with fire.
JOS.11.12	Likewise, Joshua took all the cities of those kings and all their kings and smote them with the edge of the sword, and he utterly destroyed them as Moses the slave of the 
JOS.11.13	But of all the cities that stood on their hills, Israel burned none of them, excepting Hazor only, which Joshua burned.
JOS.11.14	And all the spoil of these cities and the beasts, the sons of Israel took for themselves; but every man they smote with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, without leaving any that breathed.
JOS.11.15	As the 
JOS.11.16	So Joshua took all that land, the mountains and all the region of the Negev and all the land of Goshen and the valleys and the plains and the mountain of Israel and its valleys.
JOS.11.17	Even from Mount Halak that goes up unto Seir unto Baalgad in the plains of Lebanon at the roots of Mount Hermon; likewise he took all their kings and smote them and slew them.
JOS.11.18	Joshua made war many days with all those kings.
JOS.11.19	There was not a city that made peace with the sons of Israel except the Hivites, the inhabitants of Gibeon; they took all the others in battle.
JOS.11.20	For it was of the 
JOS.11.21	Also at the same time Joshua came and cut off the Anakims from the mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel; Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.
JOS.11.22	There were none of the Anakims left in the land of the sons of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there remained.
JOS.11.23	So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the 
JOS.12.1	Now these are the kings of the land which the sons of Israel smote and possessed their land on the other side of the Jordan toward the rising of the sun from the river Arnon unto Mount Hermon and all the plain on the east:
JOS.12.2	Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and from the midst of the river and from half of Gilead, even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the sons of Ammon,
JOS.12.3	and from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east and unto the sea of the plain, the salt sea on the east, by the way to Bethjeshimoth, and from the Negev, under Ashdothpisgah.
JOS.12.4	And the borders of Og, king of Bashan, who was of the remnant of the Rephaim, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,
JOS.12.5	and reigned in Mount Hermon and in Salcah and in all Bashan unto the borders of the Geshur and Maachath and half of Gilead, the border of Sihon, king of Heshbon.
JOS.12.6	These did Moses, the slave of the 
JOS.12.7	And these are the kings of the land which Joshua and the sons of Israel smote on this side of the Jordan on the west from Baalgad in the plains of Lebanon even unto Mount Halak that goes up to Seir, which Joshua gave unto the tribes of Israel for a possession according to their divisions,
JOS.12.8	in the mountains and in the valleys and in the plains and in the springs and in the wilderness and towards the Negev: the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
JOS.12.9	the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, another;
JOS.12.10	the king of Jerusalem, another; the king of Hebron, another;
JOS.12.11	the king of Jarmuth, another; the king of Lachish, another;
JOS.12.12	the king of Eglon, another; the king of Gezer, another;
JOS.12.13	the king of Debir, another; the king of Geder, another;
JOS.12.14	the king of Hormah, another; the king of Arad, another;
JOS.12.15	the king of Libnah, another; the king of Adullam, another;
JOS.12.16	the king of Makkedah, another; the king of Bethel, another;
JOS.12.17	the king of Tappuah, another; the king of Hepher, another;
JOS.12.18	the king of Aphek, another; the king of Lasharon, another;
JOS.12.19	the king of Madon, another; the king of Hazor, another;
JOS.12.20	the king of Shimronmeron (Samaria), another; the king of Achshaph, another;
JOS.12.21	the king of Taanach, another; the king of Megiddo, another;
JOS.12.22	the king of Kedesh, another; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, another;
JOS.12.23	the king of Dor in the province of Dor, another; the king of the Gentiles in Gilgal, another;
JOS.12.24	the king of Tirzah, another; thirty-one kings in all.
JOS.13.1	Now when Joshua was old and advanced in years, the 
JOS.13.2	This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines and all Geshuri
JOS.13.3	from the Nile, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron northward, which is counted among the Canaanites; five cardinals of the Philistines; the Gazathites and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites, also the Avites;
JOS.13.4	towards the Negev all the land of the Canaanites and Mearah that is beside those of Sidon unto Aphek to the border of the Amorite;
JOS.13.5	and the land of the Giblites and all Lebanon toward the sunrising, from Baalgad at the root of Mount Hermon unto the entering into Hamath.
JOS.13.6	All the inhabitants of the mountains from Lebanon unto the hot springs and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out from before the sons of Israel; only thou shalt divide the country by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded thee.
JOS.13.7	Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the nine tribes and the half tribe of Manasseh,
JOS.13.8	for the other half received their inheritance with the Reubenites and the Gadites, which Moses gave them of the other side of the Jordan eastward, according as Moses the slave of the 
JOS.13.9	from Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon;
JOS.13.10	and all the cities of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the borders of the sons of Ammon;
JOS.13.11	and Gilead and the borders of the Geshur and Maachath and all Mount Hermon and all Bashan unto Salcah;
JOS.13.12	all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the Rephaim, for these did Moses smite and cast them out of the land.
JOS.13.13	Nevertheless, the sons of Israel did not expel those of Geshur and Maachath, but Geshur {Heb. the proud beholder} and Maachath {Heb. the oppressor} dwell among the Israelites until this day.
JOS.13.14	But unto the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the sacrifices on fire of the 
JOS.13.15	And Moses gave unto the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families,
JOS.13.16	and their border was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river and all the plain until Medeba,
JOS.13.17	Heshbon and all her cities that are in the plain, Dibon, and Bamothbaal and Bethbaalmeon,
JOS.13.18	and Jahazah and Kedemoth and Mephaath,
JOS.13.19	and Kirjathaim and Sibmah and Zarethshahar in the mount of the valley, {Emec}
JOS.13.20	and Bethpeor and Ashdothpisgah and Bethjeshimoth,
JOS.13.21	and all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur and Hur and Reba, who were princes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.
JOS.13.22	Balaam also, the son of Beor, the diviner, did the sons of Israel slay with the sword among those that were slain by them.
JOS.13.23	And the border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan and the border thereof. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, these cities with their villages.
JOS.13.24	Moses likewise gave unto the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad according to their families.
JOS.13.25	And their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead and half of the land of the sons of Ammon, unto Aroer that is before Rabbah,
JOS.13.26	and from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim, and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir,
JOS.13.27	and the valley of Betharam and Bethnimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon, king of Heshbon, the Jordan and its border, even unto the edge of the sea of Chinnereth on the other side of the Jordan eastward.
JOS.13.28	This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, these cities with their villages.
JOS.13.29	And Moses also gave unto the half tribe of Manasseh, and it belonged to the half tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families.
JOS.13.30	Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities.
JOS.13.31	And half of Gilead and Ashtaroth and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were given to the sons of Machir, the son of Manasseh, even to one half of the sons of Machir, according to their families.
JOS.13.32	This is what Moses distributed in inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side of the Jordan of Jericho, eastward.
JOS.13.33	But to the tribe of Levi Moses did not give any inheritance; the 
JOS.14.1	This is the inheritance of the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel, distributed unto them.
JOS.14.2	Their inheritance was by lot, as the 
JOS.14.3	For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and half a tribe on the other side of the Jordan, but unto the Levites he gave no inheritance among them.
JOS.14.4	For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and they gave no part unto the Levites in the land except cities to dwell in with their suburbs for their livestock and for their substance.
JOS.14.5	As the 
JOS.14.6	Then the sons of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, said unto him, Thou knowest the thing that the 
JOS.14.7	I was forty years old when Moses, the slave of the 
JOS.14.8	but my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt; but I entirely followed the 
JOS.14.9	And Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land on which thy feet have trodden shall be thy inheritance and thy sons’ for ever because thou hast entirely followed the 
JOS.14.10	And now, behold, the 
JOS.14.11	As yet I am as strong today as I was in the day that Moses sent me; as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war and to go out and to come in.
JOS.14.12	Now, therefore, give me this mountain, of which the 
JOS.14.13	Then Joshua blessed him and gave unto Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, Hebron as inheritance.
JOS.14.14	Hebron, therefore, became the inheritance of Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, unto this day because he entirely followed the 
JOS.14.15	And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; Arba had been a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.
JOS.15.1	This then was the lot of the tribe of the sons of Judah by their families: next to the border of Edom, of the wilderness of Zin towards the Negev on the south side.
JOS.15.2	And their border on the side of the Negev was from the shore of the salt sea from the bay that looks toward the Negev;
JOS.15.3	and it went out towards the Negev to the ascent to Acrabbim passing unto Zin and ascending up by the Negev unto Kadeshbarnea past Hezron and going up by Adar, it went around to Karkaa,
JOS.15.4	from there it passed toward Azmon and went out unto the river of Egypt, and this border goes out to the western sea. This shall be your border of the Negev.
JOS.15.5	And the east border is the salt sea, even unto the end of the Jordan. And the border in the north quarter, from the bay of the sea, from the end of the Jordan,
JOS.15.6	and this border goes up to Bethhogla and passes along by the north of Betharabah, and from here this border goes up to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben.
JOS.15.7	And this border goes back up to Debir from the valley of Achor and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the ascent to Adummim, which is towards the Negev of the river, and this border passes the waters of Enshemesh and comes out at the fount of Rogel;
JOS.15.8	and this border goes up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto the side of the Jebusite towards the Negev; this is Jerusalem. Then this border goes up to the top of the mountain that is before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the valley of the giants northward;
JOS.15.9	and this border comes around from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah and goes out to the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border goes around to Baalah, which is Kirjathjearim.
JOS.15.10	After this, the border turns from Baalah westward unto Mount Seir and passes to the side of Mount Jearim, which is Chesalon, on the north side, and descends to Bethshemesh and passes on to Timnah.
JOS.15.11	Then this border goes out to the side of Ekron northward; and the same border comes around to Shicron and passes by Mount Baalah and goes out to Jabneel; and this border comes out to the sea.
JOS.15.12	And the west border is the great sea. This is the border of the sons of Judah round about according to their families.
JOS.15.13	And unto Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, he gave a part among the sons of Judah, according to the commandment of the 
JOS.15.14	And Caleb drove from there the three sons of Anak, Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the sons of Anak.
JOS.15.15	From there he went up to the inhabitants of Debir, and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.
JOS.15.16	And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
JOS.15.17	And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
JOS.15.18	And it came to pass when he was taking her, he persuaded her to ask of her father for land to cultivate. Then she lighted off her ass, and Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?
JOS.15.19	And she answered, Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a dry land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
JOS.15.20	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families.
JOS.15.21	And these were the cities in the border of the tribe of the sons of Judah towards the border of Edom towards the Negev: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
JOS.15.22	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
JOS.15.23	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,

JOS.15.42	Libnah, Ether, Ashan,
JOS.15.43	Jiphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
JOS.15.44	Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah: nine cities with their villages:
JOS.15.45	Ekron, with her towns and her villages.
JOS.15.46	From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with their villages:
JOS.15.47	Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns and her villages, unto the river of Egypt and the great sea and the border thereof;
JOS.15.48	And in the mountains, Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
JOS.15.49	Dannah, Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,
JOS.15.50	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,

JOS.15.61	in the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, Secacah,
JOS.15.62	Nibshan, the city of Salt, and Engedi: six cities with their villages.
JOS.15.63	As for the Jebusites who inhabit Jerusalem, the sons of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusite remains in Jerusalem with the sons of Judah unto this day.
JOS.16.1	And the lot of the sons of Joseph fell from the Jordan of Jericho unto the water of Jericho towards the east to the wilderness that goes up from Jericho to Mount Bethel,
JOS.16.2	and from Bethel going to Luz and passing the border of Archi in Ataroth,
JOS.16.3	and turns to descend to the westward sea to the border of Japhleti until the border of Bethhoron the lower, and to Gezer, and comes out at the sea.
JOS.16.4	So the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance.
JOS.16.5	And this was the border of the sons of Ephraim according to their families; this was the border of their inheritance on the east side from Atarothaddar unto Bethhoron the upper;
JOS.16.6	and this border comes out to the sea and to Michmethah on the north side; and this border goes around eastward unto Taanathshiloh and from here passes on the east to Janohah;
JOS.16.7	and from Janohah it goes down to Ataroth and to Naarath, and touches in Jericho and comes out at the Jordan.
JOS.16.8	And from Tappuah this border turns towards the westward sea at the river Kanah and comes out at the sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim by their families.
JOS.16.9	There were also cities separated for the sons of Ephraim among the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.
JOS.16.10	And they did not drive out the Canaanite that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanite remained in the midst of Ephraim unto this day and served under tribute.
JOS.17.1	There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the firstborn of Joseph. Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh and father of Gilead, who was a man of war, had Gilead and Bashan.
JOS.17.2	There was also a lot for the rest of the sons of Manasseh by their families: for the sons of Abiezer and for the sons of Helek and for the sons of Asriel and for the sons of Shechem, and for the sons of Hepher and for the sons of Shemida: these were the male sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, by their families.
JOS.17.3	But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters, and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
JOS.17.4	And they came near before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua, the son of Nun, and before the princes and said, The 
JOS.17.5	And there fell ten portions to Manasseh besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side of the Jordan,
JOS.17.6	because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons; and the rest of Manasseh’s sons had the land of Gilead.
JOS.17.7	And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, which is before Shechem; and this border goes along on the right hand to the inhabitants of Entappuah.
JOS.17.8	Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah; but the Tappuah next to the border of Manasseh belongs to the sons of Ephraim;
JOS.17.9	And this border descends to the river Kanah towards the Negev of the river. These cities of Ephraim are among the cities of Manasseh; and the border of Manasseh is from the north side of the same river, and it comes out at the sea.
JOS.17.10	Ephraim towards the Negev and Manasseh to the north and the sea is his border; and they meet with Asher on the side of the north and with Issachar to the east.
JOS.17.11	And Manasseh also had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her towns and Ibleam and her towns and the inhabitants of Dor and her towns and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns and the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns and the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns, three provinces.
JOS.17.12	But the sons of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those cities; to the contrary the Canaanite desired to dwell in that land.
JOS.17.13	Yet it came to pass when the sons of Israel waxed strong that they put the Canaanite under tribute, but did not utterly drive them out.
JOS.17.14	And the sons of Joseph spoke unto Joshua, saying, Why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I am a great people and that the 
JOS.17.15	And Joshua answered them, If thou art such a great people, then go up to the forest and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzite and of the giants, if mountain of Ephraim is too narrow for thee.
JOS.17.16	And the sons of Joseph said, This mountain is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron, both those who are in Bethshean and her towns, and those who are in the valley of Jezreel.
JOS.17.17	Then Joshua replied unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people and hast great strength; thou shalt not have only one lot;
JOS.17.18	but that mountain shall be thine, for it is a forest, and thou shalt cut it down, and the borders of it shall be thine; for thou shalt drive out the Canaanite, though he has iron chariots and though he is strong.
JOS.18.1	And the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled together at Shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the testimony there after the land was subdued before them.
JOS.18.2	And there remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not yet received their inheritance.
JOS.18.3	And Joshua said unto the sons of Israel, How long shall ye be negligent to go to possess the land, which the 
JOS.18.4	Indicate from among you three men for each tribe that I may send them and let them arise and walk through the land and draw it according to its inheritances; and they shall return unto me.
JOS.18.5	And they shall divide it into seven parts; Judah shall abide in their borders towards the Negev, and the house of Joseph shall abide in their borders on the north.
JOS.18.6	Ye shall therefore draw up the land into seven parts and bring the description here that I may cast lots for you here before the 
JOS.18.7	But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of the 
JOS.18.8	And the men arose and went away; and Joshua charged those that went to draw the land, saying unto them, Go and walk through the land and draw it up and return to me that I may cast lots for you here before the 
JOS.18.9	And those men went and passed through the land, drawing it by cities into seven parts in a book and came again to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.
JOS.18.10	And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the 
JOS.18.11	And the lot of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families; and the border of their lot came forth between the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph.
JOS.18.12	And their border on the side of the north was from the Jordan and that border goes up beside Jericho on the north side and up to the mountain westward and comes out at the wilderness of Bethaven;
JOS.18.13	and from there that border passes through Luz, by the side of Luz (which is Bethel) towards the Negev. And this border descends from Atarothadar to the mountain that is towards the Negev of the lower Bethhoron.
JOS.18.14	And this border turns and compasses the side of the sea towards the Negev unto the mountain that is before Bethhoron towards the Negev, and it comes out at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the sons of Judah. This is the west quarter.
JOS.18.15	And the side of the Negev is from the end of Kirjathjearim, and the border goes out to the west and comes out at the well of waters of Nephtoah,
JOS.18.16	and this border descends to the end of the mountain that is before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is in the valley of the giants to the north, and descends then to the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite towards the Negev and from there descends to the fountain of Rogel,
JOS.18.17	and from the north it turns and goes to Enshemesh and from there goes to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent to Adummim, and descends to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben
JOS.18.18	and passes along toward the side over against the valley of the north and descends to the plain;
JOS.18.19	and this border turns to pass to the side of Bethhoglah northward, and the border comes out at the north bay of the salt sea at the end of the Jordan towards the Negev. This is the border towards the Negev.
JOS.18.20	And Jordan finishes this border on the east side. This is the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, by the borders thereof round about, according to their families.
JOS.18.21	Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Bethhoglah, the valley of Keziz,
JOS.18.22	Betharabah, Zemaraim, Bethel,
JOS.18.23	Avim, Parah, Ophrah,

JOS.19.1	And the second lot came forth to Simeon, for the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families; and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the sons of Judah.

JOS.19.7	Ain, Remmon, Ether, and Ashan: four cities and their villages,
JOS.19.8	with all the villages that were round about these cities unto Baalathbeer, which is Ramath of the Negev. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families.
JOS.19.9	Out of the portion of the sons of Judah was taken the inheritance of the sons of Simeon; for the part of the sons of Judah was too much for them; therefore, the sons of Simeon had their inheritance within the inheritance of Judah.
JOS.19.10	The third lot came up for the sons of Zebulun according to their families, and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid.
JOS.19.11	And their border goes up towards the sea and to Maralah and reaches unto Dabbasheth and from there comes to the river that is before Jokneam,
JOS.19.12	and turning from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising to the border of Chislothtabor and then goes out to Daberath and up to Japhia,
JOS.19.13	and from there passes eastward toward the sunrising to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goes out to Remmonmethoar around Neah;

JOS.19.22	and this border reaches to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and their border comes out to the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages.
JOS.19.23	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, these cities with their villages.

JOS.19.30	including Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two cities with their villages.

JOS.19.32	The sixth lot came out to the sons of Naphtali, for the sons of Naphtali according to their families.
JOS.19.33	And their border was from Heleph, Allon, Zaanannim, Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum, and comes out at the Jordan,
JOS.19.34	and turning westward this border goes to Aznothtabor and passes from there to Hukkok and reaches to Zebulun towards the Negev and reaches to Asher on the west side and to Judah upon the Jordan toward the sunrising.

JOS.19.46	Mejarkon, Rakkon, with the border before Joppa.
JOS.19.47	And the border of the sons of Dan went out too little for them; therefore, the sons of Dan went up to fight against Leshem and took it and smote it with the edge of the sword and possessed it and dwelt therein and called Leshem, Dan, after the name of Dan their father.
JOS.19.48	This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families, these cities with their villages.
JOS.19.49	Thus they finished dividing the land in inheritance by their borders, and the sons of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in their midst.
JOS.19.50	According to the word of the 
JOS.19.51	These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the 
JOS.20.1	And the 
JOS.20.2	Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, Appoint the cities of refuge, of which I spoke unto you by the hand of Moses,
JOS.20.3	so that the manslayer who kills any person in error and without knowledge may flee there, and they shall be your refuge from the avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood.
JOS.20.4	And he that flees unto one of these cities shall present himself at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city; they shall receive him into the city among them and give him a place, that he may dwell among them.
JOS.20.5	And when the avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood pursues after him, they shall not deliver the manslayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbour by error, nor did he have enmity with him before.
JOS.20.6	And he shall dwell in that city until he stands before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days; then shall the manslayer return, and come unto his own city and unto his own house unto the city from where he fled.
JOS.20.7	Then they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in the mountain of Naphtali and Shechem in the mountain of Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah.
JOS.20.8	And on the other side of the Jordan of Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the tribe of Reuben and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.
JOS.20.9	These were the cities appointed for all the sons of Israel and for the stranger that sojourns among them that anyone who kills any person by error might flee there and not die by the hand of the avenger {Heb. redeemer} of blood until he stands before the congregation.
JOS.21.1	Then the heads of the fathers of the Levites came near unto Eleazar the priest and unto Joshua, the son of Nun, and unto the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel;
JOS.21.2	and they spoke unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, The 
JOS.21.3	Then the sons of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their possessions, according to the word of the 
JOS.21.4	And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites; and the sons of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites, had by lot out of the tribe of Judah and out of the tribe of Simeon and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.
JOS.21.5	And the rest of the sons of Kohath had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Ephraim and out of the tribe of Dan and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.
JOS.21.6	And the sons of Gershon had by lot out of the families of the tribe of Issachar and out of the tribe of Asher and out of the tribe of Naphtali and out of the half tribe of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.
JOS.21.7	The sons of Merari by their families had out of the tribe of Reuben and out of the tribe of Gad and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.
JOS.21.8	Thus the sons of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these cities with their suburbs, as the 
JOS.21.9	And they gave out of the tribe of the sons of Judah and out of the tribe of the sons of Simeon these cities which are here mentioned by name;
JOS.21.10	and the first lot was of the sons of Aaron, of the family of Kohath, of the sons of Levi;
JOS.21.11	and they gave them the city of Arba of the father of Anak, which is Hebron, in the mountain of Judah, with its suburbs round about.
JOS.21.12	But the fields of the city and the villages thereof, they gave to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.
JOS.21.13	Thus they gave to the sons of Aaron the priest Hebron with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for manslayers and Libnah with its suburbs
JOS.21.14	and Jattir with its suburbs and Eshtemoa with its suburbs
JOS.21.15	and Holon with its suburbs and Debir with its suburbs
JOS.21.16	and Ain with its suburbs and Juttah with its suburbs and Bethshemesh with its suburbs: nine cities out of those two tribes.
JOS.21.17	And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs, Geba with its suburbs,
JOS.21.18	Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs: four cities.
JOS.21.19	All these cities of the priests, the sons of Aaron, are thirteen cities with their suburbs.
JOS.21.20	But the families of the sons of Kohath, Levites, those who remained of the sons of Kohath, received cities by lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.
JOS.21.21	For they gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the mountain of Ephraim, to be a city of refuge for manslayers, and Gezer with its suburbs,
JOS.21.22	Kibzaim with its suburbs, Bethhoron with its suburbs: four cities.
JOS.21.23	And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its suburbs, Gibbethon with its suburbs,

JOS.21.25	And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with its suburbs and Gathrimmon with its suburbs: two cities.
JOS.21.26	All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the remaining families of the sons of Kohath.
JOS.21.27	And unto the sons of Gershon, of the families of the Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave Golan in Bashan with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for manslayers, and Beeshterah with its suburbs: two cities.
JOS.21.28	And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with its suburbs, Dabareh with its suburbs,
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth with its suburbs, Engannim with its suburbs: four cities.
JOS.21.30	And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs, Abdon with its suburbs,
JOS.21.31	Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs: four cities.
JOS.21.32	And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for manslayers, and Hammothdor with its suburbs and Kartan with its suburbs: three cities.
JOS.21.33	All the cities of those of Gershon according to their families were thirteen cities with their suburbs.
JOS.21.34	And unto the families of the sons of Merari, Levites that remained, out of the tribe of Zebulun they gave them, Jokneam with its suburbs and Kartah with its suburbs,
JOS.21.35	Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs: four cities.
JOS.21.36	And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer and Jahazah,
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth, and Mephaath: four cities.
JOS.21.38	And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs, to be a city of refuge for manslayers; and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
JOS.21.39	Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs; four cities in all.
JOS.21.40	So all the cities for the sons of Merari by their families, who remained of the families of the Levites, were by their lot twelve cities.
JOS.21.41	All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their suburbs.
JOS.21.42	Each one of these cities were separated with their suburbs round about them; thus were all these cities.
JOS.21.43	Thus the 
JOS.21.44	And the 
JOS.21.45	There failed not a word of all the good things which the 
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half tribe of Manasseh
JOS.22.2	and said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the slave of the 
JOS.22.3	Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day but have kept the charge of the commandment of the 
JOS.22.4	And now the 
JOS.22.5	Only that with diligence ye keep yourselves doing the commandment and the law, which Moses, the slave of the 
JOS.22.6	So Joshua, blessing them, sent them; and they went unto their tents.
JOS.22.7	Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given possession in Bashan; but unto the other half Joshua gave inheritance among their brethren on this side of the Jordan to the west. And Joshua also sent these to their tents, after having blessed them,
JOS.22.8	And he spoke unto them, saying, Return with great riches unto your tents and with a great amount of cattle with silver, with gold, with brass, with iron, and with very much clothing; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.
JOS.22.9	And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh returned, departing from the sons of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their possession, of which they were the possessors, according to the word of the 
JOS.22.10	And when they came unto the borders of the Jordan, which is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh built an altar there next to the Jordan, a great altar to look upon.
JOS.22.11	And the sons of Israel heard it said, Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the borders of the Jordan, at the passage of the sons of Israel.
JOS.22.12	And when the sons of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the sons of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.
JOS.22.13	And the sons of Israel sent unto the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half tribe of Manasseh into the land of Gilead, Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest,
JOS.22.14	and with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was the head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.
JOS.22.15	And they came unto the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the half tribe of Manasseh unto the land of Gilead, and they spoke with them, saying,
JOS.22.16	Thus saith the whole congregation of the 
JOS.22.17	Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, for which there was a plague in the congregation of the 
JOS.22.18	And ye turn away this day from following the 
JOS.22.19	If the land of your possession seems unto you to be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the 
JOS.22.20	Peradventure did Achan, the son of Zerah, not commit a trespass in the anathema, and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his iniquity.
JOS.22.21	Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel,
JOS.22.22	The 
JOS.22.23	that we have built us an altar to turn from following the 
JOS.22.24	likewise, if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, Peradventure tomorrow your children shall speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the 
JOS.22.25	The 
JOS.22.26	Therefore we said, Let us now work to build us an altar, not for burnt offering nor for sacrifice,
JOS.22.27	but that it may be a witness between us and you and our generations after us, to do the service of the 
JOS.22.28	Therefore we said, that it shall be, if they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may reply, Behold the pattern of the altar of the 
JOS.22.29	Let it never happen that we should rebel against the 
JOS.22.30	And when Phinehas the priest and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them.
JOS.22.31	And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said unto the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the 
JOS.22.32	And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes, returned from the sons of Reuben and from the sons of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel and brought them word again.
JOS.22.33	And the thing pleased the sons of Israel; and the sons of Israel blessed God and did not speak again of going up against them in battle to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and Gad dwelt.
JOS.22.34	And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar Ed; for it is a witness between us that the 
JOS.23.1	And it came to pass many days after the 
JOS.23.2	And Joshua called for all Israel and for their elders and for their princes and for their judges and for their officers and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age;
JOS.23.3	and ye have seen all that the 
JOS.23.4	Behold, I have divided unto you as inheritance unto your tribes all these Gentiles, those that remain as well as those that are destroyed, from the Jordan unto the great sea towards the going down of the sun.
JOS.23.5	And the 
JOS.23.6	Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses without turning aside to the right hand or to the left
JOS.23.7	that ye not enter in among these Gentiles that remain among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them,
JOS.23.8	but cleave unto the 
JOS.23.9	For the 
JOS.23.10	One man of you has chased a thousand; for the 
JOS.23.11	Therefore take heed for your souls that ye love the 
JOS.23.12	Because if ye do in any wise go back and cleave unto the remnant of these Gentiles that remain among you and shall make marriages with them and go in unto them and they to you,
JOS.23.13	know for a certainty that the 
JOS.23.14	And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth and ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one word has failed of all the good things which the 
JOS.23.15	Therefore it shall come to pass that as all the good things are come upon you, which the 
JOS.23.16	when ye shall transgress the covenant of the 
JOS.24.1	And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem and called for the elders of Israel and for their princes and for their judges and for their officers, and they presented themselves before God.
JOS.24.2	And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the 
JOS.24.3	And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the river and led him throughout all the land of Canaan and multiplied his generation and gave him Isaac.
JOS.24.4	And to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave Mount Seir to possess it; but Jacob and his sons went down into Egypt.
JOS.24.5	I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to that which I did among them; and afterward I brought you out.
JOS.24.6	And I brought your fathers out of Egypt; and when ye came to the sea, the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.
JOS.24.7	And when they cried unto the 
JOS.24.8	And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who dwelt on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you, but I delivered them into your hands that ye might possess their land, and I destroyed them from before you.
JOS.24.9	Then Balak, the son of Zippor, king of the Moabites, arose and warred against Israel and sent and called Balaam, the son of Beor, to curse you.
JOS.24.10	But I would not hearken unto Balaam; to the contrary, he blessed you repeatedly, and I delivered you out of his hand.
JOS.24.11	And ye passed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the lords of Jericho fought against you: the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered them into your hands.
JOS.24.12	And I sent hornets before you, which drove them out from before you, even the two kings of the Amorites, but not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
JOS.24.13	And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour and cities which ye did not build, and ye dwell in them and eat of vineyards and oliveyards which ye did not plant.
JOS.24.14	Now therefore fear the 
JOS.24.15	And if it seems evil unto you to serve the 
JOS.24.16	Then the people answered and said, May it never happen that we should forsake the 
JOS.24.17	For the 
JOS.24.18	And the 
JOS.24.19	Then Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the 
JOS.24.20	If ye forsake the 
JOS.24.21	And the people said unto Joshua, No, but we will serve the 
JOS.24.22	And Joshua said unto the people, Ye shall be witnesses against yourselves that ye have chosen the 
JOS.24.23	Now, therefore, take away, the strange gods which are among you and incline your heart unto the 
JOS.24.24	And the people replied unto Joshua, We will serve the 
JOS.24.25	So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day and set them statutes and laws in Shechem.
JOS.24.26	And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God, and taking a great stone, he set it up there under an oak that was in the sanctuary of the 
JOS.24.27	And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall be a witness unto us, for it has heard all the words of the 
JOS.24.28	So Joshua sent the people, each one unto his inheritance.
JOS.24.29	And after these things, Joshua, the son of Nun, the slave of the 
JOS.24.30	And they buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah, which is in Mount Ephraim, on the north side of the Mountain of Gaash.
JOS.24.31	And Israel served the 
JOS.24.32	And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem in the part of the field which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for one hundred ewes, and it became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph.
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar, the son of Aaron, died, and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas, his son, which was given to him in the mountain of Ephraim.
JDG.1.1	Now after the death of Joshua, it came to pass that the sons of Israel asked the 
JDG.1.2	And the 
JDG.1.3	And Judah said unto Simeon, his brother, Come up with me into my lot that we may fight against the Canaanite; and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.
JDG.1.4	And Judah went up; and the 
JDG.1.5	And they found Adonibezek in Bezek, and they fought against him, and they slew the Canaanite and the Perizzite.
JDG.1.6	But Adonibezek fled, and they pursued after him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.
JDG.1.7	And Adonibezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered crumbs under my table; as I have done, so God has recompensed me. And they put him into Jerusalem, and there he died.
JDG.1.8	Now the sons of Judah had fought against Jerusalem and had taken it and smitten it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.
JDG.1.9	And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanite that dwelt in the mountains and in the Negev and in the plains.
JDG.1.10	And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba), and they slew Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
JDG.1.11	And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir (and the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher).
JDG.1.12	And Caleb said, He that smites Kirjathsepher and takes it, to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.
JDG.1.13	And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.
JDG.1.14	And it came to pass when he took her that he persuaded her to ask her father for land to cultivate. And she lighted from off her ass, and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?
JDG.1.15	And she said unto him, Give me a blessing, for thou hast given me a dry land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
JDG.1.16	And the sons of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah which is towards the Negev of Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.
JDG.1.17	And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the Canaanite that inhabited Zephath and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.
JDG.1.18	Also Judah took Gaza with its border and Askelon with its border and Ekron with its border.
JDG.1.19	And the 
JDG.1.20	And they gave Hebron unto Caleb as Moses had said, and he expelled from there the three sons of Anak.
JDG.1.21	And the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem; thus the Jebusites dwell with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.
JDG.1.22	And also those of the house of Joseph went up against Bethel, and the 
JDG.1.23	And those of the house of Joseph put spies in Bethel (Now the name of the city before was Luz).
JDG.1.24	And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said unto him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will show thee mercy.
JDG.1.25	And when he showed them the entrance into the city, they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man go and all his family.
JDG.1.26	And the man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and called the name of it Luz, which is its name unto this day.
JDG.1.27	Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and its towns nor Taanach and its towns nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; but the Canaanite desired to dwell in that land.
JDG.1.28	And it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites under tribute but did not utterly drive them out.
JDG.1.29	Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanite that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanite dwelt in Gezer among them.
JDG.1.30	Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron nor the inhabitants of Nahalol, but the Canaanite dwelt among them and became tributaries.
JDG.1.31	Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho nor the inhabitants of Zidon nor of Ahlab nor of Achzib nor of Helbah nor of Aphik nor of Rehob;
JDG.1.32	to the contrary Asher dwelt among the Canaanites that inhabited the land, for they did not drive them out.
JDG.1.33	Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh nor the inhabitants of Bethanath, but he dwelt among the Canaanites that inhabited the land; nevertheless, the inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.
JDG.1.34	And the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the mountain, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley.
JDG.1.35	And the Amorites desired to dwell in Mount Heres in Aijalon and in Shaalbim; yet when the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, they made them tributaries.
JDG.1.36	And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent to Akrabbim from the rock and upward.
JDG.2.1	And the angel of the 
JDG.2.2	as long as ye make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; to the contrary, ye shall throw down their altars, but ye have not heard my voice; why have ye done this?
JDG.2.3	Therefore, I also said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare unto you.
JDG.2.4	And when the angel of the 
JDG.2.5	And they called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there unto the 
JDG.2.6	For Joshua had let the people go, and the sons of Israel had each gone unto his inheritance to possess the land.
JDG.2.7	And the people had served the 
JDG.2.8	And Joshua, the son of Nun, the slave of the 
JDG.2.9	And they buried him within the border of his inheritance in Timnathheres in the mount of Ephraim on the north side of the mount of Gaash.
JDG.2.10	And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers, and there arose another generation after them which did not know the 
JDG.2.11	And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.2.12	And they forsook the 
JDG.2.13	And they forsook the 
JDG.2.14	And the anger of the 
JDG.2.15	Wherever they went out, the hand of the 
JDG.2.16	Nevertheless, the 
JDG.2.17	And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they fornicated after other gods and bowed themselves unto them; they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers had walked hearing the commandments of the 
JDG.2.18	And when the 
JDG.2.19	But when the judge was dead, then they would return, and corrupt themselves more than their fathers in following other gods to serve them and to bow down unto them; they did not diminish from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.
JDG.2.20	And the anger of the 
JDG.2.21	neither will I drive out any longer from before them any of these Gentiles which Joshua left when he died,
JDG.2.22	that through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of the 
JDG.2.23	Therefore, the 
JDG.3.1	Now these are the Gentiles which the 
JDG.3.2	he left them only that the generations of the sons of Israel might know, and to teach them war, only for those that had known nothing before:
JDG.3.3	namely, five cardinals of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites that dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
JDG.3.4	These, therefore, were left to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the 
JDG.3.5	And as the sons of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,
JDG.3.6	they took their daughters to be their wives and gave their daughters to their sons and served their gods.
JDG.3.7	And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.3.8	Therefore the anger of the 
JDG.3.9	And when the sons of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.3.10	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.3.11	And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, died.
JDG.3.12	And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.3.13	And he gathered unto him the sons of Ammon and of Amalek and went and smote Israel and took the city of palm trees.
JDG.3.14	So the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	But when the sons of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.3.16	But Ehud had made himself a two-edged sword of a cubit length, and he girded it under his clothing upon his right thigh.
JDG.3.17	And he brought the present unto Eglon, king of Moab, and Eglon was a very fat man.
JDG.3.18	And when he had offered the present, he sent away the people that had brought the present.
JDG.3.19	But he, himself turned again from the graven images that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret word for thee, O king, who then said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
JDG.3.20	And Ehud came unto him, and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a word from God unto thee. Then he arose out of his seat.
JDG.3.21	But Ehud put forth his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh and thrust it into Eglon’s belly;
JDG.3.22	in such a manner that the haft also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly, and the excrement came out.
JDG.3.23	Then Ehud went forth through the porch and shut the doors of the parlour upon him and locked them.
JDG.3.24	When he was gone out, his slaves came; and when they saw that the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Peradventure he covers his feet in his summer chamber.
JDG.3.25	And having waited until they were confounded and he had not opened the doors of the parlour; therefore, they took a key and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
JDG.3.26	But while they had waited, Ehud escaped and passed beyond the graven images and escaped unto Seirath.
JDG.3.27	And as he entered in, he blew the shofar in the mountain of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
JDG.3.28	Then he said unto them, Follow after me, for the 
JDG.3.29	And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all fat, and all men of war, and there escaped not a man.
JDG.3.30	So Moab was subjected that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.
JDG.3.31	And after him was Shamgar, the son of Anath, who slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad, and he also saved Israel.
JDG.4.1	But the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.4.2	And the 
JDG.4.3	And the sons of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.4.4	And a woman judged Israel at that time, Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth.
JDG.4.5	This Deborah dwelt under a palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in Mount Ephraim, and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.
JDG.4.6	And she sent and called Barak, the son of Abinoam, out of Kedesh of Naphtali and said unto him, Has not the 
JDG.4.7	And I will draw Sisera, the captain of Jabin’s army, unto thee to the river Kishon, with his chariots and his multitude, and I will deliver him into thy hands.
JDG.4.8	And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go; but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.
JDG.4.9	And she said, I will surely go with thee, but thy honour shall not be in the way that thou goest; for the 
JDG.4.10	And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he went up with ten thousand men on foot, and Deborah went up with him.
JDG.4.11	Now Heber, the Kenite, of the sons of Hobab, the father-in-law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.
JDG.4.12	And the news came unto Sisera that Barak, the son of Abinoam, was gone up to Mount Tabor.
JDG.4.13	And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.
JDG.4.14	Then Deborah said unto Barak, Rise up, for this is the day in which the 
JDG.4.15	And the 
JDG.4.16	But Barak pursued after the chariots and after the host unto Harosheth of the Gentiles, and all the camp of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword, and there was not a man left.
JDG.4.17	And Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin, the king of Hazor, and the house of Heber the Kenite.
JDG.4.18	And Jael went out to meet Sisera and said unto him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into the tent, she covered him with a thick coverlet.
JDG.4.19	And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk and gave him to drink and covered him again.
JDG.4.20	Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and if anyone should come and enquire of thee and say, Is there anyone here? Thou shalt say, No.
JDG.4.21	Then Jael, Heber’s wife, took the tent stake, and putting a hammer in her hand, went softly unto him and smote the stake into his temples and fastened it into the ground, for he was fast asleep and weary. So he died.
JDG.4.22	And as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said unto him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seekest. And when he entered into where she was, behold, Sisera lay dead with the stake through his temples.
JDG.4.23	So God subjected on that day Jabin, the king of Canaan, before the sons of Israel.
JDG.4.24	And the hand of the sons of Israel began to prosper and to prevail against Jabin, the king of Canaan until they had destroyed him.
JDG.5.1	Then sang Deborah with Barak, the son of Abinoam, on that day, saying,
JDG.5.2	Praise ye the 
JDG.5.3	Hear, O ye kings. Give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing unto the 
JDG.5.4	, when thou didst go out of Seir, when thou didst march out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped; the clouds also dropped water.
JDG.5.5	The mountains melted from before the 
JDG.5.6	In the days of Shamgar, the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways ceased, and those that walked went astray through crooked paths.
JDG.5.7	The inhabitants of the villages ceased; they had ceased in Israel until I Deborah arose, I arose a mother in Israel.
JDG.5.8	When they chose new gods, the war was at the gates. Was there a shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel?
JDG.5.9	My heart is toward the princes of Israel, those that offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the 
JDG.5.10	Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that preside in judgment, and walk by the way.
JDG.5.11	Because of the noise of archers, taken from among those that draw water, there they shall retell the righteousnesses of the 
JDG.5.12	Rise up, rise up, Deborah; rise up, rise up, sing a song. Stand up, Barak and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.
JDG.5.13	Now he has made the remnant of the people to have dominion over the magnificent; the 
JDG.5.14	Out of Ephraim came his root against Amalek; after thee, came Benjamin, against thy peoples; out of Machir came down princes; and from Zebulun, those that handle the pen of the writer.
JDG.5.15	Also princes of Issachar were with Deborah; and Issachar, like Barak, went on foot into the valley. From the divisions of Reuben, great are the thoughts of the heart.
JDG.5.16	Why didst thou abide among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? From the divisions of Reuben great are the searchings of the heart.
JDG.5.17	Gilead remained on the other side of the Jordan, and why did Dan remain next to the ships? Asher continued on the sea shore and remained in his breaches.
JDG.5.18	Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives unto the death in the high places of the field.
JDG.5.19	The kings came and fought; then the kings of Canaan fought in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.
JDG.5.20	They fought from the heavens; the stars from their ways fought against Sisera.
JDG.5.21	The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the river Kishon. Tread down, O my soul, with strength.
JDG.5.22	Then were the hoofs of the horses broken by the means of the pransings, the pransings of their mighty ones.
JDG.5.23	Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the 
JDG.5.24	Blessed above women shall Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, be; blessed shall she be above women in the tent.
JDG.5.25	He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth cream in a lordly dish.
JDG.5.26	She put her hand to the stake, and her right hand to the workmen’s hammer, and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.
JDG.5.27	At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down; at her feet he bowed, he fell; where he bowed, there he fell down dead.
JDG.5.28	The mother of Sisera looked out the window and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why do the wheels of his chariots tarry?
JDG.5.29	Her wise princesses answered her; and she even answered to herself,
JDG.5.30	Have they not found spoil and are dividing it? To each man a damsel or two; to Sisera a spoil of different colours, a spoil of different colours of needlework, of different colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of those that take the spoil?
JDG.5.31	So let all thine enemies perish, O 
JDG.6.1	And the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the 
JDG.6.2	And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel, and because of the Midianites the sons of Israel made dens in the mountains and caves and strongholds.
JDG.6.3	For when those of Israel had sown, the Midianites would come up and the Amalekites and the sons of the east. They would come up against them
JDG.6.4	and encamp against them and destroy the fruits of the earth as far as Gaza, and they would leave nothing to eat in Israel neither sheep nor ox nor ass.
JDG.6.5	For they would come up with their livestock and their tents in a great multitude like locusts, for there was no number in them nor in their camels, and they would enter into the land destroying it.
JDG.6.6	And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the sons of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.6.7	And when the sons of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.6.8	the 
JDG.6.9	I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drove them out from before you and gave you their land;
JDG.6.10	and I said unto you, I am the 
JDG.6.11	And the angel of the 
JDG.6.12	And the angel of the 
JDG.6.13	And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the 
JDG.6.14	And the 
JDG.6.15	Then he replied unto him, Oh my Lord, with what shall I save Israel? Behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house.
JDG.6.16	And the 
JDG.6.17	And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, then show me a sign that thou hast spoken with me.
JDG.6.18	Do not depart from here, I pray thee, until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry until thou come again.
JDG.6.19	And Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an ephah of flour; the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the oak and presented it.
JDG.6.20	And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them upon this rock and pour out the broth. And he did so.
JDG.6.21	Then the angel of the 
JDG.6.22	And when Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the 
JDG.6.23	And the 
JDG.6.24	Then Gideon built an altar there unto the 
JDG.6.25	And it came to pass the same night that the 
JDG.6.26	and build an altar unto the 
JDG.6.27	Then Gideon took ten men of his slaves and did as the 
JDG.6.28	And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was built.
JDG.6.29	And they said one to another, Who has done this thing? And when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon, the son of Joash, has done this thing.
JDG.6.30	Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son that he may die because he has cast down the altar of Baal and because he has cut down the grove that was by it.
JDG.6.31	And Joash replied unto all that stood against him, Will ye contend for Baal? Will ye save him? Whoever will contend for him, let him be put to death while it is yet morning; if he is God, let him contend for himself with the one who has cast down his altar.
JDG.6.32	Therefore, on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal contend against him because he has thrown down his altar.
JDG.6.33	Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east gathered themselves together as one and went over and pitched camp in the valley of Jezreel.
JDG.6.34	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.6.35	And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh who also joined with him; likewise he sent messengers unto Asher and unto Zebulun and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.
JDG.6.36	And Gideon said unto God, Wilt thou save Israel by my hand as thou hast said?
JDG.6.37	Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the threshing floor; and if the dew is on the fleece only and it is dry upon all the earth beside it, then I shall know that thou wilt save Israel by my hand as thou hast said.
JDG.6.38	And it was so, for he rose up early in the morning, and wringing the fleece, he took the dew out of it, a bowl full of water.
JDG.6.39	But Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me if I speak again on this occasion; only let me prove again now with the fleece. I pray thee, let it be dry only upon the fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.
JDG.6.40	And God did so that night for it was dry upon the fleece only, and there was dew on all the ground.
JDG.7.1	Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with him rose up early and pitched camp beside the well of Harod so that the camp of the Midianites was on the north, on the other side of the hill of Moreh, in the valley.
JDG.7.2	And the 
JDG.7.3	Now, therefore, cause it to be proclaimed in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return and depart early from Mount Gilead. And twenty-two thousand of the people returned, and ten thousand remained.
JDG.7.4	And the 
JDG.7.5	So he brought the people down unto the water, and the 
JDG.7.6	And the number of those that lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, were three hundred men; but all the rest of the people bowed down upon their knees to drink the water.
JDG.7.7	Then the 
JDG.7.8	And having taken provision for the people in his hands with their shofarot; he sent all the other Israelites each one to his tent and retained those three hundred men, and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.
JDG.7.9	And it came to pass the same night, that the 
JDG.7.10	But if thou art afraid to go down, go with Phurah thy servant down to the camp,
JDG.7.11	and thou shalt hear what they say; and then thy hands shall be strengthened, and thou shalt go down to the camp. Then he went down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that were in the camp.
JDG.7.12	And Midian and Amalek and all the sons of the east lay along in the valley like locusts in multitude, and their camels were not numbered as the sand by the sea side for multitude.
JDG.7.13	And when Gideon arrived, behold, a man was telling a dream to his fellow, saying, Behold, I dreamed a dream that I saw a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and come unto the tents, and it smote them so that they fell and overturned them, and the tents fell.
JDG.7.14	And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else but the sword of Gideon, the son of Joash, a man of Israel, for God has delivered the Midianites with all the camp into his hand.
JDG.7.15	And when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshipped; and when he had returned into the camp of Israel, he said, Arise, for the 
JDG.7.16	And dividing the three hundred men into three companies, he put a shofar in each man’s hand with empty pitchers and torches burning within the pitchers.
JDG.7.17	And he said unto them, Look at me and do as I do; and, behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, as I do, so shall ye do.
JDG.7.18	I shall blow the shofar, I and all that are with me, then ye shall blow the shofarot on every side of all the camp, and say, I AM The Hewer! {YHWH-Gideon}
JDG.7.19	So Gideon and the hundred men that were with him came unto the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch when only the guards were awake, and they blew the shofarot and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.
JDG.7.20	And the three companies blew the shofarot; and breaking the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands and the shofarot in their right hands to blow with; and they cried, The sword of I AM The Hewer! {YHWH-Gideon}
JDG.7.21	And they stood in their places round about the camp; and all the camp was routed, and they fled crying out.
JDG.7.22	But the three hundred blew the shofarot, and the 
JDG.7.23	And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of Naphtali and out of Asher and out of all Manasseh and pursued after the Midianites.
JDG.7.24	Gideon also sent messengers throughout all Mount Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites and take before them the waters unto Bethbarah and the Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together and took the waters unto Bethbarah and the Jordan.
JDG.7.25	And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress of Zeeb; and after they pursued Midian, they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan.
JDG.8.1	And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us thus that thou didst not call us when thou didst go to fight against Midian? And they chided with him sharply.
JDG.8.2	And he replied unto them, What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
JDG.8.3	God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and what was I able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger was abated toward him when he spoke that word.
JDG.8.4	And Gideon came to pass the Jordan, he and the three hundred men that were with him, faint from the pursuit.
JDG.8.5	And he said unto those of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of bread unto the people that follow me; for they are faint that I may pursue after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.
JDG.8.6	And the principals of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we should give bread unto thy army?
JDG.8.7	And Gideon said, Therefore when the 
JDG.8.8	And he went up from there to Penuel and spoke unto them likewise; and those of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.
JDG.8.9	And he spoke also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower.
JDG.8.10	Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor and their hosts with them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the sons of the east, for one hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword had been slain.
JDG.8.11	And Gideon went up by the way of those that dwelt in tents on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah and smote the camp, for the camp was secure.
JDG.8.12	And as Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them and took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna and terrified all the host.
JDG.8.13	And Gideon, the son of Joash, returned from the battle before the sun was up
JDG.8.14	and caught a young man of the men of Succoth and enquired of him; and he described unto him the principals of Succoth and the elders thereof, seventy-seven men.
JDG.8.15	And he came unto the men of Succoth and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary?
JDG.8.16	And he took the elders of the city and thorns and briars of the wilderness, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.
JDG.8.17	Likewise he beat down the tower of Penuel and slew the men of the city.
JDG.8.18	Then he said unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were those whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were they; each one resembled the sons of a king.
JDG.8.19	And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother; as the 
JDG.8.20	And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Rise up and slay them. But the youth did not draw his sword, for he feared because he was yet a youth.
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and Zalmunna and took away the ornaments that were on their camels’ necks.
JDG.8.22	Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both thou and thy son and thy son’s son also, for thou hast delivered us from the hand of Midian.
JDG.8.23	But Gideon replied, I will not rule over you, neither shall my son rule over you; the 
JDG.8.24	And Gideon said unto them, I desire to make a request of you that ye each one would give me the earrings of his prey. (For they had golden earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)
JDG.8.25	And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and each one cast therein the earrings of his prey.
JDG.8.26	And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a thousand seven hundred shekels of gold, without the ornaments and collars and purple clothing that was on the kings of Midian and without the chains that were about their camels’ necks.
JDG.8.27	And Gideon made an ephod of them and kept it in his city of Ophrah, and all Israel fornicated after it in that place, and it became a snare unto Gideon and to his house.
JDG.8.28	Thus Midian was broken before the sons of Israel so that they lifted up their heads no more. And the land rested forty years in the days of Gideon.
JDG.8.29	And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, went and dwelt in his own house.
JDG.8.30	And Gideon had seventy sons that came out of his loins, for he had many wives.
JDG.8.31	And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bore him a son, whose name he called Abimelech.
JDG.8.32	And Gideon, the son of Joash, died in a good old age and was buried in the sepulchre of Joash, his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.
JDG.8.33	And it came to pass as soon as Gideon was dead that the sons of Israel turned again and fornicated after the Baalim and made Baalberith their god.
JDG.8.34	And the sons of Israel did not remember the 
JDG.8.35	neither were they merciful with the house of Jerubbaal, namely, Gideon, according to all the good which he had done unto Israel.
JDG.9.1	And Abimelech, the son of Jerubbaal, went to Shechem unto his mother’s brethren and spoke with them and with all the family of the house of his mother’s father, saying,
JDG.9.2	Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, What would seem better unto you, that seventy persons reign over you, all the sons of Jerubbaal; or that one reign over you? Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.
JDG.9.3	And his mother’s brethren spoke for him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words, and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother.
JDG.9.4	And they gave him seventy shekels of silver out of the house of Baalberith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light men who followed him.
JDG.9.5	And coming unto his father’s house at Ophrah, he slew his brethren, the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy persons, upon a stone; yet Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, was left, for he hid himself.
JDG.9.6	And all the men of Shechem gathered together with all the house of Millo {Heb. the congregation} and went and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.
JDG.9.7	And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of Mount Gerizim and lifted up his voice and cried and said unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.
JDG.9.8	The trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.
JDG.9.9	But the olive tree replied, Should I leave my fatness, which because of me, God and man are honoured, to go and sway over the trees?
JDG.9.10	And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou and reign over us.
JDG.9.11	But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness and my good fruit to go and sway over the trees?
JDG.9.12	Then the trees said unto the vine, Come thou and reign over us.
JDG.9.13	And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which cheers God and man, to go and sway over the trees?
JDG.9.14	Then all the trees said unto the bramble, Come thou and reign over us.
JDG.9.15	And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and confide under my shadow; and if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.
JDG.9.16	Now therefore, if ye have proceeded with truth and integrity in making Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have recompensed him according to the work of his hands
JDG.9.17	(For my father fought for you and cast his life far from him to deliver you out of the hand of Midian;
JDG.9.18	and ye are risen up against my father’s house this day and have slain his sons, seventy men, upon a stone and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem because he is your brother;)
JDG.9.19	if ye then have dealt in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you.
JDG.9.20	But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the men of Shechem and the house of Millo; and let fire come out from the men of Shechem and from the house of Millo and devour Abimelech.
JDG.9.21	And Jotham ran away and fled and went to Beer and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.
JDG.9.22	When Abimelech had dominated over Israel three years,
JDG.9.23	then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem, and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech
JDG.9.24	that the cruelty done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal and their blood might come to be laid upon Abimelech their brother who slew them and upon the men of Shechem, who aided him in the killing of his brethren.
JDG.9.25	And the men of Shechem set ambushers for him in the top of the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them; and it was told Abimelech.
JDG.9.26	And Gaal, the son of Ebed, came with his brethren and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.
JDG.9.27	And they went out into the fields and gathered their vineyards and trod the grapes and made merry and went into the house of their gods and ate and drank and cursed Abimelech.
JDG.9.28	And Gaal, the son of Ebed, said, Who is Abimelech and who is Shechem that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal? And is not Zebul his deputy? Serve the men of Hamor, the father of Shechem. For why should we serve him?
JDG.9.29	If these people were under my hand, then I would remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army and come out.
JDG.9.30	And when Zebul, the prince of the city, heard the words of Gaal, the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.
JDG.9.31	And he sent messengers unto Abimelech astutely, saying, Behold, Gaal, the son of Ebed, and his brethren have come to Shechem; and, behold, they have fortified the city against thee.
JDG.9.32	Now, therefore, rise up by night, thou and the people that are with thee, and put an ambush in the field.
JDG.9.33	And in the morning as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early and set upon the city; and, behold, when he and the people that are with him come out against thee, then thou may do to them as thou shalt find occasion.
JDG.9.34	And Abimelech rose up and all the people that were with him, by night, and they put an ambush against Shechem in four companies.
JDG.9.35	And Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out and stood in the entering of the gate of the city; and Abimelech and all the people that were with him rose up from the ambush.
JDG.9.36	And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold people that come down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.
JDG.9.37	And Gaal spoke again and said, See there come people who descend through the middle of the land, and another company comes along by the plain of Meonenim.
JDG.9.38	Then Zebul said unto him, Where is now thy mouth, with which thou didst say, Who is Abimelech that we should serve him? Is not this the people that thou hast despised? Go out now and fight with them.
JDG.9.39	And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem and fought with Abimelech.
JDG.9.40	And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.
JDG.9.41	And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah; and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his brethren that they should not dwell in Shechem.
JDG.9.42	And it came to pass on the next day that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech.
JDG.9.43	And he took the people and divided them into three companies and set ambushes in the field and looked, and, behold, the people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them and smote them.
JDG.9.44	And Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood in the entering of the gate of the city, and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields and slew them.
JDG.9.45	And Abimelech fought against the city all that day, and he took the city and slew the people that were therein and beat down the city and sowed it with salt.
JDG.9.46	And when those of the tower of Shechem heard that, they entered into the stronghold of the temple of the god Berith.
JDG.9.47	And it was told Abimelech how all those of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.
JDG.9.48	Then Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bough from the trees and took it and laid it on his shoulder and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste and do as I have done.
JDG.9.49	And all the people likewise cut down each one his bough and followed Abimelech and put them next to the stronghold and set the stronghold on fire upon them; so that all those of the tower of Shechem died, about a thousand men and women.
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to Thebez and laid siege against Thebez and took it.
JDG.9.51	But in the midst of the city there was a strong tower, and all the men and women fled there, and all those of the city, and shutting the doors behind them, they climbed up to the top of the tower.
JDG.9.52	And Abimelech came to the tower, and fighting against it, he came to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.
JDG.9.53	But a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull.
JDG.9.54	Then he called hastily unto the young man, his armourbearer, and said unto him, Draw thy sword and slay me that it not be said of me, A woman slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.
JDG.9.55	And when the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed each one unto his place.
JDG.9.56	Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did against his father in slaying his seventy brethren.
JDG.9.57	And all the evil of the men of Shechem God rendered upon their heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham, the son of Jerubbaal.
JDG.10.1	And after Abimelech there arose to save Israel, Tola, the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in Mount Ephraim.
JDG.10.2	And he judged Israel twenty-three years and died and was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years.
JDG.10.4	And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called the cities of Jair unto this day, which are in the land of Gilead.
JDG.10.5	And Jair died and was buried in Camon.
JDG.10.6	And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.10.7	And the anger of the 
JDG.10.8	who dashed in pieces and crushed the sons of Israel for eighteen years, all the sons of Israel that were on the other side of the Jordan in the land of the Amorite, which is in Gilead.
JDG.10.9	Moreover the sons of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim so that Israel was sore distressed.
JDG.10.10	And the sons of Israel cried unto the 
JDG.10.11	And the 
JDG.10.12	by those of Zidon, by Amalek, and by Maon, and ye cried to me and I delivered you out of their hands?
JDG.10.13	Yet ye have forsaken me and served other gods; therefore, I will deliver you no more.
JDG.10.14	Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver you in the time of your affliction.
JDG.10.15	And the sons of Israel said unto the 
JDG.10.16	And they put away the strange gods from among them and served the 
JDG.10.17	Then the sons of Ammon were gathered together and encamped in Gilead. And likewise the sons of Israel assembled themselves together and encamped in Mizpeh.
JDG.10.18	And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, Who shall it be that will begin the battle against the sons of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
JDG.11.1	Now Jephthah existed then, a Gileadite, a mighty man of valour, the son of a harlot unto whom Gilead had begat a son.
JDG.11.2	And Gilead’s wife bore him sons; and when his wife’s sons grew up, they threw Jephthah out and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in our father’s house, for thou art the son of a strange woman.
JDG.11.3	Then Jephthah fled from his brethren and dwelt in the land of Tob; and vain men joined themselves to Jephthah and went out with him.
JDG.11.4	And it came to pass after some days that the sons of Ammon made war against Israel.
JDG.11.5	And when the sons of Ammon made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of Tob;
JDG.11.6	and they said unto Jephthah, Come, and thou shalt be our captain that we may fight with the sons of Ammon.
JDG.11.7	And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me and expel me out of my father’s house? Why, therefore, are ye come unto me now when ye are in distress?
JDG.11.8	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, For this same reason we turn again to thee now that thou may go with us and fight against the sons of Ammon and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
JDG.11.9	Then Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home again to fight against the sons of Ammon and the 
JDG.11.10	And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Let the 
JDG.11.11	Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and prince over them; and Jephthah spoke all his words before the 
JDG.11.12	And Jephthah sent ambassadors unto the king of the sons of Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me that thou art come against me to fight in my land?
JDG.11.13	And the king of the sons of Ammon replied unto the ambassadors of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok and unto the Jordan; now, therefore, restore those lands again peaceably.
JDG.11.14	Then Jephthah sent ambassadors again unto the king of the sons of Ammon,
JDG.11.15	saying unto him, Thus hath Jephthah said, Israel did not take land from Moab, nor land from the sons of Ammon,
JDG.11.16	but Israel came up from Egypt and walked through the wilderness unto the Red sea and came to Kadesh.
JDG.11.17	Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land. But the king of Edom would not hear them. And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab, but he would not consent either; therefore Israel abode in Kadesh.
JDG.11.18	Then they went along through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab and came by the side of the rising of the sun to the land of Moab; they pitched their camp on the other side of Arnon and did not enter within the border of Moab, for Arnon was the border of Moab.
JDG.11.19	And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon, king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land into my place.
JDG.11.20	But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his border; but Sihon gathered all his people together and pitched camp in Jahaz and fought against Israel.
JDG.11.21	But the 
JDG.11.22	And they possessed all the border of the Amorites from Arnon even unto Jabbok and from the wilderness even unto the Jordan.
JDG.11.23	So now the 
JDG.11.24	If Chemosh thy god should expel anyone for you, would thou not possess it? So whoever the 
JDG.11.25	Art thou better now in any thing than Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Peradventure did he ever strive against Israel? Peradventure did he ever fight against them?
JDG.11.26	Furthermore, Israel has dwelt in Heshbon and her towns and in Aroer and her towns and in all the cities that are along by the coasts of Arnon, for three hundred years. Why, therefore, did ye not recover them within that time?
JDG.11.27	Therefore, I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me; let the 
JDG.11.28	But the king of the sons of Ammon did not hear the reasons of Jephthah which he sent him.
JDG.11.29	Then the Spirit of the 
JDG.11.30	And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the 
JDG.11.31	whoever comes forth of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon shall surely be the 
JDG.11.32	So Jephthah went over unto the sons of Ammon to fight against them, and the 
JDG.11.33	And he smote them from Aroer, even unto Minnith twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very great slaughter. Thus the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel.
JDG.11.34	And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances; and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.
JDG.11.35	And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou art one of those that trouble me, for I have opened my mouth unto the 
JDG.11.36	And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth unto the 
JDG.11.37	And she said again unto her father, Let this thing be done for me; let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.
JDG.11.38	And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months, and she went with her companions and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.
JDG.11.39	And it came to pass at the end of two months that she returned unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed. And she had never known a man. From here came the custom in Israel
JDG.11.40	that the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah, the Gileadite, four days in a year.
JDG.12.1	And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together towards the Aquilon and said unto Jephthah, Why didst thou go over to fight against the sons of Ammon and didst not call us to go with thee? We will burn thy house upon thee with fire.
JDG.12.2	And Jephthah replied unto them, I and my people were at great strife with the sons of Ammon, and when I called you, ye did not defend me from their hands.
JDG.12.3	Seeing, therefore, that ye did not defend me, I put my life in my hands and went over against the sons of Ammon, and the 
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim because they had said, Ye are fugitives of Ephraim; ye are Gileadites among Ephraim and Manasseh.
JDG.12.5	And the Gileadites took the passages of the Jordan from Ephraim; and it was such that when any of those of Ephraim who had escaped would say, May I pass? The men of Gilead would ask them, Art thou an Ephrathite? If he said, No;
JDG.12.6	then they would say unto him, Now say Shibboleth. {Heb. a flowing stream}. And he would say Sibboleth; {Heb. an ear of wheat}; for he could not pronounce it the same. Then they would take him and slay him at the passages of the Jordan. And at that time forty-two thousand of those of Ephraim fell.
JDG.12.7	And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.
JDG.12.8	After him Ibzan, of Bethlehem, judged Israel,
JDG.12.9	who had thirty sons and thirty daughters, whom he married abroad and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years.
JDG.12.10	Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years.
JDG.12.12	And Elon, the Zebulonite, died and was buried in Aijalon in the country of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	And after him Abdon, the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged Israel.
JDG.12.14	And he had forty sons and thirty grandsons that rode on seventy he asses, and he judged Israel eight years.
JDG.12.15	And Abdon, the son of Hillel the Pirathonite, died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim in the mount of Amalek.
JDG.13.1	And the sons of Israel did evil again in the sight of the 
JDG.13.2	And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of Dan, whose name was Manoah, and his wife was barren, (she had never born children).
JDG.13.3	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.4	Now keep thyself and drink no wine nor strong drink and eat no unclean thing.
JDG.13.5	For thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and no razor shall come on his head, for the child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.
JDG.13.6	Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel of God, very terrible; but I did not ask him where he was from, neither did he tell me his name;
JDG.13.7	but he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive and bear a son, and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah prayed unto the 
JDG.13.9	And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again unto the woman as she sat in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her.
JDG.13.10	And the woman made haste and ran and told her husband and said unto him, Behold, the man that came unto me has appeared unto me today.
JDG.13.11	And Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him, Art thou the man that spoke unto this woman? And he said, I am.
JDG.13.12	Then Manoah said, Now let thy word come to pass. How shall we order the child, and what shall he do?
JDG.13.13	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.14	She may not eat of any thing that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing; all that I commanded her let her keep.
JDG.13.15	And Manoah said unto the angel of the 
JDG.13.16	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.17	And Manoah said unto the angel of the 
JDG.13.18	And the angel of the 
JDG.13.19	So Manoah took a kid with a present and sacrificed it upon a rock unto the 
JDG.13.20	For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the angel of the 
JDG.13.21	But the angel of the 
JDG.13.22	And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die because we have seen God.
JDG.13.23	But his wife said unto him, If the 
JDG.13.24	And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and the 
JDG.13.25	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.1	And as Samson went down to Timnath, he saw a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines.
JDG.14.2	And he came up and told his father and his mother, saying, I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines; now therefore get her for me to wife.
JDG.14.3	Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a woman among the daughters of thy brethren or among all my people that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleases me well.
JDG.14.4	But his father and his mother did not know that it was of the 
JDG.14.5	Then Samson went down with his father and his mother to Timnath, and when they came to the vineyards of Timnath, behold, a young lion came roaring against him.
JDG.14.6	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.7	And he went down and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.
JDG.14.8	And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside from the way to see the carcase of the lion; and, behold, there was a swarm of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.
JDG.14.9	And he took of it in his hands and went along the way eating, and when he came to his father and mother, he also gave them some to eat, but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.
JDG.14.10	So his father went down unto the woman; and Samson made a banquet there, for the young men used to do so.
JDG.14.11	And when they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him,
JDG.14.12	unto whom Samson said, I will now put forth an enigma unto you, which if ye can declare it and discover it to me within the seven days of the banquet, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty changes of garments.
JDG.14.13	But if ye cannot declare it to me, then ye shall give me thirty sheets and thirty changes of garments. And they said unto him, Put forth thy enigma that we may hear it.
JDG.14.14	And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth food, and out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not declare the enigma in three days.
JDG.14.15	And it came to pass on the seventh day that they said unto Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband that he may declare unto us this enigma lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire. Have ye called us here to impoverish us?
JDG.14.16	And Samson’s wife wept before him and said, Thou dost only hate me and dost not love me, for thou hast not declared unto me the enigma that thou hast put forth unto the sons of my people. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it to my father nor my mother, and must I tell it to thee?
JDG.14.17	And she wept before him the seven days while their banquet lasted, but on the seventh day, he told her, because she lay sore upon him, and she declared the enigma to the sons of her people.
JDG.14.18	And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger than a lion? And he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my heifer, ye would have never discovered my enigma.
JDG.14.19	And the Spirit of the 
JDG.14.20	But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had fed him before.
JDG.15.1	But it came to pass within some days in the time of wheat harvest that Samson visited his wife with a kid, and he said, I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not allow him to go in.
JDG.15.2	And her father said, I was persuaded that thou didst utterly hate her; therefore, I gave her to thy companion. Is not her younger sister fairer than she? Take her, I pray thee, instead of her.
JDG.15.3	And Samson replied unto them, Now I shall be blameless before the Philistines if I do them injury.
JDG.15.4	And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turning them tail to tail, he put a torch between every two tails.
JDG.15.5	Then, setting the torches on fire, he let them go into the standing grain of the Philistines and burnt up both the shocks and also the standing grain with the vineyards and oliveyards.
JDG.15.6	Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they answered, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up and burnt her and her father with fire.
JDG.15.7	And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet I will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.
JDG.15.8	And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter, and he went down and dwelt in the cleft of the rock Etam.
JDG.15.9	Then the Philistines went up and pitched camp in Judah and spread themselves in Lehi.
JDG.15.10	And the men of Judah said, Why have ye come up against us? And they answered, We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he has done to us.
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went to the cleft of the rock Etam and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are rulers over us? What is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.
JDG.15.12	And they said unto him, We have come to bind thee that we may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said unto them, Swear unto me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
JDG.15.13	And they answered him, saying, No, we will bind thee fast and deliver thee into their hands; but surely we will not kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords and brought him up from the rock.
JDG.15.14	And when he came unto Lehi, {Heb. jaw}, the Philistines received him with shouts; and the Spirit of the 
JDG.15.15	And he found a new jawbone of an ass and put forth his hand and took it and slew a thousand men with it.
JDG.15.16	Then Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, one heap, two heaps; with the jaw of an ass I have slain a thousand men.
JDG.15.17	And when he had finished speaking, he cast away the jawbone out of his hand and called that place Ramathlehi. {Heb. the lifting up of the jaw}
JDG.15.18	And he was sore athirst and called on the 
JDG.15.19	Then God broke a tooth that was in the jaw, and water came out there; and he drank, and recovered his spirit, and he lived. Therefore he called the name thereof Enhakkore, {Heb. the fountain of he who called}, which is in Lehi unto this day.
JDG.15.20	And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
JDG.16.1	Then Samson went to Gaza and saw a harlot there and went in unto her.
JDG.16.2	And it was told unto those of Gaza, Samson is come here. And they compassed him in and laid in wait for him all night in the gate of the city and were quiet all that night, saying, In the morning when it is light, we shall kill him.
JDG.16.3	And Samson slept until midnight and arose at midnight and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the mountain that is before Hebron.
JDG.16.4	And it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
JDG.16.5	And the cardinals of the Philistines came up unto her and said unto her, Entice him and see what gives him his great strength and by what means we may overcome him, that we may bind him to afflict him; and each one of us will give thee eleven hundred pieces of silver.
JDG.16.6	And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, what gives thee thy great strength and how might thou be bound to afflict thee.
JDG.16.7	And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green wicker strands that were never dried, then I shall become weak and be as any other man.
JDG.16.8	Then the cardinals of the Philistines brought up to her seven green wicker strands which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.
JDG.16.9	Now there were men lying in wait in a chamber of her house. And she said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he broke the wicker strands as a thread of tow is broken when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.
JDG.16.10	Then Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me and told me lies; now tell me, I pray thee, how thou might be bound.
JDG.16.11	And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that never were occupied, then I shall become weak and be as any other man.
JDG.16.12	Delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him with them and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And there were men lying in wait abiding in a chamber. But he broke them from off his arms like a thread.
JDG.16.13	And Delilah said unto Samson, Until now thou hast mocked me, and told me lies. Tell me, therefore, now, how thou might be bound. Then he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the cloth.
JDG.16.14	And she fastened it with the stake and said unto him, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep and went away with the stake of the loom and with the cloth.
JDG.16.15	And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when thy heart is not with me? Thou hast mocked me these three times and hast not yet told me what gives thee thy great strength.
JDG.16.16	And it came to pass that, pressing and grinding him daily with her words, his soul was reduced unto mortal anguish.
JDG.16.17	Therefore, he told her all his heart and said unto her, A razor has never come upon my head, for I am a Nazarite of God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man.
JDG.16.18	And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called for the cardinals of the Philistines, saying, Come up this time, for he has showed me all his heart. Then the cardinals of the Philistines came up unto her and brought the money in their hand.
JDG.16.19	And she caused him to sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.
JDG.16.20	And she said, The Philistines are upon thee, Samson. And he awoke out of his sleep and said, This time I will go out like before and escape; not knowing that the 
JDG.16.21	But the Philistines took hold of him and put out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with fetters of iron that he should grind in the prison house.
JDG.16.22	And the hair of his head began to grow again after he was shaven.
JDG.16.23	Then the cardinals of the Philistines gathered themselves together to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god and to rejoice, for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy into our hands.
JDG.16.24	And when the people saw him, they praised their god, for they said, Our god has delivered our enemy into our hands, the destroyer of our country, who slew many of us.
JDG.16.25	And it came to pass when their hearts were merry, that they said, Call for Samson that he may make us laugh. And they called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport, and they set him between the pillars.
JDG.16.26	And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Bring me near and let me feel the pillars upon which the house stands that I may lean upon them.
JDG.16.27	Now the house was full of men and women; and all the cardinals of the Philistines were there, and upon the roof there were about three thousand men and women that beheld while Samson was mocked.
JDG.16.28	Then Samson called unto the 
JDG.16.29	Then Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the house stood and on which it was borne up, and leaned upon them, on the one with his right hand and on the other with his left.
JDG.16.30	And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he pushed with all his might, and the house fell upon the cardinals and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead which he slew at his death were more than those which he slew in his life.
JDG.16.31	Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the sepulchre of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty years.
JDG.17.1	And there was a man of Mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.
JDG.17.2	And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver that were stolen from thee, about which thou didst curse in my hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the 
JDG.17.3	And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had completely dedicated the silver unto the 
JDG.17.4	After the money was restored unto her, his mother took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to the founder, who made thereof a graven image and a molten image, which was set up in the house of Micah.
JDG.17.5	And the man Micah had a brothel of idolatry, {Heb. house of gods}, and made an ephod and teraphim {the vessels, clothing and instruments pertaining to idol worship} and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.
JDG.17.6	In those days there was no king in Israel; each one did that which was right in his own eyes.
JDG.17.7	And there was a young man out of Bethlehem of Judah of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.
JDG.17.8	And the man had departed out of the city from Bethlehem of Judah to sojourn where he could find a place, and he came to Mount Ephraim to the house of Micah as he journeyed.
JDG.17.9	And Micah said unto him, From where hast thou come? And he said unto him, I am a Levite of Bethlehem of Judah, and I go to sojourn where I may find a place.
JDG.17.10	Then Micah said unto him, Dwell with me and be a father and a priest unto me, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year and the ordinary apparel and thy food. So the Levite went in.
JDG.17.11	And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man was unto him as one of his sons.
JDG.17.12	And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest and was in the house of Micah.
JDG.17.13	Then Micah said, Now know I that the 
JDG.18.1	In those days there was no king in Israel, and in those days the tribe of the Dan sought a possession for themselves to dwell in, for unto that day their lot had not fallen unto them among the tribes of Israel for an inheritance.
JDG.18.2	And the sons of Dan sent five men from their family of their borders, men of valour, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to search it, and they said unto them, Go, search the land. These came unto Mount Ephraim to the house of Micah, and they lodged there.
JDG.18.3	When they were near the house of Micah, they recognized the accent of the voice of the young man the Levite, and they turned in there and said unto him, Who brought thee here? And what doest thou in this place? And what hast thou here?
JDG.18.4	And he said unto them, Thus and thus Micah has done with me and has hired me that I may be his priest.
JDG.18.5	And they said unto him, Ask counsel now, therefore, of God, that we may know whether he shall prosper our journey which we do.
JDG.18.6	And the priest replied unto them, Go in peace. Your journey which ye do is before the 
JDG.18.7	Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw that the people that dwelt there were secure, idle, and confident after the manner of the Zidonians; and there was no one in that land that might hinder them in any way from possessing that land; furthermore they were far from the Zidonians and had no business with anyone.
JDG.18.8	And they returned unto their brethren in Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brethren said unto them, What say ye?
JDG.18.9	And they said, Arise, let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good; and are ye to remain still? Do not be slothful to go and to enter to possess the land.
JDG.18.10	When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure and to a large land, for God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.
JDG.18.11	And there went from there of the family of Dan, out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war.
JDG.18.12	And they went up and pitched camp in Kirjathjearim in Judah; therefore, they called that place the camp of Dan unto this day; it is behind Kirjathjearim.
JDG.18.13	And they passed from there unto Mount Ephraim and came unto the house of Micah.
JDG.18.14	Then the five men that had gone to spy out the land of Laish said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these houses an ephod and teraphim and a graven image and a molten image? Now, therefore, consider what ye have to do.
JDG.18.15	And they turned in there and came to the house of the young man, the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and greeted him. {Heb. asked him of peace}
JDG.18.16	And the six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.
JDG.18.17	And the five men that went to spy out the land went up and went in there and took the graven image and the ephod, and the teraphim and the molten image while the priest stood in the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men that were armed with weapons of war.
JDG.18.18	So they entered into Micah’s house and took the graven image the ephod and the teraphim and the molten image. Then the priest said unto them, What are you doing?
JDG.18.19	And they said unto him, Silence, lay thy hand upon thy mouth and go with us to be our father and priest; is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one man or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family of Israel?
JDG.18.20	And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the ephod and the teraphim and the graven image and went in the midst of the people.
JDG.18.21	So they turned and departed and put the little ones and the cattle and the baggage before them.
JDG.18.22	And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together and overtook the sons of Dan.
JDG.18.23	And they cried unto the sons of Dan. And these turned their faces and said unto Micah, What ails thee that thou dost come with such a company?
JDG.18.24	And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made and the priest, and ye are gone away; and what is left to me? And why do ye say unto me, What ails thee?
JDG.18.25	And the sons of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us lest peradventure angry fellows run upon thee and thou lose thy life with the lives of thy household.
JDG.18.26	And the sons of Dan went their way, and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.
JDG.18.27	And they took the things which Micah had made together with the priest which he had and came unto Laish unto a people that were at quiet and secure, and they smote them with the edge of the sword and burnt the city with fire.
JDG.18.28	And there was no deliverer because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with anyone; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. Then they rebuilt the city and dwelt therein.
JDG.18.29	And they called the name of the city Dan after the name of Dan their father, who was born unto Israel; however, the name of the city was Laish at the first.
JDG.18.30	And the sons of Dan set up the graven image; and Jonathan, the son of Gershon, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.
JDG.18.31	And they set up Micah’s graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	In those days when there was no king in Israel, there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of Mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehem of Judah.
JDG.19.2	And his concubine committed adultery against him and went away from him unto her father’s house to Bethlehem of Judah and was there four whole months.
JDG.19.3	And her husband arose and went after her to speak friendly unto her and to bring her again, having his servant with him and a couple of asses, and she brought him into her father’s house. And when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him;
JDG.19.4	and his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, retained him, and he dwelt with him three days; eating and drinking, and abiding there.
JDG.19.5	And on the fourth day when they arose early in the morning, the Levite rose up to depart; and the damsel’s father said unto his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterwards ye shall go.
JDG.19.6	And the two of them sat down together and ate and drank. And the damsel’s father said unto the man, Be content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and thy heart shall be merry.
JDG.19.7	And when the man rose up to depart, his father-in-law urged him to remain and lodge there again.
JDG.19.8	And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, and the damsel’s father said, Strengthen now thy heart. And after having eaten together, they tarried until afternoon.
JDG.19.9	And when the man rose up to depart, he and his concubine and his servant, his father-in-law, the damsel’s father, said unto him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening, I pray you tarry all night; behold, the day comes to an end; lodge here that thy heart may be merry, and tomorrow ye shall get up early and be on your way that thou may come unto thy tent.
JDG.19.10	But the man would not remain there that night, but he rose up and departed and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem, with his two asses saddled and with his concubine.
JDG.19.11	And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant said unto his master, Come now and let us turn in into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.
JDG.19.12	And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside here into a city of strangers that is not of the sons of Israel; we will go on to Gibeah.
JDG.19.13	And he said unto his servant, Come and let us draw near to one of these places to pass the night, in Gibeah or in Ramah.
JDG.19.14	And they passed on and walked; and the sun went down upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belonged to Benjamin.
JDG.19.15	And they turned in there, to enter and to lodge in Gibeah; and entering in, they sat down in the plaza of the city, for no one took them into their house to pass the night.
JDG.19.16	And, behold, an old man, who in the evening came from working in the field, who was also of Mount Ephraim, sojourned in Gibeah, but the men of the place were sons of Jemini. {Benjamin}
JDG.19.17	And the old man lifted up his eyes and saw the traveller in the plaza of the city and said unto him, Where dost thou go and where hast thou come from?
JDG.19.18	And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehem of Judah toward the side of Mount Ephraim, where I am from, and I went to Bethlehem of Judah, but I am now going to the house of the 
JDG.19.19	even though we have straw and fodder for our asses, and there is bread and wine also for me and for thy handmaid and for the young man who is with thy slave; we have no lack of any thing.
JDG.19.20	And the old man said, Peace be with thee; let all thy needs be upon me; only do not pass the night in the plaza.
JDG.19.21	So he brought him into his house and gave fodder unto the asses, and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
JDG.19.22	Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, that men of the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about and beat at the doors and spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thy house that we may know him.
JDG.19.23	And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them and said unto them, No, my brethren, I pray you, do not do this evil, seeing that this man has entered into my house; do not commit this folly.
JDG.19.24	Behold, here is my virgin daughter and his concubine; I will bring them out now, humble them, and do with them what seems good unto you, but unto this man do not commit this vile folly.
JDG.19.25	But the men would not hearken unto him, so the man took his concubine and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her and abused her all night until the morning; and when the day began to break, they let her go.
JDG.19.26	Then the woman came, in the dawning of the day, and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her lord was until it was light.
JDG.19.27	And her lord rose up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, and behold, the woman, his concubine, was fallen down at the door of the house with her hands upon the threshold.
JDG.19.28	And he said unto her, Rise up, and let us be going. But she did not answer. Then the man rose up and took her upon his ass and went unto his place.
JDG.19.29	And when he was come into his house, he took a knife and laid hold on his concubine and divided her, together with her bones into twelve pieces, and sent them into all the borders of Israel.
JDG.19.30	And everyone that saw it said, No such deed has been done or seen from the day that the sons of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day. Consider this, give advice, and speak.
JDG.20.1	Then all the sons of Israel went out, and the congregation was gathered together as one man, from Dan to Beersheba and the land of Gilead, unto the 
JDG.20.2	And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel, were present in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.
JDG.20.3	(Now the sons of Benjamin heard that the sons of Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then the sons of Israel said, Tell us, how was this wickedness?
JDG.20.4	And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was murdered, answered and said, I came into Gibeah of Benjamin with my concubine to pass the night there.
JDG.20.5	And the men of Gibeah rose up against me and beset the house round about upon me by night and thought to have slain me, and they have forced my concubine in such a manner that she is dead.
JDG.20.6	Then I took my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the possession of Israel, for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.
JDG.20.7	Behold, all ye sons of Israel; give here your advice and counsel.
JDG.20.8	Then all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house
JDG.20.9	until we do this upon Gibeah that we cast lots against it;
JDG.20.10	and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch provisions for the people that shall go against Gibeah of Benjamin, according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit together as one man.
JDG.20.12	And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?
JDG.20.13	Now therefore deliver us those men, the sons of Belial, who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and put away the evil from Israel. But the sons of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of their brethren, the sons of Israel;
JDG.20.14	but the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of the cities in Gibeah to go out to battle against the sons of Israel.
JDG.20.15	And the sons of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of the cities twenty-six thousand men that drew sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven hundred chosen men.
JDG.20.16	Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men with their right hands impeded (they were lefthanded); each one could sling stones at a hairs breadth, and not miss. {Heb. sin}
JDG.20.17	And the men of Israel, not counting Benjamin, were numbered four hundred thousand men that drew sword; all these were men of war.
JDG.20.18	Then the sons of Israel arose and went up to the house of God and asked counsel of God and said, Which of us shall go up first to the battle against the sons of Benjamin? And the 
JDG.20.19	And the sons of Israel rose up in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.
JDG.20.20	And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and the men of Israel put themselves in order to fight against them at Gibeah.
JDG.20.21	And the sons of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah and destroyed down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites that day.
JDG.20.22	And the people encouraged themselves, and the men of Israel set their battle again in order in the place where they put themselves in order the first day.
JDG.20.23	(And the sons of Israel went up and wept before the 
JDG.20.24	And the sons of Israel came near against the sons of Benjamin the second day.
JDG.20.25	And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day and again destroyed down to the ground eighteen thousand of the sons of Israel; all these drew the sword.
JDG.20.26	Then all the sons of Israel and all the people went up and came unto the house of God and wept and sat there before the 
JDG.20.27	And the sons of Israel enquired of the 
JDG.20.28	and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of Benjamin, my brother, or shall I cease? And the 
JDG.20.29	And Israel set ambushes round about Gibeah.
JDG.20.30	And the sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and put themselves in order against Gibeah as at the other times.
JDG.20.31	And the sons of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city, and they began to smite of the people and kill as at the other times in the highways, one of which goes up to the house of God and the other to Gibeah by the field, and they killed about thirty men of Israel.
JDG.20.32	And the sons of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before us as at the first. But the sons of Israel said, Let us flee and draw them from the city unto the highways.
JDG.20.33	Then all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and put themselves in order at Baaltamar, and also those of the ambushes of Israel came forth out of their place, out of the meadows of Gibeah.
JDG.20.34	And ten thousand chosen men out of all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was sore; but they did not know that evil was near them.
JDG.20.35	And the 
JDG.20.36	So the sons of Benjamin saw that they were smitten, for the men of Israel had given place to the Benjamites because they trusted those of the ambushes which they had set behind Gibeah.
JDG.20.37	Then the men of the ambushes rushed upon Gibeah and spread out and smote all the city with the edge of the sword.
JDG.20.38	Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and the men of the ambushes that they should make a great signal by causing much smoke to rise up out of the city.
JDG.20.39	Then when the men of Israel turned their backs in the battle and those of Benjamin began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons, for they said, Surely they are smitten down before us as in the first battle.
JDG.20.40	But when the signal began to arise up out of the city, a pillar of smoke, those of Benjamin looked behind them, and, behold, the whole consumption of the city ascended up to heaven.
JDG.20.41	Then the men of Israel turned again, and the men of Benjamin were terrified, for they saw that evil was come upon them.
JDG.20.42	Therefore, they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto the way of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them, and those who came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.
JDG.20.43	Thus they inclosed those of Benjamin round about and chased them and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the sunrising.
JDG.20.44	And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were men of valour.
JDG.20.45	And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of Rimmon; and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of them.
JDG.20.46	So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.
JDG.20.47	But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the rock Rimmon and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.
JDG.20.48	And the men of Israel turned again upon the sons of Benjamin and smote them with the edge of the sword, men and beasts in every city and all that was found; they also set on fire all the cities that they came to.
JDG.21.1	Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, None of us shall give his daughter unto those of Benjamin to wife.
JDG.21.2	And the people came to the house of God and abode there until the evening before God and lifted up their voices and wept sore
JDG.21.3	and said, O 
JDG.21.4	And it came to pass on the next day that the people rose early and built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.
JDG.21.5	And the sons of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes of Israel that did not come up with the congregation unto the 
JDG.21.6	And the sons of Israel repented because of Benjamin their brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.
JDG.21.7	What shall we do for wives for those that remain, seeing we have sworn by the 
JDG.21.8	And they said, Is there anyone of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to Mizpeh to the 
JDG.21.9	For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.
JDG.21.10	Then the congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword with the women and the children.
JDG.21.11	And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy every male and every woman that has lain with a man.
JDG.21.12	And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four hundred young virgins that had known no man by lying with any male, and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.
JDG.21.13	Then the whole congregation sent some to speak to the sons of Benjamin that were in the rock of Rimmon and to call peaceably unto them.
JDG.21.14	And those of Benjamin had returned at that time; and they gave them as wives those whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead, and even so they were not enough.
JDG.21.15	And the people repented over Benjamin because the 
JDG.21.16	Then the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for those that remain? For the female sex had been destroyed out of Benjamin.
JDG.21.17	And they said, Let the inheritance of Benjamin be saved that a tribe not be destroyed out of Israel.
JDG.21.18	However, we may not give them wives of our daughters, for the sons of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that gives a wife to anyone of Benjamin.
JDG.21.19	Then they said, Behold, there is a solemn feast of the 
JDG.21.20	Therefore, they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in wait in the vineyards
JDG.21.21	and watch with care, and when you see the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come out of the vineyards, and each one of you shall rapture a wife of the daughters of Shiloh and go to the land of Benjamin.
JDG.21.22	And when their fathers or their brethren come unto us to complain, we will say unto them, Be merciful unto us for their sakes because in the war we did not take enough women for all of them; and you could not have given them to them, or ye should be guilty now.
JDG.21.23	And the sons of Benjamin did so and took themselves wives, according to their number, rapturing them from among those that danced; and they went and returned unto their inheritance and rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them.
JDG.21.24	Then the sons of Israel departed from there at that time, each man to his tribe and to his family, each one going from there to his inheritance.
JDG.21.25	In those days there was no king in Israel; each one did that which seemed right in his own eyes.
RUT.1.1	Now it came to pass in the days when the judges governed that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem of Judah went to sojourn in the fields of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.
RUT.1.2	And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem of Judah. And they came into the fields of Moab and continued there.
RUT.1.3	And Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left with her two sons,
RUT.1.4	who took wives for themselves of the women of Moab; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth; and they dwelt there about ten years.
RUT.1.5	And Mahlon and Chilion both died also; and the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.
RUT.1.6	Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, to return from the fields of Moab, for she had heard in the field of Moab how the 
RUT.1.7	Therefore she went forth out of the place where she had been and her two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return unto the land of Judah.
RUT.1.8	And Naomi said unto her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to thy mother’s house; the 
RUT.1.9	The 
RUT.1.10	And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy people.
RUT.1.11	And Naomi replied, Go back, my daughters; why must ye go with me? Do I have more sons in my womb that they may be your husbands?
RUT.1.12	Turn, my daughters, and go back, for I am too old to have a husband. Even if I should say, I have hope, if I should have a husband tonight and should also bear sons,
RUT.1.13	should ye tarry for them until they are grown? Should ye stay without husbands because of them? No, my daughters, for I have greater bitterness than you because the hand of the 
RUT.1.14	And they lifted up their voice and wept again, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth cleaved unto her.
RUT.1.15	And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods; return thou after thy sister-in-law.
RUT.1.16	And Ruth said, Do not intreat me to leave thee or to return from following after thee, for wherever thou goest, I will go; and wherever thou shalt lodge, I will lodge; thy people shall be my people and thy God my God.
RUT.1.17	Where thou diest, I will die, and there will I be buried; let the 
RUT.1.18	When she saw that she was courageous to go with her, then she left off speaking to her.
RUT.1.19	So the two walked until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, entering into Bethlehem, that all the city was moved because of them, and they said, Is this Naomi?
RUT.1.20	And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara; for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
RUT.1.21	I went out full, and the 
RUT.1.22	So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the fields of Moab, and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of strength, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.
RUT.2.2	And Ruth, the Moabitess, said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the field and glean ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.
RUT.2.3	And she went and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers, and it came to pass that her lot was to light on a part of the field belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.
RUT.2.4	And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem and said unto the reapers, The 
RUT.2.5	Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?
RUT.2.6	And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the damsel of Moab that came back with Naomi out of the fields of Moab;
RUT.2.7	and she has said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves; so she came and has continued from the morning until now except a short while that she was in the house.
RUT.2.8	Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hear, my daughter, do not glean in another field, nor leave here; thou shalt cleave to my maidens.
RUT.2.9	Look carefully upon the field that they reap and go after them, for I have charged the young men not to touch thee. And when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels and drink of that which the young men have drawn.
RUT.2.10	Then she fell on her face and bowed herself to the ground and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes that thou should acknowledge me, seeing I am a stranger?
RUT.2.11	And Boaz answered and said unto her, It has fully been showed me all that thou hast done unto thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother and the land of thy nativity and art come three days ago unto a people whom thou didst not know before.
RUT.2.12	Let the 
RUT.2.13	Then she said, Let me find grace in thy sight, my lord, for thou hast comforted me and hast spoken unto the heart of thy handmaid though I am not like unto one of thy handmaidens.
RUT.2.14	And Boaz said unto her at mealtime, Come here and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and he gave her of the pottage, and she ate and was satisfied, and some was left over.
RUT.2.15	And when she had risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves and do not reproach her
RUT.2.16	and let fall also some of the handfuls on purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and do not reprehend her.
RUT.2.17	So she gleaned in the field until evening and beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.
RUT.2.18	And she took it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also brought forth that which had been left over after she had been satisfied and gave it to her.
RUT.2.19	And her mother-in-law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned today? Where hast thou worked? Blessed be he that acknowledged thee. And she declared unto her mother-in-law all that had happened to her with him and said, The man’s name with whom I worked today is Boaz.
RUT.2.20	And Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law, Let him be blessed of the 
RUT.2.21	And Ruth, the Moabitess, said, He also said unto me, Thou shalt cleave to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.
RUT.2.22	And Naomi replied unto Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens that they not meet thee in any other field.
RUT.2.23	So she kept close by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Then Naomi, her mother-in-law, said unto her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee?
RUT.3.2	And now is not Boaz of our kindred with whose maidens thou wast? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.
RUT.3.3	Therefore, thou shalt wash thyself and anoint thyself and put thy raiment upon thee and go down to the threshingfloor, but do not make thyself known unto the man until he shall have finished eating and drinking.
RUT.3.4	And it shall be when he lies down that thou shalt perceive the place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lie down there, and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.
RUT.3.5	And she said unto her, All that thou dost command me I will do.
RUT.3.6	And she went down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.
RUT.3.7	And when Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was merry, he went to lie down at the end of the heap, and she came softly and uncovered his feet and lay down.
RUT.3.8	And it came to pass at midnight that the man was startled and took hold, and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.
RUT.3.9	Then he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth, thy handmaid; spread therefore the edge of thy mantle over thy handmaid; for thou art a redeemer.
RUT.3.10	And he said, Blessed be thou of the 
RUT.3.11	And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do unto thee all that thou hast said, for all the city of my people know that thou art a valiant woman.
RUT.3.12	And now it is true that I am thy redeemer; however, there is another redeemer nearer than I (in kinship).
RUT.3.13	Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning that if he will redeem thee, well, let him redeem thee, but if he does not wish to redeem, then I will redeem thee, as the 
RUT.3.14	And she lay at his feet until the morning, and she rose up before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that the woman has come to the threshing floor.
RUT.3.15	Also he said, Bring the veil that thou hast upon thee and hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley and laid it on her, and she went into the city.
RUT.3.16	And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, What now, my daughter? And she told her all that had happened to her with the man.
RUT.3.17	And she said, He gave me these six measures of barley, saying, Do not go empty unto thy mother-in-law.
RUT.3.18	Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou shall know how the matter will fall, for that man will not rest until he has concluded the thing today.
RUT.4.1	And Boaz went up to the gate and sat down there, and, behold, the redeemer of whom Boaz spoke came by unto whom he said, Ho, such a one! Come here and sit down. And he came and sat down.
RUT.4.2	Then he took ten men of the elders of the city and said, Sit down here. And they sat down.
RUT.4.3	And he said unto the redeemer, Naomi, that is come again out of the field of Moab, sold a parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech’s,
RUT.4.4	and I decided to cause thee to know this and tell thee to take it before the inhabitants and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt redeem it, redeem it, but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell me that I may know, for there is no one to redeem it besides thee, and I after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz replied, The day that thou dost receive the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must also receive Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
RUT.4.6	And the redeemer said, I cannot redeem it for myself lest I ruin my own inheritance; redeem thou; I cede my right to you, for I shall not be able to redeem it.
RUT.4.7	Now for a long time in Israel there had been this custom concerning redemption or contracts, that for the confirmation of all matters: one plucked off his shoe and gave it to his neighbour, and this was a testimony in Israel.
RUT.4.8	Therefore, the former owner of the right of redemption said unto Boaz, Buy it thyself. So he drew off his shoe.
RUT.4.9	And Boaz said unto the elders and unto all the people, Ye are witnesses this day that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s and all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.
RUT.4.10	Moreover, I also take Ruth, the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, as my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brethren and from the gate of his place. Ye shall be witnesses of this today.
RUT.4.11	And all the people that were in the gate and the elders, said, We are witnesses. The 
RUT.4.12	let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bore unto Judah, of the seed which the 
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife, and when he went in unto her, the 
RUT.4.14	And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the 
RUT.4.15	And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy soul and a sustainer in thy old age, for thy daughter-in-law, whom thou doth love, who is better to thee than seven sons, has given birth.
RUT.4.16	And Naomi took the child and laid it in her bosom and was his nurse.
RUT.4.17	And the women, her neighbours, named him, saying, There is a son born to Naomi, and they called his name Obed. This is the father of Jesse, the father of David.
RUT.4.18	Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,
RUT.4.19	and Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,
RUT.4.20	and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,
RUT.4.21	and Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,
RUT.4.22	and Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.
1SA.1.1	Now there was a certain man of Ramath of Zophim, of Mount Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite.
1SA.1.2	And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
1SA.1.3	And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.1.4	And when the day would come, Elkanah would sacrifice, and he would give portions to Peninnah his wife and to all her sons and her daughters.
1SA.1.5	But unto Hannah he would give a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah, even though the 
1SA.1.6	And her rival provoked her to anger and sorrow because the 
1SA.1.7	And this would happen year by year when she went up to the house of the 
1SA.1.8	Then Elkanah, her husband, said to her, Hannah, why dost thou weep? And why dost thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? Am I not better to thee than ten sons?
1SA.1.9	So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post of the temple of the 
1SA.1.10	And she was in bitterness of soul and prayed unto the 
1SA.1.11	and she vowed a vow and said, O 
1SA.1.12	And it came to pass as she continued praying before the 
1SA.1.13	Now Hannah spoke in her heart and only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard; therefore, Eli thought she was drunk.
1SA.1.14	And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.
1SA.1.15	And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the 
1SA.1.16	Do not count thy handmaid for a daughter of Belial, for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief I have waited until now to speak.
1SA.1.17	Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.
1SA.1.18	And she said, Let thy handmaid find grace in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no longer sad.
1SA.1.19	And they rose up in the morning early and worshipped before the 
1SA.1.20	Therefore, it came to pass when the time was come about after Hannah had conceived, she bore a son and called his name Samuel, {Heb. heard of God}, saying, Because I have asked him of the 
1SA.1.21	And the man Elkanah and all his house went up to offer unto the 
1SA.1.22	But Hannah did not go up, for she said unto her husband, I will not go up until the child is weaned, and then I will bring him that he may be presented before the 
1SA.1.23	And Elkanah, her husband, said unto her, Do what seems good unto thee; tarry until thou hast weaned him; only let the 
1SA.1.24	And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks and one ephah of flour and a bottle of wine, and brought him unto the house of the 
1SA.1.25	And they slew a bullock and brought the child to Eli.
1SA.1.26	And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the 
1SA.1.27	For this child I prayed, and the 
1SA.1.28	Therefore, I also have given him back to the 
1SA.2.1	And Hannah prayed and said, My heart rejoices in the 
1SA.2.2	There is none holy as the 
1SA.2.3	Do not multiply thyself speaking great and lofty things; let arrogant words cease from your mouth, for the 
1SA.2.4	The bows of the mighty men have been broken, and the weak are girded with strength.
1SA.2.5	Those that were full have hired themselves out for bread, and those that were hungry ceased so that the barren has given birth to seven, and she that has many children is waxed feeble.
1SA.2.6	The 
1SA.2.7	The 
1SA.2.8	He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill to set them among princes and to make them inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are the 
1SA.2.9	He keeps the feet of his saints, and the wicked perish in darkness, for no man shall prevail by their own strength.
1SA.2.10	, thine adversaries shall be broken to pieces; out of heaven he shall thunder upon them. The 
1SA.2.11	And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child ministered unto the 
1SA.2.12	But the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they did not know the 
1SA.2.13	It was the priests’ custom with the people that when anyone offered a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come, while the flesh was being boiled, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his hand;
1SA.2.14	and he would strike it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot, and all that the fleshhook brought up, the priest took for himself. Thus would they do in Shiloh to all the Israelites that went there.
1SA.2.15	Likewise, before they burnt the fat, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not take cooked flesh of thee, but raw.
1SA.2.16	And if the man would say unto him, Let them not fail to burn the fat today and then take as much as thy soul desires, then he would answer him, No, but thou shalt give it to me now, and if not, I will take it by force.
1SA.2.17	Therefore, the sin of the young men was very great before the 
1SA.2.18	But Samuel ministered before the 
1SA.2.19	Moreover his mother made him a little coat and brought it to him each year when she came up with her husband to offer the accustomed sacrifice.
1SA.2.20	And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife and said, The 
1SA.2.21	And the 
1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old and heard all that his sons did unto all Israel and how they lay with the women that served at the door of the tabernacle of the testimony.
1SA.2.23	And he said unto them, Why do ye do such things? For I hear from all the people of your evil dealings.
1SA.2.24	No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear that ye cause the people of the 
1SA.2.25	If one man sins against another, the judges shall judge him, but if someone sins against the 
1SA.2.26	And the child Samuel kept on growing and was in favour both with the 
1SA.2.27	And a man of God came unto Eli and said unto him, Thus saith the 
1SA.2.28	And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer upon my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me, and I gave unto the house of thy father all the offerings on fire of the sons of Israel.
1SA.2.29	Why do ye trample my sacrifices and my offerings which I have commanded to be offered in my tabernacle and honor thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the offerings of Israel my people?
1SA.2.30	Therefore, the 
1SA.2.31	Behold, the days come that I will cut off thine arm and the arm of thy father’s house that there shall not be an old man in thy house.
1SA.2.32	And thou shalt see a competitor in my tabernacle in all the things in which I shall do good unto Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house for ever.
1SA.2.33	I shall not totally cut off all thy men from my altar to consume thine eyes and to grieve thy soul, and all the increase of thy house shall die as young men.
1SA.2.34	And this shall be a sign unto thee that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: in one day they shall both die.
1SA.2.35	And I will raise me up a faithful priest that shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind, and I will build him a sure house, and he shall walk before my anointed {Heb. Messiah} for ever.
1SA.2.36	And it shall come to pass that every one that is left in thy house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver and a morsel of bread and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into some aspect of the priesthood that I may eat a piece of bread.
1SA.3.1	And the child Samuel ministered unto the 
1SA.3.2	And it came to pass one day when Eli was lain down in his place, his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;
1SA.3.3	and before the lamp of God was put out, Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the 
1SA.3.4	and the 
1SA.3.5	And he ran unto Eli and said, Here am I, for thou didst call me. And he said, I did not call; lie down again. And he went and lay down.
1SA.3.6	And the 
1SA.3.7	Now Samuel did not yet know the 
1SA.3.8	And the 
1SA.3.9	Therefore, Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down, and it shall be if he calls thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, 
1SA.3.10	And the 
1SA.3.11	And the 
1SA.3.12	In that day I will perform against Eli all the things which I have spoken concerning his house; when I begin, I will also make an end.
1SA.3.13	For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows of (because his sons made themselves vile, and he did not restrain them).
1SA.3.14	And therefore, I have sworn unto the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli’s house shall not be reconciled, not with sacrifices nor with presents for ever.
1SA.3.15	And Samuel lay until the morning and opened the doors of the house of the 
1SA.3.16	Then Eli called Samuel and said, Samuel, my son. And he answered, Here am I.
1SA.3.17	And he said, What is the word that the 
1SA.3.18	And Samuel declared all of it to him without hiding any thing. Then he said, It is the 
1SA.3.19	And Samuel grew, and the 
1SA.3.20	And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was a faithful prophet of the 
1SA.3.21	Thus the 
1SA.4.1	And Samuel spoke unto all Israel. Now at that time Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and pitched their camp beside Ebenezer; and the Philistines pitched theirs in Aphek.
1SA.4.2	And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel; and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines, who slew of the army in the field about four thousand men.
1SA.4.3	And when the people returned into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has the 
1SA.4.4	So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.5	And when the ark of the covenant of the 
1SA.4.6	And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What great shout of joy is this in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the 
1SA.4.7	And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! For yesterday and day before yesterday it was not so.
1SA.4.8	Woe unto us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues in the wilderness.
1SA.4.9	Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye not serve the Hebrews as they have served you; quit yourselves like men and fight.
1SA.4.10	And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled each one into his tent, and there was a very great slaughter, for thirty thousand footmen of Israel fell.
1SA.4.11	And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain.
1SA.4.12	And running out of the battle, a man of Benjamin came to Shiloh that same day with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head.
1SA.4.13	And when he came, behold Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and gave the news, all the city cried out.
1SA.4.14	And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What is the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily and told Eli.
1SA.4.15	Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes had become dim so that he could not see.
1SA.4.16	And the man said unto Eli, I come from the battle; I fled today out of the army. And he said unto him, What has happened, my son?
1SA.4.17	And the messenger answered and said, Israel fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God was taken.
1SA.4.18	And it came to pass when he made mention of the ark of God, Eli fell from off the seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck broke, and he died; for he was an old man and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.
1SA.4.19	And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’s wife, was with child, near to be delivered, and when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was taken and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and travailed, for her pains had come upon her.
1SA.4.20	And about the time of her death the women that stood by her said unto her, Fear not, for thou hast given birth to a son. But she did not answer, neither did she regard it.
1SA.4.21	And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed from Israel! (Because the ark of God was taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.)
1SA.4.22	Therefore, she said, The glory is departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.
1SA.5.1	And the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod.
1SA.5.2	When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into the house of Dagon and set it by Dagon.
1SA.5.3	And when those of Ashdod arose early in the morning, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of the 
1SA.5.4	And when they arose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the 
1SA.5.5	Therefore, neither the priests of Dagon nor any that come into Dagon’s temple tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto this day.
1SA.5.6	But the hand of the 
1SA.5.7	And when they saw this, those of Ashdod said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us, for his hand is sore upon us and upon Dagon our god.
1SA.5.8	They sent, therefore, and gathered all the cardinals of the Philistines unto themselves and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be removed unto Gath. And they removed the ark of the God of Israel there.
1SA.5.9	And it came to pass that after they had removed it, the hand of the 
1SA.5.10	Therefore, they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And when the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have removed the ark of the God of Israel unto us to kill me and my people.
1SA.5.11	So they sent and gathered together all the cardinals of the Philistines and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it go again to his own place, that it not kill me and my people, for there was a deadly destruction throughout all the city, and the hand of God had become very heavy there.
1SA.5.12	And those that did not die were smitten with the hemorrhoids, and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
1SA.6.1	And the ark of the 
1SA.6.2	Then the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners, saying, What shall we do with the ark of the 
1SA.6.3	And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but ye shall pay unto him the expiation of guilt; then ye shall be healed, and ye shall know why his hand was not removed from you.
1SA.6.4	Then said they, What shall be the expiation of guilt which we shall pay unto him? They answered, Five golden hemorrhoids and five golden rats, according to the number of the cardinals of the Philistines, for the same plague that is on you is also on your cardinals.
1SA.6.5	Therefore, ye shall make images of your hemorrhoids and images of your rats that destroy the land, and ye shall give glory unto the God of Israel; peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you and from off your gods and from off your land.
1SA.6.6	Why then do ye harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When he had dealt thus among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?
1SA.6.7	Now, therefore, make a new cart and take two milk cows, on which no yoke has been placed and tie the cows to the cart and bring their calves home from them.
1SA.6.8	Then ye shall take the ark of the 
1SA.6.9	And see if it goes up by the way of his own border to Bethshemesh, then he has done us this great evil, but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us; it was an accident that happened to us.
1SA.6.10	And the men did so and took two milk cows and tied them to the cart and shut up their calves at home.
1SA.6.11	Then they laid the ark of the 
1SA.6.12	And the cows went straight down the way of Bethshemesh and went along the highway, lowing as they went and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left, and the cardinals of the Philistines went after them unto the border of Bethshemesh.
1SA.6.13	And those of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley, and they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it.
1SA.6.14	And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and stopped there, for there was a great stone there; and they clave the wood of the cart and offered the cows in a burnt offering unto the 
1SA.6.15	And the Levites took down the ark of the 
1SA.6.16	And when the five cardinals of the Philistines had seen it, they returned to Ekron the same day.
1SA.6.17	These, therefore are the golden hemorrhoids which the Philistines returned in expiation for their guilt unto the 
1SA.6.18	and the golden rats, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five cardinals; a ransom for those of the fenced cities and for the country dwellers even unto the great stone of Abel, upon which they placed the ark of the 
1SA.6.19	Then God smote those of Bethshemesh because they had looked at the ark of the 
1SA.6.20	And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before this holy 
1SA.6.21	And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have returned the ark of the 
1SA.7.1	And the men of Kirjathjearim came and carried up the ark of the 
1SA.7.2	And it came to pass while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim, that the time was long, for it was twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the 
1SA.7.3	And Samuel spoke unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye return unto the 
1SA.7.4	Then the sons of Israel did put away the Baalim and Ashtaroth and served the 
1SA.7.5	And Samuel said, Gather all Israel in Mizpeh, and I will pray for you unto the 
1SA.7.6	And they gathered together in Mizpeh and drew water and poured it out before the 
1SA.7.7	And when the Philistines heard that the sons of Israel were gathered together in Mizpeh, the cardinals of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines.
1SA.7.8	And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry unto the 
1SA.7.9	And Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it for a burnt offering completely unto the 
1SA.7.10	And it came to pass as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering that the Philistines drew near to battle against Israel. But the 
1SA.7.11	And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh and pursued the Philistines and smote them until they were below Bethcar.
1SA.7.12	Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpeh and Shen and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Thus far the 
1SA.7.13	So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into the border of Israel, and the hand of the 
1SA.7.14	And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel from Ekron even unto Gath with their borders, and Israel delivered them out of the hands of the Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorite.
1SA.7.15	And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.
1SA.7.16	And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpeh and judged Israel in all those places.
1SA.7.17	Then he would return to Ramah, for there was his house, and there he judged Israel, and there he built an altar unto the 
1SA.8.1	And it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel.
1SA.8.2	Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abiah; they were judges in Beersheba.
1SA.8.3	And his sons did not walk in his ways but turned aside after greed, receiving bribes and perverting that which is right.
1SA.8.4	Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together and came to Samuel in Ramah
1SA.8.5	and said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons do not walk in thy ways; therefore make us a king to judge us like all the Gentiles.
1SA.8.6	But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the 
1SA.8.7	And the 
1SA.8.8	According to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day, with which they have forsaken me and served other gods, so they also do unto thee.
1SA.8.9	Now, therefore, hearken unto their voice; however first protest solemnly against them by declaring unto them the rights of the king that shall reign over them.
1SA.8.10	And Samuel told all the words of the 
1SA.8.11	And he said, This will be the right of the king that shall reign over you: He will take your sons and appoint them for himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen, and some shall run before his chariot.
1SA.8.12	And he will appoint captains over thousands and captains over fifties and will set them to plough his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his weapons of war and the munitions of his chariots.
1SA.8.13	And he will take your daughters to be confectioneries and to be cooks and to be bakers.
1SA.8.14	And he will take your fields and your vineyards and your good oliveyards and give them to his slaves.
1SA.8.15	And he will take the tenth of your seed and of your vineyards to give to his officers and to his slaves.
1SA.8.16	And he will take your menslaves and your maidslaves and your good young men and your asses and do his work with them.
1SA.8.17	He will also take the tenth of your sheep, and finally ye shall be his slaves.
1SA.8.18	And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye shall have chosen you, and the 
1SA.8.19	Nevertheless, the people refused to hear the voice of Samuel, and they said, No, but we will have a king over us
1SA.8.20	that we also may be like all the Gentiles and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles.
1SA.8.21	And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed them in the ears of the 
1SA.8.22	And the 
1SA.9.1	Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a son of Jemini, {Benjamin}, a mighty man of power.
1SA.9.2	And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. Among the sons of Israel there was not a nicer person than he; from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.
1SA.9.3	And the she asses of Kish, Saul’s father, were lost. And Kish said to Saul, his son, Take now one of the slaves with thee, and arise, go seek the asses.
1SA.9.4	And he passed through Mount Ephraim and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shalim, and they were not there, and he passed through the land of Jemini, {or of Benjamin}, but they did not find them.
1SA.9.5	And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses and take thought for us.
1SA.9.6	And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honorable man; all that he says surely comes to pass; now let us go there; peradventure he can show us our way that we should go.
1SA.9.7	Then Saul replied unto his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? For the bread is spent in our vessels, and we have nothing to present unto the man of God. What do we have?
1SA.9.8	And the servant answered Saul again and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver; this will I give to the man of God to tell us our way.
1SA.9.9	(Beforetime in Israel when anyone went to enquire of God, he spoke thus, Come, and let us go to the seer, for he that is now called a Prophet was called a Seer before.)
1SA.9.10	Then Saul said to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was.
1SA.9.11	And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water and said unto them, Is the seer here?
1SA.9.12	And they answered them and said, He is; behold, he is before you; make haste now, for he came today to the city, for there is a sacrifice of the people today in the high place.
1SA.9.13	As soon as you are come into the city, ye shall straightway find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes because he must bless the sacrifice, and afterwards those that are invited eat. Now therefore go up, for about this time ye shall find him.
1SA.9.14	And they went up into the city. And when they were come into the city, behold, Samuel came out before them to go up to the high place.
1SA.9.15	Now the 
1SA.9.16	Tomorrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be prince over my people Israel that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines, for I have looked upon my people because their cry is come unto me.
1SA.9.17	And when Samuel saw Saul, the 
1SA.9.18	Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer’s house is.
1SA.9.19	And Samuel answered Saul and said, I am the seer; go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me today, and tomorrow I will let thee go and will tell thee all that is in thy heart.
1SA.9.20	And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, take no care for them, for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of Israel? Is it not on thee and on all thy father’s house?
1SA.9.21	And Saul answered and said, Peradventure am I not of Jemini, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And is my family not the least of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why, therefore, dost thou speak so to me?
1SA.9.22	And Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the banquet chamber and made them sit at the head among those that were invited, which were about thirty persons.
1SA.9.23	And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it aside.
1SA.9.24	And the cook took up the shoulder and that which was upon it and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which was reserved! Set it before thee and eat because for this time it has been kept for thee, since I said, I have invited the people. So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
1SA.9.25	And when they were come down from the high place into the city, he spoke with Saul upon the top of the house.
1SA.9.26	And they arose early about dawn, and Samuel called Saul, who was on the top of the house, saying, Rise up that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.
1SA.9.27	And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while that I may declare thee the word of God.
1SA.10.1	Then Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it upon his head and kissed him and said, Is it not because the 
1SA.10.2	When thou art departed from me today, then thou shalt find two men by Rachel’s sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou didst go to seek are found, and thy father has left the care of the asses and sorrows for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?
1SA.10.3	Then shalt thou go on forward from there, and thou shalt come to the plain of Tabor, and three men going up to God to Bethel shall meet thee, one carrying three kids and another carrying three loaves of bread and another carrying a bottle of wine.
1SA.10.4	And they will salute thee and give thee two loaves of bread; which thou shalt receive of their hands.
1SA.10.5	After that thou shalt come to the hill of God where the garrison of the Philistines is, and it shall come to pass when thou art come there to the city, that thou shalt meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery and a tambourine and a pipe and a harp before them; and they shall prophesy.
1SA.10.6	And the Spirit of the 
1SA.10.7	And let it be when these signs are come unto thee that thou do according as thou shalt find at hand, for God is with thee.
1SA.10.8	And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal, and, behold, I will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings. Seven days shalt thou tarry until I come to thee and show thee what thou shalt do.
1SA.10.9	And it was so that when he had turned his shoulder to go from Samuel, God gave him another heart, and all those signs came to pass that day.
1SA.10.10	And when they came there to the hill, behold, the company of prophets met him, and the Spirit of God prospered him, and he prophesied among them.
1SA.10.11	And it came to pass when all that knew him beforetime saw that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the people said one to another, What has happened to the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?
1SA.10.12	And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their father? Therefore, it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1SA.10.13	And he ceased prophesying and came to the high place.
1SA.10.14	And Saul’s uncle said unto him and to his servant, Where went ye? And he said, To seek the asses, and when we saw that they were nowhere, we came to Samuel.
1SA.10.15	And Saul’s uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said unto you.
1SA.10.16	And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel spoke, he did not tell him.
1SA.10.17	And Samuel called the people together unto the 
1SA.10.18	and said unto the sons of Israel, Thus hath the 
1SA.10.19	But ye have this day rejected your God, who saves you out of all your afflictions and your troubles, and ye have said unto him, No, but set a king over us. Now, therefore, present yourselves before the 
1SA.10.20	And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.
1SA.10.21	When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their lineages, the family of Matri was taken, and from it Saul the son of Kish was taken, and when they sought him, he could not be found.
1SA.10.22	Therefore, they enquired of the 
1SA.10.23	And they ran and took him from there, and when he stood among the people, he was higher than any of the people from his shoulders and upward.
1SA.10.24	And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the 
1SA.10.25	Then Samuel recited unto the people the rights of the kingdom and wrote it in a book and laid it up before the 
1SA.10.26	And Saul also went home to Gibeah, and there went with him some from the army, whose hearts God had touched.
1SA.10.27	But the sons of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him and brought him no presents. But he pretended not to notice.
1SA.11.1	Then Nahash, the Ammonite, came up and encamped against Jabeshgilead. And all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.
1SA.11.2	And Nahash, the Ammonite, answered them, On this condition will I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your right eyes and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.
1SA.11.3	And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days’ respite, that we may send messengers unto all the borders of Israel, and then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to thee.
1SA.11.4	Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the tidings in the ears of the people, and all the people lifted up their voices and wept.
1SA.11.5	And, behold, Saul came after the oxen out of the field, and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep? And they told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.
1SA.11.6	And the Spirit of God prospered Saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.
1SA.11.7	And he took a yoke of oxen and hewed them in pieces and sent them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hands of messengers, saying, Whoever does not come forth after Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear of the 
1SA.11.8	And when he numbered them in Bezek, the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand and the men of Judah thirty thousand.
1SA.11.9	And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say unto the men of Jabeshgilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, ye shall have salvation. And the messengers came and declared it to the men of Jabesh, and they were glad.
1SA.11.10	Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seems good unto you.
1SA.11.11	And it was so on the next day that Saul put the people in order in three companies, and they came into the midst of the host in the morning watch and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the day, and it came to pass that those who remained were scattered so that two of them were not left together.
1SA.11.12	Then the people said unto Samuel, Who were those that said, Shall Saul reign over us? Bring the men, that we may put them to death.
1SA.11.13	And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day, for today the 
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.
1SA.11.15	And all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the 
1SA.12.1	And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto your voice in all that ye said unto me and have made a king over you.
1SA.12.2	And now, behold, your king walks before you. I am old and grayheaded, and, behold, my sons are with you, and I have walked before you from my childhood unto this day.
1SA.12.3	Behold, here I am; witness against me before the 
1SA.12.4	And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us nor oppressed us; neither hast thou taken anything of any man’s hand.
1SA.12.5	And he said unto them, The 
1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said unto the people, The 
1SA.12.7	Now, therefore, stand still that I may contend with you before the 
1SA.12.8	After Jacob had entered into Egypt and your fathers cried unto the 
1SA.12.9	And when they forgot the 
1SA.12.10	And they cried unto the 
1SA.12.11	Then the 
1SA.12.12	And when ye saw that Nahash, the king of the sons of Ammon, came against you, ye said unto me, No, but a king shall reign over us when the 
1SA.12.13	Now, therefore, behold the king whom ye have chosen and whom ye have desired! Behold, the 
1SA.12.14	If ye will fear the 
1SA.12.15	But if ye will not hear the voice of the 
1SA.12.16	Now, therefore, stand and see this great thing, which the 
1SA.12.17	Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the 
1SA.12.18	So Samuel called unto the 
1SA.12.19	And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy slaves unto the 
1SA.12.20	And Samuel said unto the people, Do not fear. Ye have done all this wickedness, yet do not turn aside from following the 
1SA.12.21	do not turn aside after vain things which cannot profit nor deliver, for they are vain.
1SA.12.22	For the 
1SA.12.23	Moreover as for me, in no wise should I sin against the 
1SA.12.24	Only fear the 
1SA.12.25	But if ye shall persevere in doing wickedly, both ye and your king shall perish.
1SA.13.1	Saul was as a son of one year when he began to reign, and when he had reigned two years over Israel,
1SA.13.2	Saul chose three thousand men of Israel, of which two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in Mount Bethel and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin; and of the rest of the people he sent each one to his tent.
1SA.13.3	And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul caused the shofar to be blown throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.
1SA.13.4	And all Israel heard it said that Saul had smitten a garrison of the Philistines and also that Israel had become a stench unto the Philistines. And the people were called together after Saul to Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	Then the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude; and they came up and pitched camp in Michmash, eastward from Bethaven.
1SA.13.6	When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hid themselves in caves and in thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits.
1SA.13.7	And some of the Hebrews went over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.
1SA.13.8	And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel had appointed, but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were deserting from him.
1SA.13.9	Then Saul said, Bring me a burnt offering and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.
1SA.13.10	And it came to pass that as soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him that he might bless him.
1SA.13.11	Then Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I saw that the people were leaving me and that thou didst not come within the days appointed and that the Philistines gathered themselves together at Michmash,
1SA.13.12	therefore, I said, The Philistines will come down now upon me to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the 
1SA.13.13	Then Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; thou hast not kept the commandment of the 
1SA.13.14	But now thy kingdom shall not stand; the 
1SA.13.15	And Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with him, about six hundred men.
1SA.13.16	And Saul and Jonathan, his son, and the people that were present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin, but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.
1SA.13.17	And three companies came out of the camp of the Philistines to destroy the land. One company turned unto the way that leads to Ophrah unto the land of Shual.
1SA.13.18	Another company turned the way to Bethhoron, and another company turned to the way of the border that looks to the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.
1SA.13.19	Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel, for the Philistines had said, Lest peradventure the Hebrews make swords or spears.
1SA.13.20	But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen each man his share and his coulter and his axe and his mattock
1SA.13.21	and when they had nicks in the mattocks and the coulters and the forks and the axes, or to fix a goad.
1SA.13.22	So it came to pass in the day of battle that there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people that were with Saul and Jonathan except with Saul and with Jonathan his son who had them.
1SA.13.23	And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of Michmash.
1SA.14.1	Now it came to pass upon a day that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said unto the young man that bore his armour, Come and let us go over to the Philistines’ garrison that is on the other side. But he did not tell his father.
1SA.14.2	And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree which is in Migron, and the people that were with him were about six hundred men;
1SA.14.3	and Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod’s brother, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the 
1SA.14.4	And between the passages by which Jonathan sought to go over unto the Philistines’ garrison, there was a sharp rock on the one side and a sharp rock on the other side; and the name of the one was Bozez and the name of the other Seneh.
1SA.14.5	The forefront of the one was situated northward over against Michmash and the other towards the Negev over against Gibeah.
1SA.14.6	And Jonathan said to the young man that bore his armour, Come and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised; peradventure the 
1SA.14.7	And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thy heart; go. Behold, I am with thee according to thy will.
1SA.14.8	Then Jonathan said, Behold, we will go over unto these men, and we will show ourselves unto them.
1SA.14.9	If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you, then we will stand still in our place and will not go up unto them.
1SA.14.10	But if they say thus, Come up unto us, then we will go up, for the 
1SA.14.11	And both of them showed themselves unto the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.
1SA.14.12	And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armourbearer and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing. Then Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after me, for the 
1SA.14.13	And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet and his armourbearer after him; and they fell before Jonathan, and his armourbearer slew after him.
1SA.14.14	And that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armourbearer made was about twenty men within as it were a half acre of land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.
1SA.14.15	And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among all the people of the garrison; and those who had gone out to destroy the land, they also trembled, and the earth quaked, and there was fear of God.
1SA.14.16	And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and, behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating down one another.
1SA.14.17	Then Saul said unto the people that were with him, Number now and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.
1SA.14.18	And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring the ark of God. For the ark of God was at that time with the sons of Israel.
1SA.14.19	And it came to pass while Saul talked unto the priest, that the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased. Then Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thy hand.
1SA.14.20	And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled themselves, and they came to the battle; and, behold, each man’s sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great discomfiture.
1SA.14.21	Moreover, the Hebrews that had been with the Philistines before that time, who had gone up with them into the camp from the country round about, even they also turned to be with the Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.
1SA.14.22	Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in Mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, they also followed hard after them in the battle.
1SA.14.23	So the 
1SA.14.24	But the men of Israel were distressed that day, for Saul had adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food until evening that I may be avenged on my enemies. So none of the people tasted any food.
1SA.14.25	And the army of all the land came to a wood, and there was honey upon the ground.
1SA.14.26	And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped, but no man put his hand to his mouth, for the people feared the oath.
1SA.14.27	But Jonathan had not heard when his father charged the people with the oath, therefore, he put forth the end of the rod that was in his hand and dipped it in a honeycomb and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes were enlightened.
1SA.14.28	Then one of the people spoke and said, Thy father straitly charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man that eats any food this day. And the people were faint.
1SA.14.29	Then Jonathan said, My father has troubled the land. See, I pray you, how my eyes have been enlightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
1SA.14.30	How much more if haply the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found? Would there not have been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?
1SA.14.31	And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon, but the people were very faint.
1SA.14.32	Therefore, the people flew upon the spoil and took sheep and oxen and calves and slew them on the ground, and the people ate them with the blood.
1SA.14.33	Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against the 
1SA.14.34	And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people and tell each one to bring his ox and his sheep here unto me and slay them here and eat and do not sin against the 
1SA.14.35	And Saul built an altar unto the 
1SA.14.36	And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them. And they said, Do whatever seems good unto thee. Then the priest said, Let us draw near unto God here.
1SA.14.37	And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel? But he did not answer him that day.
1SA.14.38	Then Saul said, Bring here all the chief of the people and know and see by whom this sin has been this day.
1SA.14.39	For, as the 
1SA.14.40	Then he said unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said unto Saul, Do what seems good unto thee.
1SA.14.41	Therefore, Saul said unto the 
1SA.14.42	And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And Jonathan was taken.
1SA.14.43	Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; must I die for this.
1SA.14.44	And Saul answered, God do so and more also, for thou shalt surely die, Jonathan.
1SA.14.45	Then the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great saving health in Israel? No, in no wise: as the 
1SA.14.46	Then Saul went up from following the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.
1SA.14.47	So Saul took the kingdom over Israel and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab and against the sons of Ammon and against Edom and against the kings of Zobah and against the Philistines; and wherever he turned himself, he troubled them.
1SA.14.48	And he gathered a host and smote Amalek and delivered Israel out of the hands of those that spoiled them.
1SA.14.49	Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan and Ishui and Melchishua. And the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn Merab and the name of the younger Michal.
1SA.14.50	And the name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. And the name of the captain of his host was Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle.
1SA.14.51	For Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner, the father of Abner, was the son of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	And there was intense war against the Philistines all the days of Saul, and when Saul saw any strong man or any valiant man, he took him unto him.
1SA.15.1	And Samuel said unto Saul, The 
1SA.15.2	Thus hath said the 
1SA.15.3	Now go and smite Amalek and utterly destroy all that they have and spare him not, but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.
1SA.15.4	And Saul gathered the people together and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen and ten thousand men of Judah.
1SA.15.5	And Saul came to a city of Amalek and laid wait in the valley.
1SA.15.6	And Saul said unto the Kenite, Go, depart, go out from among those of Amalek lest I destroy you with them, for ye showed mercy to all the sons of Israel when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenite departed from among those of Amalek.
1SA.15.7	And Saul smote Amalek from Havilah until thou comest to Shur that is over against Egypt.
1SA.15.8	And he took Agag, the king of the Amalekites, alive and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.
1SA.15.9	But Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings and the lambs and all that was good and would not utterly destroy them, but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.
1SA.15.10	Then the word of the 
1SA.15.11	It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king, for he has turned back from following me and has not performed my commandments. And it incensed Samuel, and he cried unto the 
1SA.15.12	And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set himself up a monument and is gone about and passed on and gone down to Gilgal.
1SA.15.13	And Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the 
1SA.15.14	Then Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?
1SA.15.15	And Saul said, They have brought them from Amalek, for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.15.16	Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the 
1SA.15.17	And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the 
1SA.15.18	And the 
1SA.15.19	Why then didst thou not hear the voice of the 
1SA.15.20	And Saul said unto Samuel, But I have obeyed the voice of the 
1SA.15.21	But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the firstfruits of the anathema, to sacrifice them unto the 
1SA.15.22	And Samuel said, Does the 
1SA.15.23	For rebellion is the sin of witchcraft, and to break the word of the Lord is iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.24	Then Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the 
1SA.15.25	Now, therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin and turn again with me that I may worship the 
1SA.15.26	And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee, for thou hast rejected the word of the 
1SA.15.27	And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.
1SA.15.28	And Samuel said unto him, The 
1SA.15.29	And also the Overcomer of Israel will not lie nor repent concerning this, for he is not a man, that he should repent.
1SA.15.30	Then he said, I have sinned; yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people and before Israel and turn again with me that I may worship the 
1SA.15.31	So Samuel turned again after Saul, and Saul worshipped the 
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, Bring me Agag, the king of Amalek. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is near.
1SA.15.33	And Samuel said, As thy sword has made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. Then Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the 
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul.
1SA.15.35	And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death; nevertheless, Samuel mourned for Saul because the 
1SA.16.1	And the 
1SA.16.2	And Samuel said, How can I go? If Saul understands it, he will kill me. And the 
1SA.16.3	And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show thee what thou shalt do, and thou shalt anoint unto me the one whom I name unto thee.
1SA.16.4	And Samuel did as the 
1SA.16.5	And he said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice unto the 
1SA.16.6	And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab and said, Peradventure is the 
1SA.16.7	And the 
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab and made him pass before Samuel. And he said, Neither has the 
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither has the 
1SA.16.10	Again, Jesse made his seven sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said unto Jesse, The 
1SA.16.11	And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are all thy young men here? And he said, There remains yet the youngest, and, behold, he keeps the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send for him, for we will not sit down to the table until he comes here.
1SA.16.12	And he sent and brought him in. Now he was ruddy and of a beautiful countenance and handsome. And the 
1SA.16.13	Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him from among his brethren; and the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.14	But the Spirit of the 
1SA.16.15	And Saul’s slaves said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit from God troubles thee.
1SA.16.16	Let our lord now command thy slaves, which are before thee, to seek out a man who is a cunning player on a harp, and it shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon thee, that he shall play with his hand and thou shalt have relief.
1SA.16.17	And Saul said unto his slaves, Provide me now a man that can play well and bring him to me.
1SA.16.18	Then one of the servants answered and said, Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem, that is cunning in playing and a mighty valiant man and a man of war and prudent in speech and handsome, and the 
1SA.16.19	Therefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse and said, Send me David, thy son, who is with the sheep.
1SA.16.20	And Jesse took an ass laden with bread and a bottle of wine and a kid and sent them by David, his son, unto Saul.
1SA.16.21	And David came to Saul and stood before him; and he loved him greatly, and he became his armourbearer.
1SA.16.22	And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand before me, for he has found favour in my sight.
1SA.16.23	And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon Saul, that David took a harp and played with his hand; so Saul was refreshed and was better, and the evil spirit departed from him.
1SA.17.1	Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched camp between Shochoh and Azekah in Ephesdammim.
1SA.17.2	And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched camp by the valley of Elah and ordered the battle against the Philistines.
1SA.17.3	And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and Israel stood on a mountain on the other side; and there was a valley between them.
1SA.17.4	And a man named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span, came out of the camp of the Philistines and stood between the two camps.
1SA.17.5	And he had a helmet of brass upon his head, and he was clothed with a coat of mail of scales; and the weight of the coat of mail was five thousand shekels of brass.
1SA.17.6	And he had greaves of brass upon his legs and a shield of brass between his shoulders.
1SA.17.7	And the staff of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and his spear’s head weighed six hundred shekels of iron, and one bearing a shield went before him.
1SA.17.8	And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? Am I not a Philistine, and ye slaves to Saul? Choose a man from among you, and let him come down to me.
1SA.17.9	If he is able to fight with me and to overcome me, then will we be your slaves, but if I prevail against him and overcome him, then ye shall be our slaves and serve us.
1SA.17.10	And the Philistine said, I have dishonoured the ranks of Israel today; give me a man that we may fight together.
1SA.17.11	When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.
1SA.17.12	And David was the son of an Ephrathite man of Bethlehem of Judah, whose name was Jesse, and he had eight sons, and this man was old in the days of Saul and of advanced age among men.
1SA.17.13	And the three eldest sons of Jesse had gone and followed Saul to the battle. And the names of his three sons that went to the battle were Eliab, the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab and the third Shammah.
1SA.17.14	And David was the youngest, the three eldest having gone after Saul.
1SA.17.15	But David had gone and returned from being with Saul to feed his father’s sheep in Bethlehem.
1SA.17.16	And the Philistine drew near morning and evening and presented himself for forty days.
1SA.17.17	And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren an ephah of this parched grain and these ten loaves and run to the camp to thy brethren
1SA.17.18	and carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their thousand and look how thy brethren fare and take their pledge.
1SA.17.19	Now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.
1SA.17.20	And David rose up early in the morning and left the sheep with a keeper and took and went with his burden as Jesse had commanded him, and he came to the trench as the host was going forth in battle array, and they had already sounded the alarm for the battle.
1SA.17.21	For Israel and the Philistines had ordered the battle, army against army.
1SA.17.22	And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the carriage and ran into the army and came and asked about his brethren, if they were well.
1SA.17.23	And as he talked with them, behold, there came up that man, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the armies of the Philistines, speaking the same words, and David heard them.
1SA.17.24	And all the men of Israel when they saw the man fled from him and feared greatly.
1SA.17.25	And each one of the men of Israel were saying, Have ye seen this man that is come up? He is come up to dishonour Israel. It shall be that the king will enrich the man who overcomes him with great riches and will give him his daughter and make his father’s house free in Israel.
1SA.17.26	Then David spoke to the men that stood by him, saying, What shall be done to the man that overcomes this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should dishonour the armies of the living God?
1SA.17.27	And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall it be done to the man that overcomes him.
1SA.17.28	And Eliab, his eldest brother, heard when he spoke unto the men, and Eliab’s anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why didst thou come down here? And with whom hast thou left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride and the malice of thy heart, for thou art come down that thou might see the battle.
1SA.17.29	And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?
1SA.17.30	And he turned from him toward another and spoke after the same manner, and the people answered him again after the former manner.
1SA.17.31	And the words which David had spoken were heard, and they were rehearsed before Saul, and he sent for him.
1SA.17.32	And David said to Saul, Let no man’s heart fail because of him; thy slave will go and fight with this Philistine.
1SA.17.33	And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for thou art but a young man, and he a man of war from his youth.
1SA.17.34	And David replied unto Saul, Thy slave was the pastor of his father’s sheep, and if a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock,
1SA.17.35	I went out after him and smote him and delivered it out of his mouth; and if he arose against me, I caught him by his beard and smote him and slew him.
1SA.17.36	Whether it was a lion or a bear thy slave would kill it, and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he has dishonoured the armies of the living God.
1SA.17.37	David said moreover, The 
1SA.17.38	And Saul clothed David with his clothing, and he put a helmet of brass upon his head; he also armed him with a coat of mail.
1SA.17.39	And David girded Saul’s sword upon Saul’s clothing, and he undertook to go, for he had not proved them. And David said unto Saul, I cannot go with these, for I have not proved them. And putting them off, David
1SA.17.40	took his staff in his hand and chose five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd’s bag which he had, even in a provision bag, and with his sling in his hand he drew near to the Philistine.
1SA.17.41	And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David, and the man that bore the shield went before him.
1SA.17.42	And when the Philistine looked about and saw David, he disdained him, for he was but a youth and ruddy and of a fair countenance.
1SA.17.43	And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog that thou comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
1SA.17.44	And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give thy flesh unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the field.
1SA.17.45	Then David said to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear and with a shield, but I come to thee in the name of the 
1SA.17.46	This day the 
1SA.17.47	And all this congregation shall know that the 
1SA.17.48	And it came to pass when the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David that David hastened and ran to do battle against the Philistine.
1SA.17.49	And David put his hand in his bag and took a stone from there and slang it and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that the stone remained sunk into his forehead, and he fell upon his face to the earth.
1SA.17.50	So David overcame the Philistine with a sling and with a stone and smote the Philistine and slew him, but there was no sword in the hand of David.
1SA.17.51	Therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath and slew him and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw their giant was dead, they fled.
1SA.17.52	And the men of Israel and of Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistines unto the valley and to the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath and unto Ekron.
1SA.17.53	And the sons of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.
1SA.17.54	And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.
1SA.17.55	And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul lives, O king, I cannot tell.
1SA.17.56	And the king said, Enquire whose son the young man is.
1SA.17.57	And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.
1SA.17.58	And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, young man? And David answered, I am the son of thy slave Jesse of Bethlehem.
1SA.18.1	And it came to pass when he had finished speaking unto Saul that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.
1SA.18.2	And Saul took him that day and would not let him return to his father’s house.
1SA.18.3	Then Jonathan and David made a covenant because he loved him as his own soul.
1SA.18.4	And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him and gave it to David and his garments, even to his sword and to his bow and to his girdle.
1SA.18.5	And David went out wherever Saul sent him and behaved himself prudently, and Saul set him over the men of war, and he was accepted in the sight of all the people and also in the sight of Saul’s slaves.
1SA.18.6	And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul, with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.
1SA.18.7	And the women sang as they played and said, Saul has slain his thousands and David his ten thousands.
1SA.18.8	And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him, and he said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me they have ascribed but thousands; and what can he have more but the kingdom?
1SA.18.9	And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.
1SA.18.10	And it came to pass on the next day that the evil spirit from God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house, and David played with his hand as at other times, and there was a spear in Saul’s hand.
1SA.18.11	And Saul cast the spear, saying, I will smite David to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his presence twice.
1SA.18.12	But Saul was afraid of David because the 
1SA.18.13	Therefore, Saul removed him from him and made him captain over a thousand, and he went out and came in before the people.
1SA.18.14	And David behaved himself prudently in all his ways, and the 
1SA.18.15	Therefore, when Saul saw that he behaved himself very prudently, he was afraid of him.
1SA.18.16	But all Israel and Judah loved David because he went out and came in before them.
1SA.18.17	And Saul said to David, Behold I will give thee my elder daughter Merab to wife; only be thou valiant for me, and fight the 
1SA.18.18	And David said unto Saul, Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel that I should be son-in-law to the king?
1SA.18.19	And it came to pass at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David that she was given unto Adriel, the Meholathite, to wife.
1SA.18.20	But Michal, Saul’s other daughter, loved David, and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.
1SA.18.21	And Saul said, I will give her to him that she may be a snare to him and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him. Therefore, Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son-in-law with the other one.
1SA.18.22	And Saul commanded his slaves, saying, Speak with David secretly and say, Behold, the king has delight in thee, and all his slaves love thee; now, therefore, be the king’s son-in-law.
1SA.18.23	And Saul’s slaves spoke those words in the ears of David. And David said, Does it seem to you a light thing to be a king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and lightly esteemed?
1SA.18.24	And the slaves of Saul told him, saying, David spoke these words.
1SA.18.25	And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The desire of the king is not in any dowry, but one hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to be avenged of the king’s enemies. For Saul thought to make David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
1SA.18.26	And when his slaves told David these words, it pleased David well to be the king’s son-in-law, and the days were not expired.
1SA.18.27	Therefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of the Philistines two hundred men, and David brought their foreskins, and they gave them all to the king that he might be the king’s son-in-law. And Saul gave him Michal, his daughter, to wife.
1SA.18.28	But Saul, seeing and knowing that the 
1SA.18.29	was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s enemy continually.
1SA.18.30	Then the princes of the Philistines went forth, and it came to pass after they went forth that David behaved himself more prudently than all the slaves of Saul so that his name was much set by.
1SA.19.1	And Saul spoke to Jonathan, his son, and to all his slaves that they should kill David.
1SA.19.2	But Jonathan, Saul’s son, delighted much in David, and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul, my father, seeks to kill thee: now, therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the morning and abide in a secret place and hide thyself.
1SA.19.3	And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where thou art, and I will speak with my father of thee, and what I see, that I will tell thee.
1SA.19.4	And Jonathan spoke good of David unto Saul, his father, and said unto him, Let not the king sin against his slave David, for he has not sinned against thee; on the other hand his works have been very good for thee,
1SA.19.5	for he put his soul in his hand and slew the Philistine, and the 
1SA.19.6	And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan, and Saul swore, As the 
1SA.19.7	And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told him all those things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as in times past.
1SA.19.8	And there was war again, and David went out and fought with the Philistines and slew them with a great slaughter, and they fled from him.
1SA.19.9	And the evil spirit from the 
1SA.19.10	And Saul sought to smite David to the wall with the spear, but he slipped away out of Saul’s presence, who smote the spear into the wall; and David fled and escaped that night.
1SA.19.11	Saul also sent messengers unto David’s house to watch him and to slay him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife told him, saying, If thou save not thy life tonight, tomorrow thou shalt be dead.
1SA.19.12	So Michal let David down through a window, and he went and fled and escaped.
1SA.19.13	Then Michal took an image and laid it in the bed and put a pillow of goats’ hair at his head and covered it with a cloth.
1SA.19.14	And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.
1SA.19.15	And Saul sent the messengers again to see David, saying, Bring him up to me in the bed that I may slay him.
1SA.19.16	And when the messengers were come in, behold, there was an image in the bed with a pillow of goats’ hair at his head.
1SA.19.17	And Saul said unto Michal, Why hast thou deceived me so and sent away my enemy that he is escaped? And Michal answered Saul, He said unto me, Let me go; if not, I shall kill thee.
1SA.19.18	So David fled and escaped and came to Samuel in Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt in Naioth.
1SA.19.19	And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.
1SA.19.20	And Saul sent messengers to take David, and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and Samuel standing as appointed over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.
1SA.19.21	And when it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they prophesied likewise. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they prophesied also.
1SA.19.22	Then he also went to Ramah and came to a great well that is in Sechu, and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And one said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.
1SA.19.23	And he went there to Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and he went on and prophesied, until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
1SA.19.24	And he stripped off his clothes also and prophesied before Samuel in like manner and lay down naked all that day and all that night. From here it was said, Is Saul also among the prophets?
1SA.20.1	And David fled from Naioth in Ramah and came and said before Jonathan, What have I done? What is my iniquity or what is my sin before thy father that he seeks my life?
1SA.20.2	And he said unto him, No, in no wise; thou shalt not die. Behold, my father will do nothing either great or small, but that he will show it me, and why should my father hide this thing from me? It shall not be so.
1SA.20.3	And David swore moreover, and said, Thy father certainly knows that I have found grace in thine eyes, and he saith in himself, Let Jonathan not know this lest he be grieved; but truly as the 
1SA.20.4	Then Jonathan said unto David, Whatever thy soul saith, I will do it for thee.
1SA.20.5	And David replied unto Jonathan, Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit with the king at food, but thou shalt let me go and hide myself in the field until the evening of the third day.
1SA.20.6	If thy father at all misses me, then say, David earnestly asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem, his city, for all those of his lineage have an anniversary sacrifice.
1SA.20.7	If he should say, It is well; thy slave shall have peace; but if he is very wroth, then be sure that the evil is determined in him.
1SA.20.8	Therefore, thou shalt deal in mercy with thy slave, for thou hast brought thy slave into a covenant of the 
1SA.20.9	And Jonathan said, Far be it from thee, for if I knew certainly that evil were determined by my father to come upon thee, then would I not be obliged to show it to thee?
1SA.20.10	Then said David to Jonathan, Who shall tell me? Or what if thy father answers thee roughly?
1SA.20.11	And Jonathan said unto David, Come, and let us go out into the field. And both of them went out into the field.
1SA.20.12	Then Jonathan said unto David, O 
1SA.20.13	the 
1SA.20.14	And if I live, thou shalt show me the mercy of the 
1SA.20.15	thou shalt not cut off thy mercy from my house for ever. When the 
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David.
1SA.20.17	And Jonathan swore unto David again because he loved him, for he loved him as he loved his own soul.
1SA.20.18	Then Jonathan said to David, Tomorrow is the new moon, and thou shalt be missed because thy seat will be empty.
1SA.20.19	And when thou hast stayed three days, then thou shalt go down quickly and come to the place where thou didst hide thyself on the day of the work and shalt remain by the stone Ezel;
1SA.20.20	and I will shoot three arrows on the side thereof as though I shot at a mark.
1SA.20.21	And, behold, I will send a lad, saying, Go, find the arrows. If I expressly say unto the lad, Behold, the arrows are on this side of thee; take them, then come thou, for there is peace unto thee and no hurt, as the 
1SA.20.22	But if I say thus unto the young man, Behold, the arrows are beyond thee, then go away, for the 
1SA.20.23	And as touching the matter which thou and I have spoken of, behold, let the 
1SA.20.24	So David hid himself in the field, and when the new moon was come, the king sat down to eat bread.
1SA.20.25	And the king sat upon his seat as at other times, even upon a seat by the wall; and Jonathan arose, and Abner sat by Saul’s side, and David’s place was empty.
1SA.20.26	Nevertheless, Saul said nothing that day, for he thought, Something has befallen him, he is not clean; surely he is not clean.
1SA.20.27	And it came to pass on the next day, which was the second day of the new moon, that David’s place was empty, and Saul said unto Jonathan his son, Why did not the son of Jesse come to food, neither yesterday nor today?
1SA.20.28	And Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem.
1SA.20.29	And he said, Let me go, I pray thee, for those of our lineage have a sacrifice in the city, and my brother, he has commanded me to be there, and now, if I have found grace in thine eyes, let me get away, I pray thee, and see my brethren. Therefore he has not come unto the king’s table.
1SA.20.30	Then Saul’s anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said unto him, Thou son of the perverse rebellious woman, do I not know that thou hast chosen the son of Jesse to thine own confusion and unto the confusion of thy mother’s shame?
1SA.20.31	For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the land, thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdom. Therefore, now send and bring him unto me, for he shall surely die.
1SA.20.32	And Jonathan answered Saul his father and said unto him, Why shall he be slain? What has he done?
1SA.20.33	And Saul cast a spear at him to smite him whereby Jonathan knew that it was determined of his father to slay David.
1SA.20.34	So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the new moon, for he was grieved for David and because his father had done him shame.
1SA.20.35	And it came to pass in the morning that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.
1SA.20.36	And he said unto his lad, Run and find the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.
1SA.20.37	And when the lad was come to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the lad, and said, Is not the arrow beyond thee?
1SA.20.38	And Jonathan cried after the lad, Make speed, haste, stay not. And Jonathan’s lad gathered up the arrows and came to his master.
1SA.20.39	But the lad did not understand anything; only Jonathan and David understood the matter.
1SA.20.40	And Jonathan gave his weapons unto his lad and said unto him, Go, carry them to the city.
1SA.20.41	And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of a place toward the Negev and fell on his face to the ground and bowed himself three times, and they kissed one another and wept one with another, although David exceeded.
1SA.20.42	And Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the 
1SA.21.1	Then David came to Nob to Ahimelech, the priest, and Ahimelech was afraid at the meeting of David and said unto him, Why art thou alone, and no one with thee?
1SA.21.2	And David said unto Ahimelech, the priest, The king has commanded me a business and has said unto me, Let no one know anything of this business about which I send thee and what I have commanded thee, and I have appointed my servants to a certain place.
1SA.21.3	Now, therefore, what is under thy hand? Give me five loaves of bread in my hand or what there is present.
1SA.21.4	And the priest answered David and said, There is no common bread under my hand; there is only sacred bread, which I will give thee if the young men have kept themselves at least from women.
1SA.21.5	And David answered the priest and said unto him, Of a truth women have been kept from us since yesterday and the day before yesterday since I came out, and the vessels of the young men were holy although the way is profane; how much more that today it shall be sanctified with the vessels.
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave him the sacred bread, for there was no bread there but the showbread that had been taken from before the 
1SA.21.7	Now a certain man of the slaves of Saul was there that day, fulfilling a vow before the 
1SA.21.8	And David said unto Ahimelech, And is there not here under thy hand a spear or a sword? For I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons with me because the king’s business required haste.
1SA.21.9	And the priest replied, The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom thou didst overcome in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a veil behind the ephod; if thou wilt take that, take it, for there is none other except that here. And David said, There is none like that; give it to me.
1SA.21.10	And David arose and fled that day from the presence of Saul and went to Achish, the king of Gath.
1SA.21.11	And the slaves of Achish said unto him, Is this not David, the king of the land? Did they not sing one to another of him in dances, saying, Saul has slain his thousands and David his ten thousands?
1SA.21.12	And David laid up these words in his heart and was sore afraid of Achish, the king of Gath.
1SA.21.13	And he changed his behaviour before them and feigned himself a fool in their hands and scrabbled on the doors of the gate and let his spittle fall down upon his beard.
1SA.21.14	Then Achish said unto his slaves, Behold, ye see the man is mad; why then have ye brought him to me?
1SA.21.15	Have I need of mad men that ye have brought this fellow to play the mad man in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?
1SA.22.1	And David departed from there and escaped to the cave Adullam; {Heb. righteousness or justice of the people}; and when his brethren and all his father’s house heard it, they went down there to him.
1SA.22.2	And every one that was in distress and every one that was in debt and all whose souls were bitter gathered themselves unto him, and he became the captain over them, and there were about four hundred men with him.
1SA.22.3	And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab, and he said unto the king of Moab, Let my father and my mother, I pray thee, come forth and be with you until I know what God will make of me.
1SA.22.4	And he brought them before the king of Moab, and they dwelt with him all the while that David was in the fortress.
1SA.22.5	And the prophet Gad said unto David, do not abide in this fortress; depart, and go into the land of Judah. Then David departed and came into the forest of Hareth.
1SA.22.6	When Saul heard how David had appeared and the men that were with him (now Saul abode in Gibeah under a tree in Ramah, having his spear in his hand, and all his slaves were standing about him),
1SA.22.7	then Saul said unto his slaves that stood about him, Hear now, ye sons of Jemini, will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards and make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds
1SA.22.8	that all of you have conspired against me, and there is no one that shows me that my son has made a league with the son of Jesse, and there is none of you that is sorry for me or shows unto me that my son has stirred up my slave against me, to lie in wait against me, as at this day?
1SA.22.9	Then Doeg, the Edomite, who was set over the slaves of Saul, answered and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob to Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub.
1SA.22.10	And he enquired of the 
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent to call Ahimelech, the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s house, the priests that were in Nob; and they all came to the king.
1SA.22.12	And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Ahitub. And he answered, Here I am, my lord.
1SA.22.13	And Saul said unto him, Why have ye conspired against me, thou and the son of Jesse, in that thou hast given him bread and a sword and hast enquired of God for him that he should rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?
1SA.22.14	Then Ahimelech answered the king and said, And who is so faithful among all thy slaves as David, the king’s son-in-law, who goes at thy bidding and is honourable in thy house?
1SA.22.15	Did I begin to enquire of God for him today? Be it far from me; let not the king impute any thing unto his slave nor to all the house of my father, for thy slave knew nothing of all this, less or more.
1SA.22.16	And the king said, Thou shalt surely die, Ahimelech, thou and all thy father’s house.
1SA.22.17	Then the king said unto the footmen that stood about him, Turn and slay the priests of the 
1SA.22.18	Then the king said to Doeg, Turn thou and fall upon the priests. And Doeg, the Edomite, turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day eighty-five men that wore a linen ephod.
1SA.22.19	And Nob, the city of the priests, he smote with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and sucklings and oxen and asses and sheep with the edge of the sword.
1SA.22.20	And one of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled after David.
1SA.22.21	And Abiathar gave David the news that Saul had slain the 
1SA.22.22	And David said unto Abiathar, I knew it that day when Doeg, the Edomite, was there that he would surely tell Saul. I have given cause before Saul against all the persons of thy father’s house.
1SA.22.23	Abide thou with me; do not fear, for he that seeks my life seeks thy life; it is good that thou shalt be kept with me.
1SA.23.1	Then they told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines fight against Keilah, and they rob the threshingfloors.
1SA.23.2	Therefore David enquired of the 
1SA.23.3	But David’s men said unto him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah, how much more than if we go to Keilah against the army of the Philistines?
1SA.23.4	Then David enquired of the 
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah and fought with the Philistines and brought away their livestock and smote them with a great slaughter. So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.
1SA.23.6	And it came to pass when Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, fled to David to Keilah that the ephod came in his hand.
1SA.23.7	And it was told Saul how David had come to Keilah. And Saul said, God has delivered him into my hand, for he is shut in by entering into a town that has gates and bars.
1SA.23.8	And Saul called all the people together to war, to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
1SA.23.9	But David understood that Saul devised evil against him, and he said to Abiathar, the priest, Bring here the ephod.
1SA.23.10	Then David said, O 
1SA.23.11	Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand? Will Saul come down as thy slave has heard? O 
1SA.23.12	Then David said, Will the men of Keilah deliver me and my men into the hand of Saul? And the 
1SA.23.13	So David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and departed out of Keilah and went from one place to another. And it was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah, and he forbare to go forth.
1SA.23.14	And David abode in the wilderness in strong holds and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not deliver him into his hand.
1SA.23.15	And David, seeing that Saul had come out to seek his soul, stayed in the woods in the wilderness of Ziph.
1SA.23.16	Then Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went to David in the woods and strengthened his hand in God.
1SA.23.17	And he said unto him, Do not fear, for the hand of Saul, my father, shall not find thee, and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be next unto thee; and even my father knows this.
1SA.23.18	And the two made a covenant before the 
1SA.23.19	Then those of Ziph came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the woods in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the right hand side of the wilderness?
1SA.23.20	Now, therefore, O king, come down according to all the desire of thy soul to come down, and our part shall be to deliver him into the king’s hand.
1SA.23.21	And Saul said, Blessed are ye of the 
1SA.23.22	Go, I pray you, prepare yet and know and see his place where he places his foot and who has seen him there, for it is told me that he deals with great prudence.
1SA.23.23	See, therefore, and take knowledge of all the hiding places where he hides himself and come again to me with the certainty, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass, if he is in the land that I will search him out with all the thousands of Judah.
1SA.23.24	And they arose and went to Ziph before Saul, but David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon in the plain on the right hand side of the wilderness.
1SA.23.25	Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David, and he came down from there into a rock and abode in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.
1SA.23.26	And Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men on that side of the mountain; and David made haste to get away from the presence of Saul, for Saul and his men compassed David and his men round about to take them.
1SA.23.27	But there came a messenger unto Saul, saying, Make haste and come, for the Philistines have invaded the land.
1SA.23.28	Saul returned, therefore, from pursuing after David and went against the Philistines. For this reason they called that place Selahammahlekoth. {Heb. the rock of divisions}
1SA.23.29	And David went up from there and dwelt in strong holds at Engedi.
1SA.24.1	And it came to pass when Saul was returned from following the Philistines, that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.
1SA.24.2	Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats.
1SA.24.3	And he came to a flock of sheep by the way where there was a cave, and Saul went in to cover his feet, and David and his men remained in the sides of the cave.
1SA.24.4	Then the men of David said unto him, Behold the day of which the 
1SA.24.5	And it came to pass afterward that David’s heart smote him because he had cut off Saul’s skirt.
1SA.24.6	And he said unto his men, The 
1SA.24.7	So David stayed his servants with these words and did not allow them to rise against Saul. But Saul rose up out of the cave and went on his way.
1SA.24.8	David also arose afterward and went out of the cave and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king. And when Saul looked behind him, David stooped with his face to the earth and worshipped.
1SA.24.9	And David said to Saul, Why hearest thou men’s words, saying, Behold, David seeks thy hurt?
1SA.24.10	Behold, this day thine eyes have seen how that the 
1SA.24.11	Moreover, my father, see; see the skirt of thy robe is even in my hand, for in that I cut off the skirt of thy robe and did not kill thee, know thou and see that there is neither evil nor transgression in my hand, and I have not sinned against thee; yet thou doest hunt my life to take it.
1SA.24.12	The 
1SA.24.13	As saith the proverb of the ancients, Wickedness proceeds from the wicked, but my hand shall not be upon thee.
1SA.24.14	After whom is the king of Israel come out? After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog? After a flea?
1SA.24.15	The 
1SA.24.16	And it came to pass, when David had finished speaking these words unto Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.
1SA.24.17	And he said to David, Thou art more righteous than I, for thou hast repaid me with good, whereas I have repaid thee with evil.
1SA.24.18	And thou hast showed this day how that thou hast dealt well with me; forasmuch as when the 
1SA.24.19	For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe and sound? The 
1SA.24.20	And now, behold, I know well that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of Israel shall be firm and stable in thy hand.
1SA.24.21	Swear now therefore unto me by the 
1SA.24.22	Then David swore unto Saul. And Saul went home, but David and his men went up unto the fortress.
1SA.25.1	And Samuel died, and all Israel gathered together and lamented him and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.
1SA.25.2	And there was a man in Maon whose possessions were in Carmel, and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.
1SA.25.3	Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail. And she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance, but the man was hard and evil in his doings, and he was of the lineage of Caleb.
1SA.25.4	And David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.
1SA.25.5	And David sent out ten young men, and David said unto the young men, Climb up to Carmel and go to Nabal and greet him in my name.
1SA.25.6	And thus shall ye say to him, May thou live and peace be unto thee and peace be unto thy house and peace be unto all that thou hast.
1SA.25.7	I have recently heard that thou hast shearers. Now thy shepherds who were with us, we did not hurt them, neither was there anything missing unto them all the while they were in Carmel.
1SA.25.8	Ask thy slaves, and they will tell thee. Therefore, let the young men find grace in thine eyes, for we come in a good day; give, I pray thee, whatever is in thy hand unto thy slaves and to thy son David.
1SA.25.9	And when David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all those words in the name of David and ceased.
1SA.25.10	And Nabal answered David’s slaves and said, Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many slaves nowadays that break from their masters.
1SA.25.11	Shall I then take my bread and my water and my slaughtered meat that I have killed for my shearers and give it unto men that I do not know where they are from?
1SA.25.12	So David’s young men left and returned and came and told him all those words.
1SA.25.13	Then David said unto his men, Gird ye on each man his sword. And each one girded on his sword, and David also girded on his sword; and about four hundred men went up after David, and they left two hundred with the stuff.
1SA.25.14	And one of the servants told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless our master, and he railed on them.
1SA.25.15	But the men were very good unto us and never hurt us, neither did we miss anything all the time that we have been conversant with them when we were in the fields.
1SA.25.16	They were a wall unto us both by night and day all the time that we were feeding the sheep with them.
1SA.25.17	Now, therefore, know and consider what thou must do, for evil is determined against our master and against all his household, for he is such a son of Belial that no one can speak to him.
1SA.25.18	Then Abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched flour and one hundred bunches of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses.
1SA.25.19	And she said unto her servants, Go on before me; behold, I come after you. But she told nothing to her husband Nabal.
1SA.25.20	And it was so as she rode on the ass that she came down a secret part of the mountain, and, behold, David and his men came down against her, and she met them.
1SA.25.21	Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this fellow has in the wilderness so that nothing was missed of all that pertained unto him, and he has returned unto me evil for good.
1SA.25.22	Let God do so and more also unto the enemies of David if I leave of all that pertain to him by the morning light any that piss against the wall.
1SA.25.23	And when Abigail saw David, she hastened and lighted off the ass and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground
1SA.25.24	and fell at his feet and said, Upon me, my lord, upon me let this iniquity be, and let thy handmaid, I pray thee, speak in thy audience; and hear the words of thy handmaid.
1SA.25.25	Let not my lord, I pray thee, take to heart this man of Belial, even Nabal, for as his name is, so is he; Nabal {Heb. fool} is his name, and folly is with him; but I, thy handmaid, did not see the servants of my lord whom thou didst send.
1SA.25.26	Now, therefore, my lord, as the 
1SA.25.27	And now this blessing which thy handmaid has brought unto my lord, let it be given unto the servants that follow my lord.
1SA.25.28	I pray thee, forgive the trespass of thy handmaid, for the 
1SA.25.29	Yet a man is risen to pursue thee and to seek thy soul, but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with the 
1SA.25.30	And it shall come to pass when the 
1SA.25.31	that this shall be no stumblingblock unto thee nor grief of heart unto my lord, either that thou hast shed blood causeless or that my lord has avenged himself; but when the 
1SA.25.32	Then David said to Abigail, Blessed be the 
1SA.25.33	and blessed be thy advice, and blessed be thou who hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with my own hand.
1SA.25.34	For in very deed as the 
1SA.25.35	So David received of her hand that which she had brought him and said unto her, Go up in peace to thy house; see, I have hearkened to thy voice and have accepted thy person.
1SA.25.36	And Abigail came to Nabal, and, behold, he held a banquet in his house like the banquet of a king; and Nabal’s heart was merry within him, for he was very drunken; therefore, she told him nothing, less or more, until the morning light.
1SA.25.37	But it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of Nabal, and his wife had told him these things, that his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
1SA.25.38	And it came to pass about ten days after, that the 
1SA.25.39	And when David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be the 
1SA.25.40	And when the slaves of David were come to Abigail to Carmel, they spoke with her, saying, David sent us unto thee to take thee to him to wife.
1SA.25.41	And she arose and bowed herself on her face to the earth and said, Behold, let thy handmaid be a slave to wash the feet of the slaves of my lord.
1SA.25.42	And Abigail hastened and arose and rode upon an ass with five damsels of hers that went after her, and she went after the messengers of David and became his wife.
1SA.25.43	David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they were also both of them his wives.
1SA.25.44	For Saul had given Michal, his daughter, David’s wife, to Phalti, the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.
1SA.26.1	And the Ziphites came unto Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does David not hide himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before Jeshimon?
1SA.26.2	Then Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.
1SA.26.3	And Saul pitched camp in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the wilderness by the way. But David abode in the wilderness, and he perceived that Saul came after him into the wilderness.
1SA.26.4	David, therefore, sent out spies and understood that Saul was indeed come.
1SA.26.5	And David arose and came to the place where Saul had pitched camp, and David beheld the place where Saul lay and Abner, the son of Ner, the captain of his host. And Saul lay in the trench, and the people pitched round about him.
1SA.26.6	Then David spoke and said to Ahimelech, the Hittite, and to Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab, saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp? And Abishai said, I will go down with thee.
1SA.26.7	So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at his head, but Abner and the people lay round about him.
1SA.26.8	Then Abishai said to David, God has delivered thy enemy into thy hand today; now, therefore, let me smite him, I pray thee, with the spear and pin him to the earth at once, and I will not need a second opportunity.
1SA.26.9	And David said to Abishai, Do not destroy him, for who has stretched forth his hand against the 
1SA.26.10	David said furthermore, As the 
1SA.26.11	the 
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and the cruse of water that were at Saul’s head, and they went, and no one saw it nor knew it neither awaked, for they were all asleep because a deep sleep from the 
1SA.26.13	Then David went over to the other side and stood out of the way on the top of the mountain, a great space being between them;
1SA.26.14	and David cried to the people and to Abner, the son of Ner, saying, Dost thou not answer, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who art thou that dost cry to the king?
1SA.26.15	And David said to Abner, Art not thou a man? And who is there like unto thee in Israel? Why then hast thou not kept thy lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king thy lord.
1SA.26.16	This thing is not good that thou hast done. As the 
1SA.26.17	And Saul knew David’s voice and said, Is this thy voice, my son David? And David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.
1SA.26.18	And he said, Why does my lord thus pursue after his slave? What have I done? What evil is in my hand?
1SA.26.19	Now, therefore, I pray thee, let my lord the king hear the words of his slave. If the 
1SA.26.20	Now therefore, do not let my blood fall to the earth before the face of the 
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, I have sinned; return, my son David; for I will do no more harm unto thee because my life was precious in thine eyes today. Behold, I have played the fool and have erred exceedingly.
1SA.26.22	And David answered and said, Behold the king’s spear! Let one of the servants come over and take it.
1SA.26.23	The 
1SA.26.24	And, behold, as thy life has been esteemed today in my eyes, so let my life be esteemed in the eyes of the 
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, Blessed art thou, my son David; without a doubt thou shalt do great things and prevail. So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.
1SA.27.1	And David said in his heart, In the end I shall be killed some day by the hand of Saul; there is nothing better for me than that I should escape once and for all into the land of the Philistines; and Saul shall despair of me, to seek me any more within the borders of Israel; so shall I escape out of his hand.
1SA.27.2	And David arose, and he went over with the six hundred men that were with him unto Achish, the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
1SA.27.3	And David dwelt with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each one with his household, David with his two wives, Ahinoam, the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, who had been the wife of Nabal of Carmel.
1SA.27.4	And it was told Saul that David had fled to Gath, and he sought him no more.
1SA.27.5	And David said unto Achish, If I have now found grace in thine eyes, let me be given a place in one of the cities of the land that I may dwell there, for why should thy slave dwell in the royal city with thee?
1SA.27.6	Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day. Therefore, Ziklag pertains to the kings of Judah unto this day.
1SA.27.7	And the number of days that David dwelt in the country of the Philistines was four months and some days.
1SA.27.8	And David and his men went up and invaded the Geshurites and the Gezrites and the Amalekites, for these had inhabited the land for a long time, from as thou goest unto Shur even unto the land of Egypt.
1SA.27.9	And David smote the land and left neither man nor woman alive and took away the sheep and the oxen and the asses and the camels and the apparel and returned and came to Achish.
1SA.27.10	And Achish would say, Where have ye raided today? And David would say, Against the south of Judah and towards the Negev of the Jerahmeelites or towards the Negev of the Kenites.
1SA.27.11	And David left neither man nor woman alive, to bring tidings to Gath, saying, Lest they should tell on us, saying, So did David. And this was his manner all the time he dwelt in the land of the Philistines.
1SA.27.12	And Achish believed David, saying, He is making himself abominable unto his people of Israel; therefore, he shall be my slave for ever.
1SA.28.1	And it came to pass in those days, that the Philistines gathered their armies together for warfare, to fight against Israel. And Achish said unto David, Know for certain, that thou shalt go out with me to battle, thou and thy men.
1SA.28.2	And David said to Achish, Surely thou shalt know what thy slave can do. And Achish said to David, Therefore, I will make thee keeper of my head all the days.
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah in his own city. And Saul had removed the spiritists and the diviners out of the land.
1SA.28.4	And the Philistines gathered themselves together and came and pitched camp in Shunem, and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they pitched camp in Gilboa.
1SA.28.5	And when Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.
1SA.28.6	And Saul enquired of the 
1SA.28.7	Then Saul said unto his slaves, Seek me a woman that is a spiritist that I may go to her and enquire of her. And his slaves said to him, Behold, there is a woman that is a spiritist at Endor.
1SA.28.8	And Saul disguised himself and put on other clothing, and he went with two men, and they came to the woman by night; and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by spiritism and bring me him up whom I shall name unto thee.
1SA.28.9	And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul has done, how he has cut off the spiritists and the diviners out of the land; why then dost thou lay a snare for my life, to cause me to die?
1SA.28.10	And Saul swore to her by the 
1SA.28.11	Then the woman said, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.
1SA.28.12	And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? For thou art Saul.
1SA.28.13	And the king said unto her, Do not be afraid. What didst thou see? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods rising out of the land.
1SA.28.14	And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old man comes, and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the ground and worshipped.
1SA.28.15	And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed, for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me and no longer answers me neither by prophets nor by dreams; therefore, I have called thee that thou may make known unto me what I shall do.
1SA.28.16	Then Samuel said, Why then dost thou ask of me, seeing the 
1SA.28.17	The 
1SA.28.18	Because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the 
1SA.28.19	And the 
1SA.28.20	Then Saul, as great as he was, fell suddenly to the earth and was sore afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day nor all that night.
1SA.28.21	And the woman came unto Saul and saw that he was sore troubled and said unto him, Behold, thy handmaid has heard thy voice, and I have put my soul in my hand and have hearkened unto thy words which thou didst speak unto me.
1SA.28.22	Now, therefore, I pray thee, hearken thou also unto the voice of thy handmaid and let me set a morsel of bread before thee; and eat, that thou may have strength, and go on thy way.
1SA.28.23	But he refused and said, I will not eat. But his slaves, together with the woman, compelled him, and he hearkened unto their voice. So he arose from the ground and sat upon a bed.
1SA.28.24	And the woman had a fat calf in the house, and she hastened and killed it and took flour and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread with it.
1SA.28.25	And she brought it before Saul and before his slaves, and after they ate, they rose up and went away that night.
1SA.29.1	Now the Philistines gathered together all their camps to Aphek, and the Israelites pitched camp by a fountain which is in Jezreel. {Heb. God scatters}
1SA.29.2	And as the cardinals of the Philistines reviewed their companies of hundreds and of thousands, David and his men were in the rear with Achish.
1SA.29.3	Then the princes of the Philistines said, What are these Hebrews doing here? And Achish replied unto the princes of the Philistines, Is not this David, the slave of Saul, the king of Israel, who has been with me these days or these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell unto me unto this day?
1SA.29.4	Then the princes of the Philistines were angry with him, and the princes of the Philistines said unto him, Make this fellow return that he may go again to his place which thou hast appointed him and not come with us to the battle lest in the battle he be an adversary to us, for with what should he return to the good graces of his master than with the heads of these men?
1SA.29.5	Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances, saying, Saul slew his thousands and David his ten thousands?
1SA.29.6	Then Achish called David and said unto him, Surely, as the 
1SA.29.7	Therefore, now return and go in peace that thou not do evil in the eyes of the cardinals of the Philistines.
1SA.29.8	And David replied unto Achish, But what have I done? And what hast thou found in thy slave so long as I have been with thee unto this day that I may not go fight against the enemies of my lord the king?
1SA.29.9	And Achish answered and said to David, I know that thou art good in my sight as an angel of God; notwithstanding, the princes of the Philistines have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.
1SA.29.10	Therefore, now rise up early in the morning with thy master’s slaves that are come with thee, and as soon as ye are up early in the morning and it is light, depart.
1SA.29.11	So David and his men rose up early to depart in the morning to return into the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	And it came to pass when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day that the Amalekites had invaded the Negev and Ziklag and had smitten Ziklag and burned it with fire.
1SA.30.2	And they had taken the women captives that were therein, from the youngest to the oldest; they did not kill any but carried them away and went on their way.
1SA.30.3	So David and his men came to the city, and, behold, it was burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captives.
1SA.30.4	Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep.
1SA.30.5	And David’s two wives were taken captives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail, who had been the wife of Nabal of Carmel.
1SA.30.6	And David was greatly distressed, for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of all the people was bitter, each one for his sons and for his daughters; but David encouraged himself in the 
1SA.30.7	And David said to Abiathar, the priest, Ahimelech’s son, I pray thee, bring the ephod here to me. And Abiathar brought the ephod to David.
1SA.30.8	And David enquired at the 
1SA.30.9	So David went, he and the six hundred men that were with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where some stayed behind.
1SA.30.10	But David pursued, he and four hundred men, for two hundred stayed behind, who were so faint that they could not go over the brook Besor.
1SA.30.11	And they found an Egyptian in the field and brought him to David and gave him bread to eat and water to drink,
1SA.30.12	and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two bunches of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him, for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days and three nights.
1SA.30.13	And David said unto him, To whom dost thou belong and where art thou from? And the young Egyptian said, I am the slave to an Amalekite, and my master left me three days ago because I was sick.
1SA.30.14	We made an invasion upon towards the Negev from the Chereth and upon Judah and towards the Negev from Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.
1SA.30.15	And David said to him, Wilt thou bring me down to this company? And he said, Swear unto me by God, that thou wilt neither kill me nor deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will bring thee down to this company.
1SA.30.16	And so he brought him down, and behold, they were spread abroad upon all the earth, eating and drinking, and holding a feast because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of the land of the Philistines and out of the land of Judah.
1SA.30.17	And David smote them from the morning twilight even unto the evening of the next day, and none of them escaped except four hundred young men who rode upon camels and fled.
1SA.30.18	And David recovered all that the Amalekites had carried away, and David delivered his two wives.
1SA.30.19	And there was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great neither sons nor daughters, of the robbery and of all the things that had been taken from them; David recovered it all.
1SA.30.20	And David took all the sheep and the cows, and bringing them with all the other livestock, they said, This is David’s spoil.
1SA.30.21	And David came to the two hundred men who were so faint that they could not follow David, whom they had made also to remain at the brook Besor, and they went forth to meet David and to meet the people that were with him, and when David came near to the people, he saluted them with peace.
1SA.30.22	Then all the wicked men and men of Belial, of those that went with David, answered and said, Because they did not go with us, we will not give them of the spoil that we have recovered, except to each man his wife and his children, that they may lead them away, and depart.
1SA.30.23	Then David said, Ye shall not do so, my brethren, with that which the 
1SA.30.24	For who will hearken unto you in this matter? For as his part is that goes down to the battle, so shall his part be that remains by the stuff; they shall part alike.
1SA.30.25	And it was so from that day forward that he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel unto this day.
1SA.30.26	And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil unto the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, Behold a blessing for you of the spoil of the enemies of the 
1SA.30.27	to those who were in Bethel and to those who were in Ramoth towards the Negev and to those who were in Jattir
1SA.30.28	and to those who were in Aroer and to those who were in Siphmoth and to those who were in Eshtemoa
1SA.30.29	and to those who were in Rachal and to those who were in the cities of the Jerahmeelites and to those who were in the cities of the Kenites
1SA.30.30	and to those who were in Hormah and to those who were in Chorashan and to those who were in Athach
1SA.30.31	and to those who were in Hebron and in all the places where David had been with his men.
1SA.31.1	Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines and fell down slain in Mount Gilboa.
1SA.31.2	And the Philistines followed hard upon Saul and upon his sons, and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchishua, Saul’s sons.
1SA.31.3	And the battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers found him, and he was sore afraid of the archers.
1SA.31.4	Then said Saul unto his armourbearer, Draw thy sword and thrust me through with it lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not, for he was sore afraid. Therefore, Saul took his sword and fell upon it.
1SA.31.5	And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise upon his sword and died with him.
1SA.31.6	So Saul died and his three sons and his armourbearer and all his men that same day together.
1SA.31.7	And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley and those that were on the other side of the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1SA.31.8	And it came to pass on the next day when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen in Mount Gilboa.
1SA.31.9	And they cut off his head and stripped off his weapons and sent them into the land of the Philistines round about to publish it in the house of their idols and among the people.
1SA.31.10	And they put his weapons in the house of Ashtaroth, and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.
1SA.31.11	And when the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead heard of that which the Philistines had done to Saul,
1SA.31.12	all the valiant men arose and went all night and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan and came to Jabesh and burnt them there.
1SA.31.13	And they took their bones and buried them under a tree at Jabesh and fasted seven days.
2SA.1.1	Now it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
2SA.1.2	it came to pass on the third day that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent and earth upon his head, and so it was when he came to David, that he fell to the earth and did obeisance.
2SA.1.3	And David said unto him, Where dost thou come from? And he said unto him, I am escaped out of the camp of Israel.
2SA.1.4	And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, The people fled from the battle, and many of the people fell and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead also.
2SA.1.5	And David said unto the young man that told him, How dost thou know that Saul and Jonathan, his son, are dead?
2SA.1.6	And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon Mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear, and the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
2SA.1.7	And when he looked behind him, he saw me and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
2SA.1.8	And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
2SA.1.9	He said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me and slay me, for anguish is come upon me, and all my soul is yet in me.
2SA.1.10	So I stood upon him and slew him because I was sure that he could not live after he was fallen, and I took the crown that was upon his head and the bracelet that was on his arm and have brought them here unto my lord.
2SA.1.11	Then David took hold on his clothes and rent them and likewise all the men that were with him.
2SA.1.12	And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the 
2SA.1.13	And David said unto the young man that told him, From where art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
2SA.1.14	And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the 
2SA.1.15	Then David called one of the young men and said, Go near and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
2SA.1.16	And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head, for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain the 
2SA.1.17	And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.
2SA.1.18	(He also bade them teach the sons of Judah the use of the bow. Behold, it is written in the book of righteousness.)
2SA.1.19	The glory of Israel is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!
2SA.1.20	Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
2SA.1.21	Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you nor fields of offerings, for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
2SA.1.22	Without the blood of the slain, without the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan never turned back, and the sword of Saul never returned empty.
2SA.1.23	Saul and Jonathan were loved and desired in their lives, and in their death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
2SA.1.25	How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.
2SA.1.26	I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant hast thou been unto me; thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
2SA.1.27	How are the valiant fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
2SA.2.1	And it came to pass after this that David enquired of the 
2SA.2.2	So David went up there with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail, who had been the wife of Nabal of Carmel.
2SA.2.3	And David brought up his men that were with him, each one with his household, and they dwelt in the cities of Hebron.
2SA.2.4	And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah. And they told David, saying, The men of Jabeshgilead buried Saul.
2SA.2.5	And David sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead and said unto them, Blessed shall ye be of the 
2SA.2.6	And now the 
2SA.2.7	Therefore, now let your hands be strengthened and be ye valiant; for your master Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah have anointed me king over them.
2SA.2.8	But Abner, the son of Ner, captain of Saul’s host, took Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim
2SA.2.9	and made him king over Gilead and over the Ashurites and over Jezreel and over Ephraim and over Benjamin and over all Israel.
2SA.2.10	Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel and reigned two years. Only the house of Judah followed David.
2SA.2.11	And the number of days that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	And Abner, the son of Ner, and the slaves of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
2SA.2.13	And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the slaves of David went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon, and when they met, the one group was on the one side of the pool and the other on the other side of the pool.
2SA.2.14	And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise and sport before us. And Joab said, Let them arise.
2SA.2.15	Then there arose and went over by number twelve of Benjamin, who pertained to Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and twelve of the slaves of David.
2SA.2.16	And each one caught his fellow by the head and thrust his sword in his fellow’s side; so they fell down together; therefore, that place was called Helkathhazzurim, {Heb. the inheritance of the strong}, which is in Gibeon.
2SA.2.17	And there was a very severe battle that day where Abner and the men of Israel were overcome before the slaves of David.
2SA.2.18	And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel, and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe.
2SA.2.19	And Asahel pursued after Abner, and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.
2SA.2.20	Then Abner looked behind him and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, Yes.
2SA.2.21	Then Abner said to him, Turn aside to thy right hand or to thy left and lay hold on one of the young men and take his spoil. But Asahel would not turn aside from following after him.
2SA.2.22	And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn aside from following me; why should I smite thee to the ground? How then should I hold up my face to Joab, thy brother?
2SA.2.23	Howbeit he refused to turn aside; therefore, Abner with the butt end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib that the spear came out behind him, and he fell down there and died in the same place. And it came to pass that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died, stood still.
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner, and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah that lies before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
2SA.2.25	And the sons of Benjamin gathered themselves together in one troop with Abner and stood on the top of a hill.
2SA.2.26	Then Abner called to Joab and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? Dost thou not know that it will be bitterness in the latter end? How long shall it be then before thou bid the people to return from following their brethren?
2SA.2.27	And Joab replied, As God lives, if thou had not spoken, surely from this morning the people would have left off from following their brothers.
2SA.2.28	So Joab blew the shofar, and all the people stood still and no longer pursued after Israel, neither did they fight any more.
2SA.2.29	And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passing the Jordan, they went through all Bithron, and they came to Mahanaim.
2SA.2.30	Joab also returned from following Abner, and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of David’s slaves nineteen men and Asahel.
2SA.2.31	But the slaves of David had smitten of Benjamin and of Abner’s men, so that three hundred and sixty men died.
2SA.2.32	And they took up Asahel and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in Bethlehem. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to Hebron at the break of day.
2SA.3.1	Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David, but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.2	And sons were born unto David in Hebron; and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam, the Jezreelitess;
2SA.3.3	and his second, Chileab, of Abigail who had been the wife of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Absalom, the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur;
2SA.3.4	and the fourth, Adonijah, the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephatiah, the son of Abital;
2SA.3.5	and the sixth, Ithream, by Eglah, David’s wife. These were born to David in Hebron.
2SA.3.6	And it came to pass while there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, that Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul.
2SA.3.7	And Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And Ishbosheth said to Abner, Why hast thou gone in unto my father’s concubine?
2SA.3.8	Then Abner was very angry for the words of Ishbosheth and said, Am I a dog’s head in regard to Judah? I have shown mercy this day unto the house of Saul, thy father, to his brethren, and to his friends and have not delivered thee into the hand of David that thou dost charge me today with iniquity concerning this woman?
2SA.3.9	Let God do to Abner and more also unless, as the 
2SA.3.10	to translate the kingdom from the house of Saul and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah from Dan even to Beersheba.
2SA.3.11	And he could not answer Abner a word again because he feared him.
2SA.3.12	And Abner sent messengers to David on his behalf, saying, Whose is the land? And that they should also say, Make thy covenant with me, and, behold, my hand shall be with thee, to bring about all Israel unto thee.
2SA.3.13	And he said, Good; I will make a covenant with thee, but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face except thou first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when thou comest to see my face.
2SA.3.14	After this, David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, Saul’s son, saying, Deliver me my wife Michal, which I espoused to me for one hundred foreskins of the Philistines.
2SA.3.15	So Ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband, even from Phaltiel, the son of Laish.
2SA.3.16	And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim. Then Abner said unto him, Go, return. And he returned.
2SA.3.17	And Abner had communication with the elders of Israel, saying, Ye sought for David in times past to be king over you;
2SA.3.18	now then do it, for the 
2SA.3.19	And Abner also spoke in the ears of Benjamin, and Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that seemed good to Israel and that seemed good to the whole house of Benjamin.
2SA.3.20	So Abner came to David to Hebron and twenty men with him. And David made a banquet for Abner and the men that were with him.
2SA.3.21	And Abner said unto David, I will arise and go and will gather all Israel unto my lord the king that they may make a covenant with thee and that thou may reign over all that thy heart desires. And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.
2SA.3.22	And, behold, the slaves of David and Joab came from pursuing a troop and brought in a great spoil with them. But Abner was not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he was gone in peace.
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all the host that was with him were come, they told Joab, saying, Abner, the son of Ner, came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he is gone in peace.
2SA.3.24	Then Joab came to the king and said, What hast thou done? Behold, Abner came unto thee; why is it that thou hast let him go?
2SA.3.25	Dost thou not know that Abner, the son of Ner, came to deceive thee, and to know thy going out and thy coming in and to know all that thou doest?
2SA.3.26	And when Joab was come out from David, he sent messengers after Abner, who caused him to return from the well of Sirah, but David did not know it.
2SA.3.27	And when Abner had returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside in the gate to speak with him quietly and smote him there under the fifth rib that he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.
2SA.3.28	And afterward when David heard it, he said, I and my kingdom are guiltless before the 
2SA.3.29	Let it rest on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house and let there not fail from the house of Joab one that has an issue or that is a leper or that leans on a staff or that dies by the sword or that lacks bread.
2SA.3.30	So Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.
2SA.3.31	Then David said to Joab and to all the people that were with him, Rend your clothes and gird yourselves with sackcloth and mourn before Abner. And King David himself followed the bier.
2SA.3.32	And they buried Abner in Hebron, and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
2SA.3.33	And the king lamented over Abner and said, Abner died the death of a fool!
2SA.3.34	Thy hands were not bound nor thy feet put into fetters. Thou didst fall as a man falls before wicked men. And all the people wept again over him.
2SA.3.35	And when all the people came to cause David to eat food while it was yet day, David swore, saying, So do God to me, and more also if I taste bread or anything else until the sun is down.
2SA.3.36	And all the people understood, and it pleased them, for whatever the king did pleased all the people.
2SA.3.37	For all the people and all Israel understood that day that it was not of the king to slay Abner, the son of Ner.
2SA.3.38	Then the king said unto his slaves, Do ye not know that there is a prince and a great man fallen this day in Israel?
2SA.3.39	And I am this day a tender anointed king, and these men the sons of Zeruiah are too hard for me; the 
2SA.4.1	And when Saul’s son heard that Abner was dead in Hebron, his hands were feeble, and all the Israelites were troubled.
2SA.4.2	And Saul’s son had two men that were captains of companies; the name of the one was Baanah, and the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon, a Beerothite, of the sons of Benjamin (for Beeroth also was reckoned to Benjamin;
2SA.4.3	and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim and were sojourners there until this day).
2SA.4.4	And Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son that was lame of his feet. He was five years old when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathan out of Jezreel, and his nurse took him up and fled, and it came to pass as she made haste to flee that he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephibosheth.
2SA.4.5	And the sons of Rimmon, the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went and came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, who lay on a bed at noon.
2SA.4.6	And they came there into the midst of the house as though they were wheat merchants, and they smote him under the fifth rib; and Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.
2SA.4.7	For when they came into the house, he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, and they smote him, and slew him and beheaded him and took his head and walked all night through the plain.
2SA.4.8	And they brought the head of Ishbosheth unto David to Hebron and said to the king, Behold the head of Ishbosheth the son of Saul thy enemy, who sought thy life, and the 
2SA.4.9	And David answered Rechab and Baanah, his brother, the sons of Rimmon, the Beerothite, and said unto them, As the 
2SA.4.10	when one told me, saying, Behold, Saul is dead, thinking to have brought good tidings, I took hold of him and slew him in Ziklag as a reward for his tidings.
2SA.4.11	How much more unto wicked men who have slain a righteous person in his own house upon his bed? Shall I not, therefore, now require his blood of your hand and remove you from the earth?
2SA.4.12	Then David commanded his young men, and they slew them and cut off their hands and their feet and hung them up over the pool in Hebron. But they took the head of Ishbosheth and buried it in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.
2SA.5.1	Then all the tribes of Israel came unto David in Hebron and spoke, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
2SA.5.2	And even yesterday and the day before yesterday, when Saul was king over us, it was thou that didst lead out and bring in Israel; and the 
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to the king in Hebron; and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the 
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years.
2SA.5.5	In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months; and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.
2SA.5.6	Then the king and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, who dwelt in the land, who spoke unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in here, thinking, David cannot come in here.
2SA.5.7	Nevertheless, David took the fortress of Zion; the same is the city of David.
2SA.5.8	And David said on that day, Who shall go up the waterspout and smite the Jebusites and the lame and the blind, that are hated of David’s soul? Therefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.
2SA.5.9	So David dwelt in the fortress and called it the city of David. And David built round about from Millo and inward.
2SA.5.10	And David went on and grew great, and the 
2SA.5.11	And Hiram, king of Tyre, also sent messengers to David, and cedar trees and carpenters and masons, and they built David a house.
2SA.5.12	And David understood that the 
2SA.5.13	And David took more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem after he had come from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born unto David.
2SA.5.14	And these were the names of those that were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphalet.
2SA.5.17	But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David, and David heard of it and went down to the fortress.
2SA.5.18	The Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. {Heb. of the giants}
2SA.5.19	Then David enquired of the 
2SA.5.20	And David came to Baalperazim, and David smote them there and said, The 
2SA.5.21	And they left their images there, and David and his men burned them.
2SA.5.22	And the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
2SA.5.23	And when David enquired of the 
2SA.5.24	and when thou hearest thunder going through the tops of the mulberry trees, then thou shalt move, for then the 
2SA.5.25	And David did so as the 
2SA.6.1	Again, David gathered together all the chosen of Israel, thirty thousand.
2SA.6.2	And David arose and went with all the people that were with him from Baale of Judah to bring up from there the ark of God upon which the name of the 
2SA.6.3	And they set the ark of God upon a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab that was in Gibeah, and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab drove the new cart.
2SA.6.4	And when they brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was at Gibeah, with the ark of God, Ahio went before the ark.
2SA.6.5	And David and all the house of Israel danced before the 
2SA.6.6	And when they came to Nachon’s threshingfloor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen shook it.
2SA.6.7	And the anger of the 
2SA.6.8	And David was grieved because the 
2SA.6.9	And David was afraid of the 
2SA.6.10	So David would not remove the ark of the 
2SA.6.11	And the ark of the 
2SA.6.12	And it was told King David, saying, The 
2SA.6.13	And it was so that when those that bore the ark of the 
2SA.6.14	And David danced before the 
2SA.6.15	So David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the 
2SA.6.16	And as the ark of the 
2SA.6.17	And they brought in the ark of the 
2SA.6.18	And as soon as David had finished offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
2SA.6.19	And he dealt among all the people, even among the whole multitude of Israel, to the men as well to the women, to each one a cake of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine. So all the people departed each one to his house.
2SA.6.20	Then David returned to bless his household. And Michal, the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, How glorious was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself today in the eyes of the handmaids of his slaves as one of the vain fellows shamelessly uncovers himself!
2SA.6.21	Then David said unto Michal, It was before the 
2SA.6.22	And I will yet be more vile than thus and will be base in my own sight and before the maidservants whom thou hast spoken of, of them shall I be had in honour.
2SA.6.23	Therefore, Michal, the daughter of Saul, had no children unto the day of her death.
2SA.7.1	And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house and the 
2SA.7.2	that the king said unto Nathan, the prophet, See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within curtains.
2SA.7.3	And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thy heart, for the 
2SA.7.4	And it came to pass that night that the word of the 
2SA.7.5	Go and tell my slave David, Thus hath the 
2SA.7.6	For I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the sons of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.
2SA.7.7	In all the places in which I have walked with all the sons of Israel did I speak a word in any of the tribes of Israel, unto whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why did ye not build me a house of cedar?
2SA.7.8	Now, therefore, so shalt thou say unto my slave David, Thus hath the 
2SA.7.9	and I have been with thee wherever thou didst walk and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.
2SA.7.10	Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel and will plant them, that they may dwell in their place and never again be removed; neither shall the sons of iniquity afflict them any more as before,
2SA.7.11	since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. And I will cause thee to rest from all thy enemies. Likewise, the 
2SA.7.12	And when thy days are fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.
2SA.7.13	He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom for ever.
2SA.7.14	I will be his father, and he shall be my son. If he commits iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the sons of men;
2SA.7.15	but my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I took away from before thee.
2SA.7.16	And thy house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee; thy throne shall be established for ever.
2SA.7.17	According to all these words and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
2SA.7.18	Then King David went in and sat before the 
2SA.7.19	And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy slave’s house for a great while to come and that this shall be the condition of a man, O Lord GOD.
2SA.7.20	And what more can David say unto thee? For thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy slave.
2SA.7.21	For thou hast done all these great things by thy word and according to thine own heart to make thy slave know them.
2SA.7.22	Therefore, thou art great, O 
2SA.7.23	And who in the earth is like thy people, like Israel? A Gentile for the love of whom God went to ransom as a people to himself and to give him a name and to do with you great and terrible things in thy land because of thy people whom thou didst redeem unto thee from Egypt, from the Gentiles and their gods?
2SA.7.24	For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be thy people for ever, and thou, 
2SA.7.25	And now, O 
2SA.7.26	For thus shall thy name be magnified for ever that it may be said, The 
2SA.7.27	For thou, O 
2SA.7.28	And now, O Lord GOD, thou art God, and thy words shall be firm, and thou hast spoken this goodness unto thy slave.
2SA.7.29	Therefore, now let it please thee to bless the house of thy slave that it may continue for ever before thee, for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it, and with thy blessing the house of thy slave shall be blessed for ever.
2SA.8.1	And after this, it came to pass that David smote the Philistines and subdued them, and David took Methegammah out of the hand of the Philistines.
2SA.8.2	He also smote those of Moab and measured them with a line, causing them to lie down on the ground, and he measured them with two lines, with one to put to death and the other full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David’s slaves, bringing presents.
2SA.8.3	David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to extend his border to the river Euphrates.
2SA.8.4	And David took from him a thousand seven hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen, and David hamstrung all the chariot horses but reserved of them for one hundred chariots.
2SA.8.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.
2SA.8.6	Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became slaves to David, bringing presents. And the 
2SA.8.7	And David took the shields of gold that were on the slaves of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem.
2SA.8.8	Likewise from Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a great quantity of brass.
2SA.8.9	When Toi, king of Hamath, heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,
2SA.8.10	then Toi sent Joram, his son, unto King David, to greet him peacefully and to bless him because he had fought against Hadadezer and smitten him, for Hadadezer had wars with Toi. And Joram brought vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of brass in his hand,
2SA.8.11	which King David dedicated unto the 
2SA.8.12	of the Syrians and of the Moabites and of the sons of Ammon and of the Philistines and of Amalekites and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.
2SA.8.13	And David received fame when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt eighteen thousand men.
2SA.8.14	And he put garrisons in Edom; he put garrisons throughout all Edom, and all those of Edom became David’s slaves. And the 
2SA.8.15	And David reigned over all Israel, and David executed justice and righteousness unto all his people.
2SA.8.16	And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was over the host, and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was the writer of chronicles;
2SA.8.17	and Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests, and Seraiah was the scribe,
2SA.8.18	and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David’s sons were priests.
2SA.9.1	And David said, Is anyone left of the house of Saul that I may show him mercy for Jonathan’s sake?
2SA.9.2	And there was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba. And when they had called him unto David, the king said unto him, Art thou Ziba? And he said, Thy slave is he.
2SA.9.3	And the king said, Is there no one left of the house of Saul that I may show the mercy of God unto him? And Ziba said unto the king, There remains a son of Jonathan, who is lame on his feet.
2SA.9.4	And the king said unto him, Where is he? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he is in the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lodebar.
2SA.9.5	Then King David sent and took him out of the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lodebar.
2SA.9.6	Now when Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, was come unto David, he fell on his face and worshipped. And David said, Mephibosheth. And he answered, Behold thy slave!
2SA.9.7	And David said unto him, Fear not; for I will surely show thee mercy for Jonathan, thy father’s sake, and will restore unto thee all the land of Saul, thy father; and thou shalt eat bread at my table continually.
2SA.9.8	And he bowed himself and said, Who is thy slave, that thou should look upon such a dead dog as I am?
2SA.9.9	Then the king called to Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said unto him, I have given unto thy master’s son all that pertained to Saul and to all his house.
2SA.9.10	Thou, therefore, and thy sons and thy slaves shall till the land for him, and thou shalt bring in the fruits that thy master’s son may have bread to eat, but Mephibosheth, thy master’s son, shall eat bread always at my table. Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty slaves.
2SA.9.11	Then Ziba said unto the king, According to all that my lord the king has commanded his slave, so shall thy slave do. As for Mephibosheth, said the king, he shall eat at my table as one of the king’s sons.
2SA.9.12	And Mephibosheth had a young son, whose name was Micha. And all that dwelt in the house of Ziba were servants unto Mephibosheth.
2SA.9.13	So Mephibosheth dwelt in Jerusalem, for he ate continually at the king’s table and was lame on both his feet.
2SA.10.1	And it came to pass after this that the king of the sons of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.
2SA.10.2	Then David said, I will show mercy unto Hanun the son of Nahash, as his father showed mercy unto me. And David sent to comfort him by the hand of his slaves for his father. And David’s slaves came into the land of the sons of Ammon.
2SA.10.3	And the princes of the sons of Ammon said unto Hanun their lord, Does it appear unto thee that David has sent comforters unto thee to honour thy father? Has not David rather sent his slaves unto thee to search the city and to spy it out and to overthrow it?
2SA.10.4	Therefore, Hanun took David’s slaves and shaved off the one half of their beards and cut off their garments in the middle even to their buttocks and sent them away.
2SA.10.5	When they told it unto David, he sent to meet them because the men were greatly ashamed, and the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown and then return.
2SA.10.6	And when the sons of Ammon saw that they stank before David, the sons of Ammon sent and hired the Syrians of Bethrehob and the Syrians of Zoba, twenty thousand footmen, and of king Maacah a thousand men, and of Ishtob twelve thousand men.
2SA.10.7	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men.
2SA.10.8	And the sons of Ammon came out and ordered their troops at the entering in of the gate, and the Syrians of Zoba and of Rehob and Ishtob and Maacah were in order by themselves in the field.
2SA.10.9	When Joab saw that there were troops before and behind him, he chose from among the chosen men of Israel and put them in order against the Syrians.
2SA.10.10	Then he delivered the rest of the people into the hand of Abishai his brother that he might put them in order against the sons of Ammon.
2SA.10.11	And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then thou shalt help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for thee, then I will come and help thee.
2SA.10.12	Be of good courage, and let us be strong for our people and for the cities of our God; and let the 
2SA.10.13	And Joab drew near and the people that were with him, to do battle against the Syrians, and they fled before him.
2SA.10.14	And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they also fled before Abishai and entered into the city. So Joab returned from the sons of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together.
2SA.10.16	And Hadarezer sent and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river, and they came to Helam, and Shobach, the captain of the host of Hadarezer, went before them.
2SA.10.17	And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel together and passed over the Jordan and came to Helam. And the Syrians set themselves in order against David and fought with him.
2SA.10.18	And the Syrians fled before Israel, and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians and forty thousand horsemen and smote Shobach, the captain of their host, who died there.
2SA.10.19	And when all the kings that were slaves to Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Syrians feared to help the sons of Ammon any more.
2SA.11.1	And it came to pass, after the year was expired, at the time when kings go forth to battle, that David sent Joab and his slaves with him and all Israel, and they destroyed the sons of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried still at Jerusalem.
2SA.11.2	And it came to pass one evening, that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the king’s house, and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself, and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
2SA.11.3	And David sent and enquired after the woman. And one said, Is not this Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah, the Hittite?
2SA.11.4	And David sent messengers and took her, and she came in unto him, and he lay with her. Then she purified herself from her uncleanness, and she returned unto her house.
2SA.11.5	And the woman conceived and sent and told David and said, I am with child.
2SA.11.6	Then David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Uriah the Hittite. And Joab sent Uriah to David.
2SA.11.7	And when Uriah had come unto him, David asked him how Joab was and how the people were and how the war prospered.
2SA.11.8	And David said to Uriah, Go down to thy house and wash thy feet. And Uriah departed out of the king’s house, and royal food was sent unto him.
2SA.11.9	But Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house with all the slaves of his lord and did not go down to his house.
2SA.11.10	And when they had told David, saying, Uriah did not go down unto his house, David said unto Uriah, Didst thou not come from thy journey? Why then didst thou not go down to thy house?
2SA.11.11	And Uriah said unto David, The ark and Israel and Judah abide in tents, and my lord Joab and the slaves of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; shall I then go into my house, to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? By thy life and by the life of thy soul, I will not do this thing.
2SA.11.12	And David said to Uriah, Tarry here today also, and tomorrow I will let thee depart. So Uriah abode in Jerusalem that day and the next day.
2SA.11.13	And when David had called him, he ate and drank before him, and he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his bed with the slaves of his lord but did not go down to his house.
2SA.11.14	And it came to pass in the morning, that David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by the hand of Uriah.
2SA.11.15	And he wrote in the letter, saying, Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle and retire from him, that he may be smitten and die.
2SA.11.16	And it came to pass, when Joab observed the city, that he assigned Uriah unto a place where he knew that the most valiant men were.
2SA.11.17	And the men of the city came out and fought with Joab, and some of the people of the slaves of David fell, and Uriah the Hittite died also.
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent and told David all the things concerning the war
2SA.11.19	and charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished telling the matters of the war unto the king,
2SA.11.20	and if the king begins to be angry and he should say unto thee, Why did you approach so near unto the city when ye fought? Did ye not know that which they can throw down from the wall?
2SA.11.21	Who smote Abimelech, the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from the wall, that he died in Thebez? Why did you go near the wall? Then thou shalt say, Thy slave Uriah, the Hittite, is dead also.
2SA.11.22	So the messenger went and came and told David all that Joab had sent him for.
2SA.11.23	And the messenger said unto David, Surely the men prevailed against us and came out unto us into the field, and we made them retreat unto the entering of the gate.
2SA.11.24	And the archers shot from off the wall upon thy slaves, and some of the king’s slaves are dead, and thy slave Uriah, the Hittite, is dead also.
2SA.11.25	Then David said unto the messenger, Thus shalt thou say unto Joab, Let not this thing displease thee, for the sword devours one as well as another; strengthen the battle against the city until it is overthrown and encourage thou him.
2SA.11.26	And when the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah, her husband, was dead, she mourned for her husband.
2SA.11.27	And when the mourning was past, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife and gave birth to a son unto him. But the thing that David had done displeased the 
2SA.12.1	And the 
2SA.12.2	The rich man had exceeding many sheep and cows,
2SA.12.3	but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb, which he had bought and nourished up, and it grew up together with him and with his children; it ate of his own food and drank of his own cup and lay in his bosom and was unto him as a daughter.
2SA.12.4	And a traveller came unto the rich man, who did not wish to take of his own sheep and of his own cows to dress for the wayfaring man that was come unto him, but took the poor man’s lamb and dressed it for the man that had come to him.
2SA.12.5	And David’s anger was greatly kindled against the man, and he said to Nathan, As the 
2SA.12.6	and he shall pay for the lamb fourfold because he did this thing and because he had no pity.
2SA.12.7	Then Nathan said to David, Thou art the man. Thus hath said the 
2SA.12.8	and I gave thee thy master’s house and thy master’s wives into thy bosom and gave thee the house of Israel and of Judah, and if that is too little, I shall add unto thee such and such things.
2SA.12.9	Why, therefore, hast thou despised the commandment of the 
2SA.12.10	Now, therefore, the sword shall never depart from thy house because thou hast despised me and hast taken the wife of Uriah, the Hittite, to be thy wife.
2SA.12.11	Thus hath the 
2SA.12.12	For thou hast done it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel and before the sun.
2SA.12.13	Then David said unto Nathan, I have sinned against the 
2SA.12.14	However, because by this deed, thou hast given great occasion to the enemies of the 
2SA.12.15	And Nathan departed unto his house. And the 
2SA.12.16	David, therefore, besought God for the child, and David fasted and went in and lay all night upon the earth.
2SA.12.17	And the elders of his house arose and went to him to raise him up from the earth, but he would not, neither did he eat bread with them.
2SA.12.18	And it came to pass on the seventh day that the child died. And the slaves of David feared to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke unto him, and he would not hearken unto our voice; how much more will it trouble him if we tell him that the child is dead?
2SA.12.19	But when David saw that his slaves whispered, David understood that the child was dead; therefore, David said unto his slaves, Is the child dead? And they said, He is dead.
2SA.12.20	Then David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes and came into the house of the 
2SA.12.21	Then his slaves said unto him, What is this that thou hast done? Thou didst fast and weep for the child while it was alive; but when the child was dead, thou didst rise and eat bread.
2SA.12.22	And he replied, While the child was yet alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, Who can tell whether GOD will have mercy on me, that the child may live?
2SA.12.23	But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.
2SA.12.24	And David comforted Bathsheba, his wife, and went in unto her and lay with her; and she gave birth to a son, and he called his name Solomon; {Heb. peace offering}; and the 
2SA.12.25	And he sent by the hand of Nathan, the prophet; and he called his name Jedidiah, {Heb. beloved of the 
2SA.12.26	And Joab fought against Rabbah, of the sons of Ammon, and took the royal city.
2SA.12.27	Then Joab sent messengers to David and said, I have fought against Rabbah and have taken the city of waters.
2SA.12.28	Now, therefore, gather the rest of the people together and encamp against the city and take it lest I take the city, and it be called after my name.
2SA.12.29	And David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah and fought against it and took it.
2SA.12.30	And he took their king’s crown from off his head, the weight of which was a talent of gold with the precious stones, and it was set on David’s head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance.
2SA.12.31	And he brought forth the people that were therein and put them under saws and under harrows of iron and under axes of iron and made them pass through the brickkiln, and thus did he unto all the cities of the sons of Ammon. So David and all the people returned unto Jerusalem.
2SA.13.1	And it came to pass after this that Absalom, the son of David, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar, and Amnon, the son of David, loved her.
2SA.13.2	And Amnon was so distressed that he fell sick for his sister Tamar, for she was a virgin, and Amnon thought it difficult for him to do any thing to her.
2SA.13.3	But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, and Jonadab was a very astute man.
2SA.13.4	And he said unto him, Why art thou, being the king’s son, becoming thinner from day to day? Wilt thou not tell me? And Amnon said unto him, I love Tamar, my brother Absalom’s sister.
2SA.13.5	And Jonadab said unto him, Lay thee down on thy bed and pretend to be sick; and when thy father comes to see thee, say unto him, I pray thee, let my sister Tamar come and give me food and make the food in my sight that I may see it and eat it at her hand.
2SA.13.6	So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick, and when the king came to see him, Amnon said unto the king, I pray thee, let Tamar, my sister, come, and make me a couple of cakes in my sight that I may eat at her hand.
2SA.13.7	Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, Go now to thy brother Amnon’s house and make him something to eat.
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, and he was lying down. And she took flour and kneaded it and made cakes in his sight and baked the cakes.
2SA.13.9	Then she took a pan and poured them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, Send everyone out from me. And they all went out from him.
2SA.13.10	Then Amnon said unto Tamar, Bring the food into the chamber that I may eat from thy hand. And Tamar took the cakes which she had made and brought them into the chamber to Amnon, her brother.
2SA.13.11	And when she had brought them unto him to eat, he took hold of her and said unto her, Come lie with me, my sister.
2SA.13.12	And she answered him, No, my brother, do not force me, for no such thing ought to be done in Israel. Do not commit this folly.
2SA.13.13	And I, where shall I go with my reproach? And as for thee, thou shalt be as one of the fools in Israel. Now, therefore, I pray thee, speak unto the king, for he will not withhold me from thee.
2SA.13.14	Howbeit, he would not hearken unto her voice, but, being stronger than she, forced her and lay with her.
2SA.13.15	Then Amnon hated her exceedingly so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said unto her, Arise, be gone.
2SA.13.16	And she said unto him, There is no cause; this evil in sending me away is greater than the other that thou didst unto me. But he would not hearken unto her.
2SA.13.17	Then he called his servant that ministered unto him and said, Put now this woman out from me and bolt the door after her.
2SA.13.18	And she had a garment of different colours upon her, for with such robes were the king’s daughters that were virgins apparelled. Then his servant brought her out and bolted the door after her.
2SA.13.19	And Tamar put ashes on her head and rent her garment of different colours that was on her and laid her hand on her head and went on crying.
2SA.13.20	And Absalom, her brother, said unto her, Has Amnon thy brother been with thee? But now remain silent, my sister; he is thy brother; do not regard this thing in thy heart. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom’s house.
2SA.13.21	But when King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.
2SA.13.22	And Absalom spoke neither good nor bad unto his brother Amnon, for Absalom hated Amnon because he had forced his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	And it came to pass after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baalhazor, which is beside Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons.
2SA.13.24	And Absalom came to the king and said, Behold now, thy slave has sheepshearers; let the king, I beseech thee, and his slaves go with thy slave.
2SA.13.25	And the king said to Absalom, No, my son, let us not all go lest we be burdensome unto thee. And he pressed him; however, he would not go but blessed him.
2SA.13.26	Then said Absalom, If not, I pray thee, let my brother Amnon go with us. And the king said unto him, Why should he go with thee?
2SA.13.27	But because Absalom pressed him, he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.
2SA.13.28	Now Absalom had commanded his servants, saying, Mark ye now when Amnon’s heart is merry with wine, and when I say unto you, Smite Amnon, then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous, and be valiant.
2SA.13.29	And the servants of Absalom did unto Amnon as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons arose, and they all got upon their mules and fled.
2SA.13.30	And it came to pass, while they were in the way, that the rumour came to David, saying, Absalom has slain all the king’s sons, and there is not one of them left.
2SA.13.31	Then the king arose and tore his garments and lay on the earth; and all his slaves stood by with their clothes rent.
2SA.13.32	And Jonadab, the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, answered and said, Do not let my lord suppose that they have slain all the young men, the king’s sons, for only Amnon is dead, for by the mouth of Absalom this has been determined from the day that he forced his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.33	Now, therefore, do not let my lord the king take the thing to his heart, to think that all the king’s sons are dead, for only Amnon is dead.
2SA.13.34	But Absalom fled. And the young man that kept the watch lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there came many people by the way of the side of the mountain behind him.
2SA.13.35	And Jonadab said unto the king, Behold, the king’s sons come; as thy slave said, so it is.
2SA.13.36	And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king’s sons came and lifted up their voice and wept. And the king also and all his slaves wept very sore.
2SA.13.37	But Absalom fled and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.
2SA.13.38	So after Absalom fled and went to Geshur, he was there three years.
2SA.13.39	And King David longed to see Absalom, for he was now comforted concerning Amnon, who was dead.
2SA.14.1	Now Joab, the son of Zeruiah, perceived that the king’s heart was toward Absalom.
2SA.14.2	And Joab sent to Tekoa and brought an astute woman from there and said unto her, I pray thee, feign thyself to be a mourner and put on mourning apparel and do not anoint thyself with oil, but be as a woman that has mourned for a long time for someone who is dead
2SA.14.3	and come to the king and speak on this manner unto him. So Joab put the words in her mouth.
2SA.14.4	And when the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground and did obeisance and said, Save me, O king.
2SA.14.5	And the king said unto her, What ails thee? And she answered, I am a widow woman, and my husband is dead.
2SA.14.6	And thy handmaid had two sons, and the two strove together in the field, and there was no one to part them, but the one smote the other and slew him.
2SA.14.7	And, behold, the whole family is risen against thy handmaid, and they said, Deliver him that smote his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and we will destroy the heir also. So they shall quench my coal which is left and shall not leave to my husband neither name nor remainder upon the earth.
2SA.14.8	And the king said unto the woman, Go to thy house, and I will give a command concerning thee.
2SA.14.9	And the woman of Tekoa said unto the king, My lord, O king, the iniquity be on me and on my father’s house; and the king and his throne be guiltless.
2SA.14.10	And the king said, Whoever speaks against thee, bring him to me, and he shall not touch thee any more.
2SA.14.11	Then she said, I pray thee, let the king remember the 
2SA.14.12	Then the woman said, Let thine handmaid, I pray thee, speak one word unto my lord the king. And he said, Say on.
2SA.14.13	And the woman said, Why then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God? For the king speaks this word as one who is guilty in that the king does not bring home again his banished.
2SA.14.14	For it is certain that we die and are as water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; neither does God respect any person; yet he does devise means that his outcasts not be expelled from him.
2SA.14.15	Now, therefore, that I have come to speak of this thing unto my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. But thy handmaid said to herself, I will now speak unto the king; it may be that the king will perform the word of his handmaid.
2SA.14.16	For the king will hear, to deliver his handmaid out of the hand of the man that would destroy me and my son together out of the inheritance of God.
2SA.14.17	Then thy handmaid said, Let the word of my lord the king bring rest; for as an angel of God, so is my lord the king to discern good and evil; and let the 
2SA.14.18	Then the king answered and said unto the woman, Hide not from me, I pray thee, the thing that I shall ask thee. And the woman said, Let my lord the king now speak.
2SA.14.19	And the king said, Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this? And the woman answered and said, By the life of thy soul, my lord the king, I can not turn to the right hand or to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken; for thy slave Joab, he commanded me, and he put all these words in the mouth of thy handmaid;
2SA.14.20	to bring about this form of speech thy slave Joab has done this thing; but my lord is wise, according to the wisdom of an angel of God, to know that which is done in the earth.
2SA.14.21	Then the king said unto Joab, Behold now, I have done this thing; go, therefore, bring the young man Absalom again.
2SA.14.22	And Joab fell to the ground on his face and worshipped and blessed the king, and Joab said, Today thy slave knows that I have found grace in thy sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has fulfilled the word of his slave.
2SA.14.23	So Joab arose and went to Geshur and brought Absalom to Jerusalem.
2SA.14.24	But the king said, Let him go to his own house and let him not see my face. So Absalom returned to his own house, and did not see the king’s face.
2SA.14.25	And in all Israel there was no one to be so greatly praised as Absalom for his beauty; from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.
2SA.14.26	And when he shaved his head (for it was at every year’s end that he shaved it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore, he shaved it), the hair of his head weighed two hundred shekels after the king’s weight.
2SA.14.27	And unto Absalom there were born three sons and one daughter, whose name was Tamar, who was a beautiful woman to behold.
2SA.14.28	So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem and did not see the king’s face.
2SA.14.29	Therefore, Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king; but he would not come to him; and when he sent again the second time, he would not come.
2SA.14.30	Therefore, he said unto his slaves, See, Joab’s field is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire. And Absalom’s slaves set the field on fire.
2SA.14.31	Then Joab arose and came to Absalom unto his house and said unto him, Why have thy slaves set my field on fire?
2SA.14.32	And Absalom answered Joab, Behold, I have sent for thee, saying, Come here, that I may send thee to the king, to say, Why have I come from Geshur? It would have been better for me to have been there still. Now, therefore, let me see the king’s face; and if there is any iniquity in me, let him kill me.
2SA.14.33	So Joab came to the king and told him. Then he called Absalom, who came to the king and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.
2SA.15.1	And it came to pass after this that Absalom prepared himself chariots and horses and fifty men to run before him.
2SA.15.2	And Absalom rose up early and stood beside the way of the gate; and when anyone that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called unto them and said, Of what city art thou? And he said, Thy slave is of one of the tribes of Israel.
2SA.15.3	And Absalom would say unto them, See, thy matters are good and just; but there is no one delegated by the king to hear thee.
2SA.15.4	And Absalom would say, Oh, that I were made judge in the land, that everyone who has any suit or cause might come unto me, and I would do him justice!
2SA.15.5	And it was so, that when anyone came near unto him to do him obeisance, he put forth his hand and took him and kissed him.
2SA.15.6	And Absalom did according to this manner with all Israel that came to the king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of those of Israel.
2SA.15.7	And at the end of a predetermined period of forty years, it came to pass that Absalom said unto the king, I pray thee, let me go to Hebron and pay my vow, which I have vowed unto the 
2SA.15.8	For thy slave vowed a vow while I abode at Geshur in Syria, saying, If the 
2SA.15.9	And the king said unto him, Go in peace. So he arose and went to Hebron.
2SA.15.10	But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, As soon as ye hear the sound of the shofar, then ye shall say, Absalom reigns in Hebron.
2SA.15.11	And two hundred men of Jerusalem went with Absalom, that were invited by him, and they went in their integrity, without knowing anything.
2SA.15.12	Absalom also sent for Ahithophel, the Gilonite, of David’s counsel, from his city, even from Giloh, while he offered sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people increased continually with Absalom.
2SA.15.13	And the word came to David, saying, The hearts of the men of Israel are after Absalom.
2SA.15.14	Then David said unto all his slaves that were with him at Jerusalem, Arise, and let us flee, for we shall not otherwise escape from Absalom; make speed to depart lest he overtake us suddenly and bring evil upon us and smite the city with the edge of the sword.
2SA.15.15	And the king’s slaves said unto the king, Behold, thy slaves are ready to do whatever my lord the king shall choose.
2SA.15.16	And the king went forth and all his household after him. And the king left ten women, who were concubines, to keep the house.
2SA.15.17	And the king went forth and all the people after him and stopped in a place that was far off.
2SA.15.18	And all his slaves passed to his side, and all the Cherethites and all the Pelethites and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come on foot with him from Gath, went before the king.
2SA.15.19	Then the king said to Ittai, the Gittite, Why dost thou also go with us? Return to thy place and abide with the king; for thou art a stranger and also an exile.
2SA.15.20	Whereas thou didst come but yesterday, should I this day make thee go up and down with us? Seeing I go where I go, return thou and take back thy brethren; mercy and truth are in thee.
2SA.15.21	And Ittai answered the king and said, As the 
2SA.15.22	Then David said to Ittai, Go, therefore, and pass. And Ittai, the Gittite, passed and all his men and all the little ones that were with him.
2SA.15.23	And all those of the land wept with a loud voice, and all the people passed the brook Kidron; and then the king also passed, and all the people passed unto the way of the wilderness.
2SA.15.24	And behold Zadok also and with him all the Levites who bore the ark of the covenant of God, and they set down the ark of God. And Abiathar went up after all the people had finished leaving the city.
2SA.15.25	But the king said unto Zadok, Carry back the ark of God into the city; if I shall find grace in the eyes of the 
2SA.15.26	But if he should say, I have no delight in thee; behold, here I am, let him do to me as seems good unto him.
2SA.15.27	The king said also unto Zadok, the priest, Art not thou a seer? Return into the city in peace and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz, thy son, and Jonathan, the son of Abiathar.
2SA.15.28	See, I will tarry in the plain of the wilderness until you send word to me.
2SA.15.29	Then Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem, and they remained there.
2SA.15.30	And David went up by the ascent of Mount Olivet and wept as he went up and had his head covered, and he went barefoot. And all the people that were with him covered each one his head, and they went up, weeping as they went up.
2SA.15.31	And it was told David, saying, Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom. Then David said, O 
2SA.15.32	And it came to pass that when David came to the top of the mount to worship God there, behold, Hushai, the Archite came to meet him, with his coat rent and earth upon his head,
2SA.15.33	Unto whom David said, If thou pass on with me, then thou shalt be a burden unto me;
2SA.15.34	but if thou return to the city and say unto Absalom, I will be thy slave, O king as I have been thy father’s slave until now, so will I now also be thy slave; then thou may defeat the counsel of Ahithophel for me.
2SA.15.35	Are not Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, there with thee? Therefore, it shall be that whatever thou shalt hear out of the king’s house, thou shalt tell it to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests.
2SA.15.36	Behold, they have there with them their two sons, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son, and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send unto me everything that you hear.
2SA.15.37	So Hushai, David’s special companion came into the city, and Absalom came into Jerusalem.
2SA.16.1	And when David was a little past the top of the mountain, behold, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, met him with a couple of asses saddled and upon them two hundred loaves of bread and one hundred bunches of raisins and one hundred of summer fruits and a bottle of wine.
2SA.16.2	And the king said unto Ziba, What meanest thou by these? And Ziba said, The asses are for the king’s household to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit for the servants to eat, and the wine that those that become weary in the wilderness may drink.
2SA.16.3	And the king said, And where is thy master’s son? And Ziba said unto the king, Behold, he abides at Jerusalem, for he said, Today shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father.
2SA.16.4	Then the king said to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth. And Ziba bowed down and said, Let me find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king.
2SA.16.5	And when King David came to Bahurim, behold, a man of the family of the house of Saul came forth, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he came forth cursing
2SA.16.6	and casting stones at David and at all the slaves of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.
2SA.16.7	And thus said Shimei when he cursed, Come out, come out, thou bloody man, and thou man of Belial;
2SA.16.8	the 
2SA.16.9	Then Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, said unto the king, Why should this dead dog curse, my lord the king? Let me go over, I pray thee, and take off his head.
2SA.16.10	And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah? So let him curse, because the 
2SA.16.11	And David said to Abishai, and to all his slaves, Behold, my son, who came forth of my bowels, seeks my life; how much more now a son of Jemini? Let him alone, and let him curse, for the 
2SA.16.12	It may be that the 
2SA.16.13	And as David and his men went by the way, Shimei went along on the side of the mountain over against him and cursed as he went and threw stones at him and cast dust.
2SA.16.14	And the king and all the people that were with him arrived weary and refreshed themselves there.
2SA.16.15	And Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
2SA.16.16	And it came to pass when Hushai the Archite, David’s special companion, came unto Absalom, that Hushai said unto Absalom, Long live the king, Long live the king.
2SA.16.17	And Absalom said to Hushai, Is this thy mercy to thy friend? Why didst thou not go with thy friend?
2SA.16.18	And Hushai said unto Absalom, No, but whom the 
2SA.16.19	And again, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of his son? As I have served in thy father’s presence, so will I be in thy presence.
2SA.16.20	Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, Give counsel among you what we shall do.
2SA.16.21	And Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Go in unto thy father’s concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel shall hear that thou art abhorred of thy father; then the hands of all that are with thee shall be strong.
2SA.16.22	So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house, and Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
2SA.16.23	And the counselled of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was as if a man had enquired at the word of God: so was all the counselled of Ahithophel both with David and with Absalom.
2SA.17.1	Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom, Let me now choose out twelve thousand men, and I will arise and pursue after David this night,
2SA.17.2	and I will come upon him while he is weary and weak-handed and will make him afraid, and all the people that are with him shall flee; and I will smite the king only.
2SA.17.3	Thus will I turn all the people back unto thee, and when they have returned (for that man is whom thou dost seek), all the people shall be in peace.
2SA.17.4	And this word seemed right in the eyes of Absalom and of all the elders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	Then Absalom said, Now call Hushai, the Archite, also, and let us likewise hear what he says.
2SA.17.6	And when Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom spoke unto him, saying, Thus spoke Ahithophel; shall we follow his word or not? Speak thou.
2SA.17.7	Then Hushai said unto Absalom, The counsel that Ahithophel has given this time is not good.
2SA.17.8	For, said Hushai, thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are mighty men, and now their souls are bitter, as a bear robbed of her whelps in the field. And thy father is a man of war and will not lodge with the people.
2SA.17.9	Behold, he is hid now in some pit or in some other place, and if some of thy men are overthrown at the beginning, whoever hears of it will say, There is a slaughter among the people that follow Absalom.
2SA.17.10	Thus even the valiant, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, shall utterly melt, for all Israel knows that thy father is a mighty man and those who are with him are valiant men.
2SA.17.11	Therefore I counsel that all Israel be generally gathered unto thee from Dan even to Beersheba, as the sand that is by the sea for multitude, and that thou go to battle in thine own person.
2SA.17.12	Then we shall come upon him in some place where he shall be found, and we will light upon him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and of all the men that are with him, there shall not be left so much as one.
2SA.17.13	Moreover, if he goes into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will draw it into the river until not even one small stone is found there.
2SA.17.14	Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Hushai, the Archite, is better than the counsel of Ahithophel. For the 
2SA.17.15	Then Hushai said unto Zadok and to Abiathar, the priests, Thus and thus did Ahithophel counselled Absalom and the elders of Israel, and thus and thus have I counselled.
2SA.17.16	Now, therefore, send quickly and tell David, saying, Do not lodge this night in the plains of the wilderness, but speedily pass the Jordan; lest the king be swallowed up and all the people that are with him.
2SA.17.17	Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz stayed by Enrogel, for they could not be seen coming into the city; and a maidservant went and told them, and they went and told King David.
2SA.17.18	Nevertheless, a young man saw them and told Absalom, but both of them went away quickly and came to a man’s house in Bahurim, who had a well in his court, and they went down into it.
2SA.17.19	And the woman of the house took and spread a covering over the well’s mouth and spread ground wheat upon it, and the thing was not known.
2SA.17.20	And when Absalom’s slaves came to the woman to the house, they said, Where is Ahimaaz and Jonathan? And the woman said unto them, They have gone over the brook of water. And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.17.21	And it came to pass, after they had departed, that they came up out of the well and went and told King David and said unto David, Arise and pass quickly over the water, for thus has Ahithophel counselled against you.
2SA.17.22	Then David arose and all the people that were with him, and they passed over the Jordan before the morning light; there lacked not one of them that was not gone over the Jordan.
2SA.17.23	And when Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass and arose, and went home to his house, to his city, and put his household in order and hanged himself and died and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
2SA.17.24	Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.
2SA.17.25	And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab; this Amasa was the son of a man of Israel named Ithra, who had gone in to Abigail, the daughter of Nahash, sister to Zeruiah, Joab’s mother.
2SA.17.26	So Israel pitched camp with Absalom in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	And it came to pass, when David arrived at Mahanaim, that Shobi, the son of Nahash of Rabbah of the sons of Ammon; and Machir, the son of Ammiel of Lodebar; and Barzillai, the Gileadite of Rogelim,
2SA.17.28	brought beds and basins and earthen vessels and wheat and barley and flour and parched wheat and beans and lentils and parched grain
2SA.17.29	and honey and butter and sheep and cheese of cows for David and for the people that were with him, to eat, for they said, These people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.
2SA.18.1	And David numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of thousands and captains of hundreds over them.
2SA.18.2	And David sent forth a third part of the people under the hand of Joab and another third under the hand of Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and the other third under the hand of Ittai, the Gittite. And the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself also.
2SA.18.3	But the people answered, Thou shalt not go forth, for if we flee away, they will not care about us; nor if half of us die, will they care about us; but now thou art worth ten thousand of us. Therefore, now it is better that thou help us out of the city.
2SA.18.4	Then the king said unto them, I will do what seems best unto you. And the king stood beside the gate, and all the people came out by hundreds and by thousands.
2SA.18.5	And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom.
2SA.18.6	So the people went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was in the forest of Ephraim,
2SA.18.7	where the people of Israel were slain before the slaves of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of twenty thousand men.
2SA.18.8	For the battle was there scattered over the face of all the land, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.
2SA.18.9	And Absalom met the slaves of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and the mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught hold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and the mule that was under him went away.
2SA.18.10	And a certain man saw it and told Joab, saying, Behold, I saw Absalom hanged in an oak.
2SA.18.11	And Joab replied unto the man that told him, Behold, when thou didst see him, why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? I would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle.
2SA.18.12	And the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in my hand, yet I would not put forth my hand against the king’s son, for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Beware that no one touch the young man Absalom.
2SA.18.13	Otherwise, I should have wrought falsehood against my own soul (for there is no matter hid from the king), and thou thyself would have set thyself against me.
2SA.18.14	Then Joab answered, I may not tarry thus with thee. And taking three darts in his hand, he thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was yet alive in the midst of the oak.
2SA.18.15	And ten young men that bore Joab’s armour surrounded and smote Absalom and slew him.
2SA.18.16	Then Joab blew the shofar, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab held back the people.
2SA.18.17	And they took Absalom and cast him into a great pit in the forest and laid a very great heap of stones upon him; and all Israel fled each one to his tent.
2SA.18.18	Now Absalom, while he was alive, had taken and reared up for himself a pillar, which is in the king’s valley; for he said, I have no son to keep my name in remembrance. And he called the pillar after his own name, and it is called unto this day, Absalom’s place. {Heb. hand}
2SA.18.19	Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, Let me now run and bear the king tidings, how that the 
2SA.18.20	And Joab said unto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings today, but thou shalt bear tidings another day; but this day thou shalt bear no tidings because the king’s son is dead.
2SA.18.21	And Joab said to Cushi, Go tell the king what thou hast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab and ran.
2SA.18.22	Then Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said yet again unto Joab, Be what may, let me, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Why wilt thou run, my son, seeing that thou wilt receive no reward for the tidings?
2SA.18.23	But, said he, let me run, be what may. And he said unto him, Run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain and overran Cushi.
2SA.18.24	And David sat between the two gates, and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate unto the wall and lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold a man running alone.
2SA.18.25	And the watchman cried and told the king. And the king said, If he is alone, he brings good news. And while he kept on drawing near,
2SA.18.26	the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called unto the porter and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth tidings.
2SA.18.27	And the watchman said, I think the running of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok. And the king said, He is a good man and comes with good tidings.
2SA.18.28	And Ahimaaz called and said unto the king peace. And he fell down to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the 
2SA.18.29	And the king said, Is the young man Absalom at peace? And Ahimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king’s slave, and me thy slave, I saw a great tumult, but I did not know what it was.
2SA.18.30	And the king said unto him, Turn aside and stand here. And he turned aside and stood still.
2SA.18.31	And, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king, for the 
2SA.18.32	And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom at peace? And Cushi answered, Let the enemies of my lord the king and all that rise against thee for evil, be as that young man.
2SA.18.33	Then the king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept; and as he went, he said this: O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! I would rather have died instead of thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!
2SA.19.1	And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weeps and mourns for Absalom.
2SA.19.2	And that day the salvation was turned into mourning for all the people, for the people heard it said that day how the king was grieved for his son.
2SA.19.3	And the people entered by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.
2SA.19.4	But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!
2SA.19.5	And Joab entering into the house of the king, said unto him, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy slaves, who this day have saved thy life and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters and the lives of thy wives and the lives of thy concubines,
2SA.19.6	by loving those who hate thee and hating thy friends. For thou hast declared this day that thou dost not regard thy princes nor thy slaves. For this day I perceive that if Absalom had lived and we had all died today, then this would be right in thine eyes.
2SA.19.7	Now, therefore, arise, go forth and speak unto the heart of thy slaves, for I swear by the 
2SA.19.8	Then the king arose and sat in the gate. And it was declared unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king sits in the gate. And all the people came before the king, but Israel had fled every man to his tent.
2SA.19.9	And all the people were in contention throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines, and now he has fled out of the land for Absalom.
2SA.19.10	And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now, therefore, why are ye silent regarding bringing the king back?
2SA.19.11	And King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar, the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of Judah, saying, Why shall ye be the last to bring the king back to his house? Seeing that the word of all Israel has come to the king, to return him to his house.
2SA.19.12	Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh; why then are ye the last to bring back the king?
2SA.19.13	Likewise say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone and of my flesh? God do so to me and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the place of Joab.
2SA.19.14	And he inclined the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man, so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou and all thy slaves.
2SA.19.15	So the king returned and came to the Jordan. And Judah came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over the Jordan.
2SA.19.16	And Shimei, the son of Gera, son of Jemini, who was of Bahurim, hastened and came down with the men of Judah to meet King David.
2SA.19.17	And there were a thousand men of Benjamin with him; likewise Ziba, the slave of the house of Saul and his fifteen sons and his twenty slaves with him, who went over the Jordan before the king.
2SA.19.18	Then the ferry boat went over to carry over the king’s household and to do what he desired. Then Shimei, the son of Gera, fell down before the king, as he was passing the Jordan,
2SA.19.19	And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither retain the memory of the wickedness that thy slave did the day that my lord the king went out of Jerusalem, that the king should guard it in his heart.
2SA.19.20	For I, thy slave, know that I have sinned; therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of Joseph to go down to meet my lord the king.
2SA.19.21	But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this because he cursed the 
2SA.19.22	Then David said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? Shall anyone be put to death today in Israel? Do I not know that I am this day king over Israel?
2SA.19.23	And the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king swore unto him.
2SA.19.24	Mephibosheth, the son of Saul, also came down to meet the king and had neither washed his feet nor trimmed his beard nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace.
2SA.19.25	And after he had come to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said unto him, Why didst thou not go with me, Mephibosheth?
2SA.19.26	And he answered, My lord, O king, my slave deceived me, for thy slave said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride upon it and go to the king because thy slave is lame.
2SA.19.27	And he has slandered thy slave unto my lord the king, but my lord the king is as an angel of God; do therefore what is good in thine eyes.
2SA.19.28	For all of my father’s house were worthy of death before my lord the king; yet thou didst set thy slave among those that eat at thy own table. What righteousness, therefore, have I yet to cry any more unto the king?
2SA.19.29	And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more words? I have determined, Thou and Ziba divide the land.
2SA.19.30	And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Let him even take it all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house.
2SA.19.31	Barzillai, the Gileadite, also came down from Rogelim and went over the Jordan with the king to conduct him over the Jordan.
2SA.19.32	Now Barzillai was a very aged man, of eighty years, who had provided the king with sustenance while he was at Mahanaim, for he was a very great man.
2SA.19.33	And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in Jerusalem.
2SA.19.34	And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto Jerusalem?
2SA.19.35	I am this day eighty years old, and shall I tell the difference between the good and the bad? Shall thy slave enjoy what I eat or what I drink? Shall I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why then should thy slave be yet a burden unto my lord the king?
2SA.19.36	Thy slave will go a little way over the Jordan with the king, and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward?
2SA.19.37	Let thy slave, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in my own city and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy slave Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king, and do to him what shall seem good unto thee.
2SA.19.38	And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do with him that which shall seem good unto thee, and whatever thou shalt ask of me, that will I do for thee.
2SA.19.39	And all the people went over the Jordan. And when the king had also come over, the king kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned unto his own place.
2SA.19.40	Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel.
2SA.19.41	And, behold, all the men of Israel came to the king and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of Judah, stolen thee away and have brought the king and his household and all David’s men with him, over the Jordan?
2SA.19.42	And all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, Because the king is near of kin to us. Why then are ye angry for this matter? Have we eaten anything at the king’s cost? Or has he given us any gift?
2SA.19.43	Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye; why then did ye not take us into account? Did we not speak first about bringing back our king? But in the end words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel.
2SA.20.1	And a man of Belial happened to be there, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a man of Jemini, and he blew the shofar, saying, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse. Every man to his tents, O Israel.
2SA.20.2	So all the men of Israel went up from after David and followed Sheba, the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah cleaved unto their king from the Jordan even to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.3	And when David came to his house at Jerusalem, the king took the ten women, his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and put them in ward and fed them, but did not go in unto them. So they were shut up unto the day of their death, living in widowhood.
2SA.20.4	Then the king said to Amasa, Assemble me the men of Judah for the third day, and be thou here present.
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to assemble the men of Judah, but he tarried longer than the set time which he had appointed him.
2SA.20.6	And David said to Abishai, Now Sheba, the son of Bichri, shall do us more harm than Absalom; take thou thy lord’s slaves and pursue after him lest he find fenced cities and escape us.
2SA.20.7	Then Joab’s men went out after him, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all the mighty men; and they went out of Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba, the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.8	When they were at the great stone which is in Gibeon, Amasa came out and met them. And Joab’s garment that he had put on was girded unto him and upon it a girdle with a sword fastened upon his loins in its sheath, and as he went forth, it fell out.
2SA.20.9	And Joab said to Amasa, Art thou in peace, my brother? And Joab took Amasa by the beard with the right hand to kiss him.
2SA.20.10	But Amasa took no heed of the sword that was in Joab’s hand; and he smote him with it in the fifth rib, and shed out his bowels to the ground and struck him not again; and he died. So Joab and Abishai, his brother, pursued after Sheba, the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.11	And one of Joab’s servants stood by him, and said, He that favours Joab and he that is for David, let him go after Joab.
2SA.20.12	And Amasa had wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people stopped, he removed Amasa out of the highway into the field and cast a garment upon him because he saw that every one that came by him stopped.
2SA.20.13	When he was removed out of the highway, all the people that followed Joab passed on, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.
2SA.20.14	And he went through all the tribes of Israel unto Abel and to Bethmaachah and all the Berites; and they were gathered together and also went after him.
2SA.20.15	And they came and besieged him in Abel of Bethmaachah, and they cast up a bank against the city, and the people went against the wall; and all the people that were with Joab battered the wall, to throw it down.
2SA.20.16	Then a wise woman cried out in the city, Hear, hear, I pray you, tell Joab to come here, that I may speak with him.
2SA.20.17	And when he had come near unto her, the woman said, Art thou Joab? And he answered, I am he. Then she said unto him, Hear the words of thy handmaid. And he answered, I hear.
2SA.20.18	Then she spoke, saying, They used to speak in old times, saying, If you have a question ask it at Abel; and so they concluded the matter.
2SA.20.19	I am one of those that are peaceable and faithful in Israel, and thou seekest to destroy a city that is a mother in Israel; why wilt thou swallow up the inheritance of the 
2SA.20.20	And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me that I should swallow up or destroy.
2SA.20.21	The matter is not so, but a man of Mount Ephraim, Sheba, the son of Bichri, by name, has lifted up his hand against King David; give only him over, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said unto Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
2SA.20.22	Then the woman went unto all the people in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba, the son of Bichri, and cast it out to Joab. And he blew the shofar, and they retired from the city, each one to his tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem unto the king.
2SA.20.23	So Joab remained over all the host of Israel, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites;
2SA.20.24	and Adoram was over the tribute, and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, was writer of the chronicles,
2SA.20.25	and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests;
2SA.20.26	and Ira, the Jairite, was David’s priest.
2SA.21.1	Then there was a famine in the days of David for three consecutive years, and David enquired of the 
2SA.21.2	And the king called the Gibeonites and said unto them: (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the sons of Israel had sworn unto them, and Saul had sought to slay them in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah).
2SA.21.3	Therefore, David said unto the Gibeonites, What shall I do for you? And with what shall I make reconciliation that ye may bless the inheritance of the 
2SA.21.4	And the Gibeonites replied unto him, We have no quarrel regarding silver nor gold with Saul, nor with his house; neither do we desire that anyone in Israel should die. And he said unto them, What ye shall say that will I do for you.
2SA.21.5	And they answered the king, The man that consumed us and that devised against us, let us destroy him that nothing of him remains in any of the borders of Israel.
2SA.21.6	Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will disjoint them, hanging them from a tree, unto the 
2SA.21.7	But the king spared Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the 
2SA.21.8	But the king took the two sons of Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, whom she gave birth unto Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and five sons of Michal, the daughter of Saul, whom she had given birth unto Adriel, the son of Barzillai, the Meholathite;
2SA.21.9	and he delivered them into the hands of the Gibeonites, and they disjointed them hanging them from a tree in the hill before the 
2SA.21.10	And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth and spread it upon the rock from the beginning of harvest until water rained upon them out of heaven and allowed neither the birds of the air to rest on them by day nor the beasts of the field by night.
2SA.21.11	And it was told David what Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.
2SA.21.12	Then David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan, his son, from the men of Jabeshgilead, who had stolen them from the plaza of Bethshan where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa;
2SA.21.13	and he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan, his son; and they gathered the bones of those that had been disjointed by being hanged from a tree,
2SA.21.14	and they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan, his son, in the land of Benjamin in Zelah, in the sepulchre of Kish his father; and they performed all that the king commanded. And after that God was intreated for the land.
2SA.21.15	And the Philistines made war again with Israel; and David went down, and his slaves with him, and fought against the Philistines; and David became weary.
2SA.21.16	And Ishbibenob, who was of the sons of the giant, and the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels of brass in weight, was girded with a new sword and had determined to kill David.
2SA.21.17	But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, helped David, and smote the Philistine and killed him. Then the men of David swore unto him, saying, From now on thou shalt not go out with us to battle that thou not quench the light of Israel.
2SA.21.18	And after this, there was a second war with the Philistines at Gob; then Sibbechai, the Hushathite, slew Saph, who was of the sons of the giant.
2SA.21.19	And there was another war in Gob with the Philistines where Elhanan, the son of Jaareoregim of Bethlehem, slew Goliath, the Gittite, the staff of whose spear was like a weaver’s beam.
2SA.21.20	And after that there was another war in Gath where there was a man of great stature, that had six fingers on every hand, and six toes on every foot, twenty-four in number; and he also was of the sons of the giant.
2SA.21.21	And when he dishonoured Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimea, the brother of David, slew him.
2SA.21.22	These four were born to the giant in Gath and fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his slaves.
2SA.22.1	And David spoke the words of this song unto the 
2SA.22.2	And he said, The 
2SA.22.3	God is my Strong One; in him will I trust: he is my shield and the horn of my saving health; my defence and my refuge; my saviour, who shall save me from violence.
2SA.22.4	I will call on the 
2SA.22.5	When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of Belial made me afraid;
2SA.22.6	when the cords of Sheol compassed me about; the snares of death came before me;
2SA.22.7	in my distress I called upon the 
2SA.22.8	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the heavens were moved and shook because he was wroth.
2SA.22.9	Smoke went up from his nostrils, and fire devoured out of his mouth; coals were kindled by it.
2SA.22.10	And he lowered the heavens and came down, and darkness was under his feet.
2SA.22.11	And he rode upon a cherub and flew; and he appeared upon the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	He placed darkness like tabernacles round about him, dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
2SA.22.13	From the brightness of his presence, coals of fire were kindled.
2SA.22.14	The 
2SA.22.15	he sent out arrows and scattered them; he sent forth lightning, and consumed them.
2SA.22.16	Then the springs of the sea appeared and the foundations of the world were uncovered, at the rebuking of the 
2SA.22.17	He extended his hand from above, he took me; he drew me out of the impetuous waters;
2SA.22.18	he delivered me from strong enemies, from those that hated me, who were stronger than I.
2SA.22.19	They came upon me unawares in the day of my calamity, but the 
2SA.22.20	He brought me forth into a large place; he delivered me, because he had put his will in me.
2SA.22.21	The 
2SA.22.22	For I have kept the ways of the 
2SA.22.23	For I have all his ordinances before me and am attentive to his statutes; I will not depart from them.
2SA.22.24	And I was perfect before him and have kept myself from my iniquity.
2SA.22.25	Therefore, the 
2SA.22.26	With the merciful thou art good, and with the perfect thou art upright.
2SA.22.27	With the pure thou art pure, and with the perverse thou art an adversary.
2SA.22.28	Thou wilt save the poor in spirit; but thine eyes are upon the haughty that thou may bring them down.
2SA.22.29	For thou art my lamp, O 
2SA.22.30	For in thee I have run through a troop; with my God I have gone over the walls.
2SA.22.31	As for God, his way is perfect; the word of the 
2SA.22.32	For what God is there except the 
2SA.22.33	God is he who strengthens me with virtue; he who clears my way;
2SA.22.34	he who makes my feet like hinds’ feet, and he who sets me upon my high places;
2SA.22.35	he who trains my hands for war and causes my arms to break the bow of bronze.
2SA.22.36	Thou hast also given me the shield of thy saving health, and thy meekness has multiplied me.
2SA.22.37	Thou hast enlarged my steps under me so that my knees did not shake.
2SA.22.38	I have pursued my enemies and destroyed them and did not return until I had consumed them.
2SA.22.39	And I consumed them and wounded them, and they did not arise; they are fallen under my feet.
2SA.22.40	For thou hast girded me with strength for the battle; thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
2SA.22.41	Thou hast given me the necks of my enemies, of those that hate me, that I might cut them off.
2SA.22.42	They looked, but there was no one to save them; even unto the 
2SA.22.43	Then I beat them as small as the dust of the earth; I stamped them as the mire of the street and spread them abroad.
2SA.22.44	Thou also hast delivered me from the strivings of peoples; thou hast kept me to be head of the Gentiles; peoples whom I did not know have served me.
2SA.22.45	The strangers trembled before my command; as soon as they heard, they obeyed me.
2SA.22.46	The strangers withered away and trembled in their close places.
2SA.22.47	The 
2SA.22.48	The God who has given me revenge and who subjects the peoples under me,
2SA.22.49	who brings me forth from among my enemies; thou hast lifted me up on high from among those that rose up against me; thou hast delivered me from the man of violence.
2SA.22.50	Therefore, I will confess thee among the Gentiles, O 
2SA.22.51	He who makes great the saving health of his king and shows mercy to his anointed, unto David, and to his seed for ever.
2SA.23.1	Now these are the last words of David. David, the son of Jesse, said, and the man who was raised up high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the sweet cantor of Israel, said,
2SA.23.2	(The Spirit of the 
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel dictated unto me, the strong One of Israel spoke): He that rules over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God.
2SA.23.4	And as the light of the morning when the sun rises, of a morning shining forth without clouds, as the shining forth through light rain upon the tender grass of the earth:
2SA.23.5	shall not my house be so with God, although all my saving health and my desire shall not be produced yet? For he has made an everlasting covenant with me, ordered in all things, and it shall be kept;
2SA.23.6	but those of Belial shall all be as thorns to be chased away, whom no one takes with the hand;
2SA.23.7	but the one that desires to touch them must be armed with iron and the staff of a spear, and they are completely burned with fire in their place.
2SA.23.8	These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: he that sat in the seat of wisdom, chief among the three: Adino, the Eznite, who on one occasion slew eight hundred enemies.
2SA.23.9	And after him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men who were with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and those of Israel were gone away.
2SA.23.10	He arose and smote the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand clave unto the sword; and the 
2SA.23.11	And after him was Shammah, the son of Agee, the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a community, where was an inheritance of land full of lentils, and the people had fled before the Philistines.
2SA.23.12	But he stood in the midst of the inheritance and defended it and slew the Philistines, and the 
2SA.23.13	These three, who were of the thirty chief, went down and came to David in the harvest time unto the cave of Adullam, and the camp of the Philistines was pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
2SA.23.14	And David was then in the fortress, and the garrison of the Philistines was in Bethlehem.
2SA.23.15	And David longed and said, Oh that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!
2SA.23.16	Then these three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David; nevertheless, he would not drink of it, but poured it out unto the 
2SA.23.17	Be it far from me, O 
2SA.23.18	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief of three. And he lifted up his spear against three hundred and slew them and had a name among the three.
2SA.23.19	He was the most honourable of the three and captain among them; however, he did not attain unto the first three.
2SA.23.20	Then, Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, slew two lions of Moab; he went down also and slew a lion in the midst of a pit in time of snow.
2SA.23.21	He also slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, and the Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and slew him with his own spear.
2SA.23.22	These things did Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and had a name among the three mighty men.
2SA.23.23	He had more honour than the thirty, but he did not attain to the first three. And David put him in his council.
2SA.23.24	Asahel, the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; Elhanan, the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,
2SA.23.25	Shammah of Harodi, Elika of Harodi,
2SA.23.26	Helez of Palti, Ira, the son of Ikkesh of Tekoah,
2SA.23.27	Abiezer of Anethoth, Mebunnai of Hushath,
2SA.23.28	Zalmon of Ahoh, Maharai of Netophath,
2SA.23.29	Heleb, the son of Baanah of Netophath, Ittai, the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the sons of Benjamin,
2SA.23.30	Benaiah, the Pirathonite, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash,
2SA.23.31	Abialbon of Arbath, Azmaveth of Barhum,
2SA.23.32	Eliahba of Shaalbon, Jonathan of the sons of Jashen,
2SA.23.33	Shammah of Harar, Ahiam, the son of Sharar of Harar,
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet, the son of Ahasbai, the son of Maachath, Eliam, the son of Ahithophel of Gilon,
2SA.23.35	Hezrai of Carmel, Paarai of Arbi,
2SA.23.36	Igal, the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani of Gadi,
2SA.23.37	Zelek of Ammon, Naharai of Beeroth, armourbearer to Joab, the son of Zeruiah,
2SA.23.38	Ira of Ithri, Gareb of Ithri,
2SA.23.39	Uriah, the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.
2SA.24.1	And again the anger of the 
2SA.24.2	For the king said to Joab, the captain of the host, who was with him, Go now through all the tribes of Israel from Dan unto Beersheba and number the people that I may know the number of the people.
2SA.24.3	And Joab replied unto the king, Now the 
2SA.24.4	Notwithstanding, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and against the captains of the host. And Joab and the captains of the host went out from the presence of the king, to number the people of Israel.
2SA.24.5	And passing the Jordan, they pitched in Aroer, on the right side of the city that lies in the midst of the river of Gad, and toward Jazer.
2SA.24.6	After that they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtimhodshi, and they came to Danjaan and about to Zidon.
2SA.24.7	Then they came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and of the Canaanites, and they went out towards the Negev from Judah, even to Beersheba.
2SA.24.8	So when they had gone through all the land, they returned to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.
2SA.24.9	And Joab gave up the sum of the number of the people unto the king, and there were in Israel eight hundred thousand valiant men that drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand men.
2SA.24.10	And David’s heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said unto the 
2SA.24.11	And in the morning when David had risen, the word of the 
2SA.24.12	Go and say unto David, Thus hath the 
2SA.24.13	So Gad came to David and told him and said unto him, Shall seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land? Or wilt thou flee three months before thy enemies while they pursue thee? Or shall there be three days’ pestilence in thy land? Now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.
2SA.24.14	Then David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait; let us fall now into the hand of the 
2SA.24.15	So the 
2SA.24.16	And when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to destroy it, the 
2SA.24.17	And David spoke unto the 
2SA.24.18	And Gad came that day to David and said unto him, Go up, erect an altar unto the 
2SA.24.19	And David went up, according to the word of Gad, as the 
2SA.24.20	And Araunah looked and saw the king and his slaves coming on toward him, and Araunah went out and bowed himself before the king on his face upon the ground.
2SA.24.21	And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his slave? And David answered, To buy this threshingfloor of thee, to build an altar unto the 
2SA.24.22	And Araunah said unto David, Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good unto him; behold, here are oxen for burnt sacrifice and threshing instruments and other instruments of the oxen for wood;
2SA.24.23	all these things does king Araunah give unto the king. Then Araunah said unto the king, The 
2SA.24.24	And the king said unto Araunah, No, but I will surely buy it of thee at a price, for I will not offer burnt offerings unto the 
2SA.24.25	And David built there an altar unto the 
1KI.1.1	Now king David was old and stricken in years, and they covered him with clothes, but he did not become warm.
1KI.1.2	Therefore, his slaves said unto him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin, and let her stand before the king and let her warm him and let her lie in thy bosom, and she shall warm my lord the king.
1KI.1.3	So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel and found Abishag, a Shunammite and brought her to the king.
1KI.1.4	And the damsel was very fair and warmed the king and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.
1KI.1.5	Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, exalted himself, saying, I will reign, and he prepared chariots and horsemen for himself and fifty men to run before him.
1KI.1.6	And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why hast thou done so? and he also was very handsome; and he had begotten him after Absalom.
1KI.1.7	And he conferred with Joab, the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar, the priest who helped Adonijah.
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan, the prophet, and Shimei and Rei and the mighty men of David did not follow Adonijah.
1KI.1.9	And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren, the king’s sons, and all the men of Judah, the king’s slaves;
1KI.1.10	but he did not invite Nathan, the prophet, nor Benaiah nor the mighty men nor Solomon his brother.
1KI.1.11	And Nathan spoke unto Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon, saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah, the son of Haggith, reigns without David our lord knowing of it?
1KI.1.12	Now, therefore, come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel that thou may deliver thine own life and the life of thy son Solomon.
1KI.1.13	Go and enter in unto King David and say unto him, Didst not thou, my lord, O king, swear unto thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon, thy son, shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?
1KI.1.14	And while thou art yet speaking there with the king, I also will come in after thee and finish thy words.
1KI.1.15	And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber; and the king was very old; and Abishag, the Shunammite, ministered unto the king.
1KI.1.16	And Bathsheba bowed and worshipped the king. And the king said, What dost thou desire?
1KI.1.17	And she said unto him, My lord, thou didst sware by the 
1KI.1.18	and now, behold, Adonijah reigns; and now, my lord the king, thou dost not know it.
1KI.1.19	He has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and has called all the sons of the king and Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the captain of the host; but he has not invited Solomon, thy slave.
1KI.1.20	And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee that thou should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.
1KI.1.21	Otherwise, it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers that I and my son Solomon shall be counted as sinners.
1KI.1.22	And while she yet spoke with the king, Nathan, the prophet, also came in.
1KI.1.23	And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan, the prophet. And when he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.
1KI.1.24	And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?
1KI.1.25	For today he has gone down and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance and has called all the king’s sons and the captains of the host and Abiathar, the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him and say, Long live King Adonijah.
1KI.1.26	But he did not invite me, thy slave, nor Zadok, the priest, nor Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, nor thy slave Solomon.
1KI.1.27	Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not declared unto thy slave who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?
1KI.1.28	Then King David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba. And she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king.
1KI.1.29	And the king swore and said, As the 
1KI.1.30	even as I swore unto thee by the 
1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth and did reverence to the king and said, Let my lord King David live for ever.
1KI.1.32	And King David said, Call me Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada. And they entered into the presence of the king.
1KI.1.33	And the king said unto them, Take with you the slaves of your lord and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule and bring him down to Gihon.
1KI.1.34	And let Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, anoint him there king over Israel; and ye shall blow the shofar and say, Long live king Solomon.
1KI.1.35	Afterward ye shall come up after him that he may come and sit upon my throne, for he shall reign in my stead, for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.
1KI.1.36	Then Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, answered the king and said, Amen. Let the 
1KI.1.37	As the 
1KI.1.38	So Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and caused Solomon to ride upon King David’s mule and brought him to Gihon.
1KI.1.39	And Zadok, the priest, took the horn of the oil of the tabernacle and anointed Solomon. And they blew the shofar, and all the people said, Long live king Solomon.
1KI.1.40	Afterward all the people came up following him, and the people sang with flutes and rejoiced with great joy so that it seemed the earth rent with the sound of them.
1KI.1.41	And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it when they had finished eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the shofar, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?
1KI.1.42	And while he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar, the priest, came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in, for thou art a valiant man and bringest good tidings.
1KI.1.43	And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord King David has made Solomon king.
1KI.1.44	And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king’s mule;
1KI.1.45	and Zadok, the priest, and Nathan, the prophet, have anointed him king in Gihon; and they are come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
1KI.1.46	And also Solomon has been seated on the throne of the kingdom.
1KI.1.47	And moreover, the king’s slaves came to bless our lord King David, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king worshipped upon the bed.
1KI.1.48	And also thus said the king, Blessed be the 
1KI.1.49	And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid and rose up and went each one his way.
1KI.1.50	And Adonijah, fearing the presence of Solomon, arose and went and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
1KI.1.51	And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, for he has caught hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay his slave with the sword.
1KI.1.52	And Solomon said, If he will show himself virtuous, there shall not one hair of him fall to the ground, but if wickedness shall be found in him, he shall die.
1KI.1.53	So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and bowed himself to King Solomon. And Solomon said unto him, Go to thy house.
1KI.2.1	Now the days of David drew near that he should die; and he charged Solomon, his son, saying,
1KI.2.2	I go the way of all the earth; be thou strong therefore and show thyself a man.
1KI.2.3	Keep the charge of the 
1KI.2.4	that the 
1KI.2.5	Moreover thou knowest also what Joab, the son of Zeruiah, did to me and what he did to the two captains of the host of Israel, unto Abner, the son of Ner and unto Amasa, the son of Jether, whom he slew, shedding the blood of war in peace and putting the blood of war upon his girdle that was about his loins and in his shoes that were on his feet.
1KI.2.6	Do, therefore, according to thy wisdom and let not his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.
1KI.2.7	But show mercy unto the sons of Barzillai, the Gileadite, and let them be of those that eat at thy table, for they came thus unto me when I fled because of Absalom, thy brother.
1KI.2.8	And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei, the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by the 
1KI.2.9	Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for thou art a wise man and knowest what thou should do with him, but thou shalt bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.
1KI.2.10	And David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David.
1KI.2.11	The days that David reigned over Israel were forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
1KI.2.12	Then Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was established greatly.
1KI.2.13	Then Adonijah, the son of Haggith, came to Bathsheba, the mother of Solomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
1KI.2.14	He said moreover, I have a word to say unto thee. And she said, Say on.
1KI.2.15	And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine and that all Israel had set their faces on me that I should reign, but the kingdom is turned about and is become my brother’s, for by the 
1KI.2.16	And now I ask one petition of thee, do not deny me. And she said unto him, Say on.
1KI.2.17	Then he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king (for he will not deny thee) that he give me Abishag, the Shunammite to wife.
1KI.2.18	And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee unto the king.
1KI.2.19	Bathsheba, therefore, went unto King Solomon, to speak unto him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her and bowed himself unto her and sat down on his throne and caused a seat to be set for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right hand.
1KI.2.20	Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, do not deny me. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother, for I will not deny thee.
1KI.2.21	And she said, Let Abishag, the Shunammite, be given to Adonijah, thy brother, to wife.
1KI.2.22	And King Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dost thou ask Abishag, the Shunammite, for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my elder brother and he also has Abiathar, the priest, and Joab, the son of Zeruiah.
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon swore by the 
1KI.2.24	Now, therefore, as the 
1KI.2.25	Then King Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada; and he fell upon him that he died.
1KI.2.26	And unto Abiathar, the priest, the king said, Go to Anathoth, unto thine own inheritance, for thou art worthy of death; but I will not put thee to death today because thou didst bare the ark of the Lord GOD before David, my father, and because thou hast been afflicted in all wherein my father was afflicted.
1KI.2.27	So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the 
1KI.2.28	And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he had not turned after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.29	And it was told King Solomon that Joab had fled unto the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.30	And Benaiah entered into the tabernacle of the 
1KI.2.31	And the king said unto him, Do as he has said and fall upon him and bury him that thou may take away from me and from the house of my father the blood which Joab shed without a cause.
1KI.2.32	And the 
1KI.2.33	Their blood shall, therefore, return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed for ever; but upon David and upon his seed and upon his house and upon his throne shall there be peace for ever from the 
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, went up and fell upon him and slew him, and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
1KI.2.35	And the king put Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, in his place over the host; and Zadok, the priest, the king put in the place of Abiathar.
1KI.2.36	Afterward the king sent and called for Shimei and said unto him, Build thee a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go forth from there anywhere.
1KI.2.37	For it shall be that on the day thou goest out and passest over the brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
1KI.2.38	And Shimei said unto the king, The word is good as my lord the king has said, so will thy slave do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.
1KI.2.39	But it came to pass at the end of three years that two of the slaves of Shimei ran away unto Achish, son of Maachah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy slaves are in Gath.
1KI.2.40	And Shimei arose and saddled his ass and went to Gath to Achish to seek his slaves. Shimei went, therefore, and brought his slaves from Gath.
1KI.2.41	And it was told Solomon how Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had come again.
1KI.2.42	Then the king sent and called for Shimei and said unto him, Did I not make thee to swear by the 
1KI.2.43	Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the 
1KI.2.44	The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thy heart knoweth well that thou didst to David my father; therefore, the 
1KI.2.45	and King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the 
1KI.2.46	Then the king commanded Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, who went out and fell upon him that he died. And the kingdom was confirmed in the hand of Solomon.
1KI.3.1	And Solomon became a relative of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, for he took Pharaoh’s daughter to wife and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house, and the house of the 
1KI.3.2	Until then the people sacrificed in high places because there was still no house built unto the name of the 
1KI.3.3	And Solomon loved the 
1KI.3.4	And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place; a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer upon that altar.
1KI.3.5	In Gibeon the 
1KI.3.6	And Solomon said, Thou hast shown unto thy slave David, my father, great mercy, according to the way he walked before thee in truth and in righteousness and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great mercy that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day.
1KI.3.7	And now, O 
1KI.3.8	And thy slave is in the midst of thy people whom thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.
1KI.3.9	Give, therefore, thy slave a hearing heart to judge thy people that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this thy so great a people?
1KI.3.10	And the speech pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this thing.
1KI.3.11	And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing and hast not asked for thyself long life neither hast asked riches for thyself nor hast asked the life of thine enemies, but hast asked for thyself understanding to hear judgment,
1KI.3.12	behold, I have done according to thy words: behold, I have given thee a wise and understanding heart so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
1KI.3.13	And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and glory so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee in all thy days.
1KI.3.14	And if thou wilt walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments as thy father David walked, then I will lengthen thy days.
1KI.3.15	And when Solomon awoke, he beheld it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.3.16	In that season two women, that were harlots, came unto the king and stood before him.
1KI.3.17	And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house, and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
1KI.3.18	And it came to pass the third day after I was delivered that this woman was delivered also and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, except the two of us in the house.
1KI.3.19	And this woman’s child died in the night because she lay on top of him.
1KI.3.20	And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me while thy handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom and laid her dead child in my bosom.
1KI.3.21	And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead; but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I had given birth to.
1KI.3.22	And the other woman said, No, but my son is alive, and thy son is dead. And this one said, No, but thy son is dead, and my son is alive. Thus they spoke before the king.
1KI.3.23	Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that is alive, and thy son is dead. And the other saith, No; but thy son is dead, and my son is alive.
1KI.3.24	And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king.
1KI.3.25	And the king said, Divide the living child in two and give half to the one and half to the other.
1KI.3.26	Then the woman, of whom the living child was, spoke unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
1KI.3.27	Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it, for she is its mother.
1KI.3.28	And all Israel heard of that judgment which the king had judged, and they feared the king, for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to judge.
1KI.4.1	So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
1KI.4.2	And these were the princes which he had: Azariah, the son of Zadok, the priest,
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes, Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, writer of the chronicles;
1KI.4.4	Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the host; and Zadok and Abiathar were the priests;
1KI.4.5	Azariah, the son of Nathan, was over the officers; and Zabud, the son of Nathan, was the priest and special companion of the king;
1KI.4.6	and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram, the son of Abda, was over the tribute.
1KI.4.7	And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who maintained the king and his household. Each one of them made provision for one month in the year.
1KI.4.8	And these are their names: The son of Hur, in Mount Ephraim;
1KI.4.9	the son of Dekar, in Makaz and in Shaalbim and in Bethshemesh and in Elon and in Bethhanan;
1KI.4.10	the son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertained Sochoh and all the land of Hepher.
1KI.4.11	The son of Abinadab, in all the region of Dor, who had Taphath, the daughter of Solomon, to wife;
1KI.4.12	Baana, the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, from Bethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam;
1KI.4.13	the son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair, the son of Manasseh, which were in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and brasen bars;
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab, the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim;
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath, the daughter of Solomon, to wife.
1KI.4.16	Baanah, the son of Hushai, was in Asher and in Aloth;
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat, the son of Paruah, in Issachar;
1KI.4.18	Shimei, the son of Elah, in Benjamin;
1KI.4.19	Geber, the son of Uri, was in the land of Gilead, in the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, and of Og, king of Bashan; and in addition to these there was an officer over all the land.
1KI.4.20	Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea in multitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
1KI.4.21	And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto the land of the Philistines and unto the border of Egypt, and they brought presents and served Solomon all the days of his life.
1KI.4.22	And Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty measures of fine flour and sixty measures of meal,
1KI.4.23	ten fat oxen and twenty oxen out of the pastures and one hundred sheep beside harts and roebucks and fallowdeer and fatted fowl.
1KI.4.24	For he had dominion over all the region on the other side of the river and from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings on the other side of the river, and he had peace on all sides {Heb. with all the slaves} round about him.
1KI.4.25	And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, each one under his vine and under his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon.
1KI.4.26	And Solomon had forty thousand horses in his stables for his chariots and twelve thousand horsemen.
1KI.4.27	And these officers maintained King Solomon and all that came unto king Solomon’s table, each one in his month; they made sure nothing was lacking.
1KI.4.28	They also brought barley and straw for the horses and beasts of burden unto the place where he was, each one according to his charge.
1KI.4.29	And God gave Solomon exceedingly great wisdom and intelligence and magnanimity of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.
1KI.4.30	And Solomon’s wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of the Egyptians.
1KI.4.31	For he was wiser than all men, than Ethan, the Ezrahite, and Heman and Chalcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and he was named in all nations round about.
1KI.4.32	And he spoke three thousand proverbs: and his songs were a thousand and five.
1KI.4.33	And he spoke of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanon even unto the hyssop that springs out of the wall. He also spoke of animals and of fowl and of serpents and of fishes.
1KI.4.34	And they came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom.
1KI.5.1	Hiram, king of Tyre, also sent his slaves unto Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in the place of his father; for Hiram had always loved David.
1KI.5.2	Then Solomon sent to Hiram, saying,
1KI.5.3	Thou knowest how David, my father, could not build a house unto the name of the 
1KI.5.4	Now the 
1KI.5.5	And, therefore, I have determined to build a house unto the name of the 
1KI.5.6	Command, therefore, now that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon, and my slaves shall be with thy slaves, and I will give thee for thy slaves the hire that thou shalt appoint, for thou knowest that there is no one among us with the skill to hew timber like the Sidonians.
1KI.5.7	And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, that he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed be the 
1KI.5.8	And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard that which thou didst send to tell me, and I will do all thy desire concerning the timber of cedar and concerning the timber of fir.
1KI.5.9	My slaves shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea, and I will convey them by sea in rafts unto the place that thou shalt appoint me and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them; and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food for my household.
1KI.5.10	So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to all his desire.
1KI.5.11	And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household and twenty thousand measures of pure oil; this gave Solomon to Hiram year by year.
1KI.5.12	And the 
1KI.5.13	And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel, and the levy was thirty thousand men,
1KI.5.14	whom he sent to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses; they were a month in Lebanon and two months at home; and Adoniram was over the levy.
1KI.5.15	And Solomon had seventy thousand that bore burdens and eighty thousand hewers in the mountains;
1KI.5.16	besides Solomon’s chief officers who were over the work, there were three thousand three hundred who ruled over the people that did the work.
1KI.5.17	And the king commanded that they bring great stones, costly stones, for the foundation of the house, and hewed stones.
1KI.5.18	And Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders hewed them, and the stonesquarers; so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
1KI.6.1	And it came to pass in the year four hundred and eighty after the sons of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of the beginning of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which is the second month, that he began to build the house of the 
1KI.6.2	And the house which King Solomon built for the 
1KI.6.3	And the porch before the temple of the house was twenty cubits long, according to the width of the house; and its width was ten cubits before the house.
1KI.6.4	And for the house he made windows broad within and narrow without.
1KI.6.5	And against the wall of the house, he built wings round about, against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and of the oracle; and he made chambers round about.
1KI.6.6	The lower wing was five cubits wide, and the middle was six cubits wide, and the third was seven cubits wide, for without in the wall of the house, he had made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not be fastened in the walls of the house.
1KI.6.7	And the house, when it was built, was put together of perfect stones made ready before they were brought there; so that there was no hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was being built.
1KI.6.8	The door for the middle wing was in the right side of the house; and they went up with winding stairs into the middle wing and out of the middle into the third.
1KI.6.9	So he built the house and finished it and covered the house with work of cedar placed in order.
1KI.6.10	And then he built the wing against all the house, five cubits high; and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
1KI.6.11	And the word of the 
1KI.6.12	Concerning this house which thou art building, if thou wilt walk in my statutes and execute my rights and keep all my commandments to walk in them, then I will perform my word with thee, which I spoke unto David thy father;
1KI.6.13	and I will dwell among the sons of Israel and will not forsake my people Israel.
1KI.6.14	So Solomon built the house and finished it.
1KI.6.15	And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar, both the floor of the house and the walls of the ceiling; and he covered them on the inside with wood and covered the floor of the house with planks of fir.
1KI.6.16	And he built twenty cubits on the end of the house, both the floor and the walls with boards of cedar; and he built an oracle in the house, which is the holy of holies.
1KI.6.17	And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubits long.
1KI.6.18	And the cedar of the house within was carved with wild gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was seen.
1KI.6.19	And he prepared the oracle in the house within, to set there the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.6.20	And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length and twenty cubits wide and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold and likewise covered the altar which was of cedar.
1KI.6.21	So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold, and he closed the door of the oracle with chains of gold, and he overlaid it with gold.
1KI.6.22	And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finished all the house; also the whole altar that was in front of the oracle he overlaid with gold.
1KI.6.23	And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive wood, each ten cubits high.
1KI.6.24	And one wing of the cherub was five cubits, and the other wing of the cherub five cubits; from the uttermost part of the one wing unto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
1KI.6.25	Likewise, the other cherub was ten cubits, for both the cherubims were of one measure and one size.
1KI.6.26	The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was the other cherub.
1KI.6.27	And he set the cherubims within the inner house, and they stretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of the one touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of the house.
1KI.6.28	And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
1KI.6.29	And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within and without.
1KI.6.30	And the floor of the house he overlaid with gold, within and without.
1KI.6.31	And at the entrance of the oracle he made doors of olive wood; the lintel and side posts had five sides.
1KI.6.32	The two doors were of olive wood, and he carved upon them carvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and overlaid them with gold and covered the cherubims and the palm trees with gold.
1KI.6.33	In the same manner he made posts of olive wood at the entrance of the temple with four sides.
1KI.6.34	The two doors were of fir; the two sides of the one door were rounded, and the two leaves of the other door were rounded.
1KI.6.35	And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
1KI.6.36	And he built the inner court with three orders of hewed stone and an order of cedar beams.
1KI.6.37	In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the 
1KI.6.38	And in the eleventh year, in the month Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished throughout all its parts and with everything necessary. So he was seven years in building it.
1KI.7.1	But Solomon built his own house in thirteen years, and he finished all his house.
1KI.7.2	He also built the house of the forest of Lebanon, which was one hundred cubits long and fifty cubits wide and thirty cubits high, upon four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams upon the pillars.
1KI.7.3	And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams that lay on forty-five pillars, fifteen in a row.
1KI.7.4	And there were windows in three orders, one against another in three orders.
1KI.7.5	And all the doors and posts were square, with some windows opposite the other windows in three orders.
1KI.7.6	And he made a porch of pillars, which was fifty cubits long and thirty cubits wide, and the porch was before those others, with its corresponding pillars and thick beams.
1KI.7.7	Then he made a porch for the throne where he was to judge, even the porch of judgment; and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.
1KI.7.8	And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch, which was of like work. Solomon also made a house for Pharaoh’s daughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
1KI.7.9	All these works were of costly stones, cut and sawed with saws according to the measurements, within and without, even from the foundation unto the coping, and so on the outside unto the great court.
1KI.7.10	And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits.
1KI.7.11	And above were also costly stones, hewed according to their measurements, and work of cedar.
1KI.7.12	And the great court round about had three orders of hewed stones and an order of cedar beams, and likewise the inner court of the house of the 
1KI.7.13	And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram out of Tyre,
1KI.7.14	who was a widow’s son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father had been of Tyre. A worker in brass, full of wisdom and intelligence and knowledge in all work of brass. And he came to King Solomon and did all his work.
1KI.7.15	He made two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece, and a line of twelve cubits did compass each of them about.
1KI.7.16	And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter was five cubits.
1KI.7.17	And nets of checker work and wreaths of chain work for the chapiters which were to be placed upon the top of the pillars, seven for the one chapiter and seven for the other chapiter.
1KI.7.18	And when he had made the pillars, he also made two orders of pomegranates round about upon the network to cover the chapiters that were upon the heads of the pillars with the pomegranates, and so did he for the other chapiter.
1KI.7.19	And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were in the form of lilies like those seen in the porch, for four cubits.
1KI.7.20	And the chapiters upon the two pillars had two hundred pomegranates in two orders round about in each chapiter, on top of the belly of the chapiter, this belly being in front of the network.
1KI.7.21	And he stood up the pillars in the porch of the temple. And when he had set up the right pillar, he called the name of it Jachin; {Heb. The 
1KI.7.22	And upon the top of the pillars was lily work, and so the work of the pillars was finished.
1KI.7.23	Likewise, he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to the other; it was perfectly round, and its height was five cubits, and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
1KI.7.24	And under the brim of it round about there were knops like gourds compassing it, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about in two orders, which were made when it was cast.
1KI.7.25	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the Negev and three looking toward the east; and upon them the sea rested, and all their hinder parts were inward.
1KI.7.26	And it was a hand breadth thick, and its lip was made like the lip of a cup, with flowers of lilies; it contained two thousand baths.
1KI.7.27	He also made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of each base and four cubits the width and three cubits the height.
1KI.7.28	And the work of the bases was like this: they had borders, and the borders were between mouldings;
1KI.7.29	and upon the borders that were between the mouldings were lions, oxen, and cherubim; and upon the mouldings of the base, above and beneath the lions and oxen were certain additions made of bevelled work.
1KI.7.30	And each base had four brasen wheels and cardinals {hinged axles} of brass, and in its four corners it had shoulderpieces, which were molten at the side of each addition, to be under the laver.
1KI.7.31	Its mouth entered into the chapiter (in the joint that came out of the base) one cubit above, and its mouth was rounded like the workmanship (of the same joint) in the base, of a cubit and a half. There were also engravings upon the mouth of it with their borders, which were square, not round.
1KI.7.32	And under the borders were the four wheels, and the axletrees of the wheels came forth from the same base. The height of each wheel was one and a half cubits.
1KI.7.33	And the workmanship of the wheels was like the workmanship of a chariot wheel, their axletrees and their rims and their spokes and their hubs were all molten.
1KI.7.34	Likewise, the four shoulderpieces to the four corners of each base, and the shoulderpieces were of the very base itself.
1KI.7.35	And in the top of the base there was a rounded compass of half a cubit high and on the top of the base, its mouldings and borders which were part of it.
1KI.7.36	For on the tables of the mouldings and on the borders thereof, he made cherubim, lions, and palm trees, in front of the additions of each one round about.
1KI.7.37	After this manner he made ten bases cast in the same manner, of the same size and of the same shape.
1KI.7.38	Then he also made ten lavers of brass; each laver contained forty baths, and each laver measured four cubits; and he set a laver upon each one of the ten bases.
1KI.7.39	And he put five bases on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house, and he set the sea on the right side of the house to the east towards the Negev.
1KI.7.40	Hiram made the lavers and the shovels and the basins likewise. So Hiram finished all the work that he made King Solomon for the house of the 
1KI.7.41	That is, the two pillars and the two bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars and the two networks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the head of the pillars,
1KI.7.42	and four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, even two orders of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters that were upon the heads of the pillars,
1KI.7.43	and the ten bases and ten lavers upon the bases,
1KI.7.44	and one sea and twelve oxen under the sea,
1KI.7.45	and the pots and the shovels and the basins and all the other vessels, which Hiram made to King Solomon for the house of the 
1KI.7.46	And the king caused them all to be cast in the plain of the Jordan, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarthan.
1KI.7.47	And Solomon did not inquire the weight of the brass of all the vessels because they were exceeding many.
1KI.7.48	And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the 
1KI.7.49	and the lampstands of pure gold, five on the right hand, and five on the left, in front of the oracle, with the flowers and the lamps and the tongs of gold,
1KI.7.50	likewise the bowls and the snuffers and the basins and the spoons and the censers of pure gold, also the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house, the holy of holies, and for the doors of the house of the temple.
1KI.7.51	So all the work that King Solomon made for the house of the 
1KI.8.1	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the families of the sons of Israel, unto King Solomon in Jerusalem that they might bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.8.2	And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto King Solomon in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month, on the solemn day.
1KI.8.3	And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.
1KI.8.4	And they brought up the ark of the 
1KI.8.5	And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheep and oxen, that could not be counted nor numbered for multitude.
1KI.8.6	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
1KI.8.7	For the cherubim had their wings extended over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves from above.
1KI.8.8	And they drew out the staves so that the ends of the staves could be seen out in the holy place in front of the oracle, but they could not be seen from outside, and thus they remained until today.
1KI.8.9	There was nothing in the ark except the two tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb, when the 
1KI.8.10	And when the priests came out of the holy place, the cloud filled the house of the 
1KI.8.11	And the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the 
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon said, The 
1KI.8.13	I have surely built thee a house to dwell in, a settled place for thee to abide in for ever.
1KI.8.14	And the king turned his face about and blessed all the congregation of Israel, and all the congregation of Israel were standing.
1KI.8.15	And he said, Blessed be the 
1KI.8.16	Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel out of Egypt, I have chosen no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there, but I chose David to be over my people Israel.
1KI.8.17	And it was in the heart of David, my father, to build a house for the name of the 
1KI.8.18	But the 
1KI.8.19	nevertheless, thou shalt not build the house, but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build a house unto my name.
1KI.8.20	And the 
1KI.8.21	And I have set there a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the 
1KI.8.22	And Solomon stood before the altar of the 
1KI.8.23	he said, 
1KI.8.24	who hast kept unto thy slave David, my father, what thou didst declare unto him; thou didst say it with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as we see this day.
1KI.8.25	Therefore, now, 
1KI.8.26	And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be made firm, which thou didst speak unto thy slave David, my father.
1KI.8.27	But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heavens, the heavens of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that I have built?
1KI.8.28	Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thy slave and to his supplication, O 
1KI.8.29	that thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there that thou may hearken unto the prayer which thy slave shall make in this place.
1KI.8.30	Therefore, thou shalt hearken unto the supplication of thy slave and of thy people Israel when they shall pray in this place and hear in thy dwelling place, from the heavens; please hear and forgive.
1KI.8.31	When anyone shall have sinned against his neighbour, and an oath is laid upon him to cause him to swear and the oath comes before thy altar in this house,
1KI.8.32	thou shalt hear from heaven and do and judge thy slaves, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
1KI.8.33	When thy people Israel are smitten down before the enemy because they have sinned against thee and shall turn again to thee and confess thy name and pray and make supplication with humility unto thee in this house,
1KI.8.34	then thou shalt hear in the heavens and forgive the sin of thy people Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou didst give unto their fathers.
1KI.8.35	When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee, if they pray in this place and confess thy name and turn from their sin when thou hast afflicted them,
1KI.8.36	then thou shalt hear in the heavens and forgive the sin of thy slaves and of thy people Israel, teaching them the good way in which they should walk and shalt give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy people for an inheritance.
1KI.8.37	When there is famine in the land or pestilence or blasting or mildew or locusts or caterpillars, if their enemy besieges them in the land of their gates, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is,
1KI.8.38	every prayer and every supplication made by any man or by all thy people Israel, when anyone knows the plague of his own heart and spreads forth his hands toward this house,
1KI.8.39	then thou shalt hear in the heavens, in the habitation of thy dwelling place, and forgive and do and give to each one according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest (for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the sons of men),
1KI.8.40	that they may fear thee all the days that they live in the land which thou didst give unto our fathers.
1KI.8.41	Likewise concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel, but comes out of a far country for thy name’s sake
1KI.8.42	(for they shall have heard of thy great name and of thy strong hand and of thy stretched out arm), when he shall come to pray in this house,
1KI.8.43	thou shalt hear in the heavens, in the habitation of thy dwelling place, and do according to all that for which the stranger shall have called unto thee, that all peoples of the earth may know thy name and fear thee as do thy people Israel and that they may know that thy name is invoked upon this house, which I have built.
1KI.8.44	If thy people go out to battle against their enemies by the way which thou shalt send them and shall pray unto the 
1KI.8.45	thou shalt hear in the heavens their prayer and their supplication and do their judgment.
1KI.8.46	If they have sinned against thee (for there is no man that does not sin) and thou should be angry with them and deliver them to the enemy so that they carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near,
1KI.8.47	and they return unto their heart in the land where they were carried captives and return and make supplication unto thee in the land of those that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned and have done iniquity, we have committed wickedness;
1KI.8.48	and so convert themselves unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their enemies, who led them away captive and pray unto thee toward their land, which thou didst give unto their fathers, toward the city which thou hast chosen and the house which I have built for thy name,
1KI.8.49	thou shalt hear in the heavens, in the habitation of thy dwelling place, their prayer and their supplication and do what is right unto them
1KI.8.50	and forgive thy people that have sinned against thee and all their rebellions by which they have rebelled against thee and cause those who carried them captive to have mercy on them,
1KI.8.51	for they are thy people and thy inheritance, which thou didst bring forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace.
1KI.8.52	Let thine eyes be open unto the supplication of thy slave and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto them in all that they call for unto thee.
1KI.8.53	For thou didst separate them from among all the peoples of the earth, to be thy inheritance, as thou didst speak by the hand of Moses, thy slave, when thou didst bring our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord GOD.
1KI.8.54	And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this prayer and supplication unto the 
1KI.8.55	And he stood and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,
1KI.8.56	Blessed be the 
1KI.8.57	The 
1KI.8.58	that he may incline our hearts unto him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his rights, which he commanded our fathers.
1KI.8.59	And let these my words, with which I have made supplication before the 
1KI.8.60	that all the peoples of the earth may know that the 
1KI.8.61	Let your heart, therefore, be perfect with the 
1KI.8.62	Then the king and all Israel with him, offered sacrifices before the 
1KI.8.63	And Solomon offered sacrifices of peace, which he offered unto the 
1KI.8.64	That same day the king sanctified the middle of the court that was before the house of the 
1KI.8.65	And at that time Solomon held a feast and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt, before the 
1KI.8.66	On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they, blessing the king, went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the 
1KI.9.1	And when Solomon had finished the building of the house of the 
1KI.9.2	the 
1KI.9.3	And the 
1KI.9.4	And if thou wilt walk before me as David, thy father walked, in integrity of heart and in uprightness, to do according to all that I have commanded thee, keeping my statutes and my rights,
1KI.9.5	then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever as I spoke unto David, thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man upon the throne of Israel.
1KI.9.6	But if ye shall obstinately turn from following me, ye or your sons, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them,
1KI.9.7	I will cut off Israel out of the land which I have given them, and this house, which I have sanctified unto my name, I will cast out of my sight, and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among all peoples;
1KI.9.8	and at this house, which was high, any one that passes by it shall be astonished and shall hiss, and they shall say, Why has the 
1KI.9.9	And they shall answer, Because they forsook the 
1KI.9.10	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the 
1KI.9.11	(for which Hiram, the king of Tyre, had furnished Solomon with cedar trees and fir trees and with gold, according to all his desire), that then King Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
1KI.9.12	And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they did not please him.
1KI.9.13	And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And they called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
1KI.9.14	And Hiram had sent the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold.
1KI.9.15	And this is the account of the levy which King Solomon raised to build the house of the 
1KI.9.16	For Pharaoh, king of Egypt, had gone up and taken Gezer and burnt it with fire and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city and given it for a gift unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife.
1KI.9.17	And Solomon built Gezer and Bethhoron, the lower,
1KI.9.18	and Baalath and Tadmor in the land of the wilderness,
1KI.9.19	likewise all the cities of store that Solomon had and cities for his chariots and cities for his horsemen and that which Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and in all the land of his dominion.
1KI.9.20	And all the peoples that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the sons of Israel,
1KI.9.21	their children that were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel were not able utterly to destroy, upon those Solomon levied a tribute of bondservice unto this day.
1KI.9.22	But of the sons of Israel, Solomon did not impose service, but they were men of war, or his slaves or his princes or his captains or rulers of his chariots or his horsemen.
1KI.9.23	And those that Solomon had made princes and officers over Solomon’s work were five hundred and fifty, who bore rule over the people that wrought in the work.
1KI.9.24	But Pharaoh’s daughter came up out of the city of David unto her house which Solomon had built for her; then he built Millo.
1KI.9.25	And three times in a year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the 
1KI.9.26	And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
1KI.9.27	And Hiram sent in the navy his slaves, shipmen that had knowledge of the sea, with the slaves of Solomon.
1KI.9.28	And they went to Ophir and brought gold from there, four hundred and twenty talents and brought it to king Solomon.
1KI.10.1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the 
1KI.10.2	And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camels that bore spices and very much gold and precious stones; and when she was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.
1KI.10.3	And Solomon told her all her questions; there was not any thing hid from the king, which he did not tell her.
1KI.10.4	And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon’s wisdom and the house that he had built,
1KI.10.5	likewise the food of his table and the sitting of his slaves and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel, and his butlers and his burnt offering which he sacrificed in the house of the 
1KI.10.6	And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in my own land of thy words and of thy wisdom.
1KI.10.7	But I did not believe it until I came, and my eyes have seen that not even the half was told me. Thy wisdom and good exceeds the fame which I heard.
1KI.10.8	Blessed are thy men, blessed are these thy slaves, who stand continually before thee and that hear thy wisdom.
1KI.10.9	Blessed be the 
1KI.10.10	And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and a very great store of spices and precious stones; never again did there come such abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
1KI.10.11	And the navy of Hiram, that had brought the gold from Ophir, also brought in from Ophir a great plenty of brazil wood and precious stones.
1KI.10.12	And the king made of the brazil wood banisters for the house of the 
1KI.10.13	And King Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her slaves.
1KI.10.14	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
1KI.10.15	besides what he had from the merchantmen and from the trade of the spice merchants and from all the kings of Arabia and from the princes of the land.
1KI.10.16	And King Solomon made two hundred shields of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of gold went into each shield.
1KI.10.17	Likewise he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pounds of gold went into each shield; and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
1KI.10.18	The king also made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with the purest gold.
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind, and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays.
1KI.10.20	And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps; there was not the like made in any other kingdom.
1KI.10.21	And all King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and likewise all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; there was no silver, for in the days of Solomon it was not esteemed.
1KI.10.22	For the king had at sea a navy of Tarshish with the navy of Hiram; once every three years the navy of Tarshish came, bringing gold, silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
1KI.10.23	So King Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom.
1KI.10.24	And all the earth sought to see the face of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart.
1KI.10.25	And they each one brought his presents each year, vessels of gold and vessels of silver and garments and arms and spices, horses, and mules.
1KI.10.26	And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he put in the cities of the chariots and with the king at Jerusalem.
1KI.10.27	And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedars to be as the sycamore trees that are in the vale, for abundance.
1KI.10.28	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt and linen yarn, for the king’s merchants bought the horses and yarn.
1KI.10.29	And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for one hundred and fifty, and so by their hand they supplied all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.
1KI.11.1	But King Solomon loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites,
1KI.11.2	of the Gentiles concerning which the 
1KI.11.3	And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.
1KI.11.4	For it came to pass when Solomon was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not perfect with the 
1KI.11.5	For Solomon went after Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom, the abomination of the Ammonites.
1KI.11.6	And Solomon did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.11.7	Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the mount that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the sons of Ammon.
1KI.11.8	And he did likewise for all his strange wives, who burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods.
1KI.11.9	And the 
1KI.11.10	and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not keep that which the 
1KI.11.11	Therefore the 
1KI.11.12	But I will not do it in thy days for David, thy father’s sake, but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
1KI.11.13	However, I will not rend away all the kingdom, but will give one tribe to thy son for David, my slave’s sake, and for Jerusalem’s sake which I have chosen.
1KI.11.14	And the 
1KI.11.15	For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab, the captain of the host, had gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom
1KI.11.16	(for Joab dwelt there six months with all Israel until he had cut off every male in Edom),
1KI.11.17	that Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father’s slaves with him, to go into Egypt, Hadad being yet a little child.
1KI.11.18	And they arose out of Midian and came to Paran; and taking men with them out of Paran, they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who gave him a house and appointed him food and gave him land.
1KI.11.19	And Hadad found great grace in the sight of Pharaoh so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Queen Tahpenes.
1KI.11.20	And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath, his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh’s household among the sons of Pharaoh.
1KI.11.21	And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab, the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart that I may go to my own land.
1KI.11.22	Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me that, behold, thou seekest to go to thy own land? And he answered, Nothing; however, let me go anyway.
1KI.11.23	And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon, the son of Eliadah, who fled from his lord Hadadezer, king of Zobah.
1KI.11.24	And he gathered men unto him and became captain over a band, when David slew those of Zobah; and they went to Damascus and dwelt there, and they made him king in Damascus.
1KI.11.25	And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon, besides the evil that Hadad did, and he abhorred Israel and reigned over Syria.
1KI.11.26	Likewise Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, Solomon’s slave, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow woman, lifted up his hand against the king.
1KI.11.27	And this was why he lifted up his hand against the king: Solomon in building Millo, closed the breach of the city of David, his father.
1KI.11.28	And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour, and Solomon, seeing that the young man was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of Joseph.
1KI.11.29	And it came to pass at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah, the Shilonite, found him in the way; and he was covered with a new garment; and the two were alone in the field.
1KI.11.30	And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him and rent it in twelve pieces;
1KI.11.31	and he said to Jeroboam, Take ten pieces for thyself, for thus hath said the 
1KI.11.32	and he shall have one tribe for my slave David’s sake and for Jerusalem’s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel
1KI.11.33	because they have forsaken me and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh, the god of the Moabites, and Milcom, the god of the sons of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes and to keep my statutes and my rights, as did David his father.
1KI.11.34	But I will not take any of his kingdom out of his hand, for I will make him prince all the days of his life for David, my slave’s sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
1KI.11.35	But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes.
1KI.11.36	And unto his son I will give one tribe, that David my slave may have a lamp always before me in Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen me to put my name in her.
1KI.11.37	And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desires and shalt be king over Israel.
1KI.11.38	And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee and wilt walk in my ways and do that which is right in my sight, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David, my slave, did, that I will be with thee and build thee a sure house, as I built for David, and will give Israel unto thee.
1KI.11.39	And I will afflict the seed of David because of this, but not for ever.
1KI.11.40	Solomon sought, therefore, to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt unto Shishak, king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.
1KI.11.41	And the rest of the acts of Solomon and all that he did and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
1KI.11.42	And the days that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.
1KI.11.43	And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, his father; and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
1KI.12.1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king.
1KI.12.2	And it came to pass, when Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who was yet in Egypt, heard of it (for he had fled from the presence of King Solomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt),
1KI.12.3	that they sent and called him. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke unto Rehoboam, saying,
1KI.12.4	Thy father made our yoke grievous; now therefore make thou the grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
1KI.12.5	And he said unto them, Depart, and in three days come again to me. And the people departed.
1KI.12.6	Then King Rehoboam consulted with the old men that had stood before Solomon, his father, while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise that I may answer this people?
1KI.12.7	And they spoke unto him, saying, If thou wilt be a slave unto this people this day and wilt serve them and answer them by speaking good words unto them, then they will be thy slaves for ever.
1KI.12.8	But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had given him, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him and who stood before him.
1KI.12.9	And he said unto them, What counsel give ye that we may answer this people who have spoken to me, saying, Make the yoke which thy father put upon us lighter?
1KI.12.10	And the young men that were grown up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spoke unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thus shalt thou say unto them: My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.
1KI.12.11	And now whereas my father ladened you with a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke; my father has chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1KI.12.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
1KI.12.13	And the king answered the people roughly and forsook the old men’s counsel that they gave him
1KI.12.14	and spoke to them after the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, and I will add to your yoke; my father also chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
1KI.12.15	Therefore, the king did not hearken unto the people, for the cause was from the 
1KI.12.16	So when all Israel saw that the king did not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David? There is no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed unto their tents.
1KI.12.17	But Rehoboam reigned over the sons of Israel who dwelt in the cities of Judah.
1KI.12.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute, but all Israel stoned him with stones, and he died. Then King Rehoboam made speed to get into his chariot and flee to Jerusalem.
1KI.12.19	So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
1KI.12.20	And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation and made him king over all Israel; there were none that followed the house of David, but the tribe of Judah only.
1KI.12.21	And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men of war, to fight against the house of Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam, the son of Solomon.
1KI.12.22	But the word of God came unto Shemaiah, the man of God, saying,
1KI.12.23	Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and unto all the house of Judah and Benjamin and to the remnant of the people, saying,
1KI.12.24	Thus hath the 
1KI.12.25	And Jeroboam rebuilt Shechem in Mount Ephraim and dwelt therein, and going out from there, rebuilt Penuel.
1KI.12.26	And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David
1KI.12.27	if this people go up to sacrifice in the house of the 
1KI.12.28	And having taken counsel, the king made two calves of gold and said unto the people, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
1KI.12.29	And he set the one in Bethel and the other he put in Dan.
1KI.12.30	And this became an occasion for sin, for the people went to worship before the one, even unto Dan.
1KI.12.31	And he made a house of high places and made priests of the lowest of the people, who were not of the sons of Levi.
1KI.12.32	Then Jeroboam ordained a solemnity in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day of the month, like unto the solemnity that was celebrated in Judah; and he sacrificed upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto the calves that he had made. He also ordered in Bethel the priests of the high places which he had made.
1KI.12.33	So he sacrificed upon the altar which he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, the month which he had devised of his own heart, and made a feast unto the sons of Israel; and he climbed up on the altar to burn incense.
1KI.13.1	And, behold, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the 
1KI.13.2	And he cried against the altar by the word of the 
1KI.13.3	And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the 
1KI.13.4	And when King Jeroboam heard the word of the man of God, who had cried out against the altar in Bethel, that he put forth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand, which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull it in again to him.
1KI.13.5	The altar also was rent, and the ashes with the burnt fat were poured out from the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word of the 
1KI.13.6	Then the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat now the face of the 
1KI.13.7	And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me and refresh thyself, and I will give thee a gift.
1KI.13.8	But the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me half thy house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place,
1KI.13.9	for so was it charged me by the word of the 
1KI.13.10	So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel, and his sons came and told him all the works that the man of God had done that day in Bethel; they also told their father the words which he had spoken unto the king.
1KI.13.12	And their father said unto them, What way did he go? And his sons showed him the way the man of God had gone, who had come from Judah.
1KI.13.13	And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddled him the ass, and he rode thereon
1KI.13.14	and went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak; and he said unto him, Art thou the man of God that didst come from Judah? And he said, I am.
1KI.13.15	Then he said unto him, Come home with me and eat bread.
1KI.13.16	And he said, I may not return with thee nor go in with thee; neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place,
1KI.13.17	for it was said to me by the word of the 
1KI.13.18	And the other said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art, and an angel spoke unto me by the word of the 
1KI.13.19	So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.
1KI.13.20	And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word of the 
1KI.13.21	and he cried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus hath the 
1KI.13.22	but didst come back and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, of which the 
1KI.13.23	And when he had eaten of the bread and after he had drunk, the prophet that had brought him back saddled an ass for him,
1KI.13.24	and as he went, a lion met him by the way and slew him, and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, and the lion also stood by the carcase.
1KI.13.25	And, behold, men passed by and saw the carcase cast in the way, and the lion standing by the carcase; and they came and told it in the city where the old prophet dwelt.
1KI.13.26	And when the prophet that had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, It is the man of God, who rebelled against the word of the 
1KI.13.27	And he spoke to his sons, saying, Saddle me an ass. And they saddled it for him.
1KI.13.28	And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the carcase; the lion had not eaten the carcase nor torn the ass.
1KI.13.29	And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God and laid it upon the ass and brought it back. And the old prophet came to the city to mourn and to bury him.
1KI.13.30	And he laid his carcase in his own grave, and they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother!
1KI.13.31	And it came to pass, after he had buried him, that he spoke to his sons, saying, When I am dead, then bury me in the sepulchre in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.
1KI.13.32	For that which he proclaimed by the word of the 
1KI.13.33	After this thing Jeroboam did not return from his evil way, but made again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places; whoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priests of the high places.
1KI.13.34	And this became the cause of sin unto the house of Jeroboam for which it was cut off and destroyed from off the face of the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Abijah, the son of Jeroboam, fell sick.
1KI.14.2	And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou not be known to be the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh, for Ahijah the prophet is there, who told me that I should be king over this people.
1KI.14.3	And take with thee ten loaves and cracknels and a cruse of honey and go to him, that he shall tell thee what shall become of this child.
1KI.14.4	And Jeroboam’s wife did so and arose and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were set by reason of his age.
1KI.14.5	But the 
1KI.14.6	And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, wife of Jeroboam; why art thou in disguise? For I am sent to thee with heavy tidings.
1KI.14.7	Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus hath the 
1KI.14.8	and rent the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it thee, and yet thou hast not been as my slave David, who kept my commandments and who followed me with all his heart, to doing only that which was right in my eyes,
1KI.14.9	but hast done evil above all that were before thee, for thou hast gone and made thee other gods and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back;
1KI.14.10	therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam everyone that pisses against the wall, the one that is shut up along with the one that is left in Israel, and will burn away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man burns away dung until it is all gone.
1KI.14.11	The one that dies of those of Jeroboam in the city, the dogs shall eat, and the one that dies in the field, the fowls of the air shall eat; for the 
1KI.14.12	Arise thou, therefore, go to thy own house, and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die.
1KI.14.13	And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he only of those of Jeroboam shall enter into the grave because in him there is found some good thing of the 
1KI.14.14	And the 
1KI.14.15	For the 
1KI.14.16	And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who sinned and who has made Israel sin.
1KI.14.17	Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah; and as she entered by the threshold of the house, the child died.
1KI.14.18	And they buried him, and all Israel mourned for him, according to the word of the 
1KI.14.19	And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
1KI.14.20	And the days which Jeroboam reigned were twenty-two years, and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab, his son, reigned in his stead.
1KI.14.21	And Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
1KI.14.22	And Judah did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.14.23	For they also built themselves high places and statues, and groves on every high hill and under every green tree.
1KI.14.24	And there were also male cult prostitutes in the land, and they did according to all the abominations of the Gentiles which the 
1KI.14.25	And it came to pass in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.
1KI.14.26	And he took away the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.14.27	And King Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.
1KI.14.28	And when the king went into the house of the 
1KI.14.29	Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1KI.14.30	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
1KI.14.31	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And his mother’s name was Naamah, an Ammonitess. And Abijam, his son, reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.1	Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah.
1KI.15.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
1KI.15.3	And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had done before him; and his heart was not perfect with the 
1KI.15.4	Nevertheless for David’s sake, the 
1KI.15.5	Because David had done that which was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.6	And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life.
1KI.15.7	Now the rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
1KI.15.8	And Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Asa, his son, reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.9	In the twentieth year of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah.
1KI.15.10	And he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
1KI.15.11	And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.15.12	For he took away the male cult prostitutes out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made.
1KI.15.13	And he also removed Maachah, his mother, from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed her idol and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
1KI.15.14	But the high places were not removed; nevertheless, Asa’s heart was perfect with the 
1KI.15.15	And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated and the things which he himself had dedicated, into the house of the 
1KI.15.16	And there was war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, all their days.
1KI.15.17	And Baasha, king of Israel, went up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might not allow any to go out or come in to Asa, king of Judah.
1KI.15.18	Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the 
1KI.15.19	There is a covenant between me and thee and between my father and thy father; behold, I have sent unto thee a bribe of silver and gold; come and break thy covenant with Baasha, king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
1KI.15.20	So Benhadad hearkened unto King Asa and sent the princes of the hosts, which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon and Dan and Abelbethmaachah and all Cinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali.
1KI.15.21	And when Baasha heard this, he left off building of Ramah and dwelt in Tirzah.
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; no one was exempted; and they took away the stones and timber of Ramah, with which Baasha had been building; and King Asa built with them Geba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
1KI.15.23	The rest of all the acts of Asa and all his might and all that he did and the cities which he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless, in the time of his old age he was diseased in his feet.
1KI.15.24	And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, his father; and Jehoshaphat, his son, reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.25	And Nadab, the son of Jeroboam, began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa, king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
1KI.15.26	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.15.27	And Baasha, the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Nadab and all Israel had laid siege to Gibbethon.
1KI.15.28	Even in the third year of Asa, king of Judah, did Baasha slay him and reigned in his stead.
1KI.15.29	And when he came into the kingdom, he smote all the house of Jeroboam; he left not a living soul of those of Jeroboam, until he had destroyed him, according unto the word of the 
1KI.15.30	because of the sins of Jeroboam with which he sinned and with which he made Israel sin and because of his provocation with which he provoked the 
1KI.15.31	Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.15.32	And there was war between Asa and Baasha, king of Israel, all their days.
1KI.15.33	In the third year of Asa, king of Judah, Baasha, the son of Ahijah, began to reign over all Israel in Tirzah; and he reigned twenty-four years.
1KI.15.34	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.1	Then the word of the 
1KI.16.2	Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust and made thee prince over my people Israel, and thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam and hast made my people Israel sin, to provoke me to anger with their sins;
1KI.16.3	behold, I will burn up the posterity of Baasha and the posterity of his house and will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat.
1KI.16.4	He that dies of Baasha in the city, the dogs shall eat; and he that dies of his in the fields, the fowls of the air shall eat.
1KI.16.5	Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.6	So Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried in Tirzah, and Elah, his son, reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.7	And likewise by the hand of the prophet Jehu, the son of Hanani, had come the word of the 
1KI.16.8	In the year twenty-six of Asa, king of Judah, Elah, the son of Baasha, began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned two years.
1KI.16.9	And his slave Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspired against him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, steward of his house in Tirzah.
1KI.16.10	And Zimri went in and smote him and killed him, in the year twenty-seven of Asa, king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.11	And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he sat on his throne, that he smote all the house of Baasha; he left him not one that pisses against a wall, neither of his kinsfolk, {Heb. redeemers}, nor of his friends.
1KI.16.12	Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the 
1KI.16.13	for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah, his son, by which they sinned and by which they made Israel sin, provoking the 
1KI.16.14	Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.15	In the year twenty-seven of Asa, king of Judah, Zimri began to reign in Tirzah, and he reigned seven days. And the people were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
1KI.16.16	And the people that were in the camp heard it said, Zimri has conspired and has killed the king. Therefore, all Israel made Omri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
1KI.16.17	And Omri went up from Gibbethon and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah.
1KI.16.18	And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken, that he went into the palace of the king’s house and burnt the king’s house over him with fire, and died,
1KI.16.19	for his sins which he committed in doing evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.20	Now the rest of the acts of Zimri and his treason that he wrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.21	Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts: half of the people followed Tibni, the son of Ginath, to make him king; and half followed Omri.
1KI.16.22	But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the people that followed Tibni, the son of Ginath; so Tibni died, and Omri reigned.
1KI.16.23	In the year thirty-one of Asa, king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and he reigned twelve years; he reigned six years in Tirzah.
1KI.16.24	And he bought the mountain of Samaria of Shemer for two talents of silver and built on the mount and called the name of the city which he built, after the name of Shemer, lord of the hill, Samaria.
1KI.16.25	And Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the 
1KI.16.26	For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and in his sin with which he made Israel sin, provoking the 
1KI.16.27	Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did and his might that he showed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.16.28	So Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria; and Ahab, his son, reigned in his stead.
1KI.16.29	And in the year thirty-eight of Asa, king of Judah, Ahab, the son of Omri, began to reign over Israel. And Ahab the son of Omri, reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years.
1KI.16.30	And Ahab, the son of Omri, did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.16.31	for it was as a light thing unto him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and he took to wife Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal and worshipped him.
1KI.16.32	And he raised up an altar to Baal in the house of Baal, which he had built in Samaria.
1KI.16.33	Ahab also made groves, and Ahab did more to provoke the 
1KI.16.34	In his time Hiel, the Bethelite, rebuilt Jericho. He laid the foundation thereof in Abiram, his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.1	Then Elijah, the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead, said unto Ahab, As the 
1KI.17.2	And the word of the 
1KI.17.3	Leave this place and turn to the east and hide thyself by the brook Cherith, that is before the Jordan,
1KI.17.4	and thou shalt drink of the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed thee there.
1KI.17.5	So he went and did according unto the word of the 
1KI.17.6	And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning and bread and flesh in the evening, and he drank from the brook.
1KI.17.7	And it came to pass after a while that the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
1KI.17.8	And the word of the 
1KI.17.9	Arise, go to Zarephath of Zidon, and thou shalt dwell there; behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
1KI.17.10	So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks; and he called to her and said, Bring me, I pray thee, a little water in a vessel, that I may drink.
1KI.17.11	And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her again and said, Bring me also, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thy hand.
1KI.17.12	And she said, As the 
1KI.17.13	And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said; but first make me a little cake of bread baked under the ashes and bring it unto me, and afterwards thou shalt make for thee and for thy son.
1KI.17.14	For thus hath said the 
1KI.17.15	And she went and did as Elijah told her; and he and she and her house ate for many days.
1KI.17.16	And the pitcher of meal was not consumed, neither did the cruse of oil fail, according to the word of the 
1KI.17.17	And it came to pass after these things that the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was so severe that there was no breath left in him.
1KI.17.18	And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thou man of God? Art thou come unto me to call my iniquity to remembrance and to cause my son to die?
1KI.17.19	And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And he took him out of her bosom and carried him up into the chamber where he abode and laid him upon his own bed.
1KI.17.20	And he cried unto the 
1KI.17.21	And he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried unto the 
1KI.17.22	And the 
1KI.17.23	And Elijah took the child and brought him down out of the chamber into the house and delivered him unto his mother, and Elijah said, See, thy son lives.
1KI.17.24	Then the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art a man of God and that the word of the 
1KI.18.1	And it came to pass after many days that the word of the 
1KI.18.2	And Elijah went to show himself unto Ahab. And there was a severe famine in Samaria.
1KI.18.3	And Ahab called Obadiah, who was the governor of his house. (Now Obadiah feared the 
1KI.18.4	for when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the 
1KI.18.5	And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go through the land to all the fountains of water and to all the brooks; peradventure we may find herbage to save the horses and mules alive that we not lose all the beasts.
1KI.18.6	So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
1KI.18.7	And as Obadiah was in the way, Elijah met him; and when he recognized him, he fell on his face, and said, Art thou not my lord Elijah?
1KI.18.8	And he answered him, I am; go, tell thy lord, Behold Elijah. {Heb. The 
1KI.18.9	And he said, In what have I sinned that thou should deliver thy slave into the hand of Ahab, for him to slay me?
1KI.18.10	As the 
1KI.18.11	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold Elijah.
1KI.18.12	And it shall come to pass as soon as I am gone from thee, that the Spirit of the 
1KI.18.13	Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew the prophets of the 
1KI.18.14	And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold Elijah; and he shall slay me.
1KI.18.15	And Elijah said unto him, As the 
1KI.18.16	Then Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him, and Ahab came to meet Elijah.
1KI.18.17	And it came to pass when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said unto him, Art thou he that troubles Israel?
1KI.18.18	And he answered, I have not troubled Israel; but thou and thy father’s house, in that ye have forsaken the commandments of the 
1KI.18.19	Now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount Carmel, and the four hundred and fifty prophets of Baal, and the four hundred prophets of the groves, who eat at Jezebel’s table.
1KI.18.20	Then Ahab sent unto all the sons of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Carmel.
1KI.18.21	And Elijah came near unto all the people and said, How long shall ye halt between two opinions? If the 
1KI.18.22	Then Elijah spoke again unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the 
1KI.18.23	Give us, therefore, two bullocks, and let them choose one bullock for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under it; and I will dress the other bullock and lay it on wood and put no fire under it.
1KI.18.24	And invoke ye in the name of your gods, and I will invoke in the name of the 
1KI.18.25	So Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you one bullock for yourselves and dress it first, for ye are many, and invoke in the name of your gods, but put no fire under it.
1KI.18.26	And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressed it and invoked in the name of Baal from morning even until noon, saying, O Baal, answer us. But there was no voice nor anyone that answered. And they jumped up and down near the altar which they had made.
1KI.18.27	And it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said, Cry aloud, for he is a god; peradventure he is talking or he had to go to the latrine, or he is on a journey, or he sleeps and will awake.
1KI.18.28	And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets until the blood gushed out upon them.
1KI.18.29	And when midday was past, even so they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, and there was neither voice nor anyone that answered nor anyone that heard.
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And all the people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the 
1KI.18.31	And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the 
1KI.18.32	and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the 
1KI.18.33	And he put the wood in order and cut the bullock in pieces and laid it on the wood and said, Fill four pitchers with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood.
1KI.18.34	And he said, Do it the second time, and they did it the second time. And he said, Do it the third time, and they did it the third time.
1KI.18.35	So that the water ran round about the altar, and he had filled the trench also with water.
1KI.18.36	And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near and said, 
1KI.18.37	Answer me, O 
1KI.18.38	Then fire of the 
1KI.18.39	And seeing it, all the people fell on their faces, and they said, The 
1KI.18.40	And Elijah said unto them, Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they seized them; and Elijah took them down to the brook Kishon and slew them there.
1KI.18.41	Then Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink; for there is a sound of abundance of rain.
1KI.18.42	So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Carmel, and he cast himself down upon the earth and put his face between his knees
1KI.18.43	and said to his slave, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up and looked and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
1KI.18.44	And the seventh time he said, Behold, a little cloud like the palm of a man’s hand arises out of the sea. And he said, Go and say to Ahab, Prepare thy chariot and descend that the rain not stop thee.
1KI.18.45	And it came to pass in the meanwhile that the heavens became black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.
1KI.18.46	And the hand of the 
1KI.19.1	And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and of how he had slain all the prophets with the sword.
1KI.19.2	Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let the gods do to me, and more also, if by tomorrow at this time I have not made thy person as one of them.
1KI.19.3	And when he saw that, he arose and departed to save his life and came to Beersheba, which is in Judah, and left his servant there.
1KI.19.4	But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a juniper tree; and desiring to die, he said, It is enough; now, O 
1KI.19.5	And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then an angel touched him and said unto him, Arise and eat.
1KI.19.6	Then he looked and behold, there was a cake baked on the coals and a cruse of water at his head. And he ate and drank and went back to sleep.
1KI.19.7	And the angel of the 
1KI.19.8	And he arose and ate and drank and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights unto Horeb, the mount of God.
1KI.19.9	And there he went into a cave, where he lodged; and the word of the 
1KI.19.10	And he replied, I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.11	And he said, Go forth and stand upon the mount before the 
1KI.19.12	And after the earthquake a fire, but the 
1KI.19.13	Which when Elijah heard it, he covered his face in his mantle and went out and stood in the door of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him, saying, What doest thou here, Elijah?
1KI.19.14	And he replied, I have been very jealous for the 
1KI.19.15	And the 
1KI.19.16	and Jehu, the son of Nimshi, thou shalt anoint to be king over Israel; and Elisha, the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah, thou shalt anoint to be prophet in thy place.
1KI.19.17	And it shall be that he that escapes the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall slay; and he that escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall slay.
1KI.19.18	And I will cause seven thousand to remain in Israel, all the knees which have not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which has not kissed him.
1KI.19.19	So he departed from there and found Elisha, the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with the twelfth. And Elijah passed by him and cast his mantle upon him.
1KI.19.20	So he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, Let me, I pray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee. And he said unto him, Go back again, for what have I done to thee?
1KI.19.21	And he returned back from him and took a yoke of oxen and slew them and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen and gave unto the people and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and served him.
1KI.20.1	Then Benhadad, the king of Syria, gathered all his host together; and there were thirty-two kings with him and horses and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria and warred against it.
1KI.20.2	And he sent messengers to Ahab, king of Israel, into the city and said unto him, Thus hath Benhadad said,
1KI.20.3	Thy silver and thy gold is mine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.
1KI.20.4	And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king, according to thy word, I am thine and all that I have.
1KI.20.5	And the messengers came again and said, Thus hath Benhadad said, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver me thy silver and thy gold and thy wives and thy children,
1KI.20.6	yet I will send my slaves unto thee tomorrow about this time, and they shall search thy house and the houses of thy slaves; and it shall be that whatever is precious in thine eyes, they shall put it in their hand and take it away.
1KI.20.7	Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, Understand, I pray you, and see how this man seeks only evil, for he sent unto me for my wives and for my children and for my silver and for my gold, and I denied him not.
1KI.20.8	And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken not unto him, nor consent.
1KI.20.9	So he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lord the king, All that thou didst send for to thy slave at the first I will do, but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed and brought him word again.
1KI.20.10	And Benhadad sent unto him again and said, The gods do so unto me, and more also, that the dust of Samaria shall not be enough for the open hands of all the people that follow me.
1KI.20.11	And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not him that girds on his harness boast as he that puts it off.
1KI.20.12	And when he heard this word, as he was drinking with the kings in the pavilions, he said unto his slaves, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in array against the city.
1KI.20.13	And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab, king of Israel, saying, Thus hath the 
1KI.20.14	And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus hath the 
1KI.20.15	Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces, and they were two hundred and thirty-two: and after them he numbered all the people, even all the sons of Israel, being seven thousand.
1KI.20.16	And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty-two kings that helped him.
1KI.20.17	And the young men of the princes of the provinces went out first. And Benhadad had sent out men who warned him, saying, There are men come out of Samaria.
1KI.20.18	Then he said, If they have come out for peace, take them alive; or if they have come out for war, take them alive.
1KI.20.19	So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out of the city, and the army followed after them.
1KI.20.20	And each one smote the man that came against him; and the Syrians fled; and Israel pursued them. And Benhadad, the king of Syria, escaped on a horse with some of the horsemen.
1KI.20.21	And the king of Israel went out and smote the horsemen and the chariots and smote the Syrians with a great slaughter.
1KI.20.22	And the prophet came to the king of Israel and said unto him, Go, strengthen thyself, and consider, and see what thou must do, for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
1KI.20.23	And the slaves of the king of Syria said unto him, Their gods are gods of the mountains; therefore, they were stronger than we; but let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.
1KI.20.24	Therefore, do this: Remove the kings from their positions and put captains in their place.
1KI.20.25	And prepare another army like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse and chariot for chariot; then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, and did so.
1KI.20.26	And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadad numbered the Syrians and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
1KI.20.27	And the sons of Israel were numbered and took provisions and went against them; and the sons of Israel pitched before them like two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the land.
1KI.20.28	Then the man of God came and spoke unto the king of Israel and said, Thus hath the 
1KI.20.29	And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And so it was that in the seventh day the battle was joined; and the sons of Israel slew of the Syrians one hundred thousand footmen in one day.
1KI.20.30	But the rest fled to Aphek into the city, and the wall fell upon twenty-seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadad also fled and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
1KI.20.31	Then his slaves said unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings; let us, I pray thee, put sackcloth on our loins and ropes upon our heads and go out to the king of Israel; peradventure he will give thee thy life.
1KI.20.32	So they girded sackcloth on their loins and put ropes on their heads and came to the king of Israel and said, Thy slave Benhadad saith, I pray thee, let me live. And he replied, If he is yet alive, he is my brother.
1KI.20.33	Now these men took this as a good omen and quickly took this word from his mouth, and they said, Thy brother Benhadad! And he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth to him, and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
1KI.20.34	And Benhadad said unto him, The cities, which my father took from thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make plazas for thee in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria, and I will leave here confederated with thee. So he made a covenant with him and sent him away.
1KI.20.35	Then a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto his neighbour by the word of the 
1KI.20.36	Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice of the 
1KI.20.37	Then he found another man and said, Smite me, I pray thee. And the man smote him and wounded him.
1KI.20.38	So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way and disguised himself with a veil over his eyes.
1KI.20.39	And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king, and he said, Thy slave went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a man turned aside and brought a man unto me and said, Guard this man; if by any means he should get away, then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
1KI.20.40	And when thy slave was busy here and there, he disappeared. Then the king of Israel said unto him, So shall thy sentence be; thou thyself hast decided it.
1KI.20.41	Then he quickly took the veil away from his face; and the king of Israel recognized that he was of the prophets.
1KI.20.42	And he said unto him, Thus hath the 
1KI.20.43	And the king of Israel went to his house, sad and angry, and came to Samaria.
1KI.21.1	And it came to pass after these things that Naboth of Jezreel had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, next to the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria.
1KI.21.2	And Ahab spoke unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard that I may have it for a garden of herbs because it is next to my house, and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or if it seems good unto thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
1KI.21.3	And Naboth replied unto Ahab, The 
1KI.21.4	And Ahab came into his house, sad and angry, because of the word which Naboth of Jezreel had spoken to him, for he had said, I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he lay down upon his bed and turned away his face and would eat no bread.
1KI.21.5	And Jezebel, his wife, came to him and said unto him, Why is thy spirit so sad that thou dost eat no bread?
1KI.21.6	And he said unto her, Because I spoke with Naboth of Jezreel and said unto him, Give me thy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give thee another vineyard for it; and he answered, I will not give thee my vineyard.
1KI.21.7	And Jezebel, his wife, said unto him, Dost thou now govern the kingdom of Israel? Arise and eat bread and let thy heart be merry; I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel.
1KI.21.8	So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that were in his city dwelling with Naboth.
1KI.21.9	And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people
1KI.21.10	and set two men, sons of Belial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didst blaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out and stone him that he may die.
1KI.21.11	And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who were the inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
1KI.21.12	They proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people.
1KI.21.13	Then the two men, sons of Belial, came in and sat before him; and those men of Belial witnessed against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth blasphemed God and the king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned him with stones that he died.
1KI.21.14	Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned and is dead.
1KI.21.15	And it came to pass when Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead that she said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel which he refused to give thee for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
1KI.21.16	And it came to pass when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel, to take possession of it.
1KI.21.17	Then the word of the 
1KI.21.18	Arise, go down to meet Ahab, king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he is gone down to possess it.
1KI.21.19	And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus hath the 
1KI.21.20	And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee because thou hast sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the 
1KI.21.21	Behold, I will bring evil upon thee and will burn away thy posterity and will cut off from Ahab him that pisses against the wall and he that is kept and he that is left in Israel.
1KI.21.22	And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah, for the provocation with which thou hast provoked me to anger and made Israel to sin.
1KI.21.23	And of Jezebel, the 
1KI.21.24	Him that dies of Ahab in the city, the dogs shall eat, and him that dies in the field, shall the fowls of the air eat.
1KI.21.25	(Truly there was none like unto Ahab, who sold himself to work wickedness in the sight of the 
1KI.21.26	He was very abominable, following idols, according to all the things that the Amorites did, whom the 
1KI.21.27	And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh and fasted and slept in sackcloth and went softly.
1KI.21.28	Then the word of the 
1KI.21.29	Seest thou how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days, but in his son’s days I will bring the evil upon his house.
1KI.22.1	And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.
1KI.22.2	And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, came down to the king of Israel.
1KI.22.3	And the king of Israel said unto his slaves, Know ye that Ramoth in Gilead is ours, and we are late in not taking it out of the hand of the king of Syria?
1KI.22.4	And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wilt thou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.
1KI.22.5	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the 
1KI.22.6	Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, for the Lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king.
1KI.22.7	And Jehoshaphat said, Is there even yet a prophet of the 
1KI.22.8	And the king of Israel replied unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah, the son of Imlah, by whom we may enquire of the 
1KI.22.9	Then the king of Israel called a eunuch and said, Bring Micaiah, the son of Imlah, here quickly.
1KI.22.10	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, sat each on his throne, having put on their robes, in the plaza at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets prophesied before them.
1KI.22.11	And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, made himself horns of iron, and he said, Thus hath the 
1KI.22.12	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead and be prospered, for the 
1KI.22.13	And the messenger that had gone to call Micaiah spoke unto him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto the king with one mouth; now let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them and speak that which is good.
1KI.22.14	And Micaiah said, As the 
1KI.22.15	So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go and be prospered, for the 
1KI.22.16	And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of the 
1KI.22.17	Then he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains as sheep without a shepherd; and the 
1KI.22.18	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?
1KI.22.19	Then he said, Hear thou, therefore, the word of the 
1KI.22.20	And the 
1KI.22.21	And there came forth a spirit and stood before the 
1KI.22.22	And the 
1KI.22.23	Now, therefore, behold, the 
1KI.22.24	Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, went near and smote Micaiah on the cheek and said, Which way did the Spirit of the 
1KI.22.25	And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see in that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
1KI.22.26	Then the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and carry him back unto Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king’s son
1KI.22.27	and say, Thus hath the king said, Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace.
1KI.22.28	And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the 
1KI.22.29	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramothgilead.
1KI.22.30	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and enter into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into the battle.
1KI.22.31	But the king of Syria commanded his thirty-two captains that had rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.32	And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, Surely this is the king of Israel. And they turned aside to fight against him, but Jehoshaphat cried out.
1KI.22.33	And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.
1KI.22.34	But a certain man, shooting his bow in perfection, smote the king of Israel between the joints of his coat of mail; therefore, he said unto the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand and carry me out of the host, for I am wounded.
1KI.22.35	And the battle had increased that day, and the king was stayed up in his chariot against the Syrians and died in the evening, and the blood ran out of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
1KI.22.36	And at the going down of the sun there went a proclamation throughout the camp, saying, Every man to his city and every man to his own land.
1KI.22.37	So the king died and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.
1KI.22.38	And they washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria, and they also washed his armour; {Heb. fornications}; and the dogs licked up his blood, according unto the word of the 
1KI.22.39	Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and the ivory house which he made and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
1KI.22.40	So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his stead.
1KI.22.41	And Jehoshaphat, the son of Asa, began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab, king of Israel.
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
1KI.22.43	And he walked in all the ways of Asa, his father; he turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the 
1KI.22.44	And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
1KI.22.45	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat and his might that he showed and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
1KI.22.46	And the remnant of the male cult prostitutes, which had remained from the days of his father Asa, he consumed out of the land.
1KI.22.47	There was then no king in Edom; there was a president instead of a king.
1KI.22.48	Jehoshaphat had made ships in Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.
1KI.22.49	Then Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, said unto Jehoshaphat, Let my slaves go with thy slaves in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
1KI.22.50	And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, his father, and Jehoram, his son, reigned in his stead.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah, the son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the year seventeen of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and reigned two years over Israel.
1KI.22.52	And he did evil in the sight of the 
1KI.22.53	for he served Baal and worshipped him and provoked to anger the 
2KI.1.1	Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.
2KI.1.2	And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria and was sick, and he sent messengers and said unto them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover of this disease.
2KI.1.3	But the angel of the 
2KI.1.4	Now therefore, thus hath the 
2KI.1.5	And when the messengers turned back unto him, he said unto them, Why are ye now turned back?
2KI.1.6	And they said unto him, We met a man who said unto us, Go, turn again unto the king that sent you and say unto him, Thus hath the 
2KI.1.7	Then he said unto them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you and told you these words?
2KI.1.8	And they answered him, He was a hairy man and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah, the Tishbite.
2KI.1.9	Then the king sent unto him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him, and, behold, he sat on the top of a mountain. And he spoke unto him, Man of God, the king has commanded thee to come down.
2KI.1.10	And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And fire came down from heaven, that consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.11	Again also he sent unto him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said unto him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.
2KI.1.12	And Elijah answered and said unto them, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.
2KI.1.13	And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up and came and fell on his knees before Elijah and besought him and said unto him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life and the life of these fifty thy slaves, be precious in thy sight.
2KI.1.14	Behold, fire has come down from heaven and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties; therefore, let my soul now be precious in thy sight.
2KI.1.15	Then the angel of the 
2KI.1.16	And he said unto him, Thus hath the 
2KI.1.17	So he died according to the word of the 
2KI.1.18	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.2.1	And it came to pass, when the 
2KI.2.2	And Elijah said unto Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the 
2KI.2.3	And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha and said unto him, Knowest thou that the 
2KI.2.4	And Elijah said unto him again, Elisha, tarry here, for the 
2KI.2.5	And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha and said unto him, Knowest thou that the 
2KI.2.6	And Elijah said unto him, Tarry, I pray thee, here, for the 
2KI.2.7	And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went and stood in front of them afar off; and the two of them stood by the Jordan.
2KI.2.8	And Elijah took his mantle and wrapped it together and smote the waters, and they separated to one side and the other so that they both went over on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	And when they had gone over, Elijah said unto Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.
2KI.2.10	And he said, Thou hast asked a difficult thing. If thou shalt see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee, but if not, it shall not be so.
2KI.2.11	And it came to pass, as they still went on and talked, that, behold, a chariot of fire with horses of fire separated the two, and Elijah went up into heaven in a whirlwind.
2KI.2.12	And as Elisha saw it, he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more, and he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces.
2KI.2.13	And lifting up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, he went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
2KI.2.14	And taking up the mantle of Elijah that had fallen from him, he smote the waters, and said, Where is the 
2KI.2.15	And seeing him, the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho said, The spirit of Elijah rests on Elisha. And they came to meet him and bowed themselves to the ground before him.
2KI.2.16	And they said unto him, Behold now, there are fifty strong men with thy slaves; let them go and seek thy master; peradventure the Spirit of the 
2KI.2.17	But when they urged him until he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men, and they sought him three days, but did not find him.
2KI.2.18	And when they came again to him (for he tarried at Jericho), he said unto them, Did I not tell you to not go?
2KI.2.19	And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Behold, the seat of this city is good, as my lord sees, but the water is evil, and the ground barren.
2KI.2.20	Then he said, Bring me a new cruse and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.
2KI.2.21	And he went forth unto the springs of the waters and cast the salt in there and said, Thus hath the 
2KI.2.22	So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word which Elisha spoke.
2KI.2.23	Then he went up from there unto Bethel, and as he was going up by the way, the young men {or servants} of the city came forth and mocked him, saying, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.
2KI.2.24	And he turned back and looked on them and cursed them in the name of the 
2KI.2.25	And he went from there to Mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Now Jehoram, the son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.
2KI.3.2	And he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.3.3	Nevertheless, he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin; he did not depart from them.
2KI.3.4	And Mesha, king of Moab, was a pastor and rendered unto the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and one hundred thousand rams, with the wool.
2KI.3.5	But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
2KI.3.6	And King Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time and numbered all Israel.
2KI.3.7	And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me; wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up; I am as thou art, my people as thy people and my horses as thy horses.
2KI.3.8	And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went and the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and as they walked round about seven days’ journey through the desert, there was no water for the host or for the beasts that followed them.
2KI.3.10	Then the king of Israel said, Alas! The 
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not a prophet of the 
2KI.3.12	And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the 
2KI.3.13	Then Elisha said unto the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? Go to the prophets of thy father and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said unto him, No, for the 
2KI.3.14	And Elisha said, As the 
2KI.3.15	But now bring me a minstrel. And when the minstrel played, the hand of the 
2KI.3.16	and he said, Thus hath the 
2KI.3.17	For thus hath the 
2KI.3.18	And this is but a light thing in the sight of the 
2KI.3.19	And ye shall smite every fenced city and every choice city and shall fell every good tree and stop every fountain of water and mar every good piece of land with stones.
2KI.3.20	And it came to pass in the morning, when the present was offered, that water came by the way of Edom, and the land was filled with water.
2KI.3.21	And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to gird on a girdle and upward and stood in the border.
2KI.3.22	And when they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water before them as red as blood;
2KI.3.23	and they said, This is blood; the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another. Now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.
2KI.3.24	But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites so that they fled before them, but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.
2KI.3.25	And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land each man cast his stone and filled it, and they stopped all the fountains of water and felled all the good trees until they left their stones only in Kirharaseth, for the slingers went about it and smote it.
2KI.3.26	And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was overcoming him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords to break through unto the king of Edom, but they could not.
2KI.3.27	Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation in Israel, and they departed from him and returned to their own land.
2KI.4.1	Now a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets cried unto Elisha, saying, Thy slave, my husband, is dead; and thou knowest that thy slave feared the 
2KI.4.2	And Elisha said unto her, What shall I do for thee? Tell me what thou hast in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid has nothing in the house except a flask of oil.
2KI.4.3	And he said, Go, borrow vessels from all thy neighbours, empty vessels; borrow not a few.
2KI.4.4	Then enter in and shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons and pour out into all those vessels, and as each one is full, set it aside.
2KI.4.5	So she went from him and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her, and she poured out the oil.
2KI.4.6	And when the vessels were full, she said unto her son, Bring me yet another vessel. And he said unto her, There are no more vessels. Then the oil stopped flowing.
2KI.4.7	Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell this oil and pay thy debtors and live thou and thy sons of the rest.
2KI.4.8	And it also happened that one day Elisha passed through Shunem, where there was an important woman, and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as often as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread.
2KI.4.9	And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who passes by us continually.
2KI.4.10	Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, on the wall, and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a lampstand so that when he comes to us, he shall turn in there.
2KI.4.11	And it came to pass one day that he came there, and he turned into the chamber and slept there.
2KI.4.12	Then he said to Gehazi, his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.
2KI.4.13	And he said unto Gehazi, Say now unto her, Behold, thou hast been diligent for us with all this care; what shall I do for thee? Dost thou have need that I speak for thee unto the king or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.
2KI.4.14	And he said, What then shall we do for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she has no child, and her husband is old.
2KI.4.15	Then he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.
2KI.4.16	And he said, At the appointed time, according to the time of life, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, thou man of God, do not deceive thy handmaid.
2KI.4.17	But the woman conceived and gave birth to a son at the appointed time that Elisha had said unto her, according to the time of life.
2KI.4.18	And when the child was grown, it came to pass one day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.
2KI.4.19	And he said unto his father, My head, my head. And he said to a servant, Carry him to his mother.
2KI.4.20	And when he had taken him and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees until noon and then died.
2KI.4.21	Then she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God and shut the door upon him and went out.
2KI.4.22	And calling her husband, she said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men and one of the asses that I may run to the man of God and come again.
2KI.4.23	And he said, Why must thou go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath. And she said, Peace.
2KI.4.24	Then she caused the ass to be saddled and said to her servant, Lead and go forward; slack not the pace for me except I bid thee.
2KI.4.25	So she went and came unto the man of God to Mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi, his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite.
2KI.4.26	Run now, I pray thee, to meet her and say unto her, Dost thou have peace? And thy husband? And the child? And she answered, Peace.
2KI.4.27	And when she came to the man of God in the mountain, she caught him by the feet. And Gehazi came near to thrust her away; but the man of God said, Let her alone, for her soul is bitter within her; and the 
2KI.4.28	Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?
2KI.4.29	Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand and go; if thou meet anyone, salute him not; and if anyone salutes thee, answer him not again, and lay my staff upon the face of the child.
2KI.4.30	Then the mother of the child said, As the 
2KI.4.31	And Gehazi had gone on before them and had laid the staff upon the face of the child, but there was neither voice, nor attention. Therefore he went again to meet him and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.
2KI.4.32	And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was laid dead upon his bed.
2KI.4.33	He went in therefore and shut the door upon both of them and prayed unto the 
2KI.4.34	Then he went up and lay upon the child and put his mouth upon his mouth and his eyes upon his eyes and his hands upon his hands; thus he stretched himself upon the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.
2KI.4.35	Then he returned and walked through the house to and fro and went up and stretched himself upon him again; and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.
2KI.4.36	And he called Gehazi and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And as she was coming in unto him, he said, Take up thy son.
2KI.4.37	Then she entered in and fell at his feet and bowed herself to the ground and took up her son and went out.
2KI.4.38	And Elisha returned to Gilgal. Then there was a famine in the land; and the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, so he said unto his servant, Set on the great pot and make pottage for the sons of the prophets.
2KI.4.39	And one went out into the field to gather herbs and found a wild vine and gathered his lap full of wild grapes and came and shred them into the pot of pottage, for they knew them not.
2KI.4.40	So they poured out for the men to eat. And it came to pass, as they were eating of that pottage, that they cried out and said, O thou man of God, there is death in the pot. And they could not eat it.
2KI.4.41	But he said, Then bring meal. And he cast it into the pot, and he said, Pour out for the people that they may eat. And there was no evil thing in the pot.
2KI.4.42	Then a man came from Baalshalisha, who brought the man of God bread of the firstfruits, twenty loaves of barley, and full ears of wheat in the head. And he said, Give unto the people that they may eat.
2KI.4.43	And his minister said, How can I set this before one hundred men? He said again, Give the people, that they may eat, for thus hath the 
2KI.4.44	So he set it before them, and they ate, and some was left over, according to the word of the 
2KI.5.1	Now Naaman, captain of the host of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and in high esteem because by him the 
2KI.5.2	And the Syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid, and she waited on Naaman’s wife.
2KI.5.3	And she said unto her mistress, If my lord would ask the prophet that is in Samaria, he would remove his leprosy.
2KI.5.4	And Naaman went in and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus said the maid that is of the land of Israel.
2KI.5.5	And the king of Syria said, Go, depart, and I will send a letter unto the king of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver and six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of raiment.
2KI.5.6	And he also took the letter to the king of Israel, which said, Now when this letter is come unto thee, behold, I have therewith sent Naaman, my slave, to thee, that thou may remove his leprosy.
2KI.5.7	And when the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and said, Am I God, to kill and to give life, that this man sends unto me to remove the leprosy of this man? Therefore now consider and see how he seeks a quarrel against me.
2KI.5.8	And when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, Why hast thou rent thy clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel.
2KI.5.9	So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elisha.
2KI.5.10	And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall be restored, and thou shalt be clean.
2KI.5.11	But Naaman went away angry and said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the 
2KI.5.12	Are not Abana and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage.
2KI.5.13	Then his slaves came near and spoke unto him, and said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, would thou not have done it? How much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash and be clean?
2KI.5.14	Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.
2KI.5.15	And he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and came and stood before him, and he said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth, but in Israel. Now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing from thy slave.
2KI.5.16	But he said, As the 
2KI.5.17	Then Naaman said, Shall there not then, I pray thee, be given to thy slave two mules’ burden of earth? For from now on thy slave will offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods, but unto the 
2KI.5.18	In this thing may the 
2KI.5.19	And he said unto him, Go in peace. So he departed from him a little way.
2KI.5.20	But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, said, Behold, my master has spared Naaman, this Syrian, in not receiving at his hands that which he brought. As the 
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi followed after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him and said, Is there no peace?
2KI.5.22	And he said, Peace. My master has sent me, saying, Behold, even now two young men of the sons of the prophets came to me from Mount Ephraim; give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver and two changes of garments.
2KI.5.23	And Naaman said, If you wish take two talents. And he urged him and bound two talents of silver in two bags with two changes of garments and laid them upon two of his servants; and they bore them before him.
2KI.5.24	And when he came to a secret place, he took them from their hand and bestowed them in the house; and he let the men go, and they departed.
2KI.5.25	But when he went in and stood before his master, Elisha said unto him, From where comest thou, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went nowhere.
2KI.5.26	Then he said unto him, Did not my heart go with thee when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is it a time to receive money and to receive garments and oliveyards and vineyards and sheep and oxen and menslaves and maidslaves?
2KI.5.27	The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee and unto thy seed for ever. And he went out from his presence a leper as white as snow.
2KI.6.1	The sons of the prophets said unto Elisha, Behold now, the place where we dwell with thee is too tight for us.
2KI.6.2	Let us go, we pray thee, unto the Jordan, and each one take a beam from there, and let us make us a place there where we may dwell. And he answered, Go.
2KI.6.3	And one said, Be content, I pray thee, and go with thy slaves. And he answered, I will go.
2KI.6.4	So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down the wood.
2KI.6.5	But as one was felling a beam, the axe head fell into the water, and he cried and said, Alas, master! It was borrowed.
2KI.6.6	And the man of God said, Where did it fall? And he showed him the place. Then he cut down a stick and cast it in there and caused the iron to swim.
2KI.6.7	And he said unto him, Take it. And he put out his hand and took it.
2KI.6.8	Then the king of Syria warred against Israel and took counsel with his slaves, saying, In such and such a place shall be my camp.
2KI.6.9	And the man of God sent unto the king of Israel, saying, Beware to not pass through such and such a place, for the Syrians are going there.
2KI.6.10	Then the king of Israel sent to the place, which the man of God told him and warned him of and kept himself from there, not once nor twice.
2KI.6.11	Therefore, the heart of the king of Syria was sore troubled over this thing, and he called his slaves and said unto them, Will ye not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?
2KI.6.12	Then one of his slaves said, None, my lord, O king, but Elisha, the prophet that is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that thou speakest in thy bedchamber.
2KI.6.13	And he said, Go and spy where he is, that I may send and take him. And it was told him, saying, Behold, he is in Dothan.
2KI.6.14	So he sent horsemen and chariots there and a great host, who came by night and compassed the city about.
2KI.6.15	And when the servant of the man of God was risen early to go forth, behold, a host compassed the city both with horsemen and chariots. And his servant said unto him, Alas, my master! What shall we do?
2KI.6.16	And he answered, Fear not; for those that are with us are more than those that are with them.
2KI.6.17	And Elisha prayed and said, 
2KI.6.18	And when the Syrians came down to him, Elisha prayed unto the 
2KI.6.19	And Elisha said unto them, This is not the way, neither is this the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom ye seek. And he led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	And when they came into Samaria, Elisha said, 
2KI.6.21	And the king of Israel said unto Elisha, when he saw them, My father, shall I smite them? Shall I smite them?
2KI.6.22	And he answered, Thou shalt not smite them; would thou smite those whom thou hast taken captive with thy sword and with thy bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and return to their master.
2KI.6.23	And he prepared great provision for them; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. So the bands of Syria came no more into the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad, king of Syria, gathered all his host and went up and besieged Samaria.
2KI.6.25	And there was a great famine in Samaria as they besieged it until an ass’s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver and the fourth part of a cab of dove’s dung for five pieces of silver.
2KI.6.26	And as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, a woman cried unto him, saying, Save me, my lord, O king.
2KI.6.27	And he said, If the 
2KI.6.28	And the king said unto her, What ails thee? And she answered, This woman said unto me, Give thy son that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.
2KI.6.29	So we boiled my son and ate him. And I said unto her on the next day, Give thy son that we may eat him. But she has hid her son.
2KI.6.30	And when the king heard the words of the woman, he rent his clothes; and he passed by like this upon the wall, and the people looked, and, behold, he had sackcloth within upon his flesh.
2KI.6.31	Then he said, God do so and more also to me, if the head of Elisha, the son of Shaphat, shall remain upon him today.
2KI.6.32	And Elisha sat in his house, and the elders sat with him; and the king sent a man unto him. But before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, See ye how this son of a murderer has sent to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door; is not the sound of his master’s feet behind him?
2KI.6.33	And while he yet talked with them, behold, the messenger came down unto him; and he said, Behold, this evil is of the 
2KI.7.1	Then Elisha said, Hear ye the word of the 
2KI.7.2	Then a captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, Behold, if the 
2KI.7.3	And there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate, who said one to another, Why shall we stay here until we die?
2KI.7.4	If we say, We will enter into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we stay here, we shall die also. Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the host of the Syrians; if they save us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die.
2KI.7.5	And they rose up at the beginning of the night, to go unto the camp of the Syrians; and when they were come to the uttermost part of the camp of Syria, behold, there was no man there.
2KI.7.6	For the Lord had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host; and they said one to another, Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians, to come upon us.
2KI.7.7	Therefore they had arisen and fled at the beginning of the night and had left their tents and their horses and their asses, even the camp as it was, and had fled for their lives.
2KI.7.8	And when these lepers came to the uttermost part of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank and took silver and gold and raiment and went and hid it and came again and entered into another tent and took from there also and went and hid it.
2KI.7.9	Then they said one to another, We do not well; this day is a day to give good tidings, and we are silent; if we tarry until the morning light, we shall be taken in the iniquity. Now, therefore, come, that we may enter in and give the news in the king’s house.
2KI.7.10	So they came and called unto the porter of the city, and they told them, saying, We went to the camp of the Syrians, and, behold, there was no man there, neither voice of man, but horses tied and asses tied, and the tents as they were.
2KI.7.11	And the porters cried out and told it inside and in the king’s house.
2KI.7.12	And the king arose in the night and said unto his slaves, I will now show you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore, they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive and get into the city.
2KI.7.13	Then one of his slaves answered and said, Let some take, I pray thee, five of the horses that remain, which are left in the city (for they are as all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; they are also as all the multitude of the Israelites that are consumed) and let us send and see.
2KI.7.14	They took, therefore, two chariot horses; and the king sent after the camp of the Syrians, saying, Go and see.
2KI.7.15	And they went after them unto the Jordan; and, behold, all the way was full of garments and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away in their haste. And the messengers returned and told the king.
2KI.7.16	Then the people went out and spoiled the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine flour was sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the 
2KI.7.17	And the king appointed the prince on whose hand he leaned to have the charge of the gate; and the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died, as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
2KI.7.18	And it came to pass as the man of God had spoken to the king, saying, Two measures of barley for a shekel, and a measure of fine flour for a shekel shall be tomorrow about this time in the gate of Samaria.
2KI.7.19	Unto which that prince had answered the man of God, and said, Even if the 
2KI.7.20	And so it happened unto him, for the people trode upon him in the gate, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Then Elisha spoke unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household and sojourn wherever thou canst sojourn; for the 
2KI.8.2	Then the woman arose and did as the man of God told her; and she went with her household and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years.
2KI.8.3	And it came to pass at the end of the seven years that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines, and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her lands.
2KI.8.4	And the king had talked with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha has done.
2KI.8.5	And as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. So Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life.
2KI.8.6	And when the king asked the woman, she told him. Then the king appointed unto her a eunuch, saying, Restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the lands since the day that she left the lands, even until now.
2KI.8.7	Elisha went to Damascus; and Benhadad, the king of Syria, was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come here.
2KI.8.8	And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thy hand, and go, meet the man of God and enquire of the 
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet him and took a present with him, even of every good thing of Damascus, forty camels’ burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad, king of Syria, has sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease?
2KI.8.10	And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou may certainly recover. But the 
2KI.8.11	And he settled his countenance steadfastly, until he was ashamed; and the man of God wept.
2KI.8.12	Then Hazael said unto him, Why does my lord weep? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the sons of Israel; their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword and wilt dash their children and rip up their women with child.
2KI.8.13	And Hazael said, But what, is thy slave a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The 
2KI.8.14	So he departed from Elisha and came to his master; who said to him, What did Elisha say to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou may surely recover.
2KI.8.15	And it came to pass on the next day that he took a thick cloth and dipped it in water and spread it on his face so that he died; and Hazael reigned in his stead.
2KI.8.16	And in the fifth year of Joram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah, Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, began to reign.
2KI.8.17	He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2KI.8.18	He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, as did the house of Ahab, for the daughter of Ahab was his wife, and he did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.19	Yet with all this, the 
2KI.8.20	In his days, Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah and made a king over themselves.
2KI.8.21	So Joram went over to Zair and all his chariots with him, and he rose up by night and smote the Edomites, who had compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots; and the people fled into their tents.
2KI.8.22	Yet Edom revolted from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time.
2KI.8.23	And the rest of the acts of Joram and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.8.24	And Joram slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, and Ahaziah, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.8.25	In the twelfth year of Joram, the son of Ahab king of Israel, Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, began to reign.
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri, king of Israel.
2KI.8.27	And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab and did evil in the sight of the 
2KI.8.28	And he went with Joram, the son of Ahab, to the war against Hazael, king of Syria, in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram.
2KI.8.29	And King Joram went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael, king of Syria. And Ahaziah, the son of Jehoram king of Judah, went down to see Joram, the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.
2KI.9.1	Then Elisha, the prophet, called one of the sons of the prophets and said unto him, Gird up thy loins and take this flask of oil in thy hand and go to Ramothgilead.
2KI.9.2	And when thou comest there, thou shalt see Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, there; go in and make him arise up from among his brethren and take him to an inner chamber.
2KI.9.3	Then take the flask of oil and pour it on his head and say, Thus hath the 
2KI.9.4	So the young man, the servant of the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.
2KI.9.5	And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting, and he said, I have an errand to thee, O captain. And Jehu said, Unto which of all us? And he said, To thee, O captain.
2KI.9.6	And he arose and went into the house, and he poured the oil on his head and said unto him, Thus hath said the 
2KI.9.7	And thou shalt smite the house of Ahab, thy master, that I may avenge the blood of my slaves, the prophets, and the blood of all the slaves of the 
2KI.9.8	For the whole house of Ahab shall perish, and I will cut off from Ahab him that pisses against the wall, he that is shut up as well as he that is left in Israel.
2KI.9.9	And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha, the son of Ahijah.
2KI.9.10	And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be no one to bury her. And he opened the door and fled.
2KI.9.11	Then Jehu came forth to the slaves of his lord, and one said unto him, Is there peace? Why did this mad fellow come to thee? And he said unto them, Ye know the man and his communication.
2KI.9.12	And they said, We know not; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus he spoke unto me, saying, Thus hath the 
2KI.9.13	Then they hastened, and each man took his garment, and put it under him in a high throne, and blew the shofar, saying, Jehu is king.
2KI.9.14	So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, conspired against Joram. (Now Joram was keeping Ramothgilead, with all Israel, because of Hazael, king of Syria.
2KI.9.15	But King Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael, king of Syria.) And Jehu said, If it is your desire, then do not let anyone go forth nor escape out of the city to tell the news in Jezreel.
2KI.9.16	So Jehu rode and went to Jezreel, for Joram lay there. And Ahaziah, king of Judah, was come down to see Joram.
2KI.9.17	And the watchman, who stood in the tower of Jezreel, spied the company of Jehu as he came and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take a horseman and send to meet them and let him say unto them, Is there peace?
2KI.9.18	So one on horseback went to meet him and said, Thus saith the king, Is there peace? And Jehu said, What hast thou to do with peace? Turn behind me. And the watchman gave notice, saying, The messenger came to them, but he does not return.
2KI.9.19	Then he sent out another on horseback, who came to them, and said, Thus saith the king, Is there peace? And Jehu answered, What hast thou to do with peace? Turn behind me.
2KI.9.20	And the watchman gave notice again, saying, He also came unto them and does not return, and the pace of him who is coming is like the pace of Jehu, the son of Nimshi, for he comes impetuously.
2KI.9.21	And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram, king of Israel, and Ahaziah, king of Judah, went out, each in his chariot, and they went out to meet Jehu and found him in the portion of Naboth of Jezreel.
2KI.9.22	And when Joram saw Jehu, he said, Is there peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the fornications of thy mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?
2KI.9.23	Then Joram turned his hands and fled and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.
2KI.9.24	But Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.
2KI.9.25	Then said Jehu to Bidkar, his captain, Take him and cast him in the edge of the portion of the field of Naboth of Jezreel. Remember that when thou and I went together after Ahab, his father, the 
2KI.9.26	Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth and the blood of his sons, said the 
2KI.9.27	But when Ahaziah, the king of Judah, saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the ascent to Gur, which is by Ibleam. And he fled to Megiddo and died there.
2KI.9.28	And his slaves carried him to Jerusalem and buried him in his sepulchre with his fathers in the city of David.
2KI.9.29	In the eleventh year of Joram, the son of Ahab, Ahaziah began to reign over Judah.
2KI.9.30	And Jehu came to Jezreel, and when Jezebel heard of it, she painted her face and tired her head and looked out of a window.
2KI.9.31	And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?
2KI.9.32	And he lifted up his face to the window and said, Who is on my side? Who? And two or three eunuchs looked at him.
2KI.9.33	And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down, and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall and on the horses; and he trode her under foot.
2KI.9.34	And he entered in, and after he ate and drank, he said, Go, see now this cursed woman and bury her; for after all she is a king’s daughter.
2KI.9.35	But when they went to bury her, they found no more of her than the skull and the feet and the palms of her hands.
2KI.9.36	And they returned and told him. And he said, This is the word of the 
2KI.9.37	And the carcase of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel so that no one shall be able to say, This is Jezebel.
2KI.10.1	And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters and sent to Samaria unto the princes of Jezreel, to the elders, and to those that brought up Ahab’s children, saying,
2KI.10.2	Now as soon as this letter comes to you, unto those who have your master’s sons and who have chariots and horsemen and who have the arms and munitions of the city,
2KI.10.3	see which is the best and most upright of your master’s sons and set him on his father’s throne and fight for your master’s house.
2KI.10.4	But they were exceedingly afraid and said, Behold, two kings could not stand before him; how then shall we stand?
2KI.10.5	And he that was over the house and he that was over the city, the elders also, and those who had brought up the children sent to Jehu, saying, We are thy slaves and will do all that thou shalt bid us; we will not make any king; thou shalt do that which is good in thy eyes.
2KI.10.6	Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If ye are mine and if ye will hearken unto my voice, take the heads of the male sons of your master and come to me to Jezreel by tomorrow this time. Now the king’s sons, being seventy males, were with the great men of the city, who had brought them up.
2KI.10.7	And when the letter came to them, they took the king’s sons and slew seventy males and put their heads in baskets and sent him them to Jezreel.
2KI.10.8	And a messenger came and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king’s sons. And he said, Lay them in two heaps at the entrance of the gate until the morning.
2KI.10.9	And in the morning, he went out and stood and said to all the people, Ye are righteous; behold, I conspired against my master and slew him; but who slew all these?
2KI.10.10	Know now that of the word of the 
2KI.10.11	So Jehu slew all that had remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men and all his kinsfolk and all his priests until he left him none remaining.
2KI.10.12	And he arose and departed and came to Samaria. And as he was at a pastor’s shearing house in the way,
2KI.10.13	Jehu met with the brethren of Ahaziah, king of Judah, and said, Who are ye? And they answered, We are the brethren of Ahaziah, and we go down to salute the sons of the king and the sons of the queen.
2KI.10.14	So he said, Take them alive. And after they took them alive, they slew them at the well of the shearing house, forty-two men, without leaving any of them.
2KI.10.15	And when he had departed from there, he met Jehonadab, the son of Rechab; and after he saluted him, he said to him, Is thy heart right as my heart is with thy heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it is, give me thy hand. And he gave him his hand, and he took him up to him into the chariot.
2KI.10.16	And he said, Come with me, and thou shalt see my zeal for the 
2KI.10.17	And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that had remained of Ahab in Samaria, until he had completely destroyed him, according to the word of the 
2KI.10.18	And Jehu gathered all the people together and said unto them, Ahab served Baal a little but Jehu shall serve him much.
2KI.10.19	Now, therefore, call unto me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let no one be lacking, for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whoever is lacking shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtilty to the intent that he might destroy those that served Baal.
2KI.10.20	And Jehu said, Sanctify a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.
2KI.10.21	And Jehu sent through all Israel, and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was no one lacking that did not come. And they came into the house of Baal, and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.
2KI.10.22	And he said to the one that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all those that served Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.
2KI.10.23	And Jehu went with Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal and said unto the servants of Baal, Search and make sure that none of the slaves of the 
2KI.10.24	And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu put eighty men outside and said, Whoever leaves alive any of the men whom I have brought into your hands, his life shall be for that of the other.
2KI.10.25	And after they had finished offering the burnt offering, Jehu said to those of his guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none escape. And they smote them with the edge of the sword, and the guard and the captains left them where they fell and went to the city of the house of Baal,
2KI.10.26	and they removed the images out of the house of Baal and burned them.
2KI.10.27	And they broke down the image of Baal and broke down the house of Baal and made it a latrine unto this day.
2KI.10.28	Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.
2KI.10.29	However with all this, Jehu did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin with the golden calves that were in Bethel and in Dan.
2KI.10.30	And the 
2KI.10.31	But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the 
2KI.10.32	In those days the 
2KI.10.33	from the Jordan toward the rising of the sun, all the land of Gilead, of Gad, of Reuben, and of Manasses, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, to Gilead and to Bashan.
2KI.10.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehu and all that he did and all his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.10.35	And Jehu slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria. And Jehoahaz, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.10.36	The time that Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria was twenty-eight years.
2KI.11.1	And Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, seeing that her son was dead, arose and destroyed all the royal seed.
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, the daughter of king Joram, sister of Ahaziah, took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons which were slain; and they hid him, even him and his nurse, in the bedchamber from Athaliah, so that he was not slain.
2KI.11.3	And he was with her hid in the house of the 
2KI.11.4	But the seventh year Jehoiada sent and took rulers over hundreds, captains and people of the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the 
2KI.11.5	And he commanded them, saying, This is the thing that ye shall do; a third part of you that shall enter in on the sabbath shall be the keepers of the watch of the king’s house;
2KI.11.6	and a third part shall be at the gate of Sur; {Heb. turning aside}; and a third part at the gate behind the guard; so ye shall have the watch of the house of Mesah. {Heb. broken down}
2KI.11.7	And two parts of all you that go forth on the sabbath, even they shall keep the watch of the house of the 
2KI.11.8	And ye shall compass the king round about, each man with his weapons in his hand; and he that comes within these orders shall be slain. Ye must be with the king as he goes out and as he comes in.
2KI.11.9	And the captains over the hundreds did according to all that Jehoiada, the priest, commanded; and each man took his men that were to come in on the sabbath with those that should go out on the sabbath and came to Jehoiada, the priest.
2KI.11.10	And the priest gave the captains over hundreds King David’s spears and shields that were in the house of the 
2KI.11.11	And the guard stood, each man with his weapons in his hand, round about the king, from the right corner of the house to the left corner of the house, next to the altar and the house.
2KI.11.12	Then he brought forth the king’s son and put the crown upon him and gave him the testimony, and they made him king by anointing him; and they clapped their hands and said, Long live the king.
2KI.11.13	And when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running, she came to the people into the house of the 
2KI.11.14	and when she looked, behold, the king stood by the pillar, as was his right, and the princes and the trumpeters by the king, and all the people of the land rejoiced and blew with trumpets. Then Athaliah rent her clothes and cried, Treason, Treason.
2KI.11.15	Then Jehoiada, the priest, commanded the captains of the hundreds that governed the host and said unto them, Take her forth outside the order of the house and kill with the sword any that follow her. (For the priest had said, Let her not be slain in the house of the 
2KI.11.16	And they laid hands on her, and she went by the way by which the horsemen enter into the king’s house, and there she was slain.
2KI.11.17	Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the 
2KI.11.18	And all the people of the land went into the house of Baal and broke it down; his altars and his images they broke in pieces thoroughly and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars. And the priest appointed officers over the house of the 
2KI.11.19	And he took the rulers over hundreds and the captains and the guard and all the people of the land, and they brought down the king from the house of the 
2KI.11.20	And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was at rest after they slew Athaliah with the sword beside the king’s house.
2KI.11.21	Jehoash was seven years old when he began to reign.
2KI.12.1	In the seventh year of Jehu, Jehoash began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
2KI.12.2	And Jehoash did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.12.3	But with all this, the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.
2KI.12.4	And Jehoash said to the priests, All the money of the sanctified things that is brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.5	let the priests receive it, each man of his kinsmen; and let them repair the breaches of the house, wherever any breach shall be found.
2KI.12.6	But it was so that, in the year twenty-three of King Jehoash, the priests had not repaired the breaches of the house.
2KI.12.7	Then King Jehoash called for Jehoiada, the priest, and the other priests and said unto them, Why do ye not repair the breaches of the house? Now, therefore, receive no more money of your kinsmen, but deliver it to repair the breaches of the house.
2KI.12.8	And the priests consented to receive no more money from the people, neither to be responsible to repair the breaches of the house.
2KI.12.9	Then Jehoiada, the priest, took an ark and bored a hole in the lid of it and set it beside the altar, on the right side of the entrance to the house of the 
2KI.12.10	And when they saw that there was much money in the ark, the king’s scribe and the high priest came up and counted the money that was found in the house of the 
2KI.12.11	And they gave sufficient money into the hands of those that did the work and of those that had the responsibility of the house of the 
2KI.12.12	and to the masons and hewers of stone and to buy timber and hewed stone to repair the breaches of the house of the 
2KI.12.13	But of that money that was brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.14	because they gave it to the workmen and repaired the house of the 
2KI.12.15	Moreover they did not require accounts from the men into whose hands they delivered the money to be bestowed on workmen, for they dealt faithfully.
2KI.12.16	The guilt money and sin money was not brought into the house of the 
2KI.12.17	Then Hazael, king of Syria, went up, and fought against Gath and took it; and Hazael set his face to go up against Jerusalem.
2KI.12.18	And Jehoash, king of Judah, took all the holy things that Jehoshaphat and Jehoram and Ahaziah, his fathers, kings of Judah, had dedicated and his own holy things and all the gold that was found in the treasury of the house of the 
2KI.12.19	And the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.12.20	And his slaves arose and made a conspiracy and slew Joash in the house of Millo, as he was going down to Silla.
2KI.12.21	For Jozachar, the son of Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of Shomer, his slaves, smote him, and he died; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David; and Amaziah, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.13.1	In the year twenty-three of Joash, the son of Ahaziah, king of Judah, Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, began to reign over Israel in Samaria and reigned seventeen years.
2KI.13.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.13.3	And the anger of the 
2KI.13.4	But Jehoahaz grieved before the 
2KI.13.5	(And the 
2KI.13.6	With all this, they did not depart from the sins of the house of Jeroboam, who made Israel sin, but walked in them; and the grove also remained in Samaria.)
2KI.13.7	Neither did he leave of the people to Jehoahaz but fifty horsemen and ten chariots and ten thousand footmen, for the king of Syria had destroyed them, and had made them like dust to be tread upon.
2KI.13.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoahaz and all that he did and his might, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.13.9	And Jehoahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in Samaria; and Joash, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.13.10	In the year thirty-seven of Joash, king of Judah, Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, began to reign over Israel in Samaria and reigned sixteen years.
2KI.13.11	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.13.12	And the rest of the acts of Joash and all that he did, and his might with which he fought against Amaziah, king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.13.13	And Joash slept with his fathers, and Jeroboam sat upon his throne; and Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2KI.13.14	Now Elisha was fallen sick of his sickness of which he died. And Joash the king of Israel came down unto him, and wept over his face, and said, O my father, my father, the chariots of Israel, and the horsemen thereof!
2KI.13.15	And Elisha said unto him, Take the bow and the arrows. And he took unto him the bow and the arrows.
2KI.13.16	And he said to the king of Israel, Put thy hand upon the bow. And he put his hand upon it; and Elisha put his hands upon the king’s hands.
2KI.13.17	And he said, Open the window towards the east. And when he opened it Elisha said, Shoot. And he shot. And he said, The arrow of the 
2KI.13.18	And he said again, Take the arrows. And he took them. Then he said to the king of Israel, Smite upon the ground. And he smote three times, and stopped.
2KI.13.19	Then the man of God was angry with him, and said, If thou would have smitten five or six times; then thou would have smitten Syria until thou had consumed it; whereas now thou shalt smite Syria three times.
2KI.13.20	And Elisha died, and they buried him. And the bands of the Moabites invaded the land at the coming in of the year.
2KI.13.21	And it came to pass, as they were burying a man, that, behold, they spied a band of men; and they cast the man into the sepulchre of Elisha; and when the dead man touched the bones of Elisha, he revived, and stood up on his feet.
2KI.13.22	So Hazael king of Syria oppressed Israel all the days of Jehoahaz.
2KI.13.23	But the 
2KI.13.24	And Hazael king of Syria died; and Benhadad his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.13.25	And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz, his father, by war. Three times did Joash smite him, and he recovered the cities of Israel.
2KI.14.1	In the second year of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, began to reign.
2KI.14.2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign and reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
2KI.14.3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.14.4	With all this, the high places were not taken away; as yet the people sacrificed and burnt incense on the high places.
2KI.14.5	And as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, he slew his slaves which had slain the king, his father.
2KI.14.6	But the sons of those who had slain him he slew not; according unto that which is written in the book of the law of Moses where the 
2KI.14.7	He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand and took Selah by war and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day.
2KI.14.8	Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz, son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us look each other in the face.
2KI.14.9	And Jehoash, the king of Israel, sent to Amaziah, king of Judah, this reply, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife. And the wild beasts that were in Lebanon passed by and trode down the thistle.
2KI.14.10	Thou hast indeed smitten Edom, and thy heart has lifted thee up; glory in this, but tarry at home. Why should thou meddle in evil that thou should fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash, king of Israel, went up; and he and Amaziah, king of Judah, looked each other in the face at Bethshemesh, which is in Judah.
2KI.14.12	But Judah fell before Israel, and they fled each man to their tents.
2KI.14.13	Furthermore, Jehoash, king of Israel, took Amaziah, king of Judah, the son of Jehoash, the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh and came to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2KI.14.14	And he took all the gold and silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of the 
2KI.14.15	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash, which he did, and his might and how he fought with Amaziah, king of Judah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.14.16	And Jehoash slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel; and Jeroboam, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.14.17	And Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived after the death of Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, fifteen years.
2KI.14.18	And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.14.19	Now they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish and slew him there.
2KI.14.20	And they brought him on horses, and he was buried at Jerusalem with his fathers in the city of David.
2KI.14.21	Then all the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah.
2KI.14.22	He built Elath and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
2KI.14.23	In the fifteenth year of Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel, began to reign in Samaria and reigned forty-one years.
2KI.14.24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.14.25	He restored the borders of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the 
2KI.14.26	For the 
2KI.14.27	and the 
2KI.14.28	Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam and all that he did and his might, how he warred and how he recovered Damascus and Hamath to Judah in Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.14.29	And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, with the kings of Israel, and Zachariah, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.1	In the year twenty-seven of Jeroboam, king of Israel, Azariah, son of Amaziah, king of Judah, began to reign.
2KI.15.2	He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jecholiah of Jerusalem.
2KI.15.3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.15.4	But with all this, the high places were not removed; the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places.
2KI.15.5	And the 
2KI.15.6	And the rest of the acts of Azariah and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.15.7	So Azariah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David; and Jotham, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.8	In the year thirty-eight of Azariah, king of Judah, Zachariah, the son of Jeroboam, began to reign over Israel in Samaria six months.
2KI.15.9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.10	And Shallum, the son of Jabesh, conspired against him, and smote him before the people and slew him, and reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.11	And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.12	This was the word of the 
2KI.15.13	Shallum, the son of Jabesh, began to reign in the year thirty-nine of Uzziah, king of Judah; and he reigned a full month in Samaria.
2KI.15.14	For Menahem, the son of Gadi, went up from Tirzah and came to Samaria and smote Shallum, the son of Jabesh, in Samaria and slew him and reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.15	And the rest of the acts of Shallum and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.16	Then Menahem smote Tiphsah and all that were therein and the borders thereof from Tirzah because they had not opened to him, therefore, he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up.
2KI.15.17	In the year thirty-nine of Azariah, king of Judah, Menahem, the son of Gadi, began to reign over Israel and reigned ten years in Samaria.
2KI.15.18	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.19	And Pul, the king of Assyria, came against the land; and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.
2KI.15.20	And Menahem exacted the money upon Israel, from all the mighty men of virtue, from each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back and did not stay there in the land.
2KI.15.21	And the rest of the acts of Menahem and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
2KI.15.22	And Menahem slept with his fathers, and Pekahiah, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.15.23	In the year fifty of Azariah, king of Judah, Pekahiah, the son of Menahem, began to reign over Israel in Samaria and reigned two years.
2KI.15.24	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.25	But Pekah, the son of Remaliah a captain of his, conspired against him and smote him in Samaria, in the palace of the king’s house, with Argob and Arieh and with him fifty men of the sons of Gilead; and he killed him and reigned in his place.
2KI.15.26	And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.27	In the year fifty-two of Azariah, king of Judah, Pekah, the son of Remaliah, began to reign over Israel in Samaria and reigned twenty years.
2KI.15.28	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.15.29	In the days of Pekah, king of Israel, came Tiglathpileser, king of Assyria, and took Ijon, Abelbethmaachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead, Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali and carried them captive to Assyria.
2KI.15.30	And Hosea, the son of Elah, made a conspiracy against Pekah, the son of Remaliah, and smote him and slew him and reigned in his stead, in the year twenty of Jotham, the son of Uzziah.
2KI.15.31	And the rest of the acts of Pekah and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.32	In the second year of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, began to reign.
2KI.15.33	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
2KI.15.34	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.15.35	With all this, the high places were not removed; the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the 
2KI.15.36	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.15.37	In those days the 
2KI.15.38	And Jotham slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David, his father; and Ahaz, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.16.1	In the year seventeen of Pekah, the son of Remaliah, Ahaz, the son of Jotham, king of Judah, began to reign.
2KI.16.2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem and did not do that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.16.3	But he walked in the way of the kings of Israel and even made his son pass through the fire, according to the abominations of the Gentiles, whom the 
2KI.16.4	Likewise he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places and on the hills and under every green tree.
2KI.16.5	Then Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem to war; and they besieged Ahaz but could not overcome him.
2KI.16.6	At that time Rezin, king of Syria, recovered Elath to Syria and drove the Jews from Elath; and the Syrians came to Elath and dwelt there unto this day.
2KI.16.7	So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser, king of Assyria, saying, I am thy slave and thy son; come up and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria and out of the hand of the king of Israel, who have risen up against me.
2KI.16.8	And Ahaz took the silver and gold that was found in the house of the 
2KI.16.9	And the king of Assyria hearkened unto him, for the king of Assyria went up against Damascus and took it and carried the people of it captive to Kir and slew Rezin.
2KI.16.10	And King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglathpileser, King of Assyria, and saw the altar that was at Damascus; and king Ahaz sent to Urijah, the priest, the fashion of the altar and the pattern of it, according to all the workmanship of it.
2KI.16.11	And Urijah, the priest, built an altar according to all that King Ahaz had sent from Damascus; so Urijah, the priest, made it while King Ahaz returned from Damascus.
2KI.16.12	And when the king was come from Damascus, the king saw the altar; and the king came near to the altar and offered upon it.
2KI.16.13	And he burnt his burnt offering and his present and poured his drink offering and sprinkled the blood of his peace offerings, next to the altar.
2KI.16.14	And the brasen altar which had been before the 
2KI.16.15	And King Ahaz commanded Urijah, the priest, saying, Upon the great altar burn the morning burnt offering and the evening present and the king’s burnt sacrifice and his present, and likewise the burnt offering of all the people of the land and their present and their drink offerings, and sprinkle upon it all the blood of the burnt offering and all the blood of the sacrifice; and the brasen altar shall be mine to enquire by.
2KI.16.16	Thus did Urijah, the priest, according to all that King Ahaz commanded him.
2KI.16.17	And King Ahaz cut off the borders of the bases and removed the lavers from off them and took down the sea from off the brasen oxen that were under it and put it upon a pavement of stones.
2KI.16.18	And the covert for the sabbath that they had built in the house and the king’s entry outside, he moved behind the house of the 
2KI.16.19	Now the rest of the acts of Ahaz which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.16.20	And Ahaz slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David; and Hezekiah, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.17.1	In the twelfth year of Ahaz, king of Judah, Hosea, the son of Elah, began to reign in Samaria over Israel nine years.
2KI.17.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.17.3	Against him came up Shalmaneser, king of Assyria; and Hosea became his slave and gave him presents.
2KI.17.4	And the king of Assyria found conspiracy in Hosea; for he had sent messengers to So, king of Egypt, and brought no present to the king of Assyria, as he had done year by year; therefore, the king of Assyria shut him up and bound him in prison.
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria came up throughout all the land and went up to Samaria and besieged it three years.
2KI.17.6	In the ninth year of Hosea, the king of Assyria took Samaria and carried Israel away into Assyria and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes.
2KI.17.7	For so it was that the sons of Israel had sinned against the 
2KI.17.8	and walked in the statutes of the Gentiles, whom the 
2KI.17.9	And the sons of Israel had secretly done those things that were not right against the 
2KI.17.10	And they had set themselves up images and groves in every high hill and under every green tree;
2KI.17.11	and there they burnt incense in all the high places like the Gentiles, whom the 
2KI.17.12	serving idols, of which the 
2KI.17.13	Yet the 
2KI.17.14	Notwithstanding, they would not hear, but hardened their necks, like to the neck of their fathers, who had never believed in the 
2KI.17.15	And they rejected his statutes and his covenant that he made with their fathers and his testimonies which he testified against them, and they followed vanity and became vain and went after the Gentiles that were round about them, concerning whom the 
2KI.17.16	And they left all the commandments of the 
2KI.17.17	and they caused their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire and used divination and enchantments and sold themselves to do evil in the sight of the 
2KI.17.18	Therefore, the 
2KI.17.19	But not even Judah kept the commandments of the 
2KI.17.20	And the 
2KI.17.21	For he rent Israel from the house of David, and they made Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, king; and Jeroboam drove Israel from following the 
2KI.17.22	For the sons of Israel walked in all the sins of Jeroboam which he did; they did not depart from them
2KI.17.23	until the 
2KI.17.24	And the king of Assyria brought Gentiles from Babylon and from Cuthah and from Ava and from Hamath and from Sepharvaim, and placed them in the cities of Samaria instead of the sons of Israel; and they possessed Samaria and dwelt in the cities thereof.
2KI.17.25	And so it was at the beginning of their dwelling there that they did not fear the 
2KI.17.26	Therefore, they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying, The Gentiles, which thou hast removed and placed in the cities of Samaria, do not know the judgment of the God of that land; therefore, he has sent lions among them, and, behold, they slay them because they do not know the judgment of the God of the land.
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, saying, Carry there one of the priests whom ye brought from there; and let them go and dwell there and teach them the judgment of the God of the land.
2KI.17.28	Then one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria came and dwelt in Bethel and taught them how they should fear the 
2KI.17.29	However each nation made gods of their own and put them in the houses of the high places which those of Samaria had made, each nation in their city in which they dwelt.
2KI.17.30	And the men of Babylon made Succothbenoth, and the men of Cuth made Nergal, and the men of Hamath made Ashima,
2KI.17.31	and the Avites made Nibhaz and Tartak, and the Sepharvites burnt their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim.
2KI.17.32	So they feared the 
2KI.17.33	They feared the 
2KI.17.34	Unto this day they do after the former manners; they do not fear the 
2KI.17.35	with whom the 
2KI.17.36	but only the 
2KI.17.37	And the statutes and rights and the law and the commandments, which he wrote for you, ye shall observe to do every day; and ye shall not fear other gods.
2KI.17.38	And the covenant that I have made with you ye shall not forget; neither shall ye fear other gods.
2KI.17.39	But the 
2KI.17.40	Howbeit they did not hearken; to the contrary they did after their former manner.
2KI.17.41	So these Gentiles feared the 
2KI.18.1	Now it came to pass in the third year of Hosea, son of Elah, king of Israel, that Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, king of Judah, began to reign.
2KI.18.2	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name also was Abi, the daughter of Zachariah.
2KI.18.3	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.18.4	He removed the high places and broke the images and cut down the groves and broke in pieces the brasen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days, the sons of Israel burned incense to it; and he called it Nehushtan. {Heb. a thing of brass}
2KI.18.5	He trusted in the 
2KI.18.6	For he cleaved unto the 
2KI.18.7	And the 
2KI.18.8	He smote the Philistines, even unto Gaza and the borders thereof, from the towers of the watchmen to the fenced city.
2KI.18.9	And in the fourth year of king Hezekiah, which was the seventh year of Hosea, son of Elah, king of Israel, Shalmaneser, king of Assyria, came up against Samaria and besieged it.
2KI.18.10	And at the end of three years, they took it; even in the sixth year of Hezekiah, that is the ninth year of Hosea, king of Israel, Samaria was taken.
2KI.18.11	And the king of Assyria carried away Israel unto Assyria and put them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan and in the cities of the Medes:
2KI.18.12	because they had not hearkened unto the voice of the 
2KI.18.13	Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the fenced cities of Judah and took them.
2KI.18.14	And Hezekiah, king of Judah, sent unto the king of Assyria to Lachish, saying, I have sinned; return from me; that which thou puttest on me I will bear. Then the king of Assyria appointed unto Hezekiah, king of Judah, three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold.
2KI.18.15	And Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the house of the 
2KI.18.16	At that time Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of the 
2KI.18.17	And the king of Assyria sent Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah with a great host against Jerusalem. And they went up and came to Jerusalem. And when they were come up, they came and stood by the conduit of the upper pool, which is in the highway of the washer’s field.
2KI.18.18	And they called the king, and Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna, the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the writer of chronicles went out to them.
2KI.18.19	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Speak ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which thou dost trust?
2KI.18.20	Thou sayest (but they are but vain words), I have counsel and strength for the war. Now on whom dost thou trust, that thou hast rebelled against me?
2KI.18.21	Now, behold, thou dost trust upon the staff of this bruised reed, even upon Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it; so is Pharaoh, king of Egypt unto all that trust in him.
2KI.18.22	But if ye say unto me, We trust in the 
2KI.18.23	Now therefore, I pray thee, give hostages unto my lord, the king of Assyria, and I will deliver thee two thousand horses, if thou art able on thy part to set riders upon them.
2KI.18.24	How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s slaves, even though thou dost trust in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
2KI.18.25	Furthermore, Have I now come up without the 
2KI.18.26	Then said Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, to thy slaves in the Syrian language, for we understand it, and do not talk with us in the Jews’ language in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
2KI.18.27	But Rabshakeh said unto them, Has my master sent me to thy master and to thee, to speak these words and not rather to the men who sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you?
2KI.18.28	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ language and spoke, saying, Hear the word of the great king, the king of Assyria.
2KI.18.29	Thus hath the king said, Let not Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you out of my hand.
2KI.18.30	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
2KI.18.31	Do not hearken unto Hezekiah, for thus saith the king of Assyria, Give me a blessing and come out to me, and then each one of you shall eat of their own vine and of their own fig tree, and each one shall drink the waters of their own well,
2KI.18.32	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of olives, of oil, and of honey, that ye may live, and not die. Do not hearken unto Hezekiah, for he deceives you, saying, The 
2KI.18.33	Peradventure have any of the gods of the Gentiles delivered his land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?
2KI.18.34	Where is the god of Hamath and of Arpad? Where is the god of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and of Ivah? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
2KI.18.35	What god out of all the gods of the lands has delivered their land out of my hand that the 
2KI.18.36	But the people remained silent and did not answer him a word, for the king had commanded, saying, Do not answer him.
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the household, and Shebna, the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the writer of chronicles, came to Hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
2KI.19.1	And when King Hezekiah heard it, he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the 
2KI.19.2	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah, the prophet, the son of Amoz,
2KI.19.3	to say unto him, Thus hath Hezekiah said, This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and blasphemy, for the sons are come to the place of breaking forth, and she that gives birth has no strength.
2KI.19.4	Peradventure, the 
2KI.19.5	So the slaves of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
2KI.19.6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus hath the 
2KI.19.7	Behold, I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a rumour and shall return to his own land, and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
2KI.19.8	So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he had departed from Lachish.
2KI.19.9	And when he heard it said of Tirhakah, king of Ethiopia, Behold, he is come out to fight against thee; he sent messengers again unto Hezekiah, saying,
2KI.19.10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah, king of Judah, saying, Let not thy God in whom thou dost trust deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
2KI.19.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands, by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be delivered?
2KI.19.12	Peradventure have the gods of the Gentiles delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the sons of Eden, who were in Thelasar?
2KI.19.13	Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivah?
2KI.19.14	And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of the 
2KI.19.15	And Hezekiah prayed before the 
2KI.19.16	Incline, O 
2KI.19.17	Of a truth, O 
2KI.19.18	and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood or stone; therefore, they have destroyed them.
2KI.19.19	Now, therefore, O 
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah, the son of Amoz, sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus hath the 
2KI.19.21	This is the word that the 
2KI.19.22	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? And against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel.
2KI.19.23	By the hand of thy messengers, thou hast reproached the Lord and hast said, With the multitude of my chariots I have come up to the height of the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon, and will cut down the tall cedar trees thereof and the choice fir trees thereof; and I will enter into the habitation of his borders and into the forest of his Carmel.
2KI.19.24	I have dug and drunk the waters of others, and with the sole of my feet I have dried up all the rivers of defended places.
2KI.19.25	Hast thou never heard that from a long time ago I made her, and from ancient times I have formed her? Now I have made her come, and it shall be to lay waste fenced cities into ruinous heaps.
2KI.19.26	Therefore their inhabitants’ hands were too short; dismayed and confounded, they shall be as the grass of the field and as the green herb, as the hay on the housetops, that is dried up before it comes to maturity.
2KI.19.27	But I know thy abode and thy going out and thy coming in and thy rage against me.
2KI.19.28	Because thou hast raged against me and thy tumult has come up into my ears, therefore, I will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou didst come.
2KI.19.29	And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such things as grow of themselves, and in the second year such things as grow again of themselves; and in the third year ye shall sow and reap and plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.
2KI.19.30	And that which has escaped, that which is left of the house of Judah, shall yet again take root downward and bear fruit upward.
2KI.19.31	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and deliverance out of Mount Zion; the zeal of the 
2KI.19.32	Therefore, thus saith the 
2KI.19.33	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not enter into this city, saith the 
2KI.19.34	For I will defend this city, to save it, for my own sake and for my slave David’s sake.
2KI.19.35	And it came to pass that night that the angel of the 
2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib, king of Assyria, departed and went and returned and dwelt at Nineveh.
2KI.19.37	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch, his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer, his sons, smote him with the sword and fled into the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.20.1	In those days Hezekiah became sick unto death. And the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, came to him and said unto him, Thus saith the 
2KI.20.2	Then he turned his face to the wall and prayed unto the 
2KI.20.3	I beseech thee, O 
2KI.20.4	And before Isaiah had gone out into the middle of the court, the word of the 
2KI.20.5	Turn again and tell Hezekiah, prince of my people, Thus saith the 
2KI.20.6	And I will add unto thy days fifteen years, and I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city for my own sake and for my slave David’s sake.
2KI.20.7	And Isaiah said, Take a lump of figs. And they took and laid it on the boil, and he recovered.
2KI.20.8	And Hezekiah had said unto Isaiah, What shall be the sign that the 
2KI.20.9	And Isaiah said, This sign shalt thou have of the 
2KI.20.10	And Hezekiah answered, It is an easy thing for the shadow to go down ten degrees, but not for the shadow to return backward ten degrees.
2KI.20.11	Then Isaiah, the prophet, cried unto the 
2KI.20.12	At that time Berodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and presents unto Hezekiah, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.
2KI.20.13	And Hezekiah hearkened unto them and showed them all the house of his precious things, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointment and all the house of his weapons and all that was found in his treasury; there was nothing in his house nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah, the prophet, came unto King Hezekiah and said unto him, What did these men say, and where did they come from unto thee? And Hezekiah replied, They are come from a far country, even from Babylon.
2KI.20.15	And he said, What have they seen in thy house? And Hezekiah answered, All the things that are in my house they have seen; there is nothing among my treasury that I have not showed them.
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said unto Hezekiah, Hear the word of the 
2KI.20.17	Behold, the days come that all that is in thy house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store unto this day shall be carried into Babylon; nothing shall be left, saith the 
2KI.20.18	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, they shall take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
2KI.20.19	Then Hezekiah said unto Isaiah, The word of the 
2KI.20.20	The rest of the acts of Hezekiah and all his might and how he made a pool and a conduit and brought water into the city, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.20.21	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and Manasseh, his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign and reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hephzibah.
2KI.21.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.3	For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah, his father, had destroyed, and he raised up altars for Baal and made a grove, as Ahab, king of Israel, had done; and he worshipped all the host of heaven and served those things.
2KI.21.4	Likewise, he built altars in the house of the 
2KI.21.5	And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the 
2KI.21.6	And he made his son pass through the fire and observed times and used enchantments and dealt with spiritists and diviners and multiplied much wickedness in the sight of the 
2KI.21.7	And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the 
2KI.21.8	neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers, only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them and according to all the law that my slave Moses commanded them.
2KI.21.9	But they did not hearken, and Manasseh caused them to err and to do more evil than did the Gentiles whom the 
2KI.21.10	And the 
2KI.21.11	Because Manasseh, king of Judah, has done these abominations and has done more evil than all that the Amorites did, who were before him and has also made Judah sin with his idols;
2KI.21.12	therefore, thus saith the 
2KI.21.13	And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and the plummet of the house of Ahab; and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down.
2KI.21.14	And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and deliver them into the hand of their enemies, and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies
2KI.21.15	because they have done that which was evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even unto this day.
2KI.21.16	Moreover, Manasseh shed innocent blood very much until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another besides his sin with which he made Judah sin so that they would do that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.17	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh and all that he did and his sin with which he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.21.18	And Manasseh slept with his fathers and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza; and Amon his son reigned in his stead.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.
2KI.21.20	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.21.21	And he walked in all the way that his father walked in and served the idols that his father had served and worshipped them;
2KI.21.22	and he forsook the 
2KI.21.23	And the slaves of Amon conspired against him and slew the king in his own house.
2KI.21.24	Then the people of the land slew all those that had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah, his son, king in his stead.
2KI.21.25	Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.21.26	And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza, and Josiah, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.
2KI.22.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2KI.22.3	And in the year eighteen of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the 
2KI.22.4	Go up to Hilkiah, the high priest, that he may sum the silver which has been brought into the house of the 
2KI.22.5	and let them deliver it into the hands of those that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.6	unto carpenters and builders and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house;
2KI.22.7	and there is to be no accounting required of those unto whom the money is delivered because they deal faithfully.
2KI.22.8	Then Hilkiah, the high priest, said unto Shaphan, the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2KI.22.9	And Shaphan, the scribe, came to the king and brought the king word again and said, Thy slaves have gathered the money that was found in the house and have delivered it into the hand of those that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the 
2KI.22.10	Likewise, Shaphan, the scribe, declared unto the king, saying, Hilkiah, the priest, has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.
2KI.22.11	And when the king heard the words of the book of the law, he rent his clothes.
2KI.22.12	And the king commanded Hilkiah, the priest, and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Achbor, the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan, the scribe, and Asahiah, a slave of the king’s, saying,
2KI.22.13	Go and enquire of the 
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah, the priest, and Ahikam and Achbor and Shaphan and Asahiah went unto Huldah, the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe, who dwelt in Jerusalem in the house of doctrine; and they spoke with her.
2KI.22.15	And she said unto them, Thus saith the 
2KI.22.16	Thus saith the 
2KI.22.17	because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore, my wrath is kindled against this place and shall not be quenched.
2KI.22.18	But to the king of Judah who sent you to enquire of the 
2KI.22.19	and thy heart became tender, and thou hast humbled thyself before the 
2KI.22.20	Behold, therefore, I will gather thee unto thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered into thy grave in peace, and thine eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place. And they brought the king word again.
2KI.23.1	And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of Judah and of Jerusalem.
2KI.23.2	And the king went up into the house of the 
2KI.23.3	And the king stood by the pillar and made a covenant before the 
2KI.23.4	And the king commanded Hilkiah, the high priest, and the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the 
2KI.23.5	And he put down the religious persons whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places round about Jerusalem; likewise, those that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.
2KI.23.6	And he brought out the graven image of the grove from the house of the 
2KI.23.7	He likewise broke down the houses of the male cult prostitutes that were by the house of the 
2KI.23.8	And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba, and broke down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which were on a man’s left hand at the gate of the city.
2KI.23.9	Nevertheless, the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the 
2KI.23.10	And he defiled Tophet, which is in the valley of the sons of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.
2KI.23.11	And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the 
2KI.23.12	And the king cast down the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the 
2KI.23.13	Likewise, the king defiled the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon, the king of Israel, had built unto Ashtoreth, the abomination of the Zidonians, and unto Chemosh, the abomination of the Moabites, and unto Milcom, the abomination of the sons of Ammon.
2KI.23.14	And he broke the images in pieces and cut down the groves and filled their places with the bones of men.
2KI.23.15	Likewise, the altar that was at Bethel and the high place which Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, who caused Israel to sin, had made: both that altar and the high place he broke down and burned the high place and stamped it small to powder and burned the grove.
2KI.23.16	And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount and sent and took the bones out of the sepulchres and burned them upon the altar and polluted it, according to the word of the 
2KI.23.17	Then he said, What title is this that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, who came from Judah and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of Bethel.
2KI.23.18	And he said, Let him alone; let no one move his bones. So his bones were saved along with the bones of the prophet that had come out of Samaria.
2KI.23.19	And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the 
2KI.23.20	And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars and burned men’s bones upon them and returned to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.21	Then the king commanded all the people, saying, Make the passover unto the 
2KI.23.22	Such a passover had not been made since the days of the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah.
2KI.23.23	In the year eighteen of King Josiah, this passover was made unto the 
2KI.23.24	In the same manner Josiah burned the spiritists, the diviners, the teraphim, the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had found in the house of the 
2KI.23.25	There was no king before him that converted like this to the 
2KI.23.26	Even with all this the 
2KI.23.27	And the 
2KI.23.28	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.23.29	In his days Pharaohnechoh, king of Egypt, went up against the king of Assyria to the river Euphrates; and King Josiah went against him; but as soon as he saw him, he slew him at Megiddo.
2KI.23.30	And his slaves carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo and brought him to Jerusalem and buried him in his own sepulchre. Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, and anointed him and made him king in his father’s stead.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2KI.23.32	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.23.33	And Pharaohnechoh put him in bonds at Riblah in the land of Hamath, as he was reigning in Jerusalem; and put the land to a tribute of one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
2KI.23.34	Then Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim, the son of Josiah, king in the place of Josiah his father and changed his name to Jehoiakim and took Jehoahaz and carried him to Egypt, and he died there.
2KI.23.35	And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh, but he caused the land to be valued to give this money according to the commandment of Pharaoh; he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of each one according to the estimation of his worth, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh.
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.
2KI.23.37	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.1	In his time Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up, and Jehoiakim became his slave three years; then he turned and rebelled against him.
2KI.24.2	And the 
2KI.24.3	Surely at the commandment of the 
2KI.24.4	and also for the innocent blood that he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, which the 
2KI.24.5	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
2KI.24.6	So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers, and Jehoiachin, his son, reigned in his stead.
2KI.24.7	And the king of Egypt never came out of his land again, for the king of Babylon had taken all that pertained to the king of Egypt from the river of Egypt unto the river Euphrates.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother’s name was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.
2KI.24.9	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.10	At that time the slaves of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.
2KI.24.11	Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, also came against the city when his slaves had besieged it.
2KI.24.12	So Jehoiachin, the king of Judah, went out to the king of Babylon, he and his mother and his slaves and his princes and his eunuchs; and the king of Babylon took him in the eighth year of his reign.
2KI.24.13	And he carried out of there all the treasures of the house of the 
2KI.24.14	And he carried away all Jerusalem and all the princes and all the mighty men of valour, ten thousand captives, and all the craftsmen and smiths; none remained except the poorest sort of the people of the land.
2KI.24.15	He likewise carried Jehoiachin away to Babylon and the king’s mother and the king’s wives and his officers, and the mighty of the land; he carried them all into captivity from Jerusalem to Babylon.
2KI.24.16	All the men of might, which were seven thousand, and craftsmen and smiths which were one thousand, all that were strong and apt for war, the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.
2KI.24.17	And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah, his father’s brother, king in his stead and changed his name to Zedekiah.
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
2KI.24.19	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2KI.24.20	For the anger of the 
2KI.25.1	And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came, he and all his host, against Jerusalem and pitched against it; and they built forts against it round about.
2KI.25.2	And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.
2KI.25.3	And on the ninth of the month the famine prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the land.
2KI.25.4	And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which is by the king’s garden, with the Chaldees round about the city; and they went by the way of the plain.
2KI.25.5	And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king and overtook him in the plains of Jericho, after all his army had been scattered from him.
2KI.25.6	So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah, and they sentenced him.
2KI.25.7	And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes and put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him with fetters of brass and carried him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	And in the fifth month, on the seventh of the month, which was the year nineteen of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a slave of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.
2KI.25.9	And he burnt the house of the 
2KI.25.10	And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down the walls of Jerusalem round about.
2KI.25.11	Now the rest of the people that were left in the city and the fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the remnant of the multitude, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried away.
2KI.25.12	But the captain of the guard left of the poor of the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.
2KI.25.13	And the Chaldees broke in pieces the pillars of brass that were in the house of the 
2KI.25.14	They also took away the pots and the shovels and the snuffers and the spoons and all the vessels of brass, with which they ministered.
2KI.25.15	And the censers and the bowls and such things as were of gold in gold and of silver in silver the captain of the guard took away, also
2KI.25.16	the two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made for the house of the 
2KI.25.17	The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the chapiter upon it was brass; and the height of the chapiter three cubits, and network and pomegranates upon the chapiter round about, all of brass; and the second pillar was like the first with network.
2KI.25.18	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah, the chief priest, and Zephaniah, the second priest, and the three keepers of the door;
2KI.25.19	and out of the city he took a eunuch, that was set over the men of war, and five men of those that were in the king’s presence, who were found in the city, and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land, with sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the city.
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, took these and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
2KI.25.21	And the king of Babylon smote and slew them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their land.
2KI.25.22	And as for the people whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, left in the land of Judah, he made Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, governor over them.
2KI.25.23	And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah, the son of Tanhumeth, the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah, the son of Maachathi, they and their men.
2KI.25.24	Then Gedaliah swore to them and to their men and said unto them, Do not fear the slaves of the Chaldees; dwell in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
2KI.25.25	But in the seventh month, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama of the royal seed, came and ten men with him and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.
2KI.25.26	Then all the people, both small and great, and the captains of the armies, arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldees.
2KI.25.27	And it came to pass after thirty-seven years of the captivity of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, that Evilmerodach, king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin, king of Judah, out of the prison house;
2KI.25.28	and he spoke kindly to him and set his seat above the seats of the kings that were with him in Babylon.
2KI.25.29	And he changed his prison garments, and he ate bread continually before him all the days of his life.
2KI.25.30	And the king caused him to be given his food continually, each thing in its time, all the days of his life.

1CH.5.22	For there fell down many slain because the war was of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

1CH.10.2	And the Philistines followed hard after Saul and after his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, the sons of Saul.
1CH.10.3	And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit him, and he was wounded of the archers.
1CH.10.4	Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword and thrust me through with it lest these uncircumcised come and abuse me. But his armourbearer would not, for he was sore afraid. Then Saul took a sword and fell upon it.
1CH.10.5	And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell likewise on his sword and died.
1CH.10.6	So Saul died and his three sons and all his house died together.
1CH.10.7	And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw that, they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then they forsook their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.
1CH.10.8	And it came to pass on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen in Mount Gilboa.
1CH.10.9	And when they had stripped him, they took his head and his weapons and sent into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry tidings unto their idols and to the people.
1CH.10.10	And they put his weapons in the house of their gods and fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.
1CH.10.11	And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had done to Saul,
1CH.10.12	all the valiant men arose and took away the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons and brought them to Jabesh and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh and fasted seven days.
1CH.10.13	So Saul died for his rebellion which he committed against the 
1CH.10.14	and not enquire of the 
1CH.11.1	Then all Israel gathered themselves to David in Hebron, saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.
1CH.11.2	And moreover yesterday and the day before yesterday, when Saul was king, it was thou that led out and brought in Israel; and the 
1CH.11.3	Therefore, all the elders of Israel came to the king in Hebron, and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the 
1CH.11.4	Then David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus, for there the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of that land.
1CH.11.5	And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not enter here. Nevertheless, David took the fortress of Zion, which is the city of David.
1CH.11.6	And David said, Whoever smites the Jebusites first shall be head and prince. So Joab, the son of Zeruiah, went up first and was made the head.
1CH.11.7	And David dwelt in the fortress; therefore, they called it the city of David.
1CH.11.8	And he built the city round about, even from Millo round about, and Joab restored the rest of the city.
1CH.11.9	So David waxed greater and greater, for the 
1CH.11.10	These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who strengthened him in his kingdom, with all Israel, to make him king over Israel, according to the word of the 
1CH.11.11	And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had: Jashobeam, of Hachmoni, the chief of the captains; he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain at one time and killed them.
1CH.11.12	And after him was Eleazar, the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who was one of the three mighties.
1CH.11.13	He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where there was an inheritance of land full of barley; and as the people fled from before the Philistines,
1CH.11.14	they set themselves in the midst of that portion and delivered it and slew the Philistines; and the 
1CH.11.15	Now three of the thirty principal ones went down to the rock to David, into the cave of Adullam; and the camp of the Philistines was pitched in the valley of Rephaim.
1CH.11.16	And David was then in the fortress, and the Philistines’ garrison was then at Bethlehem.
1CH.11.17	And David longed and said, Oh, that one would give me drink of the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!
1CH.11.18	And those three broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David; but David would not drink of it, but poured it out to the 
1CH.11.19	and said, May God keep me from doing this thing. Shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives in jeopardy? For with the jeopardy of their lives they brought it. Therefore, he would not drink it. These things did these three mightiest.
1CH.11.20	And Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of three, who had lifted up his spear against three hundred, whom he slew and had a name among the three.
1CH.11.21	Of the three, he obtained the most honour in this second group of three, for he was their prince; however, he did not attain to the first three.
1CH.11.22	Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of great acts, of Kabzeel; he slew two lions of Moab; he also went down and slew a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day.
1CH.11.23	And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits high; and in the Egyptian’s hand was a spear like a weaver’s beam; and he went down to him with a staff and plucked the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and slew him with his own spear.
1CH.11.24	These things did Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, and had the name among the three mighties.
1CH.11.25	He was the most honoured among the thirty, but did not attain to the first three. And David placed him in his council.

1CH.11.45	Jediael, the son of Shimri, and Joha, his brother, the Tizite,
1CH.11.46	Eliel, the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of Elnaam, and Ithmah, the Moabite,
1CH.11.47	Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.
1CH.12.1	Now these are those that came to David to Ziklag, while he was yet restrained because of Saul, the son of Kish; and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.
1CH.12.2	They were armed with bows and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of Saul’s brethren of Benjamin.
1CH.12.3	The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah, the Gibeathite; and Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah and Jehu, the Antothite,
1CH.12.4	and Ismaiah, the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and more than the thirty; and Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, Josabad, the Gederathite,
1CH.12.5	Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, Shemariah, Shephatiah, the Haruphite;
1CH.12.6	Elkanah, Jesiah, Azareel, Joezer, Jashobeam, the Korhites,
1CH.12.7	and Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.
1CH.12.8	And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David in the fortress in the wilderness, men of might of war fit for the battle, put in order with shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains;
1CH.12.9	Ezer, the chief, Obadiah, the second, Eliab, the third,
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah, the fourth, Jeremiah, the fifth,
1CH.12.11	Attai, the sixth, Eliel, the seventh,
1CH.12.12	Johanan, the eighth, Elzabad, the ninth,
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah, the tenth, Machbanai, the eleventh.
1CH.12.14	These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host. One of the least was over one hundred men, and the greatest over a thousand.
1CH.12.15	These went over the Jordan in the first month, when it had overflown all its banks, and they put to flight all those of the valleys to the east and to the west.
1CH.12.16	Likewise, some of the sons of Benjamin and Judah came to David, to the fortress.
1CH.12.17	And David went out to meet them and answered and said unto them, If you are come peaceably unto me to help me, my heart shall be knit unto you; but if you are come to betray me to my enemies, seeing there is no violence in my hands, let the God of our fathers look thereon and rebuke it.
1CH.12.18	Then the spirit clothed himself in Amasai, who was chief of the thirty, and he said, For thee, O David, and with thee, thou son of Jesse. Peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy helpers; for thy God helps thee. Then David received them and put them among the captains of the band.
1CH.12.19	And some of Manasseh passed over to David, when he came with the Philistines against Saul to battle, although they did not help them, for the cardinals of the Philistines, upon counsel, sent him away, saying, He will pass over to his master Saul with our heads.
1CH.12.20	As he went to Ziklag, there passed over to him of Manasseh, Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zilthai, heads of the thousands that were of Manasseh.
1CH.12.21	And they helped David with a band; for they were all mighty men of valour and were captains in the host.
1CH.12.22	For at that time help came every day to David until it was a great camp, like the camp of God.
1CH.12.23	And this is the number of the heads of those that were ready armed for war and came to David in Hebron, to turn the kingdom of Saul to him, according to the word of the 
1CH.12.24	Of the sons of Judah that bore shield and spear, six thousand eight hundred, ready armed for war.
1CH.12.25	Of the sons of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand one hundred.
1CH.12.26	Of the sons of Levi four thousand six hundred.
1CH.12.27	Likewise Jehoiada, prince of those of the lineage of Aaron, and with him three thousand seven hundred;
1CH.12.28	and Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father’s house twenty-two captains.
1CH.12.29	Of the sons of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three thousand; for in that time many of them had the charge of the house of Saul.
1CH.12.30	And of the sons of Ephraim twenty thousand eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the houses of their fathers.
1CH.12.31	And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, who were designated by name, to come and make David king.
1CH.12.32	And of the sons of Issachar, two hundred chief men, who had understanding of the times and were wise to know what Israel ought to do; and all their brethren followed their word.
1CH.12.33	Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all weapons of war, fifty thousand, who could keep rank; they were not of double heart.
1CH.12.34	And of Naphtali a thousand captains and with them with shield and spear thirty-seven thousand.
1CH.12.35	And of those of Dan expert in war twenty-eight thousand six hundred.
1CH.12.36	And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand.
1CH.12.37	And of the other side of the Jordan, of those of Reuben and those of Gad and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, one hundred and twenty thousand.
1CH.12.38	All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel; and likewise, all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make David king.
1CH.12.39	And there they were with David three days, eating and drinking, for their brethren had prepared for them.
1CH.12.40	And likewise, those that were near them, even unto Issachar and Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses and on camels and on mules and on oxen, and food, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly; for there was joy in Israel.
1CH.13.1	And David consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with all the princes.
1CH.13.2	And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seems good unto you and unto the 
1CH.13.3	and let us bring again the ark of our God to us, for from the time of Saul we have not paid attention to it.
1CH.13.4	And all the congregation said to do so, for the thing seemed right in the eyes of all the people.
1CH.13.5	So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from Kirjathjearim.
1CH.13.6	And David went up with all Israel to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which is in Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God the 
1CH.13.7	And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and his brother drove the cart.
1CH.13.8	And David and all Israel played before God with all their might, with songs and with harps and with psalteries and with timbrels and with cymbals and with trumpets.
1CH.13.9	And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put forth his hand to hold the ark, for the oxen stumbled.
1CH.13.10	And the anger of the 
1CH.13.11	And David was displeased because the 
1CH.13.12	And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I bring the ark of God home to me?
1CH.13.13	So David did not bring the ark home to himself to the city of David but carried it into the house of Obededom, the Gittite.
1CH.13.14	And the ark of God remained with the household of Obededom in his house three months. And the 
1CH.14.1	Now Hiram, king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, and timber of cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him a house.
1CH.14.2	And David, understanding that the 
1CH.14.3	took more wives at Jerusalem; and David begat more sons and daughters.
1CH.14.4	Now these are the names of his children which were born unto him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpalet,
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia,
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphalet.
1CH.14.8	And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard of it and went out against them.
1CH.14.9	And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim.
1CH.14.10	And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the Philistines? Wilt thou deliver them into my hand? And the 
1CH.14.11	So they came up to Baalperazim, and David smote them there. Then David said, God has broken in upon my enemies by my hand like the breaking forth of waters. Therefore, they called the name of that place Baalperazim.
1CH.14.12	And they left their gods there, and David gave a commandment, and they were burned with fire.
1CH.14.13	And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the valley.
1CH.14.14	Therefore, David enquired again of God; and God said unto him, Do not go up after them; go around them to come upon them over against the mulberry trees;
1CH.14.15	and it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of marching in the tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to battle; for God shall go forth before thee to smite the host of the Philistines.
1CH.14.16	David, therefore, did as God commanded him, and they smote the host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.
1CH.14.17	And the fame of David went out into all those lands, and the 
1CH.15.1	And David made houses for himself in the city of David and prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
1CH.15.2	Then David said, The ark of God should not be brought except by the Levites, for the 
1CH.15.3	And David gathered all Israel together in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.4	And David assembled the sons of Aaron and the Levites:
1CH.15.5	of the sons of Kohath: Uriel, the chief, and his brethren, one hundred and twenty;
1CH.15.6	of the sons of Merari: Asaiah, the chief and his brethren, two hundred and twenty;
1CH.15.7	of the sons of Gershon: Joel, the chief, and his brethren one hundred and thirty;
1CH.15.8	of the sons of Elizaphan: Shemaiah, the chief, and his brethren, two hundred;
1CH.15.9	of the sons of Hebron: Eliel, the chief and his brethren, eighty;
1CH.15.10	of the sons of Uzziel: Amminadab, the chief, and his brethren, one hundred and twelve.
1CH.15.11	And David also called for Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab
1CH.15.12	and said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers among the Levites; sanctify yourselves and your brethren and bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.13	for because ye did not do it thus at the first, the 
1CH.15.14	So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring up the ark of the 
1CH.15.15	And the sons of the Levites bore the ark of God upon their shoulders with the staves, as Moses had commanded according to the word of the 
1CH.15.16	And David spoke to the chief of the Levites to appoint of their brethren as singers with instruments of music, with psalteries and harps and cymbals sounding, and to lift up their voice with joy.
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman, the son of Joel; and of his brethren, Asaph, the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of Merari and of their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah,
1CH.15.18	and with them their brethren of the second order, Zechariah, Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.
1CH.15.19	So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, raised their voices with cymbals of brass;
1CH.15.20	and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on Alamoth.
1CH.15.21	And Mattithiah, Elipheleh, Mikneiah, Obededom, Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.
1CH.15.22	And Chenaniah, prince of the Levites in prophecy, for he presided in prophecy, because he had understanding.
1CH.15.23	And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.24	And Shebaniah, Jehoshaphat, Nethaneel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God; and Obededom and Jehiah were also doorkeepers for the ark.
1CH.15.25	So David and the elders of Israel and the captains over thousands went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.26	And with God helping the Levites that bore the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.27	And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and also all the Levites that bore the ark and the singers and Chenaniah, the prince of the prophecy of the singers. David also had upon him an ephod of linen.
1CH.15.28	Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.15.29	And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.1	So they brought the ark of God and set it in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it, and they offered burnt sacrifices and peace offerings before God.
1CH.16.2	And when David had finished offering the burnt offerings and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the 
1CH.16.3	And he dealt to all Israel, both men and women, to each one a loaf of bread and a good piece of flesh and a flagon of wine.
1CH.16.4	And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the ark of the 
1CH.16.5	Asaph, the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with harps, but Asaph resounded with cymbals;
1CH.16.6	and Benaiah and Jahaziel, the priests, with trumpets continually before the ark of the covenant of God.
1CH.16.7	Then, on that day, David began to thank the 
1CH.16.8	Give thanks unto the 
1CH.16.9	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, speak of all his wondrous works.
1CH.16.10	Glory in his holy name; let the heart of those that seek the 
1CH.16.11	Seek the 
1CH.16.12	Remember his marvellous works that he has done, his wonders and the judgments of his mouth;
1CH.16.13	O, ye seed of Israel, his slave, ye sons of Jacob, his chosen ones.
1CH.16.14	He is the 
1CH.16.15	Be mindful always of his covenant, the word which he commanded in a thousand generations,
1CH.16.16	the covenant which he cut with Abraham, and of his oath unto Isaac;
1CH.16.17	which he confirmed unto Jacob by statute, and to Israel in everlasting covenant,
1CH.16.18	saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the cord of your inheritance,
1CH.16.19	when ye were but few in number, and strangers in it.
1CH.16.20	And they went from nation to nation and from one kingdom to another people.
1CH.16.21	He would allow no one to oppress them; he reproved kings for their sakes,
1CH.16.22	saying, Touch not my anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
1CH.16.23	Sing unto the 
1CH.16.24	Declare his glory among the Gentiles; his marvellous works among all peoples.
1CH.16.25	For great is the 
1CH.16.26	For all the gods of the people are worthless, but the 
1CH.16.27	Glory and beauty are in his presence; strength and gladness are in his place.
1CH.16.28	Give unto the 
1CH.16.29	Give unto the 
1CH.16.30	Fear before him, all the earth; the world also is being made stable, that it be not moved.
1CH.16.31	Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice; and let men say among the Gentiles, The 
1CH.16.32	Let the sea roar, and the fullness thereof; let the fields rejoice, and all that is therein.
1CH.16.33	Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the 
1CH.16.34	O give thanks unto the 
1CH.16.35	And say, Save us, O God our saving health, and gather us together and deliver us from the Gentiles, that we may give thanks to thy holy name and glory in thy praise.
1CH.16.36	Blessed be the 
1CH.16.37	So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.16.38	and Obededom with their brethren, sixty-eight; Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters.
1CH.16.39	And Zadok, the priest, and his brethren, the priests, before the tabernacle of the 
1CH.16.40	to offer burnt offerings unto the 
1CH.16.41	and with them Heman and Jeduthun and the rest that were chosen expressly by name, to give thanks to the 
1CH.16.42	And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals to sound, and with other musical instruments of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.
1CH.16.43	And all the people departed each one to his house; and David returned to bless his house.
1CH.17.1	Now it came to pass, as David dwelt in his house, that David said to Nathan, the prophet, Behold, I dwell in a house of cedars, and the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.17.2	Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thy heart for God is with thee.
1CH.17.3	And it came to pass the same night that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
1CH.17.4	Go and tell David my slave, Thus hath the 
1CH.17.5	for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I brought up Israel unto this day, but have gone from tent to tent, and from one tabernacle to another.
1CH.17.6	Wherever I have walked with all Israel, did I speak a word to any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of cedars?
1CH.17.7	Now, therefore, thus shalt thou say unto my slave David, Thus hath the 
1CH.17.8	and I have been with thee wherever thou hast walked and have cut off all thy enemies from before thee and have made thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth.
1CH.17.9	Likewise I have ordained a place for my people Israel and have planted him that he dwell by himself and no longer be moved; neither shall the sons of iniquity waste them any more, as before,
1CH.17.10	since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel. I have humbled all thy enemies and announce unto thee that the 
1CH.17.11	And it shall come to pass, when thy days are fulfilled to go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish his kingdom.
1CH.17.12	He shall build me a house, and I will establish his throne eternally.
1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he shall be my son; and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was before thee;
1CH.17.14	but I will confirm him in my house and in my kingdom for ever, and his throne shall be established for evermore.
1CH.17.15	According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.
1CH.17.16	And David, the king, came and sat before the 
1CH.17.17	And yet this was a small thing in thy eyes, O God, for thou hast also spoken of thy slave’s house for a great while to come and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of high degree, O 
1CH.17.18	What more can David add asking thee to glorify thy slave? For thou knowest thy slave.
1CH.17.19	O 
1CH.17.20	O 
1CH.17.21	And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel, whom God went to ransom to be his own people, to make thee a name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out the Gentiles from before thy people, whom thou didst redeem out of Egypt?
1CH.17.22	For thy people Israel didst thou make thy own people for ever, and thou, 
1CH.17.23	Therefore, now, 
1CH.17.24	Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for ever, that it may be said, The 
1CH.17.25	For thou, O my God, hast told thy slave that thou wilt build him a house; therefore, thy slave has found in his heart to pray before thee.
1CH.17.26	And now, 
1CH.17.27	now it has pleased thee to bless the house of thy slave, that it may be before thee for ever; for thou, O 
1CH.18.1	Now after this it came to pass that David smote the Philistines and subdued them and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
1CH.18.2	And he smote Moab, and the Moabites became David’s slaves, bringing him presents.
1CH.18.3	And David smote Hadarezer, king of Zobah in Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion unto the river Euphrates.
1CH.18.4	And David took from him a thousand chariots, seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen; David also hamstrung all the chariot horses, but reserved those of one hundred chariots.
1CH.18.5	And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer, king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians twenty-two thousand men.
1CH.18.6	Then David put garrisons in Syria, the Syria of Damascus, and the Syrians became David’s slaves, bringing him presents. For the 
1CH.18.7	And David took the shields of gold that the slaves of Hadarezer carried and brought them to Jerusalem.
1CH.18.8	Likewise from Tibhath and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, David took very much brass, with which Solomon made the brasen sea and the pillars and the vessels of brass.
1CH.18.9	Now when Tou, king of Hamath, heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer, king of Zobah,
1CH.18.10	he sent Hadoram, his son, to King David, to greet him and to bless him because he had fought against Hadarezer and smitten him, for Hadarezer had war with Tou. And he sent him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass,
1CH.18.11	which King David dedicated unto the 
1CH.18.12	Moreover, Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, smote Edom in the valley of salt, eighteen thousand men.
1CH.18.13	And he put a garrison in Edom, and all the Edomites became David’s slaves. Thus the 
1CH.18.14	So David reigned over all Israel and executed judgment and righteousness among all his people.
1CH.18.15	And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was over the host; and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, writer of the chronicles;
1CH.18.16	and Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech, the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
1CH.18.17	and Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were first, at the hand of the king.
1CH.19.1	Now it came to pass after this that Nahash the king of the sons of Ammon, died, and his son reigned in his stead.
1CH.19.2	And David said, I will show mercy unto Hanun, the son of Nahash, because his father showed mercy to me. And David sent ambassadors to comfort him concerning his father. So the slaves of David came into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun, to comfort him.
1CH.19.3	But the princes of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun, Does it seem unto thee that David honours thy father, that he has sent comforters unto thee? Are not his slaves come unto thee to search and to overthrow and to spy out the land?
1CH.19.4	Then Hanun took David’s slaves and shaved them, and cut off their garments in half, exposing their buttocks and sent them away.
1CH.19.5	Then they left, and it was told David how the men were served. And he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards are grown and then return.
1CH.19.6	And when the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves odious to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and horsemen out of Syria of the rivers (Mesopotamia), and out of Syria of Maachah and out of Zobah.
1CH.19.7	So they hired thirty-two thousand chariots, and the king of Maachah and his people, who came and pitched camp before Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered themselves together from their cities and came to battle.
1CH.19.8	And when David heard of it, he sent Joab and all the host of the mighty men.
1CH.19.9	And the sons of Ammon came out and put the battle in order before the gate of the city, and the kings that had come were by themselves in the field.
1CH.19.10	Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel and put them in order against the Syrians.
1CH.19.11	And he put the rest of the people into the hand of Abishai, his brother, putting them in order against the sons of Ammon.
1CH.19.12	And he said, If the Syrians are too strong for me, then thou shalt save me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for thee, then I will save thee.
1CH.19.13	Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our people and for the cities of our God; and let the 
1CH.19.14	So Joab and the people that were with him drew near before the Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.
1CH.19.15	And when the sons of Ammon saw that the Syrians had fled, they likewise fled before Abishai, his brother, and entered into the city. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they sent ambassadors and drew forth the Syrians that were beyond the river, whose captain was Shophach, the prince of the host of Hadarezer.
1CH.19.17	And when it was told David, he gathered all Israel and passed over the Jordan and came upon them and ordered his host against them. And when David had put his troops in order against the Syrians, they fought with him.
1CH.19.18	But the Syrians fled before Israel, and David slew of the Syrians those of seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen; likewise he killed Shophach, the captain of the host.
1CH.19.19	And when the slaves of Hadarezer saw that they were smitten before Israel, they made peace with David and became his servants; neither would the Syrians help the sons of Ammon any more.
1CH.20.1	And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of the army and destroyed the country of the sons of Ammon and came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And Joab smote Rabbah and destroyed it.
1CH.20.2	And David took the crown of their king from off his head and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set upon David’s head. And in addition to this he took exceeding much spoil out of the city.
1CH.20.3	And he brought out the people that were in it and dominated them with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so dealt David with all the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.20.4	And it came to pass after this that there arose war at Gezer with the Philistines at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite, slew Sippai, of the lineage of the giant; and they were subdued.
1CH.20.5	And there was war again with the Philistines, and Elhanan, the son of Jair, slew Lahmi, the brother of Goliath the Gittite, whose spear staff was like a weaver’s beam.
1CH.20.6	And yet again there was war at Gath, where there was a man of great stature, who had twenty-four fingers and toes, six on each hand, and six on each foot; and he also was the son of the giant.
1CH.20.7	But when he dishonoured Israel, Jonathan, the son of Shimea, David’s brother slew him.
1CH.20.8	These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his slaves.
1CH.21.1	And Satan stood up against Israel and provoked David to number Israel.
1CH.21.2	And David said to Joab and to the princes of the people, Go, number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number of them to me, that I may know it.
1CH.21.3	And Joab answered, The 
1CH.21.4	Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore, Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.
1CH.21.5	And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David. And they found in all Israel eleven times one hundred thousand men that drew sword, and of Judah four hundred seventy thousand men that drew sword.
1CH.21.6	Among these the Levites and the sons of Benjamin were not counted, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.
1CH.21.7	And God was also displeased with this word; therefore, he smote Israel.
1CH.21.8	And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly because I have done this thing; but now, I beseech thee, take away the iniquity of thy slave, for I have done very foolishly.
1CH.21.9	And the 
1CH.21.10	Go and tell David, saying, Thus hath the 
1CH.21.11	So Gad came to David and said unto him, Thus hath the 
1CH.21.12	either three years’ famine or three months to be destroyed before thy foes while the sword of thine enemies overtakes thee or else three days of the sword of the 
1CH.21.13	Then David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait; let me fall now into the hand of the 
1CH.21.14	So the 
1CH.21.15	And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it; and as he was destroying, the 
1CH.21.16	And David lifted up his eyes and saw the angel of the 
1CH.21.17	And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? Even I it is that have sinned and done evil indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, O 
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the 
1CH.21.19	And David went up according to the word of Gad, which he had spoken unto him in the name of the 
1CH.21.20	And Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four sons with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.
1CH.21.21	And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David and went out of the threshingfloor and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.
1CH.21.22	Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the 
1CH.21.23	And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes; I even give thee the oxen for burnt offerings and the threshing instruments for wood and the wheat for the present; I give it all.
1CH.21.24	And King David said to Ornan, No, but I will truly buy it for the full price, for I will not take that which is thine for the 
1CH.21.25	So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.
1CH.21.26	And David built there an altar unto the 
1CH.21.27	And when the 
1CH.21.28	At that time when David saw that the 
1CH.21.29	For the tabernacle of the 
1CH.21.30	but David could not go before it to enquire of God, for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of the 
1CH.22.1	Then David said, This shall be the house of the 
1CH.22.2	And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were in the land of Israel, and he made them masons to hew wrought stones to build the house of God.
1CH.22.3	Likewise, David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the doors of the gates, and for the joinings, and brass in abundance without weight,
1CH.22.4	also cedar trees in abundance, for the Zidonians and those of Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.
1CH.22.5	And David said, Solomon, my son, is yet young and tender, and the house that is to be built for the 
1CH.22.6	Then he called for Solomon, his son, and charged him to build a house for the 
1CH.22.7	And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my heart to build a house unto the name of the 
1CH.22.8	but the word of the 
1CH.22.9	Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of rest, and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about, for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness unto Israel in his days.
1CH.22.10	He shall build a house for my name, and he shall be my son, and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel for ever.
1CH.22.11	Now, my son, the 
1CH.22.12	Only the 
1CH.22.13	Then shalt thou be prospered if thou shalt keep thyself to do the statutes and rights which the 
1CH.22.14	Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of the 
1CH.22.15	Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and workers of stone and timber and all manner of expert men for every manner of work.
1CH.22.16	Of the gold, the silver, and the brass and the iron, there is no number. Arise therefore, and go to work, and the 
1CH.22.17	David, likewise, commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon, his son, saying,
1CH.22.18	Is not the 
1CH.22.19	Now set your heart and your soul to seek the 
1CH.23.1	So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon, his son, king over Israel.
1CH.23.2	And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, and the priests and the Levites,
1CH.23.3	were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward; and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty-eight thousand.
1CH.23.4	Of which, twenty-four thousand were to set forward the work of the house of the 
1CH.23.5	moreover, four thousand were porters, and four thousand praised the 
1CH.23.6	And David divided them into courses according to the sons of Levi, namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

1CH.23.8	The sons of Laadan: Jehiel, the first, Zetham and Joel, three.

1CH.23.10	And the sons of Shimei: Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.
1CH.23.11	And Jahath was the first, and Zizah the second, but Jeush and Beriah did not multiply in many sons; therefore, they were in one reckoning, according to their father’s house.
1CH.23.12	The sons of Kohath: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.
1CH.23.13	The sons of Amram: Aaron and Moses. And Aaron was separated, that he should be dedicated to the most holy things, he and his sons for ever, to burn incense before the

1CH.23.15	The sons of Moses were Gershon and Eliezer.
1CH.23.16	Of the sons of Gershon, Shebuel was the chief.
1CH.23.17	And the son of Eliezer was Rehabiah, the chief. And Eliezer had no other sons, but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

1CH.23.23	The sons of Mushi: Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth, three.
1CH.23.24	These are the sons of Levi after the houses of their fathers, even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number of names by their polls, that did work in the ministry of the house of the 
1CH.23.25	For David said, The 
1CH.23.26	And also unto the Levites, they shall no longer carry the tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for its ministry.
1CH.23.27	For by the last words of David, the Levites were numbered from twenty years old and above.
1CH.23.28	And their station was at the hand of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the 
1CH.23.29	both for the showbread and for the fine flour for the sacrifice and for the unleavened cakes and for that which is baked in the pan and for that which is fried and for all manner of measure and size,
1CH.23.30	and to stand every morning to thank and praise the 
1CH.23.31	and to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the 
1CH.23.32	And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the testimony and the charge of the holy place and the charge of the sons of Aaron, their brethren, in the ministry of the house of the 
1CH.24.1	The sons of Aaron also had their courses. The sons of Aaron: Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father and had no children; therefore, Eleazar and Ithamar had the priesthood.
1CH.24.3	And David distributed them, Zadok being of the sons of Eleazar, and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their turns in their ministry.
1CH.24.4	And there were more men found of the sons of Eleazar than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among the sons of Eleazar, there were sixteen chief men of the houses of their fathers and eight among the sons of Ithamar according to the houses of their fathers.
1CH.24.5	They divided them, therefore, by lot, one with another for of the sons of Eleazar and of the sons of Ithamar there were princes of the sanctuary and princes of God.
1CH.24.6	And Shemaiah, the scribe, the son of Nethaneel, one of the Levites, wrote them before the king and the princes and before Zadok, the priest, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, and the heads of the fathers of the priests and Levites; one paternal house being taken for Eleazar, and one taken for Ithamar.

1CH.25.1	Moreover David and the captains of the host separated unto the ministry the sons of Asaph and of Heman and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals; and the number of men that were suitable for the work of their respective ministry was,

1CH.27.31	and over the sheep was Jaziz, the Hagerite. All these were the princes of the substance which was King David’s.
1CH.27.32	And Jonathan, David’s uncle, was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe; and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni had charge of the king’s sons.
1CH.27.33	Ahithophel was the king’s counsellor; and Hushai, the Archite, was the king’s companion.
1CH.27.34	And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada, the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar. And Joab was the general of the king’s army.
1CH.28.1	And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of the tribes, and the princes of the companies that ministered to the king by course, and the princes over the thousands, and princes over the hundreds, with the princes over all the substance and possession of the king, and his sons, with the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the valiant men, unto Jerusalem.
1CH.28.2	Then David, the king, stood up upon his feet and said, Hear me, my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.28.3	But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build a house for my name because thou hast been a man of war and hast shed blood.
1CH.28.4	However, the 
1CH.28.5	and of all my sons (for the 
1CH.28.6	And he said unto me, Solomon, thy son, he shall build my house and my courts, for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will be his father.
1CH.28.7	Moreover, I will establish his kingdom for ever if he is constant to do my commandments and my judgments as at this day.
1CH.28.8	Now, therefore, in the sight of all Israel the congregation of the 
1CH.28.9	And thou, Solomon, my son, know thou the God of thy father and serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing soul, for the 
1CH.28.10	Take heed now, for the 
1CH.28.11	Then David gave to Solomon, his son, the pattern of the porch and of its houses and of its treasuries and of its upper chambers and of its inner parlours and of the place of the seat of reconciliation,
1CH.28.12	and the pattern of all that he had received by the Spirit of the courts of the house of the 
1CH.28.13	also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the ministry of the house of the 
1CH.28.14	He gave gold by weight for that of gold, for all the vessels of each manner of service; silver also for all the vessels of silver by weight, for all the vessels of each service.
1CH.28.15	Gold by weight for the lampstands of gold, and for their lamps of gold, by weight for every lampstand, and for its lamps; and for the lampstands of silver by weight, both for the lampstand and also for its lamps, according to the service of each lampstand.
1CH.28.16	And by weight he gave gold for the tables of showbread, for each table; and, likewise, silver for the tables of silver.
1CH.28.17	Also pure gold for the fleshhooks and the bowls and the cups, and for the golden covers he gave gold by weight for every basin; and likewise silver by weight for every basin of silver;
1CH.28.18	and for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubim, that spread out their wings and covered the ark of the covenant of the 
1CH.28.19	All this, said David, the 
1CH.28.20	And David said to Solomon, his son, Be strong and of good courage, and do it; fear not, nor be dismayed, for the 
1CH.28.21	Behold the courses of the priests and the Levites, in all the ministry of the house of God; they shall be with thee in all the work; all of them voluntarily, with wisdom in all ministry; likewise, the princes and all the people to execute all thy commands.
1CH.29.1	Furthermore, David, the king, said unto all the congregation, Only Solomon, my son, has God chosen; he is young and tender, and the work is great, for the palace is not for man, but for the 
1CH.29.2	Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God, gold for the things of gold, and silver for the things of silver, and brass for the things of brass, and iron for the things of iron, and wood for the things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, black stones and of different colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.
1CH.29.3	Moreover, because I have my delight in the house of my God, I have in my own treasury, gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the house of the sanctuary:
1CH.29.4	three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses;
1CH.29.5	the gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of the workmen. And who then is willing to consecrate the offering of his hands today unto the 
1CH.29.6	Then the princes of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel, and the princes of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king’s work, offered willingly
1CH.29.7	and gave for the service of the house of God five thousand talents of gold and ten thousand daily wages and ten thousand talents of silver and eighteen thousand talents of brass and one hundred thousand talents of iron.
1CH.29.8	And each one gave the precious stones that they had to the treasure of the house of the 
1CH.29.9	Then the people rejoiced to have offered willingly because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the 
1CH.29.10	and blessed the 
1CH.29.11	Thine, O 
1CH.29.12	The riches and the glory are before thee, and thou dost reign over all, and in thy hand is power and might and in thy hand the greatness and the strength of all things.
1CH.29.13	Now, therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name.
1CH.29.14	But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? For all things come of thee and of thine own have we given thee.
1CH.29.15	For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all our fathers; our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no other hope.
1CH.29.16	O 
1CH.29.17	I know also, my God, that thou dost try the heart, and hast pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy that thy people, who are present here, have given willingly unto thee.
1CH.29.18	O 
1CH.29.19	Likewise, give unto Solomon, my son, a perfect heart, to keep thy commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.
1CH.29.20	Then David said to all the congregation, Now bless the 
1CH.29.21	And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the 
1CH.29.22	And they ate and drank before the 
1CH.29.23	Then Solomon sat on the throne of the 
1CH.29.24	And all the princes and the mighty men and all the sons likewise of King David, submitted themselves unto Solomon, the king.
1CH.29.25	And the 
1CH.29.26	Thus David, the son of Jesse, reigned over all Israel.
1CH.29.27	And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
1CH.29.28	And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and glory; and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.
1CH.29.29	Now the acts of David, the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel, the seer, and in the book of Nathan, the prophet, and in the book of Gad, the seer,
1CH.29.30	with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him and over Israel and over all the kingdoms of the lands.
2CH.1.1	And Solomon, the son of David, was strengthened in his kingdom, and the 
2CH.1.2	Then Solomon spoke unto all Israel, to the captains of thousands and of hundreds and to the judges and to every prince in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.
2CH.1.3	So Solomon and all the congregation with him went to the high place that was at Gibeon, for there was the tabernacle of the testimony of God, which Moses the slave of the 
2CH.1.4	But David had brought the ark of God up from Kirjathjearim to the place which David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it at Jerusalem.
2CH.1.5	Moreover, the brasen altar that Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was there before the tabernacle of the 
2CH.1.6	And Solomon went up there to the brasen altar before the 
2CH.1.7	And that night God appeared unto Solomon and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.
2CH.1.8	And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast showed great mercy unto David, my father, and hast placed me as king in his stead.
2CH.1.9	Now, O 
2CH.1.10	Give me now wisdom and knowledge that I may go out and come in before this people, for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?
2CH.1.11	And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth or glory, nor the life of thy enemies, neither yet hast asked long life, but hast asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou may judge my people, over whom I have placed thee as king,
2CH.1.12	wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will also give thee riches and wealth and glory such as none of the kings have had that have been before thee, neither shall any after thee have the like.
2CH.1.13	Then Solomon returned to Jerusalem from the high place that was at Gibeon, from before the tabernacle of the testimony, and reigned over Israel.
2CH.1.14	And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen, and he had a thousand four hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities and with the king at Jerusalem.
2CH.1.15	And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as stones, and he made cedar trees as the sycamore trees that are in the vale for abundance.
2CH.1.16	And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn; the king’s merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
2CH.1.17	And they went up and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for one hundred and fifty; and so they brought out horses for all the kings of the Hittites and for the kings of Syria, by their hands.
2CH.2.1	And Solomon determined to build a house for the name of the 
2CH.2.2	And Solomon counted seventy thousand men to bear burdens and eighty thousand to hew in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.
2CH.2.3	And Solomon sent to Hiram, the king of Tyre, saying, As thou didst deal with David, my father, sending him cedars to build himself a house to dwell in, even so deal with me.
2CH.2.4	Behold, I must build a house unto the name of the 
2CH.2.5	And the house which I must build is great, for great is our God above all gods.
2CH.2.6	But who is so powerful as to build him a house, seeing the heavens and heavens of the heavens cannot contain him? Who am I then that I should build him a house, except to burn incense before him?
2CH.2.7	Send me now, therefore, a wise man who knows how to work in gold and in silver and in brass and in iron and in purple and crimson and blue and that knows how to engrave figures with the craftsmen that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David, my father, provided.
2CH.2.8	Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and pine trees, out of Lebanon, for I know that thy slaves are skillful at cutting timber in Lebanon, and, behold, my slaves shall be with thy slaves
2CH.2.9	to prepare me timber in abundance, for the house which I am about to build shall be great and wonderful.
2CH.2.10	And, behold, I will give to thy slaves, the hewers that cut timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat and twenty thousand measures of barley and twenty thousand baths of wine and twenty thousand baths of oil.
2CH.2.11	Then Hiram, the king of Tyre, answered in writing, which he sent to Solomon, Because the 
2CH.2.12	Hiram said, moreover, Blessed be the 
2CH.2.13	And now I have sent a wise man, with knowledge and understanding, of Hiram my father,
2CH.2.14	the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre, skillful to work in gold and in silver, in brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue, in fine linen, and in crimson; also to engrave any manner of figure and to invent any design which shall be put to him, with thy craftsmen and with the craftsmen of my lord David, thy father.
2CH.2.15	Now, therefore, let my lord send unto his slaves the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which he has spoken of;
2CH.2.16	and we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt need, and we will bring it to thee in rafts by sea to Joppa, and thou shalt cause it to be carried up to Jerusalem.
2CH.2.17	And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land of Israel, after David, his father, had already numbered them; and one hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred were found.
2CH.2.18	And he set seventy thousand of them to be bearers of burdens and eighty thousand to be hewers in the mountain, and three thousand six hundred overseers to make the people work.
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the house of the 
2CH.3.2	And he began to build in the second day of the second month, in the fourth year of his reign.
2CH.3.3	Now these are the measurements on which Solomon founded the building of the house of God. The first measurement was the length of sixty cubits and the breadth of twenty cubits.
2CH.3.4	And the porch that was in the front of the length was of twenty cubits, according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the height was one hundred and twenty; and he overlaid it within with pure gold.
2CH.3.5	And the greater house he covered with fir wood, which he overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and chains.
2CH.3.6	And he also covered the house with precious stones for beauty, and the gold was gold of Parvaim.
2CH.3.7	Thus did he cover the house, its beams, its posts, its walls, and its doors, with gold and engraved cherubim on the walls.
2CH.3.8	And he made the house of the holy of holies, its length was twenty cubits, according to the breadth of the house, and its breadth was twenty cubits, and he covered it with fine gold, amounting to six hundred talents.
2CH.3.9	And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.
2CH.3.10	And inside the house of the holy of holies he made two cherubim of figured work and overlaid them with gold.
2CH.3.11	And the wings of the cherubim were twenty cubits long; one wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was likewise five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub.
2CH.3.12	And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing was five cubits also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.
2CH.3.13	The wings of these cherubim spread themselves forth twenty cubits, and they stood on their feet, and their faces were inward.
2CH.3.14	And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson and fine linen and wrought cherubim thereon.
2CH.3.15	Also he made in front of the house two pillars of thirty-five cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of them was five cubits.
2CH.3.16	And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the heads of the pillars and made one hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains.
2CH.3.17	And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the right hand and the other on the left, and called the name of the one on the right hand Jachin, {Heb. The 
2CH.4.1	Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits long and twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high.
2CH.4.2	He also made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim, entirely round and five cubits high; and a line of thirty cubits girded it round about.
2CH.4.3	And under it were figures of oxen, which did compass it round about, ten in each cubit, compassing the sea round about. Two orders of oxen were cast, when it was cast.
2CH.4.4	It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north and three looking toward the west and three looking toward the Negev and three looking toward the east; and the sea was set above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.
2CH.4.5	And the thickness of it was a handbreadth and the brim of it like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies, and it received and held three thousand baths.
2CH.4.6	He also made ten lavers and put five on the right hand and five on the left, to wash in them; they cleansed the work of the burnt offering in them; but the sea was for the priests to wash in.
2CH.4.7	And he made ten lampstands of gold according to their form, and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five on the left.
2CH.4.8	He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right hand and five on the left. And he made one hundred basins of gold.
2CH.4.9	Furthermore, he made the court of the priests and the great court and doors for the court and overlaid the doors of them with brass.
2CH.4.10	And he set the sea on the right side towards the east, over against the Negev.
2CH.4.11	And Hiram made the pots and the shovels and the basins. And Hiram finished the work, that he had been making for King Solomon for the house of God,
2CH.4.12	Two pillars and the pommels and the chapiters, which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the top of the pillars;
2CH.4.13	four hundred pomegranates on the two networks; two orders of pomegranates on each network, to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were upon the pillars.
2CH.4.14	He also made the bases upon which he placed the lavers;
2CH.4.15	one sea, and twelve oxen under it;
2CH.4.16	and the pots and the shovels and the fleshhooks and all their vessels, did Hiram, his father, make to King Solomon for the house of the 
2CH.4.17	In the plain of the Jordan did the king cast them, in clay of the ground, between Succoth and Zeredathah.
2CH.4.18	Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance, for the weight of the brass could not be found out.
2CH.4.19	And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of God, the golden altar also, and the tables upon which the showbread was set;
2CH.4.20	likewise, the lampstands with their lamps, that they should burn according to the ordinance before the oracle, of pure gold;
2CH.4.21	and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs, he made of gold, of perfect gold;
2CH.4.22	also the snuffers and the basins and the spoons and the censers, of pure gold. Regarding the entry of the house, its inner doors for the most holy place and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.
2CH.5.1	Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the 
2CH.5.2	Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the princes of the families of the sons of Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.3	Therefore, all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the king in the solemnity which was in the seventh month.
2CH.5.4	And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.
2CH.5.5	And they brought up the ark and the tabernacle of the testimony and all the vessels of the sanctuary that were in the tabernacle; these did the priests and the Levites bring up.
2CH.5.6	Also King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel that were assembled unto him before the ark sacrificed sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
2CH.5.7	And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the 
2CH.5.8	For the cherubim spread forth their wings over the place of the ark, and the cherubim covered the ark and its staves from above.
2CH.5.9	And they drew out the staves so that the ends of the staves of the ark could be seen before the oracle, but they could not be seen from outside. And they were there unto this day.
2CH.5.10	There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put in it at Horeb, with which the 
2CH.5.11	And when the priests came out of the sanctuary (for all the priests that were present were sanctified and did not then wait by course,
2CH.5.12	and the Levite singers, all of those of Asaph, those of Heman, and those of Jeduthun, together with their sons and their brethren, being clothed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them one hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets).
2CH.5.13	And they sounded the trumpets and sang with one voice, all together as one man praising and thanking the 
2CH.5.14	so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud, for the glory of the 
2CH.6.1	Then Solomon said, The 
2CH.6.2	I, therefore, have built a house of habitation for thee and a place for thy dwelling for ever.
2CH.6.3	And the king turned his face and blessed the whole congregation of Israel, and all the congregation of Israel was standing.
2CH.6.4	And he said, Blessed be the 
2CH.6.5	Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to build a house in, that my name might be there; neither did I choose any man to be a prince over my people Israel.
2CH.6.6	But I have chosen Jerusalem that my name might be there and have chosen David to be over my people Israel.
2CH.6.7	Now it was in the heart of David, my father, to build a house unto the name of the 
2CH.6.8	But the 
2CH.6.9	notwithstanding, thou shalt not build the house, but thy son which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build a house for my name.
2CH.6.10	The 
2CH.6.11	And in it I have put the ark, in which is the covenant of the 
2CH.6.12	Then he stood before the altar of the 
2CH.6.13	For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold, five cubits long and five cubits wide and three cubits high, and had set it in the midst of the court; and upon it he stood and knelt down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel and spread forth his hands toward heaven
2CH.6.14	and said, O 
2CH.6.15	who hast kept unto thy slave David, my father, that which thou hast promised him; thou didst say it with thy mouth and hast fulfilled it with thy hand, as it is this day.
2CH.6.16	Now, therefore, O 
2CH.6.17	Now then, O 
2CH.6.18	Is it true that God is to dwell with men on the earth? Behold, heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have built!
2CH.6.19	But thou shalt look upon the prayer of thy slave and upon his supplication, O 
2CH.6.20	that thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night, upon the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there, to hearken unto the prayer which thy slave prays in this place.
2CH.6.21	Hearken, likewise, unto the supplications of thy slave and of thy people Israel when they shall pray in this place; hear thou from the heavens, from thy dwelling place, even hear and forgive.
2CH.6.22	If a man sins against his neighbour and an oath is laid upon him to make him swear, and the oath comes before thy altar in this house,
2CH.6.23	thou shalt hear from heaven and do right unto thy slaves, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own head, and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.
2CH.6.24	And if thy people Israel should fall before their enemies because they have sinned against thee and if they should convert and confess thy name and pray and make supplication before thee in this house,
2CH.6.25	thou shalt hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of thy people Israel and bring them again unto the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.
2CH.6.26	If the heavens should become shut up, that there be no rain because they have sinned against thee; yet if they pray in this place and confess thy name and become converted from their sins when thou dost afflict them,
2CH.6.27	thou shalt hear them from heaven and forgive the sin of thy slaves and of thy people Israel, and thou shalt teach them the good way, that they may walk therein, and send rain upon thy land which thou hast given unto thy people for an inheritance.
2CH.6.28	If there should be famine in the land, or if there should be pestilence, if there should be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillars; if their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land; whatever affliction or sickness there may be;
2CH.6.29	every prayer and every supplication made of any man, or of all thy people Israel or of anyone who knows his affliction and his grief in his heart, if they shall extend their hands towards this house,
2CH.6.30	thou shalt hear from the heavens, from the place of thy habitation, and forgive and render unto each one according to his ways, having known his heart (for thou only knowest the hearts of the sons of men),
2CH.6.31	that they may fear thee and walk in thy ways all the days that they live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.
2CH.6.32	And also unto the stranger, who is not of thy people Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name’s sake and thy mighty hand and thy stretched out arm, if they come and pray in this house,
2CH.6.33	thou shalt hear from the heavens, from the habitation of thy dwelling place, and do according to all that the stranger calls unto thee for, that all the peoples of the earth may know thy name and fear thee, as do thy people Israel, and let them know that thy name is invoked upon this house which I have built.
2CH.6.34	If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way that thou shalt send them and they pray unto thee toward this city which thou hast chosen, toward the house which I have built for thy name,
2CH.6.35	thou shalt hear from the heavens their prayer and their supplication and do them judgment.
2CH.6.36	If they sin against thee (for there is no man who does not sin,)and thou art angry with them and deliver them over before their enemies so that those that take them carry them away captives unto an enemy land far off or near,
2CH.6.37	and they come into their right mind in the land where they are carried captive, if they convert and pray unto thee in the land of their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done iniquity and have dealt wickedly,
2CH.6.38	if they convert unto thee with all their heart and with all their soul in the land of their captivity, where they have been carried captives and pray toward their land, which thou didst give unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast chosen and toward the house which I have built unto thy name,
2CH.6.39	thou shalt hear from the heavens, from the dwelling place of thy habitation, their prayer and their supplications and do their judgment and forgive thy people who have sinned against thee.
2CH.6.40	Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open and let thine ears be attentive unto the prayer that is made in this place.
2CH.6.41	Now, therefore, arise, O 
2CH.6.42	O 
2CH.7.1	And when Solomon finished praying, the fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices; and the glory of the 
2CH.7.2	And the priests could not enter into the house of the 
2CH.7.3	And when all the sons of Israel saw the fire come down and the glory of the 
2CH.7.4	Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the 
2CH.7.5	And King Solomon offered in sacrifice twenty-two thousand oxen and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep; and so the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
2CH.7.6	And the priests were upon their watches, and the Levites with the instruments of music of the 
2CH.7.7	Solomon also sanctified the middle of the court that was before the house of the 
2CH.7.8	Then Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.
2CH.7.9	And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly, for they had made the dedication of the altar in seven days, and they had celebrated the solemn feast for seven days.
2CH.7.10	And on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart for the goodness that the 
2CH.7.11	Thus Solomon finished the house of the 
2CH.7.12	And the 
2CH.7.13	If I shut up the heavens that there be no rain or if I command the locusts to devour the land or if I send pestilence among my people;
2CH.7.14	if my people, upon whom my name is invoked, shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then I will hear from the heavens and will forgive their sin and will heal their land.
2CH.7.15	Now my eyes shall be open and my ears attentive unto the prayer that is made in this place;
2CH.7.16	so that now I have chosen and sanctified this house, that my name may be in her for ever; and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually.
2CH.7.17	And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded thee and keep my statutes and my rights,
2CH.7.18	I will confirm the throne of thy kingdom, according as I have covenanted with David, thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.
2CH.7.19	But if ye turn away and forsake my statutes and my commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and serve other gods and worship them,
2CH.7.20	I will pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for my name, I will cast out of my presence, and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all peoples.
2CH.7.21	And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to every one that passes by it, so that they shall say, Why has the 
2CH.7.22	And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the 
2CH.8.1	And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the house of the 
2CH.8.2	that Solomon rebuilt the cities which Hiram had given him and caused the sons of Israel to dwell there.
2CH.8.3	Then Solomon went to Hamathzobah and prevailed against it.
2CH.8.4	And he built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the store cities, which he built in the wilderness.
2CH.8.5	Likewise, he rebuilt Bethhoron the upper and Bethhoron the lower, fenced cities with walls, gates, and bars;
2CH.8.6	and Baalath and all the store cities that Solomon had and all the chariot cities and the cities of the horsemen and all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem and in Lebanon and throughout all the land of his dominion.
2CH.8.7	As for all the people that were left of the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, which were not of Israel,
2CH.8.8	but of their sons, who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel, did not consume, Solomon made them pay tribute until this day.
2CH.8.9	But of the sons of Israel Solomon did not make slaves for his work, for they were men of war, and his princes and his captains, and princes of his chariots and horsemen.
2CH.8.10	And King Solomon had two hundred and fifty princes of the governors, who presided over the people.
2CH.8.11	And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city of David unto the house that he had built for her, for he said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David, king of Israel, because the places are holy, unto which the ark of the 
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the 
2CH.8.13	that each thing might be offered in its day, according to the commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths and on the new moons and on the feasts three times in the year, that is in the feast of unleavened bread and in the feast of weeks and in the feast of the tabernacles.
2CH.8.14	And he appointed, according to the order of David his father, the courses of the priests to their service and the Levites to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests, each thing in its day; the porters also by their courses at each gate, for so had David, the man of God, commanded.
2CH.8.15	And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto the priests and Levites concerning any matter or concerning the treasures.
2CH.8.16	Now all the work of Solomon was prepared from the day of the foundation of the house of the 
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to Eziongeber and to Eloth, at the sea side in the land of Edom.
2CH.8.18	For Hiram had sent him ships by the hands of his slaves and slaves that had knowledge of the sea, and they had gone with the slaves of Solomon to Ophir and had taken from there four hundred and fifty talents of gold and brought them to King Solomon.
2CH.9.1	And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she came to prove Solomon with enigmas at Jerusalem, with a very great host and camels that bore spices and gold in abundance and precious stones. And when she was come to Solomon, she spoke with him of all that was in her heart.
2CH.9.2	But Solomon told her all her questions, and nothing remained that Solomon did not declare unto her.
2CH.9.3	And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon and the house that he had built
2CH.9.4	and the food of his table and the seat of his slaves and the attendance of his ministers and their apparel, his butlers also and their apparel, and his sacrifices which he sacrificed in the house of the 
2CH.9.5	And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard in my own land of thy word and of thy wisdom,
2CH.9.6	but I did not believe their words until I came, and my eyes had seen it, and, behold, not even the half of the greatness of thy wisdom was told me, for thou dost exceed the fame that I heard.
2CH.9.7	Blessed are thy men and blessed are these thy slaves, who stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom.
2CH.9.8	The 
2CH.9.9	And she gave the king one hundred and twenty talents of gold and of spices great abundance and precious stones; never had there been any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.
2CH.9.10	Also the slaves of Hiram and the slaves of Solomon, who had brought gold from Ophir, brought brazil wood and precious stones.
2CH.9.11	And the king made of the brazil wood stairs to the house of the 
2CH.9.12	And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire, whatever she asked, more than what she had brought unto the king. Then she turned and went away to her own land with her slaves.
2CH.9.13	Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was six hundred and sixty-six talents of gold,
2CH.9.14	besides that which the traders and merchants brought. And all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to Solomon.
2CH.9.15	And King Solomon made two hundred bucklers of beaten gold; six hundred shekels of beaten gold went to each buckler.
2CH.9.16	And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three hundred shekels of gold went to each shield. And the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.
2CH.9.17	Moreover, the king made a great throne of ivory and overlaid it with pure gold.
2CH.9.18	And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each side of the seat, and two lions standing by the stays.
2CH.9.19	There were also twelve lions standing on one side and on the other upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any kingdom.
2CH.9.20	And all the drinking vessels of King Solomon were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. In the days of Solomon silver was not esteemed.
2CH.9.21	For the king’s ships went to Tarshish with the slaves of Hiram, and every three years the ships came from Tarshish bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.
2CH.9.22	And King Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches and wisdom.
2CH.9.23	And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon, to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.
2CH.9.24	And of these, each his present, vessels of silver and vessels of gold and raiment, arms, spices, horses, and mules, every year.
2CH.9.25	And Solomon also had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the chariot cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.
2CH.9.26	And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt.
2CH.9.27	And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and he made cedar trees as the sycamore trees that are in the low plains in abundance.
2CH.9.28	And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt and out of all lands.
2CH.9.29	Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they not written in the books of Nathan, the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah, the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo, the seer against Jeroboam, the son of Nebat?
2CH.9.30	And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.
2CH.9.31	And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the city of David, his father; and Rehoboam, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.10.1	And Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come together in Shechem to make him king.
2CH.10.2	And when Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, heard it, who was in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of Solomon, the king, Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.
2CH.10.3	And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
2CH.10.4	Thy father made our yoke grievous; now, therefore, ease thou somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father and his heavy yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.
2CH.10.5	And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days. And the people departed.
2CH.10.6	Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood before Solomon, his father, while he yet lived, saying, What do you counsel to reply to this people?
2CH.10.7	And they spoke unto him, saying, If thou wilt seek the good of this people and please them and speak good words to them, they will be thy slaves for ever.
2CH.10.8	But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him, that stood before him.
2CH.10.9	And he said unto them, What do you counsel us to reply to this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Ease somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?
2CH.10.10	Then the young men that were brought up with him spoke unto him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spoke unto thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make it somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s loins.
2CH.10.11	For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will add to your yoke; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
2CH.10.12	So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, as the king had commanded, saying, Come again to me on the third day.
2CH.10.13	And the king answered them roughly, for King Rehoboam forsook the counsel of the old men
2CH.10.14	and answered them after the advice of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to it; my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.
2CH.10.15	So the king did not hearken unto the people, for the cause was of God, that the 
2CH.10.16	And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David or inheritance in the son of Jesse? Every man to your tents, O Israel! Now, David, see to thine own house! So all Israel went to their tents.
2CH.10.17	But Rehoboam reigned over the sons of Israel that dwelt in the cities of Judah.
2CH.10.18	Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was over the tribute and the sons of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. So King Rehoboam made speed to get into a chariot and fled to Jerusalem.
2CH.10.19	Thus Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
2CH.11.1	And when Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he gathered of the house of Judah and Benjamin one hundred and eighty thousand chosen men, who were warriors, to fight against Israel, that he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.
2CH.11.2	But the word of the 
2CH.11.3	Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,
2CH.11.4	Thus hath the 
2CH.11.5	And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem and built cities for defence in Judah.
2CH.11.6	He built Bethlehem and Etam and Tekoa
2CH.11.7	and Bethzur and Shoco and Adullam
2CH.11.8	and Gath and Mareshah and Ziph
2CH.11.9	and Adoraim and Lachish and Azekah
2CH.11.10	and Zorah and Aijalon and Hebron which are in Judah and in Benjamin, fenced cities.
2CH.11.11	And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them and provisions and wine and oil;
2CH.11.12	and in all the cities he put shields and spears. He fortified them greatly, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.
2CH.11.13	And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel gathered unto him out of all their borders.
2CH.11.14	For the Levites left their suburbs and their possessions and came to Judah and Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons had cast them off from executing the priest’s office unto the 
2CH.11.15	And he ordained himself priests for the high places and for the demons and for the calves which he had made.
2CH.11.16	And from after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set their hearts to seek the 
2CH.11.17	So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah and made Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, strong for three years because they walked three years in the way of David and of Solomon.
2CH.11.18	And Rehoboam took Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, the son of David, to wife, and Abihail, the daughter of Eliab, the son of Jesse;
2CH.11.19	who bore him sons: Jeush and Shamariah and Zaham.
2CH.11.20	And after her he took Maachah, the daughter of Absalom, who bore him Abijah and Attai and Ziza and Shelomith.
2CH.11.21	But Rehoboam loved Maachah, the daughter of Absalom, above all his wives and his concubines (for he took eighteen wives and sixty concubines and begat twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.)
2CH.11.22	And Rehoboam made Abijah, the son of Maachah, as head and prince among his brethren, for he thought to make him king.
2CH.11.23	And he caused him to be instructed and dispersed of all his sons throughout all the lands of Judah and Benjamin, unto every fenced city; and he gave them provisions in abundance. And he desired many wives.
2CH.12.1	And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had confirmed the kingdom and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the 
2CH.12.2	And it came to pass that in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, because they had rebelled against the 
2CH.12.3	with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen; and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt: the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.
2CH.12.4	And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah and came to Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	Then Shemaiah, the prophet, went to Rehoboam and to the princes of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of Shishak, and said unto them, Thus hath the 
2CH.12.6	And the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves; and they said, The 
2CH.12.7	And when the 
2CH.12.8	Nevertheless, they shall be his slaves that they may know what it is to serve me and to serve the kingdoms of the nations.
2CH.12.9	So Shishak, king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem and took away the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.12.10	And in their place King Rehoboam made shields of brass and committed them to the hands of the princes of the guard that kept the entrance of the king’s house.
2CH.12.11	And when the king entered into the house of the 
2CH.12.12	And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the 
2CH.12.13	So King Rehoboam was strengthened and reigned in Jerusalem; and Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the 
2CH.12.14	And he did evil because he did not prepare his heart to seek the 
2CH.12.15	Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written in the book of Shemaiah, the prophet, and of Iddo, the seer concerning genealogies? And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
2CH.12.16	And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David, and Abijah, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.13.1	Now in the year eighteen of King Jeroboam, Abijah began to reign over Judah.
2CH.13.2	He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam.
2CH.13.3	And Abijah set the battle in order with an army of valiant men of war, four hundred thousand chosen men; and Jeroboam set the battle in array against him with eight hundred thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.
2CH.13.4	And Abijah stood up upon Mount Zemaraim, which is in the mountains of Ephraim, and said, Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel;
2CH.13.5	do ye not know that the 
2CH.13.6	Yet Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, the slave of Solomon the son of David, is risen up and has rebelled against his lord.
2CH.13.7	And there are gathered unto him vain men, the sons of Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted and could not withstand them.
2CH.13.8	And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the 
2CH.13.9	Have ye not cast out the priests of the 
2CH.13.10	But as for us, the 
2CH.13.11	and they burn unto the 
2CH.13.12	And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the 
2CH.13.13	But Jeroboam caused an ambush to come about behind them; so they were before Judah, and the ambush was behind them.
2CH.13.14	So when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and behind; and they cried unto the 
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah gave a shout, and as the men of Judah shouted, it came to pass that God smote Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.
2CH.13.16	And the sons of Israel fled before Judah, and God delivered them into their hand.
2CH.13.17	And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter; so there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen men.
2CH.13.18	Thus the sons of Israel were humbled at that time, and the sons of Judah prevailed because they relied upon the 
2CH.13.19	And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam and took cities from him, Bethel with its towns and Jeshanah with its towns and Ephron with its towns.
2CH.13.20	Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of Abijah; and the 
2CH.13.21	But Abijah waxed mighty and married fourteen wives, and begat twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
2CH.13.22	And the rest of the acts of Abijah and his ways and his words are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.1	So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David, and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his days the land had rest ten years.
2CH.14.2	And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the 
2CH.14.3	for he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and broke down the images and cut down the groves
2CH.14.4	and commanded Judah to seek the 
2CH.14.5	Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images, and the kingdom had rest before him.
2CH.14.6	And he built fenced cities in Judah, for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years because the 
2CH.14.7	Therefore, he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers, gates, and bars, now that the land is ours; because we have sought the 
2CH.14.8	And Asa had an army of men that bore shields and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand and out of Benjamin, that bore shields and drew bows, two hundred and eighty thousand; all these were mighty men of valour.
2CH.14.9	And there came out against them Zerah, the Ethiopian, with a host of a thousand thousand and three hundred chariots and came unto Mareshah.
2CH.14.10	Then Asa went out against him, and they ordered the battle in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
2CH.14.11	And Asa cried unto the 
2CH.14.12	So the 
2CH.14.13	And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar, and the Ethiopians were overthrown until there were none left alive, for they were destroyed before the 
2CH.14.14	And they smote all the cities round about Gerar, for the fear of the 
2CH.14.15	They smote also the booths of livestock and carried away sheep and camels in abundance and returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah, the son of Oded;
2CH.15.2	and he went out to meet Asa and said unto him, Hear me, Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin: The 
2CH.15.3	For many days Israel has been without the true God, and without a priest and without a teacher and without law,
2CH.15.4	but when they in their trouble turned unto the 
2CH.15.5	And in those times there was no peace to him that went out, nor to him that came in, but great destruction upon all the inhabitants of the lands.
2CH.15.6	And one Gentile destroyed the other, and one city the other; for God discomforted them with all adversity.
2CH.15.7	Be ye strong, therefore, and do not let your hands be weak, for your work shall be rewarded.
2CH.15.8	And when Asa heard the words and prophecy of Oded, the prophet, he was comforted and put away the abominations out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin and out of the cities which he had taken in Mount Ephraim and repaired the altar of the 
2CH.15.9	And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon, for many of Israel had gone over to him, when they saw that the 
2CH.15.10	So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.
2CH.15.11	And they offered unto the 
2CH.15.12	And they entered into a covenant to seek the 
2CH.15.13	that whoever would not seek the 
2CH.15.14	And they swore unto the 
2CH.15.15	And all those of Judah rejoiced at the oath, for they had sworn with all their heart and sought him with their whole desire; and he was found of them; and the 
2CH.15.16	And also concerning Maachah, the mother of Asa the king, he removed her from being queen because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa cut down her idol and stamped it and burnt it at the brook Kidron.
2CH.15.17	But with all this the high places were not taken away out of Israel; nevertheless, the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.
2CH.15.18	And he brought into the house of God the things that his father had dedicated and that he himself had dedicated, silver and gold and vessels.
2CH.15.19	And there was no more war until the year thirty-five of the reign of Asa.
2CH.16.1	In the year thirty-six of the reign of Asa, Baasha, king of Israel, came up against Judah and built Ramah, to the intent that he might let no one go out or come in to Asa, king of Judah.
2CH.16.2	Then Asa brought out the silver and the gold out of the treasuries of the house of the 
2CH.16.3	There is a covenant between me and thee, as there was between my father and thy father; behold, I have sent thee silver and gold; go, break thy league with Baasha, king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
2CH.16.4	And Benhadad hearkened unto King Asa and sent the captains of his armies against the cities of Israel, and they smote Ijon and Dan and Abelmaim and all the store cities of Naphtali.
2CH.16.5	And when Baasha heard it, he left off building of Ramah and let his work cease.
2CH.16.6	Then Asa, the king, took all Judah, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and the timber thereof, with which Baasha was building, and he built Geba and Mizpah with it.
2CH.16.7	And at that time Hanani, the seer, came to Asa, king of Judah, and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of Syria, and not relied on the 
2CH.16.8	Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because thou didst rely on the 
2CH.16.9	For the eyes of the 
2CH.16.10	Then Asa was wroth with the seer and put him in the prison house, for he was in a rage with him because of this thing. And Asa killed some of the people at the same time.
2CH.16.11	And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2CH.16.12	And Asa in the year thirty-nine of his reign was diseased from his feet up; yet in his disease he did not seek the 
2CH.16.13	And Asa slept with his fathers and died in the year forty-one of his reign.
2CH.16.14	And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odours and aromas prepared by the apothecaries’ art; and they made a very great burning for him.
2CH.17.1	And Jehoshaphat, his son, reigned in his stead and prevailed against Israel.
2CH.17.2	And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah and set garrisons in the land of Judah and likewise in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa, his father had taken.
2CH.17.3	And the 
2CH.17.4	but sought the 
2CH.17.5	Therefore, the 
2CH.17.6	And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the 
2CH.17.7	Also in the third year of his reign he sent his princes, Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethaneel, and Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.
2CH.17.8	And with them he sent the Levites, Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites, and with them Elishama and Jehoram, priests.
2CH.17.9	And they taught in Judah and had the book of the law of the 
2CH.17.10	And the fear of the 
2CH.17.11	And the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents and tribute of silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred he goats.
2CH.17.12	And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah castles and cities of store.
2CH.17.13	And he had many works in the cities of Judah and men of war, mighty men of valour, in Jerusalem.
2CH.17.14	And these are the numbers of them according to the houses of their fathers: In Judah, princes of thousands; the prince Adnah and with him three hundred thousand mighty men of valour;
2CH.17.15	and after him, Prince Jehohanan and with him two hundred and eighty thousand;
2CH.17.16	after him, Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly offered himself unto the 
2CH.17.17	of Benjamin, Eliada, a mighty man of valour, and with him two hundred thousand armed with bow and shield;
2CH.17.18	after him, Jehozabad and with him one hundred and eighty thousand ready and prepared for the war.
2CH.17.19	These were servants of the king, besides those whom the king had put in the fenced cities throughout all Judah.
2CH.18.1	Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and married into the family of Ahab.
2CH.18.2	And after a few years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead.
2CH.18.3	And Ahab, king of Israel, said unto Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war.
2CH.18.4	And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the 
2CH.18.5	Therefore, the king of Israel gathered together of prophets four hundred men and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, for God will deliver it into the king’s hand.
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat said, Is there yet here a prophet of the 
2CH.18.7	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man here, by whom we may enquire of the 
2CH.18.8	So the king of Israel called for a eunuch and said, Bring quickly Micaiah, the son of Imla.
2CH.18.9	And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, were each sitting on their thrones, clothed in their robes, and they sat in the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesied before them.
2CH.18.10	And Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, had made himself horns of iron and said, Thus hath the 
2CH.18.11	And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead and be prospered, for the 
2CH.18.12	And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good.
2CH.18.13	And Micaiah said, As the 
2CH.18.14	And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle or shall I forbear? And he said, Go up, and ye shall be prospered; they shall be delivered into your hands.
2CH.18.15	And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the 
2CH.18.16	Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the 
2CH.18.17	And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?
2CH.18.18	So he said, Therefore, hear the word of the 
2CH.18.19	And the 
2CH.18.20	Then a spirit came out and stood before the 
2CH.18.21	And he said, I will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the 
2CH.18.22	Now, therefore, behold, the 
2CH.18.23	Then Zedekiah, the son of Chenaanah, came near and smote Micaiah upon the cheek and said, Which way did the Spirit of the 
2CH.18.24	And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go from chamber to chamber to hide thyself.
2CH.18.25	Then the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah and carry him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king’s son
2CH.18.26	and say, Thus hath the king said, Put this fellow in the prison and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I return in peace.
2CH.18.27	And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then the 
2CH.18.28	So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, went up to Ramothgilead.
2CH.18.29	And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself to enter into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself and entered into the battle.
2CH.18.30	Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight not with small nor great, but only with the king of Israel.
2CH.18.31	And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, It is the king of Israel. Therefore, they compassed about him to fight; but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the 
2CH.18.32	And when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they withdrew from pursuing him.
2CH.18.33	But a certain man drew a bow in all his perfection and smote the king of Israel between the joints of his coat of mail; therefore, he said to his chariot man, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the camp, for I am wounded.
2CH.18.34	And the battle increased that day; howbeit, the king of Israel stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the evening, and about the time of the sun going down he died.
2CH.19.1	And Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, returned to his house in peace to Jerusalem.
2CH.19.2	And Jehu, the son of Hanani, the seer, went out to meet him and said to king Jehoshaphat, Should thou help the ungodly and love those that hate the 
2CH.19.3	Nevertheless, good things have been found in thee, in that thou hast burned down the groves of the land and hast prepared thy heart to seek God.
2CH.19.4	And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem, and he went out again through the people from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim and brought them back unto the 
2CH.19.5	And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities of Judah, city by city,
2CH.19.6	and said to the judges, Take heed what ye do, for ye do not judge for man, but for the 
2CH.19.7	Therefore, now let the fear of the 
2CH.19.8	Moreover, in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat placed some of the Levites and of the priests and of the heads of the fathers of Israel for the judgment of the 
2CH.19.9	And he charged them, saying, Ye shall proceed thus in the fear of the 
2CH.19.10	In whatever case that shall come to you of your brethren that dwell in their cities, between blood and blood, between law and commandment, statutes or rights, ye shall warn them lest they become guilty against the 
2CH.19.11	Behold, Amariah, the high priest, who shall be over you in all matters of the 
2CH.20.1	It came to pass after this also that the sons of Moab and the sons of Ammon and with them others besides the Ammonites came against Jehoshaphat to battle.
2CH.20.2	Then some came and told Jehoshaphat, saying, There comes a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea, and from Syria; and, behold, they are in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi.
2CH.20.3	Then Jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the 
2CH.20.4	And Judah gathered themselves together, to consult the 
2CH.20.5	And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the 
2CH.20.6	and said, O 
2CH.20.7	Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel and didst give it to the seed of Abraham, thy friend, for ever?
2CH.20.8	And they have dwelt in it and have built thee a sanctuary in it for thy name, saying,
2CH.20.9	If evil comes upon us or the sword of judgment or pestilence or famine, we shall stand before this house and in thy presence (for thy name is in this house) and cry unto thee out of our tribulations, and thou wilt hear us and save us.
2CH.20.10	And now, behold, the sons of Ammon and of Moab and those of Mount Seir, whose land thou would not let Israel enter when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them and did not destroy them;
2CH.20.11	behold they reward us by coming to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.
2CH.20.12	O our God, wilt thou not judge them? For we have no might against this great company that comes against us; we do not know what to do; but our eyes are fixed upon thee.
2CH.20.13	And all Judah stood before the 
2CH.20.14	Then upon Jahaziel, the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the 
2CH.20.15	and he said, Hearken, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and thou King Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the 
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow ye shall go down against them; behold, they shall come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them next to the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel.
2CH.20.17	Ye shall not need to fight in this battle; set yourselves, stand still, and see the salvation of the 
2CH.20.18	Then Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and likewise all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the 
2CH.20.19	And the Levites, of the sons of the Kohath and of the sons of the Korah, stood up to praise the 
2CH.20.20	And when they arose early in the morning and while they were going forth into the wilderness of Tekoa, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem; Believe the 
2CH.20.21	And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed some to sing unto the 
2CH.20.22	And when they began to sing and to praise, the 
2CH.20.23	And the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them; and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir, each one helped his companion to kill himself.
2CH.20.24	And when Judah came to the watch tower of the wilderness, they looked for the multitude, and, behold, they were fallen to the earth dead, for none had escaped.
2CH.20.25	And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to spoil them, they found among them an abundance of riches and of dead bodies and clothing and precious vessels which they took for themselves, more than they could carry away; and they were three days gathering in the spoil, it was so much.
2CH.20.26	And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah {Heb. of Blessing}; for there they blessed the 
2CH.20.27	Then they returned, those of Judah and those of Jerusalem with Jehoshaphat at their head, to go again to Jerusalem with joy, for the 
2CH.20.28	And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the 
2CH.20.29	And the fear of God came upon all the kingdoms of the land when they heard how the 
2CH.20.30	So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat had rest, for his God gave him rest round about.
2CH.20.31	Thus Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah; he was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
2CH.20.32	And he walked in the way of Asa, his father, and did not depart from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.20.33	With all this the high places were not taken away, for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers.
2CH.20.34	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu, the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.
2CH.20.35	After these things, Jehoshaphat, king of Judah, joined himself with Ahaziah, king of Israel, who was given over to wickedness;
2CH.20.36	he joined himself with him to make ships to go to Tarshish, and they made the ships in Eziongeber.
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer, the son of Dodavah of Mareshah, prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the 
2CH.21.1	Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.21.2	And he had brethren, sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.
2CH.21.3	And their father had given them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah, but he gave the kingdom to Jehoram because he was the firstborn.
2CH.21.4	Now Jehoram rose up against the kingdom of his father, and he strengthened himself and slew all his brethren with the sword and likewise some of the princes of Israel.
2CH.21.5	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.
2CH.21.6	And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did the house of Ahab, for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife; and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.21.7	However, the 
2CH.21.8	In his days Edom rebelled from under the dominion of Judah and made themselves a king.
2CH.21.9	Then Jehoram went forth with his princes and all his chariots with him, and he rose up by night and smote Edom who had compassed him in and all the captains of the chariots.
2CH.21.10	With all this Edom remained in rebellion, out from under the hand of Judah unto this day. Libnah also rebelled at the same time to not be under his hand because he had forsaken the 
2CH.21.11	Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication and compelled Judah unto this.
2CH.21.12	And a writing came to him from Elijah, the prophet, that said this: Thus hath the 
2CH.21.13	but hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel and hast made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fornicate, like unto the fornication of the house of Ahab, and also hast slain thy brethren of thy father’s house, who were better than thyself,
2CH.21.14	behold, the 
2CH.21.15	and thou shalt have great sickness, with disease of thy bowels, until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by day.
2CH.21.16	Then the 
2CH.21.17	and they came up against Judah and invaded the land and carried away all the substance that was found in the king’s house, and his sons also and his wives so that none of his sons remained except Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.
2CH.21.18	And after all this the 
2CH.21.19	And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness; so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like they had done for his fathers.
2CH.21.20	He was thirty-two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years and departed without being desired. And they buried him in the city of David, but not in the sepulchres of the kings.
2CH.22.1	And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, his youngest son, king in his stead; for the band of men that came with the Arabians to the camp had slain all the elder sons. So Ahaziah the son of Jehoram, king of Judah reigned.
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was forty-two years old {another text: twenty-two} when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri.
2CH.22.3	He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab, for his mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.
2CH.22.4	Therefore, he did evil in the sight of the 
2CH.22.5	And He walked after their counsel and went with Jehoram, the son of Ahab, king of Israel, to war against Hazael, king of Syria at Ramothgilead, where the Syrians smote Joram.
2CH.22.6	And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria. And Azariah, the son of Jehoram, king of Judah went down to see Jehoram, the son of Ahab, at Jezreel, because he was there sick.
2CH.22.7	But this was of God so that Ahaziah would be tread under foot by coming to Joram; for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram to encounter Jehu, the son of Nimshi, whom the 
2CH.22.8	And it came to pass that when Jehu was executing judgment upon the house of Ahab and found the princes of Judah and the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to Ahaziah, he slew them.
2CH.22.9	And he sought Ahaziah, and they caught him (for he had hid himself in Samaria) and brought him to Jehu; and when they had slain him, they buried him, Because, they said, He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the 
2CH.22.10	So when Athaliah, the mother of Ahaziah, saw that her son was dead, she arose and destroyed all the royal seed of the house of Judah.
2CH.22.11	But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash, the son of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king’s sons that were being slain, and kept him and his nurse in the bedchamber. So Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of Jehoiada, the priest (for she was the sister of Ahaziah) hid him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.
2CH.22.12	And he was with them hid in the house of God six years; and Athaliah reigned over the land.
2CH.23.1	And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself and took the captains of hundreds, Azariah, the son of Jeroham, and Ishmael, the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah, the son of Obed, and Maaseiah, the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat, the son of Zichri, into covenant with him.
2CH.23.2	And they went about in Judah and gathered the Levites out of all the cities of Judah and the heads of the fathers of Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.
2CH.23.3	And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king’s son who shall reign, as the 
2CH.23.4	This is the thing that ye must do: A third part of you, those who enter on the sabbath, shall be porters at the doors with the priests and the Levites;
2CH.23.5	and a third part shall be at the king’s house; and a third part at the gate of the foundation; and all the people shall be in the courts of the house of the 
2CH.23.6	But let no one come into the house of the 
2CH.23.7	And the Levites shall compass the king round about, each one shall have his weapons in his hand; and whoever else comes into the house shall be put to death; and ye shall be with the king when he comes in and when he goes out.
2CH.23.8	So the Levites and all Judah did according to all the things that Jehoiada, the priest, had commanded, and each one took his men, those that were to come in on the sabbath with those that were to go out on the sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss the courses.
2CH.23.9	Moreover, Jehoiada, the priest, delivered to the captains of hundreds spears and bucklers and shields, that had been king David’s, which were in the house of God.
2CH.23.10	And he set all the people in order, each one having his weapon in his hand, from the right side of the house to the left side of the house, along by the altar and the house, by the king round about.
2CH.23.11	Then they brought out the king’s son and put the crown upon him and gave him the testimony and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed him and said, Long live the king.
2CH.23.12	Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running of those that were praising the king, she came to the people into the house of the 
2CH.23.13	And she looked and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at the entrance and the princes and the trumpets by the king; and all the people of the land rejoiced and sounded with trumpets, and those that knew how to praise sang with instruments of music. Then Athaliah rent her clothes and said, Treason, Treason.
2CH.23.14	Then Jehoiada, the priest, brought out the captains of hundreds that were set over the host and said unto them, Remove her from the order of the house, and whoever follows her, let them be slain with the sword. For the priest had commanded, Slay her not in the house of the 
2CH.23.15	So they laid hands on her, and she entered into the entrance of the horse gate of the king’s house, and they slew her there.
2CH.23.16	And Jehoiada made a covenant between him and between all the people and between the king that they should be the 
2CH.23.17	Then all the people went to the house of Baal and broke it down and broke in pieces his altars and his images and slew Mattan, the priest of Baal, before the altars.
2CH.23.18	Also Jehoiada ordered the offices of the house of the 
2CH.23.19	He also set the porters at the gates of the house of the 
2CH.23.20	Then he took the captains of hundreds and the nobles and those that governed the people and all the people of the land and brought down the king from the house of the 
2CH.23.21	And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was at rest after they had slain Athaliah with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah of Beersheba.
2CH.24.2	And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.24.3	And Jehoiada took for him two wives, and he begat sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	And it came to pass after this that Joash desired to repair the house of the 
2CH.24.5	And he gathered together the priests and the Levites and said to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah and gather of all Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to year, and be diligent in this matter. However the Levites were not diligent.
2CH.24.6	Therefore the king called for Jehoiada, the chief, and said unto him, Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of Judah and out of Jerusalem unto the tabernacle of the testimony the collection, according to the commandment of Moses, the slave of the 
2CH.24.7	For the wicked woman, Athaliah, and her sons had broken up the house of God, and they had also bestowed all the dedicated things of the house of the 
2CH.24.8	And at the king’s commandment they made an ark and set it outside at the gate of the house of the 
2CH.24.9	And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem to bring in to the 
2CH.24.10	And all the princes and all the people rejoiced and brought in and cast into the ark until they had fulfilled their duty.
2CH.24.11	Now it came to pass, that at what time the ark was brought unto the king’s office by the hand of the Levites and when they saw that there was much money, the king’s scribe and the high priest’s officer came and emptied the ark and took it and returned it to its place. Thus they did day by day and gathered money in abundance.
2CH.24.12	And the king and Jehoiada gave it to those that did the work of the service of the house of the 
2CH.24.13	So the workmen wrought, and by their hands the work was done, and they restored the house of God and strengthened it.
2CH.24.14	And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the money before the king and Jehoiada, of which they made vessels for the house of the 
2CH.24.15	But Jehoiada waxed old and was full of days when he died; he was one hundred and thirty years old when he died.
2CH.24.16	And they buried him in the city of David among the kings because he had done good in Israel, both toward God and toward his house.
2CH.24.17	Now after the death of Jehoiada, the princes of Judah came and worshipped the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.
2CH.24.18	And they left the house of the 
2CH.24.19	Yet he sent prophets to them to bring them again unto the 
2CH.24.20	And the Spirit of God clothed himself in Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, the priest, who being over the people, said unto them, Thus hath God said, Why do ye transgress the commandments of the 
2CH.24.21	And they conspired against him and stoned him with stones at the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the 
2CH.24.22	Thus Joash, the king, did not remember the mercy which Jehoiada, his father, had done to him but slew his son; who said when he died, The 
2CH.24.23	And at the end of the year, the host of Syria came up against him, and they came to Judah and Jerusalem and destroyed all the princes of the people from among the people and sent all the spoil of them unto the king of Damascus.
2CH.24.24	For even though the army of the Syrians had come with a small company of men, the 
2CH.24.25	And when they were departed from him (for they left him in great diseases), his own slaves conspired against him for the blood of the sons of Jehoiada, the priest, and slew him on his bed, and he died; and they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the sepulchres of the kings.
2CH.24.26	Those that conspired against him were Zabad, the son of Shimeath, an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad, the son of Shimrith, a Moabitess.
2CH.24.27	Now concerning his sons, and of the multiplication that he did of the taxes and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
2CH.25.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.25.3	For when he was confirmed in the kingdom, he slew his slaves that had killed the king, his father.
2CH.25.4	But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in the law in the book of Moses where the 
2CH.25.5	Moreover, Amaziah gathered Judah together and made them captains over thousands and captains over hundreds, according to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and Benjamin; and he numbered them from twenty years old and above and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.
2CH.25.6	He also hired one hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of Israel for one hundred talents of silver.
2CH.25.7	But a man of God came unto him, saying, O king, do not let not the army of Israel go with thee, for the 
2CH.25.8	But if thou wilt go, if thou wilt do it, and strengthen thyself for the battle, God shall make thee fall before the enemy; for in God is the strength, to help or to cast down.
2CH.25.9	Then Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel? And the man of God answered, The 
2CH.25.10	Then Amaziah separated the army of those that had come to him out of Ephraim, to go home again; therefore, their anger was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in great anger.
2CH.25.11	And Amaziah strengthened himself and led forth his people and went to the valley of salt and smote of the sons of Seir, ten thousand.
2CH.25.12	And the sons of Judah took another ten thousand alive, whom they took unto the top of the rock and cast them down from the top of the rock, and they were all broken in pieces.
2CH.25.13	But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three thousand of them and took much spoil.
2CH.25.14	Now after Amaziah came back from the slaughter of the Edomites, he brought the gods of the sons of Seir and set them up to be his gods and bowed down before them and burned incense unto them.
2CH.25.15	Therefore, the anger of the 
2CH.25.16	And as the prophet was speaking these things unto him, he said unto him, Art thou appointed as the king’s counsel? Forbear; why should thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare and said, I know that God has determined to destroy thee because thou hast done this and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.
2CH.25.17	Then Amaziah, king of Judah, took advice and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying, Come, let us see one another face to face.
2CH.25.18	And Joash, king of Israel, sent to Amaziah, king of Judah, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife. And behold, the wild beasts that were in Lebanon, passed by, and trode down the thistle.
2CH.25.19	Thou sayest, Behold, I have smitten Edom; and with this thy heart lifts thee up to boast; abide now at home; why should thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou should fall, even thou, and Judah with thee?
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they had sought after the gods of Edom.
2CH.25.21	So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another face to face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at Bethshemesh, which is of Judah.
2CH.25.22	But Judah fell before Israel, and they fled each man to his tent.
2CH.25.23	And Joash, the king of Israel, took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.
2CH.25.24	And he took all the gold and the silver and all the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obededom and the treasures of the king’s house, the hostages also, and returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	And Amaziah, the son of Joash, king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel, fifteen years.
2CH.25.26	Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel?
2CH.25.27	From the time that Amaziah turned away from following the 
2CH.25.28	And they brought him upon horses and buried him with his fathers in the city of Judah.
2CH.26.1	Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in the place of his father Amaziah.
2CH.26.2	He built Eloth and restored it to Judah, after the king slept with his fathers.
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.
2CH.26.4	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.26.5	And he persisted in seeking God in the days of Zechariah, who had understanding in the visions of God; and in those days that he sought the 
2CH.26.6	For he went forth and warred against the Philistines and broke down the wall of Gath and the wall of Jabneh and the wall of Ashdod and built cities about Ashdod and among the Philistines.
2CH.26.7	And God helped him against the Philistines and against the Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal and against the Mehunims.
2CH.26.8	And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah; and his name spread abroad even to the entrance of Egypt, for he strengthened himself exceedingly.
2CH.26.9	Moreover, Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the corners and fortified them.
2CH.26.10	He also built towers in the desert and dug many wells, for he had much livestock, both in the low country and in the plains, husbandmen also and vine dressers in the mountains and in Carmel, for he loved agriculture.
2CH.26.11	Moreover Uzziah had an army of fighting men that went out to war in companies, according to the number of their account by the hand of Jeiel, the scribe, and Maaseiah, the governor, under the hand of Hananiah, one of the king’s princes.
2CH.26.12	The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men of valour were two thousand six hundred.
2CH.26.13	And under their hand was an army, a host of three hundred and seven thousand five hundred, that made war with mighty power, to help the king against the enemy.
2CH.26.14	And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields and spears and helmets and coats of mail and bows and slings to cast stones.
2CH.26.15	And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks to shoot arrows and great stones with. And his name spread far abroad, for he was marvelously helped until he was strong.
2CH.26.16	But when he was strengthened, his heart lifted itself up unto corruption, for he rebelled against the 
2CH.26.17	And Azariah, the priest, went in after him, and with him eighty priests of the 
2CH.26.18	And they withstood Uzziah, the king, and said unto him, It does not pertain unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the 
2CH.26.19	Then Uzziah was angry and had a censer in his hand to burn incense; and in this his anger with the priests, the leprosy rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house of the 
2CH.26.20	And Azariah, the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they thrust him out from there, and he also hastened to go out because the 
2CH.26.21	And Uzziah, the king, was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a separate house, being a leper; for he was cut off from the house of the 
2CH.26.22	Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last were written by Isaiah, the prophet, the son of Amoz.
2CH.26.23	So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his fathers in the royal burial field, for they said, He is a leper. And Jotham, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.
2CH.27.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.27.3	He built the high gate of the house of the 
2CH.27.4	Moreover, he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.
2CH.27.5	He fought also with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed against them. And the sons of Ammon gave him the same year one hundred talents of silver and ten thousand measures of wheat and ten thousand of barley. So much did the sons of Ammon pay unto him, both the second year and the third.
2CH.27.6	So Jotham became mighty because he prepared his ways before the 
2CH.27.7	Now the rest of the acts of Jotham and all his wars and his ways, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.27.8	He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign and reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.
2CH.27.9	And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David; and Ahaz, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem; but he did not do that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.28.2	To the contrary he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel and also made molten images unto Baalim.
2CH.28.3	Moreover, he burnt incense in the valley of the sons of Hinnom and burnt his sons in the fire, after the abominations of the Gentiles whom the 
2CH.28.4	He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and on the hills and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	Therefore, the 
2CH.28.6	For Pekah, the son of Remaliah, slew in Judah one hundred and twenty thousand in one day, who were all valiant men, because they had forsaken the 
2CH.28.7	And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah, the king’s son, and Azrikam, the governor of the house, and Elkanah, second after the king.
2CH.28.8	And the sons of Israel carried away captive of their brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, in addition to taking much spoil from them, which they brought to Samaria.
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the 
2CH.28.10	And now ye purpose to keep subject the sons of Judah and Jerusalem for menslaves and womenslaves unto you, but are ye not guilty against the 
2CH.28.11	Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which ye have taken captive of your brethren; for the fierce wrath of the 
2CH.28.12	Then certain of the heads of the sons of Ephraim, Azariah, the son of Johanan, Berechiah, the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah, the son of Shallum, and Amasa, the son of Hadlai, stood up against those that came from the war
2CH.28.13	and said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives here, for the sin against the 
2CH.28.14	So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the princes and all the congregation.
2CH.28.15	And the men which were expressed by name rose up and took the captives, and, with the spoil, clothed all that were naked among them and arrayed them and shod them and gave them to eat and to drink and anointed them and carried all the feeble of them upon asses and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brethren; then they returned to Samaria.
2CH.28.16	At that time King Ahaz sent unto the kings of Assyria to help him.
2CH.28.17	For in addition to this, the Edomites had come and smitten Judah and carried away captives.
2CH.28.18	The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country and towards the Negev of Judah and had taken Bethshemesh and Ajalon and Gederoth and Shocho with its villages and Timnah with its villages, Gimzo also and its villages, and they dwelt in them.
2CH.28.19	For the 
2CH.28.20	And Tilgathpilneser, king of Assyria, came unto him, and distressed him but did not strengthen him.
2CH.28.21	For even though Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the 
2CH.28.22	Furthermore, king Ahaz in the time of his distress trespassed even more against the 
2CH.28.23	for he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, who had smitten him, and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them; therefore, I will also sacrifice to them that they may help me. But they were the ruin of him and of all Israel.
2CH.28.24	And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God and shut up the doors of the house of the 
2CH.28.25	And in all the cities of Judah he made high places to burn incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the 
2CH.28.26	Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2CH.28.27	And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of Jerusalem, but they did not bring him into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel; and Hezekiah, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah began to reign when he was twenty-five years old, and he reigned twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
2CH.29.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.29.3	In the first year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the 
2CH.29.4	And he brought in the priests and the Levites and gathered them together into the east plaza
2CH.29.5	and said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now yourselves, and ye shall sanctify the house of the 
2CH.29.6	For our fathers have rebelled and done that which was evil in the eyes of the 
2CH.29.7	They even shut up the doors of the porch and put out the lamps and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the sanctuary unto the God of Israel.
2CH.29.8	Therefore, the wrath of the 
2CH.29.9	For, behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.
2CH.29.10	Now it is in my heart to make a covenant with the 
2CH.29.11	My sons, do not deceive yourselves, for the 
2CH.29.12	Then the Levites arose, Mahath, the son of Amasai, and Joel, the son of Azariah, of the sons of Kohath; and of the sons of Merari, Kish, the son of Abdi, and Azariah, the son of Jehalelel; and of the sons of Gershon; Joah, the son of Zimmah, and Eden, the son of Joah;
2CH.29.13	and of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri and Jeiel; and of the sons of Asaph; Zechariah and Mattaniah;
2CH.29.14	and of the sons of Heman; Jehiel and Shimei; and of the sons of Jeduthun; Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2CH.29.15	And they gathered their brethren and sanctified themselves and entered in, according to the commandment of the king, by the words of the 
2CH.29.16	And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the 
2CH.29.17	Now they began to sanctify on the first day of the first month, and on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of the 
2CH.29.18	Then they went in to Hezekiah, the king, and said, We have cleansed all the house of the 
2CH.29.19	Likewise we have prepared and sanctified all the vessels, which King Ahaz in his reign cast away in his transgression, and, behold, they are before the altar of the 
2CH.29.20	Then Hezekiah, the king, rose early and gathered the rulers of the city and went up to the house of the 
2CH.29.21	And they offered seven bullocks and seven rams and seven lambs and seven he goats, for the sin of the kingdom and of the sanctuary and of Judah. And he commanded the priests, the sons of Aaron, to offer them on the altar of the 
2CH.29.22	So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the blood and sprinkled it on the altar; likewise, when they had killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar; they also killed the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the altar.
2CH.29.23	And they brought forth the he goats of the sin before the king and the congregation, and they laid their hands upon them;
2CH.29.24	and the priests killed them, and they removed the sin with their blood upon the altar, to reconcile all Israel, for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the atonement for sin should be offered for all Israel.
2CH.29.25	And he set the Levites in the house of the 
2CH.29.26	And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the 
2CH.29.28	And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and the trumpets sounded; and all this continued until the burnt offering was finished.
2CH.29.29	And when they had finished offering, the king and all that were present with him bowed themselves and worshipped.
2CH.29.30	Moreover, Hezekiah, the king, and the princes commanded the Levites to sing praise unto the 
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated yourselves unto the 
2CH.29.32	And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation brought, was seventy bullocks, one hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all these were for the burnt offering of the 
2CH.29.33	And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three thousand sheep.
2CH.29.34	But the priests were too few so that they could not flay all the burnt offerings; therefore, their brethren, the Levites, helped them until the work was ended and until the other priests had sanctified themselves, for the Levites were more upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
2CH.29.35	And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat of the peace offerings and the drink offerings for every burnt offering. So the service of the house of the 
2CH.29.36	And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had prepared the people, for the thing was done suddenly.
2CH.30.1	And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the house of the 
2CH.30.2	For the king had taken counsel with his princes and with all the congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second month.
2CH.30.3	For they could not keep it at that time, because there were not enough priests sanctified, neither had the people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.
2CH.30.4	And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.
2CH.30.5	So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come to keep the passover unto the 
2CH.30.6	So the posts went with the letters from the hand of the king and his princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the commandment of the king, saying, Ye sons of Israel, return unto the 
2CH.30.7	Do not be like your fathers, and like your brethren, who rebelled against the 
2CH.30.8	Therefore, do not be stiffnecked as your fathers were, but yield yourselves unto the 
2CH.30.9	For if ye return unto the 
2CH.30.10	So the posts passed from city to city through the land of Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun, but they laughed them to scorn and mocked them.
2CH.30.11	Nevertheless, some men of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
2CH.30.12	Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do the commandment of the king and of the princes, according to the word of the 
2CH.30.13	And many people assembled at Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great congregation.
2CH.30.14	And they arose and took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and they also took away all the altars for incense and cast them into the brook Kidron.
2CH.30.15	Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the second month, and the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves with shame and brought in the burnt offerings into the house of the 
2CH.30.16	And they put themselves in order according to the ordinance, according to the law of Moses, the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood, which they received of the hands of the Levites.
2CH.30.17	For there were yet many in the congregation that were not sanctified; therefore, the Levites had the charge of the killing of the passovers for each one that was not clean, to sanctify them unto the 
2CH.30.18	For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves, and they ate the passover not as it was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good 
2CH.30.19	that has prepared his heart to seek God, the 
2CH.30.20	And the 
2CH.30.21	Thus, the sons of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the solemnity of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness, and the Levites and the priests praised the 
2CH.30.22	And Hezekiah spoke unto the heart of all the Levites that had good understanding to serve the 
2CH.30.23	And the whole assembly took counsel to keep another seven days, and they kept another seven days with gladness.
2CH.30.24	For Hezekiah, king of Judah, had given to the congregation a thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep, and the princes gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand sheep, and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.
2CH.30.25	And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.
2CH.30.26	So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel there was not the like in Jerusalem.
2CH.30.27	Then the priests, the Levites, arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to the dwelling place of his sanctuary, unto heaven.
2CH.31.1	Now when all this was finished, all Israel went out, those that were present, to the cities of Judah and broke the images in pieces and cut down the groves and threw down the high places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned, each man to his possession, into their own cities.
2CH.31.2	And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the Levites after their courses, each man according to his service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for peace offerings, to minister and to give thanks and to praise in the gates of the tents of the 
2CH.31.3	The king’s portion of his substance for the burnt offerings was the morning and evening burnt offerings and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths and for the new moons and for the solemn feasts, as it is written in the law of the 
2CH.31.4	Moreover, he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they might be encouraged in the law of the 
2CH.31.5	And as soon as the commandment burst forth and multiplied, an abundance of firstfruits of grain, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field was multiplied unto the sons of Israel; and likewise, they brought in the tithe, of all things in abundance.
2CH.31.6	Also the sons of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in the cities of Judah, gave in the same manner the tithe of the cows and the sheep, and the tithe of that which was sanctified of the things which had been promised unto the 
2CH.31.7	In the third month they began to found those heaps, and they finished them in the seventh month.
2CH.31.8	And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they blessed the 
2CH.31.9	Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites concerning the heaps.
2CH.31.10	And Azariah, the high priest of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings into the house of the 
2CH.31.11	Then Hezekiah commanded that they prepare chambers in the house of the 
2CH.31.12	and brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated things faithfully, over which Cononiah, the Levite, was ruler and Shimei, his brother, was second.
2CH.31.13	And Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah, the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.
2CH.31.14	And Kore, the son of Imnah, the Levite, the porter toward the east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute the offerings of the 
2CH.31.15	And at his hand were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah in the cities of the priests, to faithfully give their brethren their parts according to their courses, to the great the same as to the small.
2CH.31.16	Besides that which is counted for the males from three years old and upward, unto all that entered into the house of the 
2CH.31.17	both to those numbered among the priests by the house of their fathers and among the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in their charges by their courses;
2CH.31.18	and likewise unto those of their generation with all their little ones, their wives, and their sons and daughters, through all the congregation, for in their faithfulness they sanctified themselves in holiness.
2CH.31.19	Likewise, to the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were in the fields of the suburbs of their cities, in all the cities, the men that were expressed by name, gave portions to all the males among the priests and to all the lineage of the Levites.
2CH.31.20	And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah and wrought that which was good and right and true before the 
2CH.31.21	And in every work that he began in the service of the house of God and in the law and in the commandments, he sought God and he did it with all his heart and was prospered.
2CH.32.1	After these things and after this faithfulness, Sennacherib king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped against the fenced cities and thought to break them up.
2CH.32.2	And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come and that he was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,
2CH.32.3	he took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were outside the city, and they helped him.
2CH.32.4	So many people gathered together, and they stopped up all the fountains and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come and find much water?
2CH.32.5	Also he strengthened himself and built up all the wall that was broken and caused the towers to be raised up, and another wall outside, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made swords and shields in abundance.
2CH.32.6	And he set captains of war over the people and gathered them together to him in the plaza of the gate of the city and spoke unto their heart, saying,
2CH.32.7	Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid nor dismayed for the king of Assyria nor for all the multitude that is with him, for there are more with us than with him.
2CH.32.8	With him is an arm of flesh, but with us is the 
2CH.32.9	After this Sennacherib, king of Assyria, sent his slaves to Jerusalem (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,
2CH.32.10	Thus hath said Sennacherib, king of Assyria, In whom do ye trust that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?
2CH.32.11	Does not Hezekiah deceive you to give yourselves over to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The 
2CH.32.12	Has not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar and burn incense upon it?
2CH.32.13	Have ye not known what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? Could peradventure the gods of the Gentiles of those lands deliver their lands out of my hand?
2CH.32.14	Who was there among all the gods of those Gentiles that my fathers utterly destroyed that could deliver his people out of my hands? Why should your God be able to deliver you out of my hand?
2CH.32.15	Now, therefore, do not let Hezekiah deceive you nor persuade you in this matter neither believe him, for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of my hands and out of the hands of my fathers; how much less shall your God deliver you out of my hand?
2CH.32.16	And his slaves spoke yet more against the 
2CH.32.17	In addition to this, he wrote letters that blasphemed the 
2CH.32.18	Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews’ speech unto the people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to make them afraid and to trouble them, that they might take the city.
2CH.32.19	And they spoke against the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man.
2CH.32.20	And for this cause Hezekiah, the king, and the prophet Isaiah, the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.
2CH.32.21	And the 
2CH.32.22	Thus, the 
2CH.32.23	And many brought a present unto the 
2CH.32.24	In those days Hezekiah was sick unto the death and prayed to the 
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah did not render again according to the benefit done unto him, for his heart lifted itself up; therefore there was wrath against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.
2CH.32.26	Notwithstanding, Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the wrath of the 
2CH.32.27	And Hezekiah had exceedingly great riches and honour, and he made himself treasures of silver and of gold and of precious stones and of spices and of shields and of all manner of pleasant vessels,
2CH.32.28	storehouses also for the increase of grain and wine and oil and stalls for all manner of beasts and places for cattle.
2CH.32.29	Moreover, he made himself cities and possessions of sheep and cows in abundance, for God had given him great substance.
2CH.32.30	This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of Gihon and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah was prospered in all that he did.
2CH.32.31	However, because of the ambassadors {Heb. scorners} of the princes of Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that had happened in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart.
2CH.32.32	Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah and his mercy, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.
2CH.32.33	And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David; and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his death. And Manasseh, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he reigned fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
2CH.33.2	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.3	For he rebuilt the high places which Hezekiah, his father, had broken down, and he raised up altars for the Baalim and made groves and worshipped all the host of the heavens and served them.
2CH.33.4	He also built altars in the house of the 
2CH.33.5	He likewise built altars for all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of the 
2CH.33.6	And he caused his sons to pass through the fire in the valley of the sons of Hinnom; he also observed times, used enchantments, and was given over to witchcraft, consulting with spiritists and with diviners; he multiplied in doing much evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.7	In addition to this, he set a graven image, the idol which he had made, in the house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon his son, In this house and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen over all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name for ever;
2CH.33.8	neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of the land which I have appointed for your fathers under the condition that they take, keep, and do all that I have commanded them, the whole law, the statutes and the rights by the hand of Moses.
2CH.33.9	So Manasseh deceived Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to do more evil than the Gentiles, whom the 
2CH.33.10	And the 
2CH.33.11	Therefore, the 
2CH.33.12	And when he was in affliction, he besought the 
2CH.33.13	and when he prayed unto him, he was heard; for he heard his supplication and brought him again to Jerusalem into his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the 
2CH.33.14	Now after this he built the wall outside the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entrance of the fish gate, and fenced Ophel and raised it up to a very great height and put captains of the army in all the fenced cities of Judah.
2CH.33.15	Likewise, he took away the strange gods and the idol out of the house of the 
2CH.33.16	And he repaired the altar of the 
2CH.33.17	Nevertheless, the people still sacrificed in the high places, yet unto the 
2CH.33.18	Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his God and the words of the seers that spoke to him in the name of the 
2CH.33.19	His prayer also and how he was heard, and all his sins, and his trespass, and the places upon which he built high places, and set up groves and graven images, before he humbled himself; behold, these things are written among the words of the seers.
2CH.33.20	So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his own house; and Amon, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he began to reign and reigned two years in Jerusalem.
2CH.33.22	But he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.33.23	But he never humbled himself before the 
2CH.33.24	And his slaves conspired against him and slew him in his own house.
2CH.33.25	But the people of the land slew all those that had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah, his son, king in his stead.
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.
2CH.34.2	And he did that which was right in the sight of the 
2CH.34.3	For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young, he began to seek after the God of David, his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the high places and the groves and the graven images and the molten images.
2CH.34.4	And they broke down the altars of the Baalim in his presence; and the images of the sun, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the groves and the graven images and the molten images, he broke in pieces and made dust of them and scattered it upon the graves of those that had sacrificed unto them.
2CH.34.5	And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars and cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.
2CH.34.6	He did the same in the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim and Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their swords round about.
2CH.34.7	And when he had broken down the altars and the groves and had beaten the graven images into powder and cut down all the idols of the sun throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah, the son of Joahaz, the writer of chronicles, to repair the house of the 
2CH.34.9	And they went to Hilkiah, the high priest, and delivered the money that was brought into the house of God, which the Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim and of all the remnant of Israel and of all Judah and Benjamin, having then returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.10	And they put it in the hand of those that did the work, that had the oversight of the house of the 
2CH.34.11	They also gave to the craftsmen and builders, to buy hewn stone, and timber for couplings, and for the woodwork of the houses which the kings of Judah had destroyed.
2CH.34.12	And the men did the work faithfully, and the overseers of them were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari; and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of Kohath, to set it forward; and others of the Levites, all those with understanding in instruments of music.
2CH.34.13	Also they were over the bearers of burdens and were overseers of all that wrought the work in any manner of service; and of the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.
2CH.34.14	And when they brought out the money that had been brought into the house of the 
2CH.34.15	And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan, the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the 
2CH.34.16	And Shaphan carried the book to the king and brought the king word back again, saying, Thy slaves have fulfilled all that was committed unto them to do.
2CH.34.17	And they have gathered together the money that was found in the house of the 
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan, the scribe, told the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest, has given me a book. And Shaphan read in it before the king.
2CH.34.19	And when the king heard the words of the law, he rent his clothes.
2CH.34.20	And the king commanded Hilkiah and Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, and Abdon, the son of Micah, and Shaphan, the scribe, and Asaiah, a slave of the king’s, saying,
2CH.34.21	Go, enquire of the 
2CH.34.22	Then Hilkiah and those of the king went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the house of doctrine); and they spoke to her to that effect.
2CH.34.23	And she answered them, The 
2CH.34.24	that thus hath the 
2CH.34.25	because they have forsaken me and have sacrificed unto other gods, provoking me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore, my wrath shall be poured out upon this place and shall not be quenched.
2CH.34.26	But as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the 
2CH.34.27	and thy heart became tender, and thou didst humble thyself before God, hearing his words against this place and against its inhabitants and didst humble thyself before me and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me, I also have heard thee, saith the 
2CH.34.28	Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be gathered to thy grave in peace; neither shall thy eyes see all the evil that I will bring upon this place and upon the inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.
2CH.34.29	Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
2CH.34.30	And the king went up into the house of the 
2CH.34.31	And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the 
2CH.34.32	And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.
2CH.34.33	And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the lands that pertained to the sons of Israel and made all that were present in Israel serve the 
2CH.35.1	Moreover, Josiah kept a passover unto the 
2CH.35.2	And he set the priests in their charges and confirmed them in the ministry of the house of the 
2CH.35.3	and said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, who were holy unto the 
2CH.35.4	and prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after your courses, according to the writing of David, king of Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon, his son.
2CH.35.5	And stand in the sanctuary according to the divisions of the families of the fathers of your brethren, the people, and after the division of the families of the Levites.
2CH.35.6	So kill the passover and sanctify yourselves and prepare your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the 
2CH.35.7	And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids, all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks; these were of the king’s substance.
2CH.35.8	And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred sheep and three hundred oxen.
2CH.35.9	Conaniah, likewise, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, princes of the Levites, gave unto the Levites for the sacrifices of the passover five thousand sheep, and five hundred oxen.
2CH.35.10	So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their place, and the Levites, likewise, in their courses, according to the king’s commandment.
2CH.35.11	And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the blood taken from the hands of the Levites who flayed them.
2CH.35.12	And they took away part of the animals that they had for the burnt offerings, that they might give according to the divisions of the families of the people, for them to offer unto the 
2CH.35.13	And they roasted the passover with fire according to the ordinance, but that which had been sanctified, they cooked in pots and in caldrons and in pans and divided them speedily among all the people.
2CH.35.14	And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests because the priests, the sons of Aaron, were occupied in the sacrifice of the burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore, the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
2CH.35.15	Likewise, the singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place, according to the commandment of David and Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun, the king’s seer; and the porters waited at every gate; it was not necessary for them to depart from their ministry, for their brethren, the Levites, prepared for them.
2CH.35.16	So all the service of the 
2CH.35.17	And the sons of Israel that were present kept the passover at that time and the solemn feast of unleavened bread for seven days.
2CH.35.18	And there was no passover like unto that kept in Israel from the days of Samuel, the prophet; neither did any of the kings of Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests and the Levites and all Judah and Israel that were present, together with all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
2CH.35.19	In the year eighteen of the reign of Josiah, this passover was kept.
2CH.35.20	After all this, when Josiah had prepared the house, Necho, king of Egypt, came up to fight against Carchemish by Euphrates; and Josiah went out against him.
2CH.35.21	But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with thee, thou king of Judah? I do not come against thee this day, but against the house that makes war with me, for God commanded me to make haste. Forbear from meddling with God, who is with me, that he not destroy thee.
2CH.35.22	Nevertheless, Josiah would not turn his face from him, but disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and did not hearken unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to fight him in the valley of Megiddo.
2CH.35.23	And the archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his slaves, Take me away, for I am sore wounded.
2CH.35.24	His slaves, therefore, took him out of that chariot and put him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died and was buried in the sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
2CH.35.25	And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah; and all the singing men and the singing women spoke of Josiah in their lamentations to this day and made them an ordinance in Israel, which are written in the lamentations.
2CH.35.26	Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his mercy, according to that which was written in the law of the 
2CH.35.27	and his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah.
2CH.36.1	Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz, the son of Josiah, and made him king in his father’s stead in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.3	And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem and condemned the land in one hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.
2CH.36.4	And the king of Egypt made Eliakim, his brother, king over Judah and Jerusalem and changed his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho took Jehoahaz, his brother, and carried him to Egypt.
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem, and he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.6	And Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, came up against him and bound him with fetters of brass; he carried him to Babylon.
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.8	Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim and his abominations which he did and that which was found in him, behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoiachin, his son, reigned in his stead.
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem; and he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.10	And when the year was expired, King Nebuchadnezzar sent and caused him to be brought to Babylon with the precious vessels of the house of the 
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.12	And he did that which was evil in the sight of the 
2CH.36.13	He rebelled, likewise, against King Nebuchadnezzar, unto whom he had sworn by God; but he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart from turning unto the 
2CH.36.14	Moreover, all the princes of the priests and the people increased the rebellion, rebelling according to all the abominations of the Gentiles and polluting the house of the 
2CH.36.15	And the 
2CH.36.16	But they mocked the messengers of God and despised his words and misused his prophets until the wrath of the 
2CH.36.17	Therefore, he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old man, or him that stooped for age; he gave them all into his hands.
2CH.36.18	Likewise, all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the 
2CH.36.19	And they burnt the house of God and broke down the wall of Jerusalem and burnt all its palaces with fire and destroyed all its desirable vessels.
2CH.36.20	And those that escaped from the sword he carried away to Babylon; where they were slaves to him and his sons until the reign of the kingdom of Persia,
2CH.36.21	to fulfil the word of the 
2CH.36.22	But in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, that the word of the 
2CH.36.23	Thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia, The 
EZR.1.1	Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, that the word of the 
EZR.1.2	Thus saith Cyrus, king of Persia, The 
EZR.1.3	Who is there among you of all his people? Let God be with him and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of the 
EZR.1.4	And whoever may remain of all the places where they remained a stranger, let the men of his place help him with silver and with gold and with goods and with beasts, with freewill gifts for the house of God that is in Jerusalem.
EZR.1.5	Then rose up the heads of the families of Judah and of Benjamin and the priests and the Levites, of all those whose spirit God woke up to go up to build the house of the 
EZR.1.6	And all those that were about them strengthened their hands with vessels of silver and of gold, with goods and with beasts and with precious things, besides all that was willingly offered.
EZR.1.7	Also Cyrus, the king, brought forth the vessels of the house of the 
EZR.1.8	Even those did Cyrus, king of Persia, bring forth by the hand of Mithredath, the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
EZR.1.9	And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a thousand chargers of silver, twenty-nine knives,
EZR.1.10	thirty basins of gold, silver basons of a second sort four hundred and ten, and another thousand vessels.
EZR.1.11	All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar cause to be brought up with those that came up from the captivity of Babylon unto Jerusalem.
EZR.2.1	Now these are the sons of the province that went up out of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and that returned unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his city,
EZR.2.2	which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah, Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah. The number of the men of the people of Israel:

EZR.2.57	the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth of Zebaim, the sons of Ami.
EZR.2.58	All the Nethinims and the sons of Solomon’s slaves, were three hundred and ninety-two.
EZR.2.59	And these were those which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, but they could not show their father’s house and their seed, whether they were of Israel.
EZR.2.60	The sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred and fifty-two.
EZR.2.61	And of the sons of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Koz, the sons of Barzillai; who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai, the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
EZR.2.62	These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found; therefore, they were, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
EZR.2.63	And the Tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things until there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
EZR.2.64	The whole congregation united as one man was forty-two thousand three hundred and seventy,
EZR.2.65	besides their slaves and their maids, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and there were among them two hundred men and women who were singers.
EZR.2.66	Their horses were seven hundred and thirty-six; their mules, two hundred and forty-five;
EZR.2.67	their camels, four hundred and thirty-five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
EZR.2.68	And some of the heads of the fathers, when they came to the house of the 
EZR.2.69	They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work sixty-one thousand drams of gold and five thousand pounds of silver and one hundred priests’ garments.
EZR.2.70	So the priests and the Levites and those of the people and the singers and the porters and the Nethinims dwelt in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
EZR.3.1	And when the seventh month was come and the sons of Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves together as one man in Jerusalem.
EZR.3.2	Then stood up Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings upon it, as it is written in the law of Moses, the man of God.
EZR.3.3	And they set the altar upon its bases, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of those lands, and they offered burnt offerings upon it unto the 
EZR.3.4	They kept also the feast of the tabernacles, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the ordinance, each thing in its day,
EZR.3.5	and in addition to this, the continual burnt offering and the new moons and all the sanctified feasts of the 
EZR.3.6	From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings unto the 
EZR.3.7	And they gave money unto the masons and to the carpenters; and food and drink and oil unto the Zidonians and to those of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of Joppa, according to the will of Cyrus, king of Persia, over them.
EZR.3.8	And in the second year of their coming unto the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of their brethren, the priests and the Levites, and all those that were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem, and appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward the work of the house of the 
EZR.3.9	Then Jeshua stood with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their sons and their brethren, the Levites.
EZR.3.10	And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the 
EZR.3.11	And they sang, praising and giving thanks unto the 
EZR.3.12	But many of the priests and Levites and of the heads of the fathers, who were ancient men that had seen the first house, as the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice while many shouted aloud for joy:
EZR.3.13	so that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.
EZR.4.1	Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the sons of the captivity built the temple unto the 
EZR.4.2	then they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of the fathers and said unto them, Let us build with you, for we seek your God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of Esarhaddon, king of Assur, who brought us up here.
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of the fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with us to build a house unto our God; but we alone will build unto the 
EZR.4.4	Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah and troubled them in building
EZR.4.5	and hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their counsel, all the days of Cyrus, king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius, king of Persia.
EZR.4.6	And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote accusations against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.4.7	And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes, king of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian tongue and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.
EZR.4.8	Rehum, the chancellor, and Shimshai, the scribe, wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes, the king, in this sort:
EZR.4.9	Then wrote Rehum, the chancellor, and Shimshai, the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites, and the Elamites,
EZR.4.10	and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnappar (Sennacherib) brought over and set in the cities of Samaria and the rest that are on the other side of the river, and of Cheenet.
EZR.4.11	This is the copy of the letter that they sent: Unto Artaxerxes, the king: Thy servants, the men of the other side of the river, and of Cheenet.
EZR.4.12	Be it known unto the king that the Jews who came up from thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have founded the walls thereof and joined the foundations.
EZR.4.13	Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city is rebuilt, and the walls founded, they will not pay toll, tribute, and custom, and so the revenue of the kings shall be reduced.
EZR.4.14	Now because we are salted with the salt of the palace, and it is not just unto us to see the king’s dishonour; therefore, we have sent to make this known unto the king,
EZR.4.15	that search may be made in the book of the records of our fathers; so shalt thou find in the book of the records and know that this city is a rebellious city and hurtful unto kings and provinces and that from old time they form rebellions in the midst of her, for which cause this city was destroyed.
EZR.4.16	We notify the king that if this city is built again, and its walls founded, the portion on the other side of the river shall no longer be yours.
EZR.4.17	The king sent this answer unto Rehum, the chancellor, and to Shimshai, the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwell in Samaria and to the rest of those of the other side of the river and to Cheenet.
EZR.4.18	The letter which you sent unto us has been plainly read before me.
EZR.4.19	And I commanded, and search has been made, and it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings and that rebellion and sedition have been made in her
EZR.4.20	and that there have been mighty kings in Jerusalem, who have ruled over all that is beyond the river, and that toll, tribute, and custom, was paid unto them.
EZR.4.21	Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease and that this city not be built until another commandment shall be given from me.
EZR.4.22	Take heed now that ye not fail to do this; why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?
EZR.4.23	Now when the copy of King Artaxerxes’ letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai, the scribe, and their companions, they went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews and made them to cease by force and power.
EZR.4.24	Then the work of the house of God which was at Jerusalem ceased. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of Darius, king of Persia.
EZR.5.1	Then the prophets, Haggai, the prophet, and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel unto them.
EZR.5.2	Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, rose up and began to build the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God helping them.
EZR.5.3	At the same time Tatnai, captain of this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and their companions came to them and said thus unto them, Who has commanded you to build this house and to make up this wall?
EZR.5.4	Then we said unto them regarding this, These are the names of the men that make this building!
EZR.5.5	For the eyes of their God were upon the elders of the Jews, and they could not cause them to cease until the matter came to Darius, and then they returned answer by letter concerning this matter.
EZR.5.6	The copy of the letter that Tatnai, captain of this side the river, and Shetharboznai, and his companions, the Apharsachites, which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius, the king:
EZR.5.7	they sent a letter unto him, in which was written thus; Unto Darius, the king, all peace.
EZR.5.8	Be it known unto the king that we went into the province of Judea, to the house of the great God, which is being built with stones of marble, and the timbers are laid in the walls, and this work is going fast and prospers in their hands.
EZR.5.9	Then we asked the elders and said unto them thus, Who commanded you to build this house and to found these walls?
EZR.5.10	We asked their names also, to notify thee, that we might write the names of the men that were at the head of them.
EZR.5.11	And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are servants of the God of heaven and earth and rebuild the house that was built many years ago, which the great king of Israel built and founded.
EZR.5.12	But after our fathers raged against the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house and carried the people away into Babylon.
EZR.5.13	But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same King Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.
EZR.5.14	And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and had brought them into the temple of Babylon, those did Cyrus, the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered unto Sheshbazzar, whom he had made captain;
EZR.5.15	and said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be built in his place.
EZR.5.16	Then the same Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundation of the house of God which was in Jerusalem, and since that time until now it is being built, and it is not yet finished.
EZR.5.17	Now, therefore, if it seems good to the king, let there be a search made in the king’s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, whether it is so, that a decree was made by Cyrus, the king, to build this house of God in Jerusalem, and let the king send unto us his will concerning this matter.
EZR.6.1	Then Darius, the king, gave a commandment, and a search was made in the house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in Babylon.
EZR.6.2	And there was found in the coffer of the palace that is in the province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus written:
EZR.6.3	In the first year of Cyrus, the king, the same Cyrus, the king, gave a commandment concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, that the house be built as a place for sacrifices to be offered, and let the walls thereof be covered; the height thereof sixty cubits, and the breadth thereof sixty cubits;
EZR.6.4	the orders, three of stones of marble and one order of new timber and let the expenses be given out of the king’s house.
EZR.6.5	And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which was at Jerusalem and brought unto Babylon, be restored and go again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, to his place, and let them be placed in the house of God.
EZR.6.6	Now therefore, Tatnai, captain of the other side of the river, Shetharboznai, and your companions, the Apharsachites, who are on the other side of the river, remove yourselves from there.
EZR.6.7	Leave the work of this house of God unto the captain of the Jews and to their elders that they may build this house of God in his place.
EZR.6.8	And by me is given the commandment regarding what ye shall do with the elders of these Jews, to build this house of God: that of the king’s goods, of the tribute from the other side of the river, the expenses be given unto these men, that they not cease.
EZR.6.9	And that which they have need of, both young bullocks and rams and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the word of the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day by day that they not cease:
EZR.6.10	that they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God of heaven and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.
EZR.6.11	It is also given by my commandment that whoever shall alter this word, let a timber be pulled down from his house, and being set up, let him be hanged upon it, and let his house be made a dunghill for this.
EZR.6.12	And the God that has caused his name to dwell there destroy all kings and people that shall put to their hand to alter or to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I Darius have made the decree; let it be done with speed.
EZR.6.13	Then Tatnai, captain of the other side of the river, Shetharboznai, and their companions, speedily did according to that which Darius, the king, had sent.
EZR.6.14	And the elders of the Jews built, and they prospered according to the prophecy of Haggai, the prophet, and Zechariah, the son of Iddo. They built and finished it, according to the commandment of the God of Israel and according to the commandment of Cyrus and of Darius and of Artaxerxes, king of Persia.
EZR.6.15	And this house was finished on the third day of the month Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius, the king.
EZR.6.16	And the sons of Israel, the priests and the Levites and the rest of the sons of the captivity, kept the dedication of this house of God with joy,
EZR.6.17	and they offered at the dedication of this house of God one hundred bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and as the sin of all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
EZR.6.18	And they set the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their courses over the work of God, which is at Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	And the sons of the captivity kept the passover upon the fourteenth day of the first month.
EZR.6.20	For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of them were pure, and killed the passover for all the sons of the captivity and for their brethren, the priests, and for themselves.
EZR.6.21	And the sons of Israel who had returned out of captivity and all those who had separated themselves unto them from the uncleanness of the Gentiles of the land, to seek the 
EZR.6.22	and kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy; for the 
EZR.7.1	Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes, king of Persia, Ezra, the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,
EZR.7.2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,
EZR.7.3	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,
EZR.7.4	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,
EZR.7.5	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the first priest.
EZR.7.6	This Ezra went up from Babylon, and he was a diligent scribe in the law of Moses, which the 
EZR.7.7	And there went up some of the sons of Israel and of the priests and the Levites and the singers and the porters and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes, the king.
EZR.7.8	And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, in the seventh year of the king.
EZR.7.9	For upon the first of the first month he began to go up from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month he came to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.
EZR.7.10	For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the 
EZR.7.11	Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes gave unto Ezra, the priest, the scribe, a scribe of the words of the commandments of the 
EZR.7.12	Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra, the priest, perfect scribe of the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and to Cheenet.
EZR.7.13	By me is given commandment, that any of the people of Israel and of his priests and Levites in my realm, who desire of their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.
EZR.7.14	For thou art sent on behalf of the king and of his seven counsellors, to inquire of Judah and Jerusalem, according to the law of thy God which is in thy hand,
EZR.7.15	and to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his counsellors freely offer unto the God of Israel, whose habitation is in Jerusalem,
EZR.7.16	and all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people and of the priests, who offer willingly for the house of their God which is in Jerusalem;
EZR.7.17	Therefore, with diligence thou shalt buy with this money bullocks, rams, lambs, with their presents and their drink offerings, and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which is in Jerusalem.
EZR.7.18	And whatever shall seem good to thee and to thy brethren, to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after the will of your God.
EZR.7.19	The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the house of thy God, thou shalt restore before the God of Jerusalem.
EZR.7.20	And whatever else shall be needful for the house of thy God, which thou shalt have need to bestow, bestow it out of the king’s treasure house.
EZR.7.21	And by me, Artaxerxes, the king, is given the commandment to all the treasurers who are on the other side of the river, that whatever Ezra, the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall require of you, it be done speedily,
EZR.7.22	unto one hundred talents of silver and to one hundred measures of wheat and to one hundred baths of wine and to one hundred baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.
EZR.7.23	Whatever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be speedily done for the house of the God of heaven: for why should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his sons?
EZR.7.24	Also unto you we cause it to be known, that regarding all of the priests and Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, and ministers of the house of this God, no one shall be able to impose toll, tribute, or custom, upon them.
EZR.7.25	And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thy hand, set as judges and governors, who govern all the people that are on the other side of the river, all such as know the laws of thy God, and teach those that do not know them.
EZR.7.26	And whoever will not do the law of thy God and the law of the king, let them be judged speedily, whether it be unto death or to banishment or to confiscation of goods or to imprisonment.
EZR.7.27	Blessed be the 
EZR.7.28	and has extended mercy unto me before the king, and his counsellors and before all the king’s mighty princes. And I, comforted according to the hand of the 
EZR.8.1	These are now the heads of their fathers, and this is the genealogy of those that went up with me from Babylon, in the reign of Artaxerxes, the king:
EZR.8.2	Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershon: of the sons of Ithamar; Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.
EZR.8.3	Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah: and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males one hundred and fifty.
EZR.8.4	Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai, the son of Zerahiah, and with him two hundred males.
EZR.8.5	Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him three hundred males.
EZR.8.6	Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed, the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty males.
EZR.8.7	And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah, the son of Athaliah, and with him seventy males.
EZR.8.8	And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah, the son of Michael, and with him eighty males.
EZR.8.9	Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah, the son of Jehiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen males.
EZR.8.10	And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with him one hundred and sixty males.
EZR.8.11	And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah, the son of Bebai, and with him twenty-eight males.
EZR.8.12	And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan, the son of Hakkatan, and with him one hundred and ten males.
EZR.8.13	And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these: Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them sixty males.
EZR.8.14	Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai and Zabbud and with them seventy males.
EZR.8.15	And I gathered them together to the river that runs to Ahava, and there we encamped three days, and having searched among the people and the priests, I did not find there any of the sons of Levi.
EZR.8.16	Then I commissioned Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, principals, also Joiarib and Elnathan, men of understanding;
EZR.8.17	and I sent them unto Iddo, the captain at the place of Casiphia, and I put words in their mouth that they should speak unto Iddo and to his brethren, the Nethinims, at the place of Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the house of our God.
EZR.8.18	And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren, eighteen;
EZR.8.19	and Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari, his brethren and their sons, twenty;
EZR.8.20	also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had appointed for the ministry of the Levites, two hundred and twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.
EZR.8.21	Then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of Ahava that we might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance.
EZR.8.22	For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers and horsemen to defend us against the enemy in the way because we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is upon all those that seek him for good; but his power and his wrath is against all those that forsake him.
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he was intreated of us.
EZR.8.24	Then I separated twelve of the principals of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,
EZR.8.25	and weighed unto them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God, which the king and his counsellors and his princes and all those that were of Israel had offered.
EZR.8.26	I weighed, therefore, unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver and silver vessels of one hundred talents and of gold one hundred talents;
EZR.8.27	also twenty basins of gold, of a thousand drams, and two vessels of clean brass, precious as gold.
EZR.8.28	And I said unto them, Ye are holiness unto the 
EZR.8.29	Watch and keep them until you weigh them before the princes of the priests and the Levites and of the princes of the fathers of Israel in Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the 
EZR.8.30	The priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and of the gold and of the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto the house of our God.
EZR.8.31	And we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth of the first month to go to Jerusalem; and the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and of such as lay in wait by the way.
EZR.8.32	And we came to Jerusalem and abode there three days.
EZR.8.33	Now on the fourth day the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the priest; and with him was Eleazar, the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad, the son of Jeshua, and Noadiah, the son of Binnui, Levites;
EZR.8.34	by number and by weight of each one; and all the weight was written at that time.
EZR.8.35	Those that had been carried away, the sons of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve he goats as sin; all this was a burnt offering unto the 
EZR.8.36	And they delivered the king’s commissions unto the king’s lieutenants and captains of the other side the river, which favoured the people and the house of God.
EZR.9.1	Now when these things were done, the princes came to me, saying, The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites, have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites, doing according to their abominations,
EZR.9.2	for they have taken of their daughters for themselves and for their sons, and the holy seed is mingled with the peoples of the lands; and the hand of the princes and of the governors has been foremost in this trespass.
EZR.9.3	And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle and plucked off of the hair of my head and of my beard and sat down astonied.
EZR.9.4	Then each one that trembled at the words of the God of Israel because of the transgression of those that had been carried away were assembled unto me; and I sat astonied until the evening sacrifice.
EZR.9.5	And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my affliction; and having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees and spread out my hands unto the 
EZR.9.6	and said, O my God, I am confused and ashamed to lift up my face to thee, my God, for our iniquities have multiplied over our head, and our guiltiness is grown up unto heaven.
EZR.9.7	Since the days of our fathers, we have been in great guiltiness unto this day; and for our iniquities we, our kings and our priests, have been delivered into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to spoil, and to confusion of face, as it is this day.
EZR.9.8	And now as for a brief moment there has been the mercy of the 
EZR.9.9	For we were slaves; yet our God did not forsake us in our bondage, but has extended mercy over us before the king of Persia, that we may be given life to lift up the house of our God and to cause the desolations thereof to be restored and to give us a wall of protection in Judah and in Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken thy commandments,
EZR.9.11	which thou hast commanded by thy slaves the prophets, saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an unclean land because of the uncleanness of the people of the lands, for the abominations with which they have filled it from one end to another with their uncleanness.
EZR.9.12	Now, therefore, do not give your daughters unto their sons, neither take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or their prosperity forever, that ye may be strengthened, and eat the good of the land and leave it for an inheritance to your sons forever.
EZR.9.13	And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guiltiness, seeing that thou our God hast intervened that we no longer be oppressed because of our iniquities and hast given us such an escape as this,
EZR.9.14	should we again break thy commandments and join in affinity with the people of these abominations? Would thou not be angry with us until thou hadst consumed us, so that there should be no remnant nor escape?
EZR.9.15	O 
EZR.10.1	Now as Ezra prayed and confessed, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, there assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of men and women and children; and the people wept very sore.
EZR.10.2	Then Shechaniah, the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra, We have rebelled against our God and have taken strange women of the peoples of the land, but there is yet hope for Israel concerning this thing.
EZR.10.3	Now, therefore, let us make a covenant with our God to send away all the women and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of the Lord and of those that fear the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.
EZR.10.4	Arise; for this matter belongs unto thee; we also will be with thee: be of good courage, and do it.
EZR.10.5	Then Ezra arose and made the princes of the priests, the Levites, and all Israel, swear that they should do according to this word. And they swore.
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God and went into the chamber of Johanan, the son of Eliashib; and when he came there, he ate no bread, nor drank water; for he mourned because of the transgression of those that had been carried away.
EZR.10.7	And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto all the sons of the captivity, that they should gather themselves together unto Jerusalem
EZR.10.8	and that whoever would not come within three days, according to the counsel of the princes and of the elders, all his substance should be forfeited and himself separated from the congregation of those that had been carried away.
EZR.10.9	Thus were all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth of the month; and all the people sat in the plaza of the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the rains.
EZR.10.10	And Ezra, the priest, stood up, and said unto them, Ye have transgressed because ye have taken strange women, thus increasing the guiltiness of Israel.
EZR.10.11	Now, therefore, make confession unto the 
EZR.10.12	Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice, Let it be done according to thy word.
EZR.10.13	But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and there is no strength to stand in the street; neither is this a work of one day or two; for we are many that have transgressed in this thing.
EZR.10.14	Let our rulers of all the congregation now stand, and let all those who have taken strange women in our cities come at appointed times, and with them the elders of each city and the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this matter is turned from us.
EZR.10.15	Jonathan, the son of Asahel, and Jahaziah, the son of Tikvah, were placed over this matter; and Meshullam and Shabbethai, the Levites, helped them.
EZR.10.16	And the sons of the captivity did so. And Ezra, the priest, and the men who were the heads of the fathers in the house of their fathers were separated, all of them by their names, and sat down in the first day of the tenth month to inquire into the matter.
EZR.10.17	And they finished, with all the men that had taken strange women by the first day of the first month.
EZR.10.18	And among the sons of the priests that had taken strange women these were found: Of the sons of Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and of his brethren: Maaseiah and Eliezer, and Jarib and Gedaliah.
EZR.10.19	And they gave their hands that they would send away their women; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for their guiltiness.
EZR.10.20	And of the sons of Immer; Hanani and Zebadiah.
EZR.10.21	And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.
EZR.10.22	And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael, Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.
EZR.10.23	And of the sons of the Levites; Jozabad, Shimei, Kelaiah, (the same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.
EZR.10.24	And of the singers; Eliashib; and of the porters; Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
EZR.10.25	Likewise of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, Jeziah, Malchiah, Miamin, Eleazar, Malchijah, and Benaiah.
EZR.10.26	And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Eliah.
EZR.10.27	And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza.
EZR.10.28	And of the sons of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
EZR.10.29	And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Ramoth.
EZR.10.30	And of the sons of Pahath-moab; Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, Binnui, and Manasseh.
EZR.10.31	And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah, Shemaiah, Shimeon,
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
EZR.10.33	Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
EZR.10.34	Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,
EZR.10.38	Bani, Binnui, Shimei,
EZR.10.39	Shelemiah, Nathan, and Adaiah,
EZR.10.40	Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,
EZR.10.41	Azareel, Shelemiah, Shemariah,
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.
EZR.10.43	And of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau, Joel, and Benaiah.
EZR.10.44	All these had taken strange women, and there were women of theirs who had given birth to sons.
NEH.1.1	The words of Nehemiah, the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan, the palace,
NEH.1.2	that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.
NEH.1.3	And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are burned with fire.
NEH.1.4	And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept and mourned certain days and fasted and prayed before the God of the heavens
NEH.1.5	and said, I beseech thee, O 
NEH.1.6	let thine ear now be attentive and thine eyes open, that thou may hear the prayer of thy slave, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the sons of Israel, thy slaves, and I confess the sins of the sons of Israel, with which we have sinned against thee; both I and my father’s house have sinned.
NEH.1.7	We have dealt very corruptly against thee and have not kept the commandments nor the statutes nor the judgments, which thou didst command thy slave Moses.
NEH.1.8	Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou didst command thy slave Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples;
NEH.1.9	but if ye turn unto me and keep my commandments and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from there and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.
NEH.1.10	Now these are thy slaves and thy people, whom thou hast ransomed with thy great power and with thy strong hand.
NEH.1.11	O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy slave and to the prayer of thy slaves who desire to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy slave this day, and grant him grace before this man. For I was the king’s cupbearer.
NEH.2.1	And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, the king, that as wine was before him, I took up the wine and gave it unto the king. And as I had not been sad before in his presence,
NEH.2.2	the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? This is nothing else but brokenness of heart. Then I was very sore afraid
NEH.2.3	and said unto the king, Let the king live for ever; why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the house of my fathers’ sepulchres, lies waste, and its gates are consumed with fire?
NEH.2.4	Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of the heavens.
NEH.2.5	And I said unto the king, If it pleases the king, and if thy slave has found favour in thy sight, that thou would send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may rebuild it.
NEH.2.6	Then the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him), For how long shall thy journey be, and when wilt thou return? So the matter pleased the king, and he sent me; and I set him a time.
NEH.2.7	Moreover, I said unto the king, If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the captains on the other side of the river, that they may convey me over until I come into Judah,
NEH.2.8	and a letter unto Asaph, the keeper of the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the palace of the house and for the wall of the city and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of the 
NEH.2.9	Then I came to the captains of the other side of the river and gave them the king’s letters. Now the king had sent princes of the army and horsemen with me.
NEH.2.10	When Sanballat, the Horonite, and Tobiah, the slave, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the sons of Israel.
NEH.2.11	So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.
NEH.2.12	And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither did I tell any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, except the beast that I rode upon.
NEH.2.13	And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before the fountain of the dragon and to the dung port and considered the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and its gates were consumed with fire.
NEH.2.14	Then I went on to the gate of the fountain and to the king’s pool, but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.
NEH.2.15	Then went I up in the night by the brook and considered the wall and turned back and entered by the gate of the valley and so returned.
NEH.2.16	And the rulers did not know where I had gone or what I had done; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews nor to the priests nor to the nobles nor to the rulers nor to the rest that did the work.
NEH.2.17	Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lies waste and its gates are burned with fire; come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no longer in reproach.
NEH.2.18	Then I told them how the hand of my God was good upon me and likewise the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they comforted their hands for good.
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat, the Horonite, and Tobiah, the slave, the Ammonite, and Geshem, the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn and despised us and said, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel against the king?
NEH.2.20	Then I gave them a reply and said unto them, The God of the heavens, he will prosper us; therefore, we, his slaves, will arise and build; but ye have no portion nor righteousness, nor memorial in Jerusalem.
NEH.3.1	Then Eliashib, the high priest, rose up with his brethren, the priests, and they built the sheep gate; they sanctified it and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.
NEH.3.2	And next unto him the men of Jericho built. And next to them built Zaccur, the son of Imri.
NEH.3.3	And the sons of Hassenaah built the fish gate; they laid its beams and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.
NEH.3.4	And next to them Meremoth, the son of Urijah, the son of Koz restored. And next to them Meshullam, the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel restored. And next to them Zadok, the son of Baana, restored.
NEH.3.5	And next to them the Tekoites restored; but their nobles did not put their necks to the work of their Lord.
NEH.3.6	Moreover, the old gate was restored by Jehoiada, the son of Paseah, and Meshullam, the son of Besodeiah; they laid its beams and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.
NEH.3.7	And next to them restored Melatiah, the Gibeonite, and Jadon, the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, on behalf of the captain of the king over the land on this side the river.
NEH.3.8	Next to them Uzziel, the son of Harhaiah, of the refiners restored. Next unto him Hananiah, the son of one of the apothecaries, also restored, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.
NEH.3.9	And next unto them Rephaiah, the son of Hur, prince of the half part of Jerusalem, restored.
NEH.3.10	And next unto them, Jedaiah, the son of Harumaph restored, and over against his house. And next unto him Hattush, the son of Hashabniah, restored.
NEH.3.11	Malchijah, the son of Harim, and Hashub, the son of Pahathmoab, restored the other piece and the tower of the furnaces.
NEH.3.12	And next to them restored Shallum, the son of Halohesh, prince of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.
NEH.3.13	The valley gate was restored by Hanun with the inhabitants of Zanoah; they rebuilt it and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and a thousand cubits in the wall unto the dung gate.
NEH.3.14	And Malchiah, the son of Rechab, prince of the province of Bethhaccerem, restored the dung gate; he built it and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars.
NEH.3.15	Shallun, the son of Colhozeh, the prince of the region of Mizpah, restored the gate of the fountain; he built it, covered it, and set up its doors, its locks, and its bars, and the wall of the pool of Siloah of the king’s garden, unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.
NEH.3.16	After him restored Nehemiah, the son of Azbuk, the prince of half the region of Bethzur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David and to the pool that was made and unto the house of the mighty.
NEH.3.17	After him restored the Levites, Rehum, the son of Bani. Next unto him Hashabiah, prince of half the region of Keilah, restored in his part.
NEH.3.18	After him their brethren, Bavai, the son of Henadad, prince of the half the region of Keilah restored.
NEH.3.19	And next to him Ezer, the son of Jeshua, prince of Mizpah, restored another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall.
NEH.3.20	After him Baruch, the son of Zabbai, earnestly restored the other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of Eliashib, the high priest.
NEH.3.21	After him, Meremoth, the son of Urijah, the son of Koz, restored another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.
NEH.3.22	And after him the priests, the men of the plain, restored.
NEH.3.23	After them Benjamin and Hashub restored over against their house. After them Azariah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, restored by his house.
NEH.3.24	After him, Binnui, the son of Henadad, restored another piece, from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the corner.
NEH.3.25	Palal, the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lies out from the king’s high house, that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah, the son of Parosh.
NEH.3.26	And the Nethinims were in Ophel, {Heb. the fortress}, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east and the tower that lies out.
NEH.3.27	After them the Tekoites restored another piece, over against the great tower that lies out, unto the wall of Ophel.
NEH.3.28	From the horse gate the priests restored, each one over against his house.
NEH.3.29	After them Zadok, the son of Immer, restored over against his house. After him, Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of the east gate restored.
NEH.3.30	After him, Hananiah, the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, restored another piece. After him Meshullam, the son of Berechiah restored over against his chamber.
NEH.3.31	After him, Malchiah, the son of the refiner, restored unto the place of the Nethinims and of the merchants, over against the gate of judgment {Heb. Miphkad} and to the going up of the corner.
NEH.3.32	And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate, the refiners and the merchants restored.
NEH.4.1	But it came to pass that when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews.
NEH.4.2	And he spoke before his brethren and the army of Samaria and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? Is this to be permitted them? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish on time? Will they resurrect the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which were burned?
NEH.4.3	Now Tobiah, the Ammonite, was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox were to go up it, he would break down their stone wall.
NEH.4.4	Hear, O our God; for we are despised; and turn their reproach upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of their captivity.
NEH.4.5	And do not cover their iniquity, nor let their sin be blotted out from before thee, for they have become angry against the builders.
NEH.4.6	But we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together unto the half thereof, for the people were motivated to work.
NEH.4.7	And it came to pass when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the walls of Jerusalem were sound and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth
NEH.4.8	and conspired all of them together to come and to fight against Jerusalem and to hinder it.
NEH.4.9	Nevertheless, we made our prayer unto our God and set a watch over the builders day and night because of them.
NEH.4.10	And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish so that we are not able to build the wall.
NEH.4.11	And our adversaries said, They shall not know or see until we come in the midst among them and slay them and cause the work to cease.
NEH.4.12	But it came to pass, that when the Jews who dwelt among them came, they advised us ten times of all the places from which they would come upon us.
NEH.4.13	Therefore, I set in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I set the people by families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
NEH.4.14	Then I looked and rose up and said unto the nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, Do not be afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.
NEH.4.15	And it came to pass when our enemies heard that we had understood it, God brought their counsel to nought, and we returned all of us to the wall, each one unto his work.
NEH.4.16	And it came to pass from that time forth that half of the young men wrought in the work, and the other half of them held spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail; and the princes were behind all the house of Judah.
NEH.4.17	Those that built on the wall and those that bore burdens and those that laded wrought with one hand in the work and with the other held a weapon.
NEH.4.18	For the builders, each one had his sword girded by his side, and so they built. And he that sounded the shofar was by me.
NEH.4.19	And I said unto the principals and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another.
NEH.4.20	In whatever place that you hear the voice of the shofar, join us there; our God shall fight for us.
NEH.4.21	So we laboured in the work, and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning until the stars appeared.
NEH.4.22	Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let each one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that by night they may be a guard to us, and labour by day.
NEH.4.23	So neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us put off our clothes, each one put them off only for washing.
NEH.5.1	Then there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren, the Jews.
NEH.5.2	For there were some that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are many; therefore we have bought grain that we may eat and live.
NEH.5.3	There were also some that said, We have mortgaged our lands, vineyards, and houses, that we might buy grain because of the famine.
NEH.5.4	And there were some that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.
NEH.5.5	Yet now, given that the flesh of our brethren is as our flesh and their sons as our sons, behold, we subject our sons and our daughters to slavery, and there are some of our daughters in bondage already; neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.
NEH.5.6	And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.
NEH.5.7	Then I meditated unto myself, and I rebuked the principals and the rulers and said unto them, Does each one of you exact usury of his brother? And I set a great assembly against them.
NEH.5.8	And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren, the Jews who had been sold unto the Gentiles; and will ye even sell your brethren? And shall they be sold unto us? Then they remained silent, for they had nothing to answer.
NEH.5.9	Also I said, What you do is not good, do you not walk in the fear of our God, that ye not be the reproach of our enemies the Gentiles?
NEH.5.10	I, likewise, and my brethren and my servants, have lent them money and grain; let us now release them from this burden.
NEH.5.11	Restore, I pray you, to them, today, their lands, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, and even the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.
NEH.5.12	Then they said, We will return it and will require nothing of them; so we will do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests and caused them to sware that they should do according to this promise.
NEH.5.13	Also I shook my lap and said, Thus will God shake out each man from his house and from his labour, that does not perform this promise, even thus shall he be shaken out and emptied. And all the congregation said, Amen, and praised the 
NEH.5.14	Moreover, from the day that I was appointed by the king to be their captain in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, the king, that is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the captain.
NEH.5.15	But the former captains that had been before me had charged the people and had taken of them for bread and wine, upon forty shekels of silver; and in addition to this their servants bore rule over the people; but I did not do so because of the fear of God.
NEH.5.16	In addition to this, I restored my part in the work of this wall, neither did we buy any inheritance; and all my servants were gathered together unto the work.
NEH.5.17	I also had at my table one hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came unto us from among the Gentiles that are around us.
NEH.5.18	Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and every ten days wine in all abundance; yet with all this I did not require the bread of the captain because the bondage was heavy upon this people.
NEH.5.19	Remember me, my God, for good and all that I have done for this people.
NEH.6.1	Now it came to pass when Sanballat and Tobiah and Geshem, the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (though at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates),
NEH.6.2	that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono. But they had thought to do me evil.
NEH.6.3	And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work so that I cannot come down; why should the work cease, whilst I leave it and come down to you?
NEH.6.4	Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort, and I answered them after the same manner.
NEH.6.5	Then Sanballat sent his slave to say the same thing for the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,
NEH.6.6	in which was written, It is reported among the Gentiles, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel, for which cause thou dost build the wall, that thou may be their king, according to these words.
NEH.6.7	And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah! And now these words shall be heard by the king. Come now, therefore, and let us take counsel together.
NEH.6.8	Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou dost feign them out of thine own heart.
NEH.6.9	For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it not be done. Now, therefore, O God, strengthen my hands.
NEH.6.10	Afterward I came in secret unto the house of Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple; for they are coming to slay thee; yea, tonight they will come to slay thee.
NEH.6.11	Then I said, Should such a man as I flee? And who is there as I who could go into the temple and live? I will not go in.
NEH.6.12	And I perceived that God had not sent him, but that he pronounced this prophecy against me, for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
NEH.6.13	For he was bribed to make me be thus afraid and sin and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.
NEH.6.14	My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works and on the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets, that did things to put me in fear.
NEH.6.15	So the wall was finished the twenty-fifth of Elul, in fifty-two days.
NEH.6.16	And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard of it, all the Gentiles that were about us feared, and they were much cast down in their own eyes, and they knew that this work was wrought of our God.
NEH.6.17	Likewise, in those days the principals of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.
NEH.6.18	For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shechaniah, the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam, the son of Berechiah.
NEH.6.19	They also reported his good deeds before me and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.
NEH.7.1	Now it came to pass, when the wall was built and I had set up the doors and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,
NEH.7.2	that I commanded my brother Hanani, and Hananiah, the prince of the palace in Jerusalem (for he was as a man of truth and feared God above many);
NEH.7.3	and I said unto them, Do not let the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot and even with the guards present, let them shut the doors and bar them. And appoint guards of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each one in his watch and each one to be in front of his house.
NEH.7.4	Now the city was large and great, but there were few people in it, and the houses were not rebuilt.
NEH.7.5	And my God put it into my heart to gather together the principals and the rulers and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the register of the genealogy of those who had come up before and found written therein:
NEH.7.6	These are the sons of the province, that came up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had carried away and returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each one unto his city,

NEH.7.59	the sons of Shephatiah, the sons of Hattil, the sons of Pochereth of Zebaim, the sons of Amon.
NEH.7.60	All the Nethinims, and the sons of Solomon’s slaves, were three hundred and ninety-two.
NEH.7.61	And these were they which came up also from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their father’s house, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel.
NEH.7.62	The sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, six hundred and forty-two.
NEH.7.63	And of the priests: the sons of Habaiah, the sons of Koz, the sons of Barzillai, who took one of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called after their name.
NEH.7.64	These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found; therefore, were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.
NEH.7.65	And the Tirshatha said unto them that they should not eat of the most holy things until there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
NEH.7.66	The whole congregation united as one man was forty-two thousand three hundred and sixty,
NEH.7.67	not counting their menslaves and their maidslaves, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred and thirty-seven; and they had two hundred and forty-five men and women singers.
NEH.7.68	Their horses, seven hundred and thirty-six; their mules, two hundred and forty-five:
NEH.7.69	Their camels, four hundred and thirty-five; their asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
NEH.7.70	And some of the princes of the families gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave for the treasure one thousand drams of gold, fifty basins, and five hundred and thirty priests’ garments.
NEH.7.71	And the princes of the families gave for the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand two hundred pounds of silver.
NEH.7.72	And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold and two thousand pounds of silver and sixty-seven priests’ garments.
NEH.7.73	So the priests and the Levites and the porters and the singers and those of the people and the Nethinims and all Israel dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the sons of Israel were in their cities.
NEH.8.1	And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the plaza that was before the water gate, and they spoke unto Ezra, the scribe, to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the 
NEH.8.2	And Ezra, the priest, brought the law before the congregation, both of men and women and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.
NEH.8.3	And he read in the book before the plaza that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.
NEH.8.4	And Ezra, the scribe, stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Urijah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchiah, Hashum, Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
NEH.8.5	And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people (for he was above all the people), and when he opened it, all the people stood up:
NEH.8.6	and Ezra blessed the 
NEH.8.7	And Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah, Levites, caused the people to be silent that they might understand the law; and the people were in their place.
NEH.8.8	So they read in the book in the law of God clearly and paid attention, and understood the reading.
NEH.8.9	And Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, and Ezra, the priest and scribe, and the Levites that caused the people to be attentive, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto the 
NEH.8.10	Then he said unto them, Go, eat the fat, and drink sweet wine, and send portions unto those who have nothing prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord, and not sad; for the joy of the 
NEH.8.11	So the Levites caused all the people to be silent, saying, Be silent, for the day is holy; neither be ye sad.
NEH.8.12	And all the people went to eat and to drink and to send portions and to rejoice with great joy because they had understood the words that were taught unto them.
NEH.8.13	And on the next day the princes of the families of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered together unto Ezra, the scribe, to understand the words of the law.
NEH.8.14	And they found written in the law, which the 
NEH.8.15	and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount and bring olive branches and pine branches and myrtle branches and palm branches and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.
NEH.8.16	So the people went forth and brought them and made themselves booths, each one upon the roof of his house and in their courts and in the courts of the house of God and in the plaza of the water gate and in the plaza of the gate of Ephraim.
NEH.8.17	And all the congregation of those that returned out of the captivity made booths and dwelt in the booths, for since the days of Jeshua, the son of Nun, unto that day, the sons of Israel had not done so. And there was very great joy.
NEH.8.18	And Ezra read in the book of the law of God each day, from the first day unto the last day. And they kept the feast seven days, and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according to the ordinance.
NEH.9.1	Now in the twenty-fourth day of this month, the sons of Israel were assembled with fasting and with sackcloth and earth upon them.
NEH.9.2	And the seed of Israel had separated themselves from all strangers and stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
NEH.9.3	And they stood up in their place and read in the book of the law of the 
NEH.9.4	Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani and cried with a loud voice unto the 
NEH.9.5	Then the Levites, Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah said, Stand up and bless the 
NEH.9.6	Thou, O 
NEH.9.7	Thou art, O 
NEH.9.8	and didst find his heart faithful before thee and didst make a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it, to his seed and hast performed thy word; for thou art righteous.
NEH.9.9	And thou didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt and didst hear their cry by the Red sea
NEH.9.10	and didst show signs and wonders upon Pharaoh and on all his slaves and on all the people of his land; for thou didst know that they had dealt proudly against them. So didst thou make thee a name, as it is this day.
NEH.9.11	And thou didst divide the sea before them so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors thou didst throw into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.
NEH.9.12	Moreover, thou didst lead them by day with a pillar of cloud and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light in the way by which they should go.
NEH.9.13	Thou didst come down upon Mount Sinai and didst speak with them from heaven and didst give them right judgments and true laws, good statutes and commandments,
NEH.9.14	and didst make known unto them the sabbath of thy holiness and didst prescribe for them commandments, statutes, and law by the hand of Moses, thy slave.
NEH.9.15	And thou didst give them bread from heaven in their hunger and didst bring forth water for them out of the rock in their thirst and didst promise them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.
NEH.9.16	But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their necks and did not hearken unto thy commandments
NEH.9.17	and refused to hear; neither did they remember thy wonders that thou hadst done among them, but hardened their necks and in their rebellion thought to appoint a leader to return to their bondage; but thou art a God of pardons, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great mercy, for thou didst not leave them.
NEH.9.18	Even when they had made themselves a molten calf and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had committed great abominations;
NEH.9.19	yet thou in thy manifold mercies didst not forsake them in the wilderness; the pillar of the cloud did not depart from them by day, to lead them in the way; neither did the pillar of fire by night, to illuminate the way in which they should go.
NEH.9.20	Thou didst give thy good spirit to teach them and didst not withhold thy manna from their mouth and didst give them water for their thirst.
NEH.9.21	Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness so that they lacked nothing; their clothes did not wax old, and their feet did not swell.
NEH.9.22	Thou didst give them kingdoms and peoples and didst divide them into corners; so they possessed the land of Sihon and the land of the king of Heshbon and the land of Og, king of Bashan.
NEH.9.23	Thou didst multiply their sons as the stars of heaven and didst introduce them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to their fathers, that they should go in to inherit it.
NEH.9.24	So the sons came in and possessed the land, and thou didst humble the inhabitants of the land before them, the Canaanites, and didst give them into their hand, with their kings and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.
NEH.9.25	And they took strong cities and fertile land and inherited houses full of all goods, hewn cisterns, vineyards and oliveyards and many trees of good fruit; so they ate and were filled and became fat and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.
NEH.9.26	Nevertheless, they were contentious and rebelled against thee and cast thy law behind their backs and slew thy prophets who testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great abominations.
NEH.9.27	Therefore, thou didst deliver them into the hand of their enemies, who afflicted them; and in the time of their tribulation, they cried unto thee, thou didst hear them from the heavens; and according to thy manifold mercies thou didst give them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.
NEH.9.28	But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore, thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies so that they had the dominion over them; yet when they returned and cried unto thee, thou didst hear them from the heavens; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies
NEH.9.29	and didst protest unto them, that they return unto thy law; yet they dealt proudly and did not hearken unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments (which if a man shall do, in them he shall live) and withdrew the shoulder and hardened their neck and would not hear.
NEH.9.30	Yet many years didst thou forbear them and didst protest against them with thy spirit by the hand of thy prophets; yet they did not hear; therefore, thou didst give them into the hand of the peoples of the land.
NEH.9.31	Nevertheless, for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly consume them nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.
NEH.9.32	Now, therefore, our God, the great, mighty, and terrible God, who keeps covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem little before thee, that has come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, on our priests, on our prophets, on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.
NEH.9.33	Howbeit thou art just in all that has come upon us; for thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly;
NEH.9.34	neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, with which thou didst testify against them.
NEH.9.35	For they did not serve thee in their kingdom and in thy great goodness that thou didst give them and in the large and fat land which thou didst deliver before them; neither did they turn from their wicked works.
NEH.9.36	Behold, we are slaves this day, behold us here, slaves in the land which thou didst give unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof.
NEH.9.37	And it multiplies its fruit for the kings, whom thou hast set over us because of our sins, who have dominion over our bodies and over our cattle, according to their will, and we are in great distress.
NEH.9.38	And because of all this, we make a sure covenant and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests seal unto it.
NEH.10.1	Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,
NEH.10.2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,
NEH.10.3	Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,
NEH.10.4	Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,
NEH.10.5	Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,
NEH.10.6	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,
NEH.10.7	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,
NEH.10.8	Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah: these were priests.
NEH.10.9	And the Levites: both Jeshua, the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;
NEH.10.10	and their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan,
NEH.10.11	Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,
NEH.10.12	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,
NEH.10.13	Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.
NEH.10.14	The heads of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu, Bani,
NEH.10.15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,
NEH.10.16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,
NEH.10.17	Ater, Hizkijah, Azzur,
NEH.10.18	Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,
NEH.10.19	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,
NEH.10.20	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,
NEH.10.21	Meshezabeel, Zadok, Jaddua,
NEH.10.22	Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,
NEH.10.23	Hosea, Hananiah, Hashub,
NEH.10.24	Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,
NEH.10.25	Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,
NEH.10.26	Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,
NEH.10.27	Malluch, Harim, Baanah.
NEH.10.28	And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all those that had separated themselves from the peoples of the lands unto the law of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge and having understanding;
NEH.10.29	Strengthened with their brethren, their nobles, they came forward in an oath with a curse that they would walk in God’s law, which was given by the hand of Moses, the slave of God, and observe and do all the commandments of the 
NEH.10.30	and that we would not give our daughters unto the peoples of the land nor take their daughters for our sons.
NEH.10.31	Likewise that if the peoples of the land bring merchandise or any food on the sabbath day to sell, that we would not take anything from them on the sabbath or on the holy day, and that we would leave the seventh year and remit every debt.
NEH.10.32	Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God,
NEH.10.33	for the showbread and for the continual present and for the continual burnt offering, and of the sabbaths and of the new moons, for the appointed feasts and for the holy things and for the atonement for sin to reconcile Israel and for all the work of the house of our God.
NEH.10.34	And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, regarding the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn upon the altar of the 
NEH.10.35	And that each year we would bring the firstfruits of our ground and the firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, unto the house of the 
NEH.10.36	Likewise, the firstborn of our sons and of our beasts, as it is written in the law and that we would bring the firstlings of our cows and of our sheep to the house of our God, unto the priests that minister in the house of our God.
NEH.10.37	And that we would also bring the firstfruits of our dough and of our offerings and the fruit of every tree, of the wine and of the oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God, and the tithe of our ground unto the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tenths of our labours in all the cities.
NEH.10.38	And that the priest, the son of Aaron, shall be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes; and the Levites shall offer the tithe of the tithes in the house of our God, to the chambers, in the treasure house.
NEH.10.39	For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring the offering of the grain, of the new wine and the oil, unto the chambers where are the vessels of the sanctuary and the priests that minister and the porters and the singers; and we will not forsake the house of our God.
NEH.11.1	And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem; but the rest of the people cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city and nine parts to dwell in the other cities.
NEH.11.2	And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.
NEH.11.3	Now these are the heads of the province that dwelt in Jerusalem; but in the cities of Judah each one dwelt in his possession in their cities, of Israel, of the priests, the Levites, and the Nethinims, and of the sons of Solomon’s slaves.
NEH.11.4	And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the sons of Judah and of the sons of Benjamin. Of the sons of Judah: Athaiah, the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah, the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the sons of Perez;
NEH.11.5	and Maaseiah, the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.
NEH.11.6	All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four hundred and sixty-eight valiant men.
NEH.11.7	And these are the sons of Benjamin: Sallu, the son of Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of Jesaiah.
NEH.11.8	And after him Gabbai and Sallai, nine hundred and twenty-eight.
NEH.11.9	And Joel, the son of Zichri, was their overseer; and Judah, the son of Senuah, was second over the city.
NEH.11.10	Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.
NEH.11.11	Seraiah, the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, prince of the house of God,
NEH.11.12	and their brethren that did the work of the house were eight hundred and twenty-two; and Adaiah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchiah,
NEH.11.13	and his brethren, princes of families, two hundred and forty-two; and Amashai, the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,
NEH.11.14	and their brethren, mighty men of valour, one hundred and twenty-eight; and their captain was Zabdiel, the son of Gedolim.
NEH.11.15	And of the Levites: Shemaiah, the son of Hashub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;
NEH.11.16	and Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the principals of the Levites, overseers of the exterior work of the house of God.
NEH.11.17	And Mattaniah, the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer; and Bakbukiah, the second among his brethren, and Abda, the son of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.
NEH.11.18	All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred and eighty-four.
NEH.11.19	Moreover, the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren, guards at the gates, were one hundred and seventy-two.
NEH.11.20	And the residue of Israel, of the priests and the Levites, were in all the cities of Judah, each one in his inheritance.
NEH.11.21	And the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, {Heb. the fortress}, and Ziha and Gispa were over the Nethinims.
NEH.11.22	The overseer of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi, the son of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micha of singers, the sons of Asaph, over the work of the house of God.
NEH.11.23	For there was a commandment of the king concerning them and a determination of the singers for each day.
NEH.11.24	And Pethahiah, the son of Meshezabeel, of the sons of Zerah, the son of Judah, was at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people.
NEH.11.25	And regarding the villages with their lands, some of the sons of Judah dwelt in Kirjatharba and in its villages and in Dibon and in its villages and in Jekabzeel and in its villages,
NEH.11.26	and in Jeshua and in Moladah and in Bethphelet
NEH.11.27	and in Hazarshual and in Beersheba and in its villages
NEH.11.28	and in Ziklag and in Mekonah and in its villages,
NEH.11.29	and in Enrimmon and in Zareah and in Jarmuth,
NEH.11.30	Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, in Lachish and its lands, in Azekah and in its villages. And they dwelt from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom.
NEH.11.31	The sons of Benjamin from Geba dwelt in Michmash and Aija and Bethel and in their villages
NEH.11.32	and in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,
NEH.11.33	Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,
NEH.11.34	Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,
NEH.11.35	Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.
NEH.11.36	And of the Levites there were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.
NEH.12.1	Now these are the priests and the Levites that came up with Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel and with Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
NEH.12.2	Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
NEH.12.3	Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,
NEH.12.4	Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,
NEH.12.5	Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,
NEH.12.6	Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,/strong>
NEH.12.7	Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the princes of the priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.
NEH.12.8	And the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his brethren officiated in the songs of praise.
NEH.12.9	Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were before them in the watches.
NEH.12.10	And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim begat Eliashib, and Eliashib begat Joiada,
NEH.12.11	Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	And in the days of Joiakim the priests, the heads of the families were of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;
NEH.12.13	of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;
NEH.12.14	of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;
NEH.12.15	of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;
NEH.12.16	of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;
NEH.12.17	of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai;
NEH.12.18	of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;
NEH.12.19	of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;
NEH.12.20	of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;
NEH.12.21	of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.
NEH.12.22	The Levites in the days of Eliashib, of Joiada and of Johanan and of Jaddua, were recorded as heads of families; also the priests, until the reign of Darius, the Persian.
NEH.12.23	The sons of Levi, heads of families, were written in the book of the chronicles, until the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib.
NEH.12.24	The heads of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, the son of Kadmiel, and their brethren before them, to praise and to give thanks, according to the statute of David, the man of God, keeping each one their ward.
NEH.12.25	Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.
NEH.12.26	These were in the days of Joiakim, the son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the captain, and of Ezra, the priest and scribe.
NEH.12.27	And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgiving and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.
NEH.12.28	And the sons of the singers were gathered together, both out of the plain country round about Jerusalem and from the villages of Netophathi;
NEH.12.29	also from the house of Gilgal and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth; for the singers had built themselves villages round about Jerusalem.
NEH.12.30	And the priests and the Levites purified themselves and purified the people and the gates and the wall.
NEH.12.31	Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall and appointed two great choirs which went in procession, one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate.
NEH.12.32	And after them went Hoshaiah and half of the princes of Judah,
NEH.12.33	and Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah;
NEH.12.35	and certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets: namely, Zechariah, the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;
NEH.12.36	and his brethren, Shemaiah, Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethaneel, Judah, and Hanani, with the musical instruments of David, the man of God, and Ezra, the scribe, before them.
NEH.12.37	And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, from the house of David unto the water gate eastward.
NEH.12.38	And the second choir went over against them, and I after them with half of the people upon the wall, from the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall,
NEH.12.39	and from the gate of Ephraim, to the old gate, and to the fish gate, to the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, unto the sheep gate; and they stood still in the gate of the guards.
NEH.12.40	Then the two choirs stood in the house of God, and I and half of the rulers with me;
NEH.12.41	and the priests: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;
NEH.12.42	and Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malchijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.
NEH.12.43	Also that day they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women also and the children rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.
NEH.12.44	And at that time men were appointed over the chambers of the treasures, of the offerings, of the firstfruits, and of the tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the legal portions for the priests and the Levites; for the joy of Judah was upon the priests and the Levites that served.
NEH.12.45	And they kept the ward of their God and the ward of the purification, and the singers and the porters, according to the statute of David and of Solomon, his son.
NEH.12.46	For from the time of David and Asaph of old there were princes of the singers, and songs and praise and thanksgiving unto God.
NEH.12.47	And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, each thing in its day; and they sanctified them unto the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the sons of Aaron.
NEH.13.1	On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and it was found written therein that the Ammonites and the Moabites should not come into the congregation of God forever
NEH.13.2	because they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them; howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.
NEH.13.3	Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.
NEH.13.4	And before this, Eliashib, the priest, had been the overseer of the chamber of the house of our God, and was related to Tobiah,
NEH.13.5	and he had prepared for him a great chamber, where before they had kept the present, the frankincense, the vessels, the tithe of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, to the singers and the porters and the offerings of the priests.
NEH.13.6	But in all this time I was not at Jerusalem; for in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon, I went unto the king, and after certain days I was sent by the king.
NEH.13.7	And I came to Jerusalem and understood the evil that Eliashib had done attending Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
NEH.13.8	And it grieved me sore; therefore, I cast forth all the household vessels of Tobiah out of the chamber.
NEH.13.9	Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers; and I caused the vessels of the house of God to be brought there again, with the present and the frankincense.
NEH.13.10	And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given to them and that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, had fled each one to his inheritance.
NEH.13.11	Then I contended with the rulers and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together and set them in their place.
NEH.13.12	Then all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, of the new wine, and of the oil unto the store houses.
NEH.13.13	And I made treasurers over the store houses, Shelemiah, the priest, and Zadok, the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah; and next to them was Hanan, the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their brethren.
NEH.13.14	Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my mercies that I have done for the house of my God and for its wards.
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw in Judah some treading wine presses on the sabbath and bringing in sheaves and lading asses with wine, grapes, figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I protested unto them the day in which they sold the food.
NEH.13.16	There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought fish and all manner of merchandise, and sold on the sabbath to the sons of Judah in Jerusalem.
NEH.13.17	Then I contended with the nobles of Judah and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do and profane thus the sabbath day?
NEH.13.18	Did not your fathers do this, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us and upon this city? Yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.
NEH.13.19	And it came to pass, that when shadow came to the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut and charged that they should not be opened until after the sabbath; and I set some of my servants at the gates, that no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.
NEH.13.20	So the merchants and sellers of all kinds of merchandise lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.
NEH.13.21	Then I testified and protested against them and said unto them, Why do ye lodge about the wall? If ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth they came no more on the sabbath.
NEH.13.22	And I told the Levites that they should cleanse themselves and that they should come and guard the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy mercy.
NEH.13.23	In those days I also saw Jews that had married wives of Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab;
NEH.13.24	and their sons spoke half in the speech of Ashdod, and according to the language of each people; for they could not speak in the Jews’ language.
NEH.13.25	And I contended with them and cursed them and smote certain of them and plucked off their hair and made them swear by God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.
NEH.13.26	Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin by these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him, who was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless, strange women caused even him to offend.
NEH.13.27	Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to transgress against our God in marrying strange women?
NEH.13.28	And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib, the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite; therefore, I chased him from me.
NEH.13.29	Remember them, O my God because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and of the Levites.
NEH.13.30	Thus I cleansed them from all strangers and appointed the wards of the priests and the Levites, each one in his work,
NEH.13.31	and for the wood offering, at the appointed times, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.
EST.1.1	Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus who reigned from India even unto Ethiopia over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces)
EST.1.2	That in those days, when the King Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan, the palace,
EST.1.3	In the third year of his reign, he made a banquet unto all his princes and his slaves, having before him the power of Persia and Media, the governors and princes of the provinces,
EST.1.4	to show them the riches of the glory of his kingdom and the honour of beauty of his greatness for many days, even one hundred and eighty days.
EST.1.5	And when these days were expired, the king made a banquet unto all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both unto great and small, for seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace.
EST.1.6	There were white, green, and blue hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble; the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of porphyre and of marble and of alabaster and of blue.
EST.1.7	And they gave them drink in vessels of gold (the vessels being diverse one from another) and royal wine in abundance, according to the power of the king.
EST.1.8	And the drink was according to this law: let no one constrain themselves; for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to the will of each one.
EST.1.9	Likewise Vashti, the queen, made a banquet for the women in the royal house of King Ahasuerus.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs that served in the presence of Ahasuerus, the king,
EST.1.11	to bring Vashti, the queen, before the king with the crown of the kingdom, to show the people and the princes her beauty, for she was fair to behold.
EST.1.12	But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s word by his eunuchs; therefore, the king was very wroth, and his anger burned in him.
EST.1.13	Then the king asked the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew about the law and rights,
EST.1.14	and the next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and who sat first in the kingdom;)
EST.1.15	What shall we do unto Queen Vashti according to law because she has not performed the decree of King Ahasuerus by the eunuchs?
EST.1.16	And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti, the queen, has not only committed iniquity against the king, but also against all the princes and against all the people that are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus.
EST.1.17	For this deed of the queen shall be known abroad unto all the women so that they shall despise their husbands, saying, King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti, the queen, to be brought in before him, but she did not come.
EST.1.18	And now the princesses of Persia and Media who have heard of the deed of the queen shall say this unto all the king’s princes, and there shall be much contempt and wrath.
EST.1.19	If it pleases the king, let there go forth a royal commandment from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it not be altered, That Vashti come no more before King Ahasuerus, and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she.
EST.1.20	And this sentence which the king shall make shall be heard throughout all his empire, although it is great, and all the wives shall give their husbands honour, from the greatest to the least.
EST.1.21	And this word pleased the king and the princes, and the king did according to the word of Memucan;
EST.1.22	for he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, saying, That every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people.
EST.2.1	After these things, when the wrath of King Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her.
EST.2.2	Then the king’s servants that ministered unto him said, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king,
EST.2.3	and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins unto Shushan, the palace, to the house of the women, unto the custody of Hege, the king’s eunuch, keeper of the women; and let them be given that which is necessary for their purification;
EST.2.4	and let the maiden which pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king, and he did so.
EST.2.5	Now in Shushan, the palace, there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;
EST.2.6	who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with Jeconiah, king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had carried away.
EST.2.7	And he had brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter; for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; and as her father and mother were dead, Mordecai had taken her for his own daughter.
EST.2.8	So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto Shushan, the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also unto the king’s house to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.
EST.2.9	And the maiden pleased him, and she found mercy before him; and he speedily gave her that which was necessary for purification and her rations, and seven maidens, which were meet to be given her out of the king’s house; and he moved her and her maids into the best place of the house of the women.
EST.2.10	Esther had not declared her people nor her birth, for Mordecai had charged her that she should not declare it.
EST.2.11	And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house to know the peace of Esther and what was done with her.
EST.2.12	Now when each maid’s turn was come to go in to King Ahasuerus, after she had been twelve months according to the law regarding the women (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, that is, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with aromatic odours and oils for women),
EST.2.13	then thus came each maiden unto the king; whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women unto the king’s house.
EST.2.14	In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch, who kept the concubines; she came in unto the king no more, unless the king delighted in her and called for her by name.
EST.2.15	Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail, the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai, the king’s eunuch, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained grace in the sight of all those that looked upon her.
EST.2.16	So Esther was taken unto King Ahasuerus into his royal house in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.
EST.2.17	And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and mercy in his sight more than did all the other virgins so that he set the crown of the kingdom upon her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.
EST.2.18	Then the king made a great banquet unto all his princes and his slaves, the banquet of Esther; and he made a release to the provinces of their taxes and gave gifts according to the power of the king.
EST.2.19	And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.
EST.2.20	Esther had not yet declared her birth nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her; for Esther did the commandment of Mordecai as when she was being brought up with him.
EST.2.21	In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s eunuchs, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which kept the door, were wroth and sought to lay hand on King Ahasuerus.
EST.2.22	And the thing was known by Mordecai, who told it unto Esther, the queen; and Esther notified the king of this in Mordecai’s name.
EST.2.23	And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out; therefore, they were both hanged on a tree; and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.
EST.3.1	After these things King Ahasuerus promoted Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.
EST.3.2	And all the king’s slaves that were in the king’s gate, knelt down and worshipped Haman, for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai did not kneel or worship before him.
EST.3.3	Then the king’s slaves, who were in the king’s gate, said unto Mordecai, Why dost thou pass over the king’s commandment?
EST.3.4	Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily unto him, and he did not hearken unto them, that they told Haman to see whether Mordecai’s word would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.
EST.3.5	And when Haman saw that Mordecai did not kneel or worship before him, then Haman was filled with wrath.
EST.3.6	And he thought it a small matter to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for now they had declared unto him the people of Mordecai; therefore, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, the people of Mordecai.
EST.3.7	In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day and from month to month, and the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar was taken.
EST.3.8	And Haman said unto King Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of thy kingdom, and their laws are different from all other people; neither do they observe the king’s laws: therefore, it is not profitable for the king to allow them to remain.
EST.3.9	If it pleases the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed; and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the public works, to bring it into the king’s treasuries.
EST.3.10	And the king took his ring from his hand and gave it unto Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy.
EST.3.11	And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to thee.
EST.3.12	Then the king’s scribes were called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and it was written according to all that Haman had commanded unto the king’s lieutenants and to the governors that were over each province and to the rulers of every people of every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language; in the name of King Ahasuerus it was written and sealed with the king’s ring.
EST.3.13	And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.
EST.3.14	The copy of the writing was to be given as law in every province that it be published unto all the peoples, that they should be ready against that day.
EST.3.15	The posts went out in haste by the king’s commandment, and the law was given in Shushan, the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Shushan was perplexed.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth with ashes and went out into the midst of the city and cried with a loud and a bitter cry
EST.4.2	and came before the king’s gate; for no one was allowed to enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.
EST.4.3	And in each province, wherever the king’s commandment and his law came, there was great mourning among the Jews and fasting and weeping and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes.
EST.4.4	So Esther’s maids and her eunuchs came and told her. Then the queen was grieved exceedingly, and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai and to take away his sackcloth from him; but he did not receive it.
EST.4.5	Then Esther called for Hatach, one of the king’s eunuchs, whom he had appointed to attend her, and sent him to Mordecai, to know what it was and why it was.
EST.4.6	So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the plaza of the city, which was before the king’s gate.
EST.4.7	And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.
EST.4.8	Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it unto Esther and to declare it unto her and to charge her that she should go in unto the king to make supplication unto him and to make request before him for her people.
EST.4.9	And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.
EST.4.10	Again Esther spoke unto Hatach and sent him to say unto Mordecai,
EST.4.11	All the king’s slaves and the people of the king’s provinces do know that anyone, whether man or woman, who shall come unto the king into the inner court without being called, by one law shall be put to death, unless the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that they may live; but I have not been called to come in unto the king these thirty days.
EST.4.12	And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.
EST.4.13	Then Mordecai told them to answer Esther, Do not think in thy soul that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.
EST.4.14	For if thou art silent at this time, then enlargement and deliverance shall arise to the Jews from another place, but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed; and who knows whether thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?
EST.4.15	Then Esther told them to return Mordecai this answer,
EST.4.16	Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan and fast for me, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day; I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so I will go in unto the king, even though this is not according to the law; and if I perish, I perish.
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went and did according to all that Esther had commanded him.
EST.5.1	Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, over against the king’s house; and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of the house.
EST.5.2	And it was so, when the king saw Esther, the queen, standing in the court, that she had grace in his sight; and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near and touched the top of the sceptre.
EST.5.3	Then the king said unto her, What wilt thou, Queen Esther? And what is thy request? It shall be given thee, even to the half of the kingdom.
EST.5.4	And Esther answered, If it seems good to the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.
EST.5.5	Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste that he may do as Esther has said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.5.6	And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? And it shall be granted thee. What is thy request? Even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.
EST.5.7	Then answered Esther and said, My petition and my request is:
EST.5.8	If I have found grace in the sight of the king and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do tomorrow as the king has commanded.
EST.5.9	Then Haman went forth that day joyful and with a glad heart, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate and that he did not stand up nor move for him, he was filled with indignation against Mordecai.
EST.5.10	Nevertheless, Haman refrained himself, and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends and Zeresh, his wife.
EST.5.11	And Haman told them of the glory of his riches and the multitude of his sons and all the things in which the king had promoted him and how he had advanced him above the princes and slaves of the king.
EST.5.12	Haman said, moreover, Even Esther, the queen, let no one come in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but myself, and tomorrow I am also invited by her with the king.
EST.5.13	Yet all this avails me nothing so long as I see Mordecai, the Jew, sitting at the king’s gate.
EST.5.14	Then said Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends unto him, Let a gallows {Heb. stake} be made fifty cubits high, and tomorrow speak unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged upon it; then go in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman, and he caused the gallows to be made.
EST.6.1	On that night the king could not sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles, and they were read before the king.
EST.6.2	And it was found written that Mordecai had told of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs, the keepers of the door, who had sought to lay hand on King Ahasuerus.
EST.6.3	And the king said, What honour and dignity has been done unto Mordecai for this? Then the king’s servants who ministered unto him answered, Nothing has been done for him.
EST.6.4	And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman had come into the outward court of the king’s house to speak unto the king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for him.
EST.6.5	And the king’s servants said unto him, Behold, Haman stands in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.
EST.6.6	So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be done unto the man whom the king delights to honour? Now Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to do honour more than to myself?
EST.6.7	And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king delights to honour,
EST.6.8	let the royal apparel be brought which the king wears, and the horse that the king rides upon, and the royal crown which is set upon his head;
EST.6.9	and let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one of the king’s most noble princes, that he may clothe the man whom the king delights to honour and bring him on horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honour.
EST.6.10	Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel and the horse, as thou hast said, and do so unto Mordecai, the Jew, that sits at the king’s gate; let nothing fail of all that thou hast spoken.
EST.6.11	Then Haman took the apparel and the horse and clothed Mordecai and brought him on horseback through the plaza of the city and caused it to be proclaimed before him, Thus shall be done unto the man whom the king delights to honour.
EST.6.12	After that Mordecai returned to the king’s gate. But Haman hastened to his house mourning and having his head covered.
EST.6.13	And Haman told Zeresh, his wife, and all his friends all that had befallen him. Then his wise men and Zeresh, his wife, said unto him, If Mordecai is of the seed of the Jews, before whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against him, but shalt surely fall before him.
EST.6.14	And while they were yet talking with him, the king’s eunuchs came in haste to bring Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman came to the banquet with Esther, the queen.
EST.7.2	And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition, Queen Esther? And it shall be granted thee. What is thy request? And it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.
EST.7.3	Then Esther, the queen, answered and said, If I have found grace in thy sight, O king and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me at my petition and my people at my request.
EST.7.4	For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to perish. If we had been sold for menslaves and womenslaves, I would remain silent, even though the enemy could not recompense the damage to the king.
EST.7.5	And King Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther, the queen, Who is he, and where is he, that has filled his heart with the arrogance to do so?
EST.7.6	Then Esther said, The man who is the adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman. Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.
EST.7.7	And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath went into the palace garden, and Haman stood up to make request for his life to Esther, the queen; for he saw that there was evil determined against him by the king.
EST.7.8	Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place of the banquet of wine, and Haman had fallen upon the bed upon which Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the queen also before me in the house? When this word went out of the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face.
EST.7.9	Then said Harbonah, one of the eunuchs before the king, Behold also, the gallows {Heb. stake} fifty cubits high, which Haman had made for Mordecai, who had spoken good for the king, stands in the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him upon it.
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king’s wrath was pacified.
EST.8.1	On that same day King Ahasuerus gave the house of Haman, the Jews’ enemy, unto Esther, the queen. And Mordecai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was unto her.
EST.8.2	And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the house of Haman.
EST.8.3	And Esther spoke yet again before the king and fell down at his feet and besought him with tears to put away the evil of Haman, the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.
EST.8.4	Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So Esther arose and stood before the king,
EST.8.5	And said, If it pleases the king and if I have found grace in his sight and if the thing is right before the king and if I am good in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the king’s provinces.
EST.8.6	For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my people? How can I endure to see the destruction of my nation?
EST.8.7	Then King Ahasuerus said unto Esther, the queen, and to Mordecai, the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him upon the gallows because he extended his hand against the Jews.
EST.8.8	Write ye also for the Jews, as it pleases you, in the king’s name, and seal it with the king’s ring; for the writing which is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s ring may not be revoked.
EST.8.9	Then the king’s scribes were called at that time in the third month, that is, the month Sivan, on the twenty-third day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai commanded unto the Jews and to the lieutenants and the captains and the princes of the provinces which are from India unto Ethiopia, one hundred and twenty-seven provinces, unto each province according to the writing thereof, and unto each people after their language, and to the Jews according to their writing, and according to their language.
EST.8.10	And he wrote in King Ahasuerus’s name and sealed it with the king’s ring and sent letters by posts on horseback, and riders on mules, mules that were born of mares,
EST.8.11	that the king granted power to the Jews who were in all the cities to gather themselves together and to stand for their life, to destroy, to slay, and to cause to perish any army of the people or province that would assault them, and even their little ones and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,
EST.8.12	upon the same day in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, namely, upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar.
EST.8.13	The copy of the writing which was to be given as law in each province was published unto all people and said that the Jews should be ready against that day to avenge themselves of their enemies.
EST.8.14	So the posts rode upon mules, they went out on mules, being hastened and pressed on by the king’s commandment. And the law was given at Shushan, the palace.
EST.8.15	And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal apparel of blue and white and with a great crown of gold and with a mantel of fine linen and purple; and the city of Shushan rejoiced and was glad.
EST.8.16	The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honour.
EST.8.17	And in each province and in each city wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and gladness, a banquet and a good day. And many of the people of the land became Jews, for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.
EST.9.1	Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king’s commandment and his law drew near to be put in execution, in the day that the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, it was turned to the contrary; for the Jews took dominion over those that hated them.
EST.9.2	The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, to lay hand on such as sought their hurt; and no one could withstand them, for the fear of them had fallen upon all the peoples.
EST.9.3	And all the princes of the provinces and the lieutenants and the captains and officers of the king helped the Jews because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.
EST.9.4	For Mordecai was great in the king’s house, and his fame went out throughout all the provinces, for this man Mordecai waxed greater and greater.
EST.9.5	Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the sword and slaughter and destruction and did what they would unto those that hated them.
EST.9.6	And in Shushan, the palace, the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men.
EST.9.7	Then they also slew Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vajezatha,
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman, the son of Hammedatha; the enemy of the Jews, they slew, but on the spoil they did not lay their hand.
EST.9.11	On the same day the number of those that were slain in Shushan, the palace, was brought before the king.
EST.9.12	And the king said unto Esther, the queen, The Jews have slain and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan, the palace, and the ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? Now what is thy petition, and it shall be granted thee? What is thy request further, and it shall be done?
EST.9.13	Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews who are in Shushan to do tomorrow also according unto this day’s decree, and let Haman’s ten sons be hanged upon the gallows. {Heb. stake}
EST.9.14	And the king commanded it to be so done; and it was given as law at Shushan; and they hanged Haman’s ten sons.
EST.9.15	And the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together also on the fourteenth day of the month Adar and slew three hundred men at Shushan; but on the spoil they did not lay their hand.
EST.9.16	And the other Jews that were in the king’s provinces also gathered themselves together and stood for their lives and had rest from their enemies and slew of their foes seventy-five thousand, but they did not lay their hands on the spoil,
EST.9.17	on the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of banquet and gladness.
EST.9.18	But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the thirteenth day thereof and on the fourteenth thereof; and on the fifteenth day of the same they rested and made it a day of banquet and gladness.
EST.9.19	Therefore, the Jews of the villages that dwelt in the unwalled towns made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of gladness and banquet and a good day and of sending portions one to another.
EST.9.20	And Mordecai wrote these things and sent letters unto all the Jews that were in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far,
EST.9.21	to establish this among them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and the fifteenth day of the same, yearly,
EST.9.22	as the days in which the Jews had rest from their enemies and the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy and from mourning into a good day, that they should make them days of banquet and joy and of sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor.
EST.9.23	And the Jews accepting this began to do as Mordecai had written unto them.
EST.9.24	Because Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them and to destroy them,
EST.9.25	but when she came before the king, he commanded by letters that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews, should return upon his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.
EST.9.26	Therefore, they called these days Purim after the name of Pur. Therefore, for all the words of this letter and of that which they had seen concerning this matter and which had come unto them,
EST.9.27	the Jews ordained and took upon them and upon their seed and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it should not fail, that they would keep these two days according to their writing and according to their appointed time each year,
EST.9.28	and that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, every family, every province, and every city, and that these days of Purim should not fail from among the Jews nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.
EST.9.29	Then Esther, the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai, the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second letter of Purim.
EST.9.30	And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with words of peace and truth,
EST.9.31	to confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed, according as Mordecai, the Jew, and Esther, the queen, had enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for their seed, the words of the fastings and their cry.
EST.9.32	And the commandment of Esther confirmed these words of Purim, and it was written in the book.
EST.10.1	And King Ahasuerus laid tribute upon the land and upon the isles of the sea.
EST.10.2	And all the acts of his power and of his might and the declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, unto which the king advanced him, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?
EST.10.3	For Mordecai, the Jew, was next unto King Ahasuerus and great among the Jews and accepted of the multitude of his brethren, seeking the good of his people and speaking peace unto all his seed.
JOB.1.1	There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God and departed from evil.
JOB.1.2	And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
JOB.1.3	His substance was seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she asses, and a very great store of servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
JOB.1.4	And his sons went and had banquets in their houses, each one on his day, and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
JOB.1.5	And it was so, when the days of their banquets were over, that Job sent and sanctified them and rose up early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned and blasphemed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
JOB.1.6	Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.1.7	And the 
JOB.1.8	And the 
JOB.1.9	Then Satan answered the 
JOB.1.10	Hast thou not made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he has on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands; therefore, his substance has increased in the land.
JOB.1.11	But put forth thy hand now and touch all that he has, and thou shalt see if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face.
JOB.1.12	And the 
JOB.1.13	And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;
JOB.1.14	and a messenger came unto Job and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;
JOB.1.15	and the Sabeans {Heb. those of Sheba} fell upon them and took them away; they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
JOB.1.16	While he was yet speaking, another came who said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven and has burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
JOB.1.17	While he was yet speaking, another came and said, The Chaldeans made three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
JOB.1.18	While he was yet speaking, there another came and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in the house of their brother, the firstborn;
JOB.1.19	and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell thee.
JOB.1.20	Then Job arose and rent his mantle and shaved his head and fell down upon the ground and worshipped
JOB.1.21	and said, Naked came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. The 
JOB.1.22	In all this Job did not sin nor charge God with folly.
JOB.2.1	Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the 
JOB.2.2	And the 
JOB.2.3	And the 
JOB.2.4	And Satan answered the 
JOB.2.5	But put forth thy hand now and touch his bone and his flesh, and thou shalt see if he does not blaspheme thee to thy face.
JOB.2.6	And the 
JOB.2.7	So Satan went forth from the presence of the 
JOB.2.8	And he took a potsherd to scratch himself with, and he was sitting among the ashes.
JOB.2.9	Then his wife said unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity? Blaspheme God and die.
JOB.2.10	But he said unto her, Thou hast spoken as any of the foolish women speak. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips.
JOB.2.11	Now three friends of Job, Eliphaz, the Temanite, Bildad, the Shuhite, and Zophar, the Naamathite, when they heard of all this evil that had come upon him, each one came from his own place; for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
JOB.2.12	And when they lifted up their eyes afar off and knew him not, they lifted up their voice and wept; and each one rent his mantle and sprinkled dust upon his head toward heaven.
JOB.2.13	So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word unto him; for they saw that his grief was very great.
JOB.3.1	After this Job opened his mouth and cursed his day.
JOB.3.2	And Job spoke and said,
JOB.3.3	Let the day perish in which I was born and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
JOB.3.4	Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above; neither let the light shine upon it.
JOB.3.5	Let darkness and the shadow of death redeem it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
JOB.3.6	As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months.
JOB.3.7	O, let that night be solitary; let no song come therein!
JOB.3.8	Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
JOB.3.9	Let the stars of its dawn be darkened; they waited for light, but have none; neither let them see the dawning of the day;
JOB.3.10	because it did not shut up the doors of my mother’s womb nor hide the misery from my eyes.
JOB.3.11	Why did I not die from the womb? Why did I not give up the spirit when I came out of the belly?
JOB.3.12	Why did the knees receive me? Of what use the breasts that I should suck?
JOB.3.13	For now I should have lain still and been quiet; I should have slept; then I would have been at rest,
JOB.3.14	with the kings and the counsellors of the earth, who built desolate places for themselves;
JOB.3.15	or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver.
JOB.3.16	Or, why was I not hidden as an untimely birth, as infants who never saw light?
JOB.3.17	There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary are at rest.
JOB.3.18	There the prisoners rest together, they do not hear the voice of the oppressor.
JOB.3.19	The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.
JOB.3.20	Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
JOB.3.21	who long for death, but it comes not; and search for it more than for hid treasures;
JOB.3.22	who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they can find the grave;
JOB.3.23	to the man who does not know which way he goes and whom God has hedged in?
JOB.3.24	For my sighing comes before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
JOB.3.25	For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
JOB.3.26	I never had prosperity, nor did I secure myself, neither was I at rest; yet trouble came.
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz, the Temanite, answered and said,
JOB.4.2	If we attempt to commune with thee, thou wilt be grieved. But who can withhold himself from speaking?
JOB.4.3	Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
JOB.4.4	Thy words have upheld the one that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
JOB.4.5	But now that it is come upon thee, thou art grieved; it touches thee, and thou art troubled.
JOB.4.6	Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the integrity of thy ways?
JOB.4.7	Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? Or where were the righteous cut off?
JOB.4.8	Even as I have seen, those that plow iniquity and sow wickedness, reap the same.
JOB.4.9	By the breath of God they perish, and by the spirit of his anger they are consumed.
JOB.4.10	The roaring of the lion and the voice of the fierce lion and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
JOB.4.11	The old lion perishes for lack of prey, and the stout lion’s whelps are scattered abroad.
JOB.4.12	Now the matter was also hidden from me, but my ear has perceived a little of it.
JOB.4.13	In imaginations of visions of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men,
JOB.4.14	fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
JOB.4.15	Then a spirit passed before me which caused the hair of my flesh to stand up.
JOB.4.16	A ghost stood in front of me, whose face I did not recognize, and I heard it say,
JOB.4.17	Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his maker?
JOB.4.18	Behold, he put no trust in his slaves, and his angels he charged with folly.
JOB.4.19	How much more with those that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who shall be crushed by the moth!
JOB.4.20	They are destroyed from morning to evening; they perish for ever without anyone regarding it.
JOB.4.21	Does their beauty perish with them? They die and do not know.
JOB.5.1	Call now, if there shall be anyone to answer thee; and if there shall be any of the saints for thee to look unto?
JOB.5.2	It is certain that wrath kills the foolish man, and envy consumes the covetous one.
JOB.5.3	I have seen the foolish taking root, but at the same time I cursed his habitation.
JOB.5.4	His sons are far from saving health, and they shall be crushed in the gate, and there shall be no one to deliver them.
JOB.5.5	The hungry shall eat up his harvest, and even take it out from among the thorns, and the thirsty shall drink up their substance.
JOB.5.6	For the iniquity does not come forth out of the dust; neither does chastisement spring up out of the ground;
JOB.5.7	yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	I would certainly seek God, and unto God would I commit my affairs;
JOB.5.9	who does great things that no one can understand, and marvels that have no explanation;
JOB.5.10	who gives rain upon the earth and sends waters abroad;
JOB.5.11	who sets up the humble on high, that those who mourn may be lifted up with saving health.
JOB.5.12	He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
JOB.5.13	He takes the wise in their own prudence, and the counsel of his adversaries is turned to folly.
JOB.5.14	They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope in the noonday as in the night.
JOB.5.15	But he saves the poor from the sword, from the mouth of the wicked, and from the hand of the violent.
JOB.5.16	Who is the hope of the poor, and iniquity closes her mouth.
JOB.5.17	Behold, blessed is the man whom God chastens; therefore, do not despise not the correction of the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	For he makes sore, and binds up; he wounds, and his hands make whole.
JOB.5.19	He shall deliver thee in six tribulations, and in the seventh no evil shall touch thee.
JOB.5.20	In famine he shall ransom thee from death, and in war from the power of the sword.
JOB.5.21	Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it comes.
JOB.5.22	At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh; neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth;
JOB.5.23	for thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
JOB.5.24	And thou shalt know that there is peace in thy tent, and thou shalt visit thy habitation and shalt not sin.
JOB.5.25	Thou shalt know that thy seed is great and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
JOB.5.26	Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like a shock of wheat that is gathered in its season.
JOB.5.27	Behold that which we have searched out, so it is; hear it and judge it for thyself.
JOB.6.1	And Job answered and said,
JOB.6.2	Oh that my grief and calamity were justly weighed and laid equally in the balances!
JOB.6.3	For it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore, my words are swallowed up.
JOB.6.4	For the arrows of the Almighty are within me; my spirit drinks of the poison; and terrors of God combat me.
JOB.6.5	Does the wild ass bray when he has grass? Does the ox low over his fodder?
JOB.6.6	Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
JOB.6.7	The things that my soul refused to touch before, now by my sorrow are my food.
JOB.6.8	Oh, that I might have my request and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
JOB.6.9	Even that it would please God to destroy me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!
JOB.6.10	Then should my comfort grow; I would hold on to sorrow without mercy; for I have not contradicted the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	What is my strength that I should hope? What is my end that I should prolong my life?
JOB.6.12	Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of steel?
JOB.6.13	Am I not doing all that I can, and even with all this I lack the power to do anything?
JOB.6.14	He that is afflicted deserves mercy from his friend; but he has forsaken the fear of the Almighty.
JOB.6.15	My brethren have lied to me as a brook; they passed away as an impetuous stream,
JOB.6.16	which was hidden by ice and covered by snow.
JOB.6.17	Which in the time of heat, they vanish; when they are heated, they disappear out of their place;
JOB.6.18	they turn aside out of the paths of their way; they go to nothing and perish.
JOB.6.19	The travelers of Tema looked; the traveling companies of Sheba waited for them.
JOB.6.20	They were put to shame because of their hope; they came there and found them confused.
JOB.6.21	Now ye are certainly as they; ye have seen the torment and are afraid.
JOB.6.22	Did I say, Bring unto me and pay for me out of your substance
JOB.6.23	and deliver me from the enemy’s hand and ransom me from the hand of the mighty?
JOB.6.24	Teach me, and I will be silent; and cause me to understand in what I have erred.
JOB.6.25	How forcible are the words of rectitude! But what does your argument reprove?
JOB.6.26	Are ye not thinking up words of reproof and throw to the wind words that are lost?
JOB.6.27	Ye also overwhelm the fatherless and dig a pit before your friend.
JOB.6.28	Now, therefore, if ye desire, look upon me and see if I shall lie in your presence.
JOB.6.29	Turn now, and there is no iniquity; return again to look for my righteousness in this.
JOB.6.30	If there is iniquity in my tongue or if my taste cannot discern the torments.
JOB.7.1	Man certainly has an appointed amount of time upon earth, and his days are like the days of a hireling.
JOB.7.2	As a slave earnestly desires the shade and as a hireling waits for rest from his work,
JOB.7.3	so I am made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise? I measure the night, and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
JOB.7.5	My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken and abominable.
JOB.7.6	My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle and are spent without hope.
JOB.7.7	Remember thou that my life is wind and that my eyes shall not return to see good.
JOB.7.8	The eyes of those that see me now shall not see me again; thine eyes shall be upon me, and I will cease to be.
JOB.7.9	As the cloud is consumed and vanishes away, so he that goes down to Sheol, who shall not come up again;
JOB.7.10	he shall return no more to his house; neither shall his place know him any more.
JOB.7.11	Therefore, I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.7.12	Am I a sea, or a dragon, that thou settest a watch over me?
JOB.7.13	When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
JOB.7.14	then thou dost scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions.
JOB.7.15	And my soul thought it better to be strangled and desired death more than my bones.
JOB.7.16	I loathed life; I do not desire to live for ever; let me alone; for my days are vanity.
JOB.7.17	What is man that thou should magnify him and that thou should set thine heart upon him
JOB.7.18	and that thou should visit him every morning and try him every moment?
JOB.7.19	For how long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone until I swallow down my spittle?
JOB.7.20	If I have sinned, what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? Why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
JOB.7.21	And why dost thou not take away my rebellion and pass over my iniquity? For now I shall sleep in the dust; and if thou shalt seek me in the morning, I shall not be found.
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad, the Shuhite, answered and said,
JOB.8.2	How long wilt thou speak such things and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
JOB.8.3	Shall God pervert that which is right or shall the Almighty pervert justice?
JOB.8.4	Because thy sons sinned against him, he cast them away in the place of their rebellion;
JOB.8.5	if thou would seek God early and make thy supplication to the Almighty,
JOB.8.6	if thou wert pure and upright, surely now he would awake upon thee and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
JOB.8.7	In such a way that thy beginning would have been small, in comparison to the great increase of thy latter.
JOB.8.8	Ask, I pray thee, of the former age, and be willing to enquire of thy fathers regarding them;
JOB.8.9	for we are but of yesterday and know nothing because our days upon earth are as a shadow.
JOB.8.10	Shall they not teach thee and tell thee and utter these words out of their heart?
JOB.8.11	Can the rush grow up without mire? Can the meadow grow without water?
JOB.8.12	Whilst it is yet in its greenness and not cut down, it withers before any other herb.
JOB.8.13	So are the paths of all that forget God, and the hypocrite’s hope shall perish.
JOB.8.14	For his hope shall be cut off, and his trust is a spider’s web.
JOB.8.15	He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
JOB.8.16	Like a tree, he is green before the sun, and his branches go forth over his garden;
JOB.8.17	his roots weave themselves around a spring and secure themselves even in a stony place.
JOB.8.18	If he is uprooted from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
JOB.8.19	Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth from where he was transplanted, others shall grow.
JOB.8.20	Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man; neither will he help the evil doers.
JOB.8.21	He will yet fill thy mouth with laughing and thy lips with shouts of joy.
JOB.8.22	Those that hate thee shall be clothed with shame, and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.9.2	I know it is so of a truth, but how shall a man be justified with God?
JOB.9.3	If he desires to contend with him, he will not be able to answer him one thing of a thousand.
JOB.9.4	He is wise in heart and mighty in strength; who has hardened himself against him and remained in peace?
JOB.9.5	Who uproots the mountains in his anger, and they know not who overturned them.
JOB.9.6	Who removes the earth out of her place and causes her pillars to tremble.
JOB.9.7	Who commands the sun, and it rises not; and seals up the stars.
JOB.9.8	He alone extends the heavens and walks upon the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	He who made Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the secret places of the south.
JOB.9.10	He who does great things past finding out, and wonders without number.
JOB.9.11	Behold, he shall pass before me, and I shall not see him; and he shall pass on, and I shall not understand him.
JOB.9.12	Behold, he shall take away, who can cause him to restore? Who shall say unto him, What doest thou?
JOB.9.13	God will not withdraw his anger, and under him those who help, unto pride are bent over.
JOB.9.14	How much less shall I answer him and choose out my words to reason with him?
JOB.9.15	Who even though I am righteous, yet I would not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
JOB.9.16	Who if I were to invoke him, and he answered me; yet I would not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
JOB.9.17	For he has broken me with a tempest and has multiplied my wounds without cause.
JOB.9.18	He will not suffer me to take my breath but has filled me with bitterness.
JOB.9.19	If we were to speak of his strength, he is certainly strong; and if of his judgment, who shall cause us to meet?
JOB.9.20	If I justify myself, my own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, he shall prove me perverse.
JOB.9.21	If I say I am imperfect, I know not my soul; I would condemn my life.
JOB.9.22	One thing remains, that I say, He consumes the perfect and the wicked.
JOB.9.23	If it is the scourge, it slays suddenly, and it does not laugh at the trial of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the faces of its judges; if it is not he who does this then, who is it and where is he?
JOB.9.25	Now my days are swifter than a post; they fled away, they never saw good.
JOB.9.26	They are passed away as the ships of Ebeh {Heb. reed} as the eagle that throws himself on the prey.
JOB.9.27	If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness and comfort myself;
JOB.9.28	I am afraid of all my troubles; I know that thou wilt not hold me guiltless.
JOB.9.29	If I am wicked, why then shall I toil in vain?
JOB.9.30	If I wash myself with snow water and make my hands never so clean;
JOB.9.31	yet thou shalt plunge me into the pit, and my own clothes shall abhor me.
JOB.9.32	For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together unto judgment.
JOB.9.33	Neither is there any arbiter between us, that might lay his hand upon us both.
JOB.9.34	Let him take his tormentor away from me, and his terror will not perturb me.
JOB.9.35	Then I would speak and not fear him, because in this state I am not myself.
JOB.10.1	My soul is cut off in my life; therefore, I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
JOB.10.2	I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; cause me to understand why thou dost contend with me.
JOB.10.3	Is it good unto thee that thou should oppress, that thou should reject the work of thine hands and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
JOB.10.4	Hast thou eyes of flesh? Dost thou see as man sees?
JOB.10.5	Are thy days as the days of man? Are thy years as man’s days,
JOB.10.6	that thou dost enquire after my iniquity and search after my sin?
JOB.10.7	Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is no one that can deliver out of thy hand.
JOB.10.8	Thine hands have formed me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
JOB.10.9	Remember now that thou hast formed me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
JOB.10.10	Hast thou not poured me out as milk and curdled me like cheese?
JOB.10.11	Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh and hast hedged me with bones and sinews.
JOB.10.12	Thou hast granted me life and mercy, and thy visitation has kept my spirit.
JOB.10.13	And these things thou hast hid in thine heart; I know that this is with thee.
JOB.10.14	If I sinned, wilt thou mark me and not cleanse me from my iniquity?
JOB.10.15	If I am wicked, woe unto me; and if I am righteous, I will not lift up my head, being full of dishonour and of seeing my affliction.
JOB.10.16	And thou dost increase. Thou dost hunt me as a fierce lion; turning and doing marvels in me.
JOB.10.17	Thou dost renew thy plagues against me and increase thine indignation upon me, bringing up armies against me.
JOB.10.18	Why then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the spirit and no eye had seen me!
JOB.10.19	I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
JOB.10.20	Are not my days few? Cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
JOB.10.21	before I go, to not return, to the land of darkness and of the shadow of death;
JOB.10.22	land of darkness, as darkness itself, and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered and said,
JOB.11.2	Should not the multitude of words be answered? And should a man full of talk be justified?
JOB.11.3	Should thy lies make men be silent? Shalt thou mock, and shall no man make thee ashamed?
JOB.11.4	For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean before thine eyes.
JOB.11.5	But oh, that God would speak and open his lips against thee
JOB.11.6	and that he would show thee the secrets of wisdom! For thou dost deserve double according to sound wisdom; and thou dost know that God has forgotten thee because of thine iniquity.
JOB.11.7	Canst thou by searching find out God? Canst thou come unto the perfection of the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	It is higher than the heavens; what canst thou do? It is deeper than Sheol; how canst thou know it?
JOB.11.9	The measure of it is longer than the earth and broader than the sea.
JOB.11.10	If he cuts off, or shuts up, or gathers together, then who can hinder him?
JOB.11.11	For he knows the vain men; and he sees the iniquity; will he not then understand it?
JOB.11.12	The vain man shall make himself understood, though man is born like a wild ass’s colt.
JOB.11.13	If thou would prepare thine heart and stretch out thine hands toward him;
JOB.11.14	if there is any iniquity in thy hand and thou dost put it far away and dost not consent that wickedness dwell in thy habitations,
JOB.11.15	then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; thou shalt be strongly established and shalt not fear;
JOB.11.16	and thou shalt forget thy misery and remember it as waters that passed away;
JOB.11.17	and thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
JOB.11.18	And thou shalt trust because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig and sleep in safety;
JOB.11.19	thou shalt lie down, and no one shall make thee afraid; and many shall make requests unto thee.
JOB.11.20	But the eyes of the wicked shall consume themselves, and they shall have no refuge, and their hope shall be agony of the soul.
JOB.12.1	And Job answered and said,
JOB.12.2	No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
JOB.12.3	But I have a heart as well as you; I am not inferior to you; and who shall not be able to say as much again?
JOB.12.4	He who invokes God and he answers him is mocked by his friend; the just and perfect man is laughed to scorn.
JOB.12.5	The torch is held in low esteem in the thought of him that is prosperous, which was prepared to guard against a slip of the feet.
JOB.12.6	The tents of robbers are at ease, and those that provoke God and those who carry gods in their hands live secure.
JOB.12.7	But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the heavens, and they shall show thee;
JOB.12.8	or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee; the fishes of the sea shall declare it unto thee also.
JOB.12.9	What thing of all these does not know that the hand of the 
JOB.12.10	In his hand is the soul of every living thing and the spirit of all flesh of man.
JOB.12.11	Certainly the ear proves words and the mouth tastes foods.
JOB.12.12	With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days intelligence.
JOB.12.13	With him is wisdom and strength; he has counsel and intelligence.
JOB.12.14	Behold, he shall break down, and it shall not be built again; he shall shut up a man, and no one shall be able to open unto him.
JOB.12.15	Behold, he shall withhold the waters, and they shall dry up; also he shall send them forth, and they shall destroy the earth.
JOB.12.16	With him is strength and existence; he who errs and he who leads astray are his.
JOB.12.17	He causes the counsellors to walk away stripped of counsel and makes the judges to be fools.
JOB.12.18	He looses the bond of kings and girds their loins with a girdle.
JOB.12.19	He leads priests away spoiled and overthrows the mighty.
JOB.12.20	He impedes the lips of those that speak the truth and takes away the counsel of the aged.
JOB.12.21	He pours contempt upon princes and weakens the strength of the mighty.
JOB.12.22	He uncovers the depths of the darkness and brings out to light the shadow of death.
JOB.12.23	He multiplies the Gentiles and destroys them; he scatters the Gentiles and gathers them again.
JOB.12.24	He takes away the heart of the heads of the people of the earth and causes them to become lost, wandering without a way.
JOB.12.25	They grope in the darkness and not the light, and he causes them to err like drunken men.
JOB.13.1	Behold, my eyes have seen all this; my ears have heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	As you know it, I know it; I am not inferior unto you.
JOB.13.3	But I would speak with the Almighty, and I desired to dispute with God.
JOB.13.4	That ye are certainly forgers of lies; ye are all physicians of no value.
JOB.13.5	O that ye would altogether be silent! And it would be unto you instead of wisdom.
JOB.13.6	Hear now my dispute, and hearken to the arguments of my lips.
JOB.13.7	Are ye to speak iniquity for God? Are ye to speak deceitfully for him?
JOB.13.8	Are ye to bring honour unto him? Are ye to contend for God?
JOB.13.9	Would it be good for him to search you out? As one man mocks another, do ye so mock him?
JOB.13.10	He will reprove you severely, if in secret you give him such honour.
JOB.13.11	Certainly his excellency should make you afraid, and his dread should fall upon you.
JOB.13.12	Your memories shall be compared unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
JOB.13.13	Listen to me, and I will speak, and afterward let come on me what will.
JOB.13.14	Why shall I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in the palm of my hand?
JOB.13.15	Though he slay me, yet I will trust in him; but I will defend my ways before him.
JOB.13.16	He also shall be my saving health; for the hypocrite shall not enter into his presence.
JOB.13.17	Hear diligently my reason and my declaration with your ears.
JOB.13.18	Behold now, if I draw near unto the judgment; I know that I shall be justified.
JOB.13.19	Who is he that will contend with me? For now, if I remain silent, I shall die.
JOB.13.20	At the least, grant me these two things; then I will not hide myself from thee:
JOB.13.21	withdraw thy hand from me; and let not thy dread make me afraid.
JOB.13.22	Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer thou me.
JOB.13.23	How many are my iniquities and sins? Make me to know my transgression and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Why dost thou hide thy face, and hold me for thine enemy?
JOB.13.25	Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? Wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
JOB.13.26	Why dost thou write bitter things against me and make me carry the iniquities of my youth.
JOB.13.27	Thou dost put my feet also in the stocks and look narrowly unto all my paths; thou dost set a print upon the heels of my feet.
JOB.13.28	And man, is as a rotten thing that is being consumed, as a garment that is moth eaten.
JOB.14.1	Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.
JOB.14.2	He comes forth like an open flower and is cut down; he flees as a shadow and does not remain.
JOB.14.3	And dost thou open thine eyes upon such a one and bring me into judgment with thee?
JOB.14.4	Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? No one.
JOB.14.5	Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass.
JOB.14.6	If thou should leave him, he will cease to exist; until then, he shall desire, as a hireling, his day.
JOB.14.7	For there is yet hope for a tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again and that its tender branch will not cease.
JOB.14.8	Though its root waxes old in the earth and its trunk is dead in the ground,
JOB.14.9	at the scent of water it will bud and bring forth boughs like a new plant.
JOB.14.10	But when man shall die and be cut off, and the man shall perish, where shall he be?
JOB.14.11	The waters from the sea went, and the river ran out, it dried up.
JOB.14.12	So man lies down and does not rise; until there is no heaven, they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep.
JOB.14.13	O that thou would hide me in Sheol, that thou would keep me covered until thy wrath is past, that thou would appoint me a set time and remember me!
JOB.14.14	If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time I will wait until my transformation comes.
JOB.14.15	Then thou shalt call, and I will answer thee; thou wilt have a desire towards the work of thine hands.
JOB.14.16	For now thou dost number my steps; thou dost not open up my sin.
JOB.14.17	My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou dost sew up my iniquity.
JOB.14.18	And certainly the mountain that falls is undone, and the rocks are removed out of their place.
JOB.14.19	The impetuous waters break the stones and wash away the dust of the earth; in like manner thou dost cause man to lose hope.
JOB.14.20	Thou shalt be stronger than him for ever, and he passes; thou dost change his countenance and send him away.
JOB.14.21	His sons shall be honoured and he shall not know of it; or they shall be afflicted, but he shall not perceive of them.
JOB.14.22	But while his flesh is upon him, he shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz, the Temanite, answered, and said,
JOB.15.2	Should a wise man utter vain knowledge and fill his belly with the east wind?
JOB.15.3	Should he dispute with useless words and with reasons that are not profitable?
JOB.15.4	Thou dost also cast off fear and undermine prayer before God.
JOB.15.5	For thy mouth has declared thine iniquity, and thou hast chosen the tongue of the crafty.
JOB.15.6	Thine own mouth shall condemn thee, and not I; thine own lips shall testify against thee.
JOB.15.7	Wast thou born before Adam? Or wast thou formed before the hills?
JOB.15.8	Hast thou heard the secret of God, that thou dost detain wisdom in thee alone?
JOB.15.9	What dost thou know that we do not? What dost thou understand, which is not in us?
JOB.15.10	Among us are also gray hairs; there are also aged men, much elder than thy father.
JOB.15.11	Are the consolations of God in such small esteem with thee? Is there by chance any secret thing concerning thee?
JOB.15.12	Why does thine heart carry thee away, and why do thine eyes blink,
JOB.15.13	that thou dost reply unto God with thy spirit and bring forth such words out of thy mouth?
JOB.15.14	What is man that he should be clean and that he that is born of a woman should be justified?
JOB.15.15	Behold, he puts no trust in his saints, and not even the heavens are clean in his sight.
JOB.15.16	How much less the man who is abominable and filthy, who drinks iniquity like water?
JOB.15.17	Listen to me and I will show thee and declare unto thee that which I have seen,
JOB.15.18	that which the wise men have told us of their fathers and have not hid it,
JOB.15.19	unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
JOB.15.20	The wicked man travails with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden from the violent.
JOB.15.21	Fearful sounds are in his ears; in peace the destroyer shall come upon him.
JOB.15.22	He will not believe that he shall return out of darkness, and he is always watching the sword.
JOB.15.23	He wanders abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? He knows that the day of darkness is prepared for him.
JOB.15.24	Tribulation and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
JOB.15.25	Because he extended his hand against God and strengthens himself against the Almighty,
JOB.15.26	he shall run him through in the neck, upon the thick shoulder pieces of his shields;
JOB.15.27	for he covered his face with his fatness and made collops of fat on his flanks;
JOB.15.28	and he dwelt in desolate cities and in houses which no one inhabited, which were in heaps.
JOB.15.29	He shall not become rich, nor shall his strength be established, neither shall he extend his beauty upon the earth.
JOB.15.30	He shall not escape from the darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth he shall perish.
JOB.15.31	He shall not be established; in vanity he shall err; therefore, he shall be changed into vanity.
JOB.15.32	He shall be cut off before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
JOB.15.33	He shall shake off his sour grapes as the vine and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
JOB.15.34	For the congregation of the hypocrites shall be made desolate, and fire shall consume the tents of bribery.
JOB.15.35	They conceive pain and bring forth iniquity, and their belly meditates deceit.
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.16.2	Many times I have heard such things; miserable comforters are ye all.
JOB.16.3	Shall vain words have an end? Or what is it that emboldens thee to answer?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak as ye do. I wish your soul were in my soul’s stead, that I could heap up words against you and shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the consolation of my lips would assuage the pain.
JOB.16.6	Though if I speak, my pain does not cease; and if I forbear to speak, it does not depart from me.
JOB.16.7	But now he has made me weary; thou hast made desolate all my company.
JOB.16.8	And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me bears witness to my face.
JOB.16.9	His wrath has torn me and has been against me; he gnashed upon me with his teeth; my enemy sharpened his eyes upon me.
JOB.16.10	They have opened their mouth against me; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
JOB.16.11	God has delivered me unto the liar, and in the hands of the wicked he has caused me to tremble.
JOB.16.12	I was prosperous, but he has broken me asunder; he has taken me by my neck and shaken me to pieces and set me up for his mark.
JOB.16.13	His archers compassed me round about; he cleaved my kidneys asunder and did not spare; he poured out my gall upon the ground.
JOB.16.14	He broke me with breach upon breach; he ran upon me like a giant.
JOB.16.15	I have sewn sackcloth upon my skin and put dust over my head.
JOB.16.16	My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death,
JOB.16.17	even though there is no injustice in my hands, and my prayer has been pure.
JOB.16.18	O earth, do not cover my blood; and let there be no place where my cry is hidden.
JOB.16.19	Certainly my witness is even now in the heavens, and my record is on high.
JOB.16.20	Those who dispute with me are my friends, but my eyes shall pour out tears unto God.
JOB.16.21	O that a man might dispute with God, as he can with his neighbour!
JOB.16.22	When the counted years are come, then I shall go the way from which I shall not return.
JOB.17.1	My breath is corrupt, my days are cut off, and the grave is ready for me.
JOB.17.2	Now there are only mockers with me, upon whose bitterness my eye continues to gaze.
JOB.17.3	Put up now, give me surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
JOB.17.4	For with these, thou hast hid their heart from understanding; therefore, thou shalt not exalt them.
JOB.17.5	He that speaks flattery to his neighbour, even the eyes of his sons shall fail.
JOB.17.6	He has made me a byword of the peoples; and before them I have been as a tambourine.
JOB.17.7	My eyes are dim by reason of sorrow, and all my thoughts are as a shadow.
JOB.17.8	Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
JOB.17.9	The righteous shall hold on to his way, and he that has clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
JOB.17.10	But return all of you, and come now; for I shall not find one that is wise among you.
JOB.17.11	My days are past, my thoughts were broken off, even the purposes of my heart.
JOB.17.12	They changed the night into day; the light is short because of the darkness.
JOB.17.13	If I wait, Sheol is my house; I have made my bed in the darkness.
JOB.17.14	I have said to the pit, Thou art my father; to the worms, my mother, and my sister.
JOB.17.15	And where shall my hope be now? As for my hope, who shall see it?
JOB.17.16	They shall go down to the bars of Sheol, and together they shall rest in the dust.
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad, the Shuhite, answered and said,
JOB.18.2	How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? Understand, and afterwards we will speak.
JOB.18.3	Why are we counted as beasts? Are we vile in your sight?
JOB.18.4	O thou that dost tear thy soul in thine anger; shall the earth be forsaken because of thee and shall the rocks be removed out of their place?
JOB.18.5	The light of the wicked shall certainly be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
JOB.18.6	The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his lamp shall be put out with him.
JOB.18.7	The steps of his strength shall be cut down, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
JOB.18.8	For a net shall be cast at his feet, and he shall walk upon a network.
JOB.18.9	The snare shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.
JOB.18.10	The cord is hidden in the ground and a trap for him in the way.
JOB.18.11	Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and his own feet shall drive him away.
JOB.18.12	His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.
JOB.18.13	They shall devour the protection of his skin; the firstborn of death shall devour his members.
JOB.18.14	His confidence shall be rooted out of his tent, and he shall be brought to the king of terrors.
JOB.18.15	He shall dwell in his tent, as if it were not his; brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
JOB.18.16	His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above his branch shall be cut off.
JOB.18.17	His memory shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the streets.
JOB.18.18	He shall be driven from the light into the darkness and chased out of the world.
JOB.18.19	He shall have neither son nor grandson among his people, nor any to succeed him in his dwellings.
JOB.18.20	Those that come after him shall be dismayed at his day, as those that went before were overcome with fear.
JOB.18.21	Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that does not know God.
JOB.19.1	And Job replied and said,
JOB.19.2	How long will ye anguish my soul and break me in pieces with words?
JOB.19.3	These ten times ye have reproached me; are ye not ashamed to make yourselves strange to me?
JOB.19.4	And if indeed I have erred, my error shall remain with me.
JOB.19.5	If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me and reprove me of my reproach,
JOB.19.6	know now that God has overthrown me and has compassed me with his net.
JOB.19.7	Behold, I shall cry out that I have been wronged, and I shall not be heard; I shall cry aloud, and there shall be no judgment.
JOB.19.8	He has walled off my way and I shall not pass, and he has set darkness in my paths.
JOB.19.9	He has stripped me of my glory and taken the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He has pulled me up on every side, and I am dried up; he has caused my hope to pass like an uprooted tree.
JOB.19.11	He has kindled his wrath against me, and he counted me unto him as one of his enemies.
JOB.19.12	His troops came together and raised up their way over me and encamp round about my tent.
JOB.19.13	He has put my brethren far from me, and my acquaintances are verily estranged from me.
JOB.19.14	My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	Those that dwell in my house and my maids have counted me for a stranger; I was an alien in their sight.
JOB.19.16	I called my slave, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.
JOB.19.17	My spirit came to be strange to my wife, although I intreated her for the sons of my own body.
JOB.19.18	Even the young children despised me; as I arose, they spoke against me.
JOB.19.19	All my intimate friends abhorred me; and those whom I loved are turned against me.
JOB.19.20	My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God has touched me.
JOB.19.22	Why do ye persecute me as God and are not satisfied with my flesh?
JOB.19.23	Oh, that my words were now written! Oh, that they were printed in a book!
JOB.19.24	That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
JOB.19.25	For I know that my redeemer lives and that he shall rise at the latter day over the dust;
JOB.19.26	and afterward from this, my stricken skin and from my own flesh, I must see God:
JOB.19.27	whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another, though my kidneys be consumed within me.
JOB.19.28	But ye should say, Why should we persecute him, seeing that the root of the matter is found in me?
JOB.19.29	Be ye afraid of the sword; for the wrath of the sword comes because of the iniquities, that ye may know there is a judgment.
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar, the Naamathite, answered and said,
JOB.20.2	My thoughts certainly cause me to answer, and therefore, I make haste.
JOB.20.3	I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my intelligence causes me to answer.
JOB.20.4	Dost thou not know this that always was, since man was placed upon earth,
JOB.20.5	that the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
JOB.20.6	Though his excellency mounts up to the heavens, and his head reaches unto the clouds,
JOB.20.7	yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung; those who have seen him shall say, What is become of him?
JOB.20.8	He shall fly away as a dream and shall not be found: yea, he shall flee away as a vision of the night.
JOB.20.9	The eye which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place behold him any more.
JOB.20.10	His poor sons shall go forth begging, and their hands shall restore that which he stole.
JOB.20.11	His bones are full of the sins of his youth, which shall be buried with him in the dust.
JOB.20.12	If wickedness was sweet in his mouth, if he hid it under his tongue,
JOB.20.13	if it seemed good unto him, and he did not forsake it, but savored it within his mouth,
JOB.20.14	his food shall be changed in his bowels, it shall be the gall of asps within him.
JOB.20.15	He has swallowed down riches, but he shall vomit them up again; God shall cast them out of his belly.
JOB.20.16	He shall suck the poison of asps; the viper’s tongue shall slay him.
JOB.20.17	He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
JOB.20.18	He shall restore the work that was not his; according to the substance that he took; neither shall he devour, nor rejoice.
JOB.20.19	Because he oppressed and forsook the poor; because he has violently taken away houses which he did not build,
JOB.20.20	therefore, he shall not feel quietness in his belly; he shall not escape with that which he desired.
JOB.20.21	Nothing is left that he did not eat; therefore, his goods shall not last.
JOB.20.22	In the fullness of his sufficiency, he shall come into anguish; the hands of all the wicked shall come upon him.
JOB.20.23	When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him and shall rain it upon him and upon his food.
JOB.20.24	He shall flee from the weapons of iron, and the bow of bronze shall strike him through.
JOB.20.25	He shall draw forth an arrow from his quiver, and like lightning it shall strike through his gall; terrors shall come upon him.
JOB.20.26	All darkness is kept for his secrets; a fire not blown shall consume him; his successor shall be broken in his tent.
JOB.20.27	The heavens shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
JOB.20.28	The increase of his house shall be taken captive; they shall be scattered in the day of his wrath.
JOB.20.29	This is the portion of a wicked man from God and the heritage that God appoints unto him by his word.
JOB.21.1	But Job answered and said,
JOB.21.2	Hear diligently my speech, and let this be instead of your consolations.
JOB.21.3	Suffer me that I may speak; and after I have spoken, mock on.
JOB.21.4	As for me, is my complaint to man? And if so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
JOB.21.5	Look upon me and be astonished and lay your hand upon your mouth.
JOB.21.6	Even I myself, when I remember, I am afraid, and trembling takes hold on my flesh.
JOB.21.7	Why do the wicked live and become old and even increase in riches?
JOB.21.8	Their seed is with them, established in their sight, and their offspring before their eyes.
JOB.21.9	Their houses are safe from fear; neither is the rod of God upon them.
JOB.21.10	Their cows conceive, and do not abort; their cows calve and do not cast forth their young.
JOB.21.11	They send forth their little ones like a flock of sheep, and their children dance.
JOB.21.12	They jump at the sound of the timbrel and harp and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
JOB.21.13	They spend their days in pleasure and in a moment go down to Sheol.
JOB.21.14	Therefore, they say unto God, Depart from us; for we do not desire the knowledge of thy ways.
JOB.21.15	Who is the Almighty that we should serve him? And what profit should we have if we pray unto him?
JOB.21.16	Behold that their good is not in their hands; the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.21.17	How often is the lamp of the wicked put out and their destruction comes upon them, and God distributes sorrows upon them in his anger.
JOB.21.18	They shall be as stubble before the wind and as chaff taken up by the whirlwind.
JOB.21.19	God shall lay up his violence for their sons; and he will reward him so that he shall know it.
JOB.21.20	His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	For what delight shall he have in his house after him, being cut off in the number of his months?
JOB.21.22	Shall he teach God knowledge, seeing he judges those that are high?
JOB.21.23	This one shall die in the full strength of his beauty, being completely at ease and quiet.
JOB.21.24	His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
JOB.21.25	And another dies in the bitterness of his soul, never having eaten with pleasure.
JOB.21.26	They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
JOB.21.27	Behold, I know your thoughts and the imaginations which ye devise against me.
JOB.21.28	For ye say, What is of the house of the prince, and what of the tent of the habitation of the wicked?
JOB.21.29	Have ye not asked those that go by the way, and do ye not know their tokens?
JOB.21.30	That the wicked is reserved for the day of destruction, they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
JOB.21.31	Who shall declare his way to his face? And who shall repay him what he has done?
JOB.21.32	He shall yet be brought to the grave and shall remain in the tomb.
JOB.21.33	The clods of the river valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall be drawn after him, as there were innumerable before him.
JOB.21.34	How then do ye comfort me in vain, given that your answers remain as falsehood?
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz, the Temanite, answered and said,
JOB.22.2	Can a man be profitable unto God? For he that is wise is profitable unto himself.
JOB.22.3	Is it any pleasure to the Almighty that thou art justified? Or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect?
JOB.22.4	Will he reprove thee or will he enter with thee into judgment because he fears thee?
JOB.22.5	Certainly thy wickedness is great and thine iniquities have no end.
JOB.22.6	For thou didst take a pledge from thy brother without cause and stripped the naked of their clothing.
JOB.22.7	Thou didst not give water to drink to the weary, and thou hast withheld bread from the hungry.
JOB.22.8	But the man of means had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.
JOB.22.9	Thou hast sent the widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
JOB.22.10	Therefore, snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubles thee
JOB.22.11	or darkness, that thou canst not see, and abundance of waters cover thee.
JOB.22.12	Is not God in the height of the heavens? Behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
JOB.22.13	And thou shalt say, What does God know? How can he judge through the darkness?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds are his hiding place, and he does not see; and he walks in the circuit of heaven.
JOB.22.15	Dost thou desire to keep the old way which wicked men have trodden?
JOB.22.16	Who were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood.
JOB.22.17	Who said unto God, Depart from us; and what can the Almighty do unto us?
JOB.22.18	He had filled their houses with good things. Therefore, the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
JOB.22.19	The righteous shall see it and be glad; and the innocent laughs them to scorn.
JOB.22.20	Whereas our substance was not cut down, when the fire had consumed the rest of them.
JOB.22.21	Make up thy friendship now with him, and thou shalt have peace; thereby good shall come unto thee.
JOB.22.22	Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.
JOB.22.23	If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tent;
JOB.22.24	then thou shalt lay up gold as dust and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
JOB.22.25	And the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
JOB.22.26	For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
JOB.22.27	Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
JOB.22.28	Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee; and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
JOB.22.29	When others are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.
JOB.22.30	He shall deliver the island of the innocent; and in the pureness of thine hands thou shalt be kept.
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered and said,
JOB.23.2	Today I will also speak with bitterness; my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
JOB.23.3	Oh, that I knew where I might find him! That I might come even to his seat!
JOB.23.4	I would order judgment before him and fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would know the words which he would answer me and understand what he would say unto me.
JOB.23.6	Will he plead against me with his great power? No, but rather he would put it in me.
JOB.23.7	There the righteous might dispute with him; and should I escape for ever from the one who condemns me.
JOB.23.8	Behold, I shall go to the east and not find him; and to the west, but I cannot perceive him;
JOB.23.9	if he is working to the north, I shall not see him; to the south, he hides himself, that I shall not see him.
JOB.23.10	But he has known the way that I take; he has tried me, and I have come forth as gold.
JOB.23.11	My feet have held to his steps, I have kept his way, and have not departed.
JOB.23.12	Neither have I separated myself from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
JOB.23.13	But if he determines something, who can turn him? His soul desired it, and he did it.
JOB.23.14	Therefore, he will finish that which is necessary for me; and there are many such things in him.
JOB.23.15	Therefore, I shall fear before his face; I shall consider, and I shall fear him.
JOB.23.16	For God has made my heart tender, and the Almighty has frightened me.
JOB.23.17	Why was I not cut off before the darkness, neither has he covered my face with the darkness.
JOB.24.1	Why, seeing that times are not hidden from the Almighty, do those that know him not see his days?
JOB.24.2	Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks and feed thereof.
JOB.24.3	They drive away the ass of the fatherless; they take the widow’s ox for a pledge.
JOB.24.4	They turn the needy out of the way; and all the poor of the earth hide themselves from them.
JOB.24.5	Behold, as wild asses in the desert, they go forth to their work, rising early for a prey; the wilderness yields food for them and for their children.
JOB.24.6	In the field they reap their fodder, and the wicked gather the vintage that is not theirs.
JOB.24.7	They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are wet with the floods of the mountains and embrace the rock for want of a covering.
JOB.24.9	They pluck the fatherless from the breast and take a pledge of the poor.
JOB.24.10	They cause the naked to go without clothing, and they take away the sheaves from the hungry.
JOB.24.11	They press oil within their walls and tread their winepresses and suffer thirst.
JOB.24.12	Men groan from out of the city, and the souls of the dead cry out; yet God did not hinder them.
JOB.24.13	They are among those that rebel against the light; they have never known its ways nor abided in its paths.
JOB.24.14	The murderer rises with the light, kills the poor and the needy, and in the night is as a thief.
JOB.24.15	The eye of the adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me; and disguises his face.
JOB.24.16	In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime; they do not know the light.
JOB.24.17	For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death; if they are known, the terrors of the shadow of death come over them.
JOB.24.18	They are swift upon the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth; they never come by the way of the vineyards.
JOB.24.19	Drought and heat consume the snow waters; so does Sheol consume those who have sinned.
JOB.24.20	The Merciful One shall forget them; the worm shall feed sweetly on them; they shall never be remembered again; and iniquity shall be broken as a tree.
JOB.24.21	He afflicted the barren woman that did not conceive and never did good unto the widow.
JOB.24.22	He furthered the violent with his power; he did not lend to anyone in his life.
JOB.24.23	If he gave credit to some to take them over, his eyes were upon their ways.
JOB.24.24	They were exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all others and cut off as the tops of the heads of grain.
JOB.24.25	And if it is not so now, who will make me a liar or reduce my speech to nothing?
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad, the Shuhite, answered, and said,
JOB.25.2	Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high places.
JOB.25.3	Is there any number to his armies? And upon whom does his light not arise?
JOB.25.4	How then can man be justified with God? Or how can he that is born of a woman be clean?
JOB.25.5	Behold, even the moon shall not shine, neither are the stars pure in his sight.
JOB.25.6	How much less man, who is as a worm, and the son of man, who is also a worm?
JOB.26.1	Job answered and said,
JOB.26.2	How hast thou helped the one who has no power? Hast thou saved with thy arm the one who has no strength?
JOB.26.3	How hast thou counselled the one that has no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
JOB.26.4	To whom hast thou uttered words, and whose is the spirit that comes forth from thee?
JOB.26.5	Dead things are formed under the waters and of its dwelling places.
JOB.26.6	Sheol is naked before him, and hell has no covering.
JOB.26.7	He stretches out the north wind over the empty place and hangs the earth upon nothing.
JOB.26.8	He binds up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
JOB.26.9	He holds back the face of his throne and spreads his cloud upon it.
JOB.26.10	He has compassed the waters with bounds until the end of light and darkness.
JOB.26.11	The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
JOB.26.12	He divides the sea with his power, and by his intelligence he smites its pride.
JOB.26.13	By his spirit he has adorned the heavens; his hand has formed the fleeing serpent.
JOB.26.14	Behold, these are parts of his ways; but how little a portion have we heard of him? For the thunder of his power, who shall understand?
JOB.27.1	Moreover, Job continued his parable and said,
JOB.27.2	As God lives, who has taken away my rights; and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter,
JOB.27.3	that all the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils,
JOB.27.4	my lips shall not speak iniquity, nor my tongue utter deceit.
JOB.27.5	In no wise should I justify you; until I die I will not remove my integrity from me.
JOB.27.6	I hold fast to my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
JOB.27.7	Let my enemy be as the wicked and my adversary as the unrighteous.
JOB.27.8	For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he has stolen much, when God takes away his soul?
JOB.27.9	Will God hear his cry when the tribulation comes upon him?
JOB.27.10	Will he delight himself in the Almighty? Will he always call upon God?
JOB.27.11	I will teach you what there is in the hand of God; I will not conceal that which is regarding the Almighty.
JOB.27.12	Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye so completely vain?
JOB.27.13	This is the portion of a wicked man with God and the heritage of the violent, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
JOB.27.14	If their sons are multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
JOB.27.15	Those that remain of him shall be buried in death; and their widows shall not weep.
JOB.27.16	Though he heaps up silver as the dust and prepares raiment as the clay,
JOB.27.17	he may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
JOB.27.18	He built his house as a moth and as a booth that the keeper makes.
JOB.27.19	The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered; he shall open his eyes and not see anyone.
JOB.27.20	Terrors shall take hold on him as waters; a whirlwind shall carry him away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind shall take him away, and he shall depart; the storm shall catch him up out of his place.
JOB.27.22	For God shall cast down on him and not spare; he would attempt to flee out of his hand.
JOB.27.23	Men shall clap their hands at him, and from his place they shall hiss at him.
JOB.28.1	Surely there is a mine for the silver, and a place for gold where they refine it.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken out of the dust, and bronze is melted out of the stone.
JOB.28.3	He set a border unto the darkness, and unto every perfect work that he made, he placed a stone of darkness and shadow of death.
JOB.28.4	The river breaks forth next to the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot, that were higher than man, are gone away.
JOB.28.5	Land out of which bread comes forth, and underneath it shall be as if it were converted in fire.
JOB.28.6	A place where its stones shall be sapphires; and it shall have dust of gold.
JOB.28.7	A path which no fowl knows and which the vulture’s eye has never seen;
JOB.28.8	the young of the proud have not trodden it, nor has the fierce lion passed by it.
JOB.28.9	He put his hand upon the flint and overturned the mountains from the root.
JOB.28.10	He cut rivers out of the rocks; and his eye saw every precious thing.
JOB.28.11	He detained the rivers in their source and caused that which was hid to be brought to light.
JOB.28.12	But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.13	Man never knew its price; neither is it found in the land of the living.
JOB.28.14	The deep saith, It is not in me; and the sea saith, It is not with me.
JOB.28.15	It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for its price.
JOB.28.16	It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx or the sapphire.
JOB.28.17	Gold cannot equal it, nor can diamond; neither shall it be exchanged for vessels of fine gold.
JOB.28.18	No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls; for wisdom is better than precious stones.
JOB.28.19	The emerald of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
JOB.28.20	Where then does wisdom come from? And where is the place of understanding?
JOB.28.21	Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living and kept concealed from every fowl of the heaven.
JOB.28.22	Hell and death say, We have heard its fame with our ears.
JOB.28.23	God understands its way, and he alone knows its place.
JOB.28.24	For he looks unto the ends of the earth and sees under the whole heaven,
JOB.28.25	To make a weight for the wind and to supply water by measure,
JOB.28.26	when he made a law for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunders.
JOB.28.27	Then he saw it and counted it; he prepared it and also searched it out.
JOB.28.28	And unto man he said, Behold, that the fear of the Lord, is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
JOB.29.1	Moreover, Job continued his parable and said,
JOB.29.2	Oh, that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
JOB.29.3	when his lamp shone upon my head, and by its light I walked in the darkness;
JOB.29.4	as I was in the days of my youth, when God was familiar in my tent;
JOB.29.5	when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
JOB.29.6	when I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil!
JOB.29.7	When I went out to the gate to judgment, when I had my seat prepared in the plaza!
JOB.29.8	The young men would see me and hide themselves, and the aged would arise and stand.
JOB.29.9	The princes would refrain from talking and lay their hand on their mouth;
JOB.29.10	the voice of the principals would not be noticed, and their tongue would cleave to the roof of their mouth.
JOB.29.11	When the ears that heard me, called me blessed; and when the eyes that saw me, gave witness to me:
JOB.29.12	because I delivered the poor that cried and the fatherless who had no one to help him.
JOB.29.13	The blessing of the one that was ready to perish came upon me; and I caused the widow’s heart to sing for joy.
JOB.29.14	I put on righteousness, and it clothed me as a robe; and my diadem was judgment.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was a father to the needy; and the cause which I did not know I searched out.
JOB.29.17	And I broke the fangs of the wicked and caused their teeth to release the prey.
JOB.29.18	Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
JOB.29.19	My root is spread out by the waters, and the dew shall remain upon my branches.
JOB.29.20	My glory is renewed with me, and my bow is renewed in my hand.
JOB.29.21	They would hear me and wait, and keep silent at my counsel.
JOB.29.22	After my words they would not reply, but my reason dropped upon them.
JOB.29.23	And they waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
JOB.29.24	If I laughed at them, they did not believe it; and they did not cast down the light of my countenance.
JOB.29.25	I approved their way and sat at the head and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforts the mourners.
JOB.30.1	But now those that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
JOB.30.2	For, unto what might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom time was lost?
JOB.30.3	For want and famine they walked alone; fleeing into solitude, to the dark place, desolate and waste.
JOB.30.4	Who cut up mallows among the bushes and juniper roots for their food.
JOB.30.5	They were driven forth from among men (they cried after them as after a thief).
JOB.30.6	They dwelt in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
JOB.30.7	Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
JOB.30.8	They were sons of fools and men without names; they were lower than the earth.
JOB.30.9	And now I am their song, and I am their byword.
JOB.30.10	They abhor me, they distance themselves from me, and do not spare to spit in my face.
JOB.30.11	Because God has loosed my cord and afflicted me, they have also gone out of control before my face.
JOB.30.12	Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
JOB.30.13	They cast down my path, they took advantage of my calamity, against them there was no helper.
JOB.30.14	They came in as through a wide breach; they were stirred up because of my calamity.
JOB.30.15	They have loosed terrors upon me; they fought my will as the wind and my saving health as a cloud that passes.
JOB.30.16	And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
JOB.30.17	My bones pierce me in the night, and my sinews take no rest.
JOB.30.18	By the great force of my disease my garment is changed; it binds me about as the collar of my coat.
JOB.30.19	He has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes.
JOB.30.20	I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me; I present myself, and thou regardest me not.
JOB.30.21	Thou art become cruel to me; with the strength of thy hand thou dost hate me.
JOB.30.22	Thou didst lift me up and cause me to ride upon the wind, and didst dissolve my being.
JOB.30.23	For I know that thou dost conduct me unto death and to the house appointed for all living.
JOB.30.24	But he will not stretch out his hand against the grave; do those who are buried cry out when he destroys them?
JOB.30.25	Did I not weep for the one that was in trouble? Was not my soul grieved for the needy?
JOB.30.26	When I expected good, then evil came unto me; and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
JOB.30.27	My bowels boil and do not rest; the days of affliction came upon me.
JOB.30.28	I went about darkened, but not by the sun; I stood up and cried out in the congregation.
JOB.30.29	I have become a brother to dragons and a companion to owls.
JOB.30.30	My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
JOB.30.31	My harp is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of those that weep.
JOB.31.1	I made a covenant with my eyes; why then should I look upon a maid?
JOB.31.2	For what reward would God give me from above and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
JOB.31.3	Is there no destruction for the wicked? And banishment for the workers of iniquity?
JOB.31.4	Does he not see my ways and count all my steps?
JOB.31.5	If I have walked with falsehood or if my foot has hastened to deceit,
JOB.31.6	let me be weighed in a just balance, that God may know my integrity.
JOB.31.7	If my step has turned out of the way and my heart walked after my eyes and if any blot has cleaved to my hands,
JOB.31.8	then let me sow, and let another eat, and let my offspring be rooted out.
JOB.31.9	If my heart has been deceived regarding a woman, or if I have laid in wait at my neighbour’s door,
JOB.31.10	then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down upon her.
JOB.31.11	For this is lewdness and iniquity that is proven.
JOB.31.12	For it is a fire that consumes unto hell and would root out all my increase.
JOB.31.13	If I had despised the right of my manslave or of my maidslave, when they contended with me;
JOB.31.14	what then would I do when God rises up? And when he visits, what would I answer him?
JOB.31.15	Did not he that made me in the belly also make him? And did not the same one fashion us in the womb?
JOB.31.16	If I have disturbed the desire of the poor or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
JOB.31.17	or have eaten my morsel alone and the fatherless has not eaten thereof;
JOB.31.18	(for from my youth the fatherless was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided the widow from my mother’s womb)
JOB.31.19	if I have seen any perish for want of clothing or any needy without a covering;
JOB.31.20	if his loins have not blessed me and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
JOB.31.21	if I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, even when I saw that they would all help me in the gate;
JOB.31.22	then let my back fall from my shoulder blade, and my arm be broken from its joint.
JOB.31.23	For I feared destruction from God, against whose highness I could have no power.
JOB.31.24	If I have made gold my hope or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
JOB.31.25	if I rejoiced because my wealth was being multiplied, and because my hand had gotten much;
JOB.31.26	if I beheld the sun when it shone or the moon walking in beauty;
JOB.31.27	and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth kissed my hand;
JOB.31.28	this would also be a proven iniquity; for I should have denied the God that is sovereign.
JOB.31.29	If I rejoiced at the destruction of the one that hated me or lifted up myself when evil found him;
JOB.31.30	for I have never even suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse upon his soul;
JOB.31.31	when the servants of my tent said, Oh that we had of his flesh! We would never be satisfied.
JOB.31.32	The stranger did not lodge in the street, but I opened my doors to the traveller.
JOB.31.33	If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding my iniquity in my bosom;
JOB.31.34	if I feared a great multitude or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and did not go out of the door?
JOB.31.35	Oh that someone would hear me! Behold, my mark is, that the Almighty will testify for me, even though my adversary had written down the charges.
JOB.31.36	Surely I would take it upon my shoulder and bind it as a crown to me.
JOB.31.37	I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince I would go near unto him.
JOB.31.38	If my land cries against me and all its furrows likewise complain;
JOB.31.39	if I ate of its strength without money or have afflicted the soul of its owners;
JOB.31.40	let thistles grow up unto me instead of wheat and stinkweed instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
JOB.32.1	So these three men ceased to answer Job because he was righteous in his own eyes.
JOB.32.2	Then the wrath of Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram, was kindled; against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
JOB.32.3	Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
JOB.32.4	Now Elihu had waited until Job had spoken because they were all elder than he.
JOB.32.5	But when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
JOB.32.6	And Elihu, the son of Barachel, the Buzite, answered and said, I am younger, and ye are older; therefore, I was afraid, and I feared to declare unto you my opinion.
JOB.32.7	I said, Days shall speak, and the multitude of years shall declare wisdom.
JOB.32.8	Certainly there is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives them understanding.
JOB.32.9	Great men are not always wise; neither do the aged understand judgment.
JOB.32.10	Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will declare my knowledge.
JOB.32.11	Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your arguments, while ye searched out what to say.
JOB.32.12	Even so, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you to reprove Job or to answer his words.
JOB.32.13	Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom; it is needful that God thrust him down, and not man.
JOB.32.14	Now he has not directed his words against me; neither will I answer him with your reasons.
JOB.32.15	They were amazed, they answered no more; they left off speaking.
JOB.32.16	And I waited, (for they did not speak, but stopped, and answered no more);
JOB.32.17	I said, I will also answer my part, I will also declare my opinion.
JOB.32.18	For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me.
JOB.32.19	Behold, my belly is as wine which has no vent; it is ready to burst forth like spirits.
JOB.32.20	I will speak, that I may be able to breathe; I will open my lips and answer.
JOB.32.21	I will not now be a respecter of persons, neither will I give flattering titles unto man.
JOB.32.22	For I do not know how to give flattering titles; otherwise my maker would soon take me away.
JOB.33.1	Therefore, Job, hear now my reasons, and hearken to all my words.
JOB.33.2	Behold, now I shall open my mouth, my tongue shall speak in my mouth.
JOB.33.3	My reasons declare the uprightness of my heart; and my lips shall utter pure knowledge.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God made me, and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.
JOB.33.5	If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
JOB.33.6	Behold, I am according to thy wish in God’s stead; I also am formed out of the clay.
JOB.33.7	Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
JOB.33.8	Surely thou hast spoken in my hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
JOB.33.9	I am clean without rebellion, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
JOB.33.10	Behold, God sought occasions against me, he counts me for his enemy,
JOB.33.11	he put my feet in the stocks, he guards all my paths.
JOB.33.12	Behold, in this thou art not just; I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
JOB.33.13	Why dost thou strive against him? For he will not answer all of thy words.
JOB.33.14	Nevertheless, in one or two manners God speaks to the one who does not see.
JOB.33.15	In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
JOB.33.16	then he opens the ears of men and seals their instruction,
JOB.33.17	that he may withdraw the man from his own work and cover the man from pride.
JOB.33.18	Thus he keeps back his soul from the pit and his life from perishing by the sword.
JOB.33.19	He is chastened also upon his bed with strong pain in all his bones,
JOB.33.20	so that his life abhors bread and his soul dainty food.
JOB.33.21	His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
JOB.33.22	His soul shall draw near to the grave, and his life to those that would bury him.
JOB.33.23	If there is a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to show unto man his uprightness;
JOB.33.24	to tell him that God had mercy on him, that he delivered him from going down to the pit; that he found a ransom;
JOB.33.25	his flesh shall become more tender than a child’s; and he shall return to the days of his youth.
JOB.33.26	He shall pray unto God, and he will love him; and he shall see his face with shouts of joy; for he will render unto the man the recompense of his righteousness.
JOB.33.27	He looks upon men, and if any say, I have sinned and perverted that which was right, and it did not profit me;
JOB.33.28	God will ransom his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
JOB.33.29	Behold, God does all these things two and three times with man,
JOB.33.30	to turn back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
JOB.33.31	Hear me, O Job, hearken unto me; be silent, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If thou hast anything to say, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify thee.
JOB.33.33	If not, hearken unto me; be silent, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
JOB.34.1	Furthermore, Elihu answered and said,
JOB.34.2	Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
JOB.34.3	For the ear tries words, as the mouth tastes food.
JOB.34.4	Let us choose our judgment; let us know among ourselves what is good.
JOB.34.5	For Job has said, I am righteous; and God has taken away my right.
JOB.34.6	In my judgment he was a liar, my arrow wound is grievous without my having committed a transgression.
JOB.34.7	What man is like Job, who drinks up the scorn like water?
JOB.34.8	Who goes in company with the workers of iniquity, and walks with wicked men.
JOB.34.9	For he said, It shall profit a man nothing that he should conform his will with God.
JOB.34.10	Therefore, hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
JOB.34.11	For he shall pay man according to his work and cause every man to find according to his ways.
JOB.34.12	Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
JOB.34.13	Who visited the earth for him? And who set the whole world in order?
JOB.34.14	If he were to set his heart upon man and gather unto himself his spirit and his breath,
JOB.34.15	all flesh would perish together, and man would turn again unto dust.
JOB.34.16	If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
JOB.34.17	Shall even he that hates judgment govern? And wilt thou condemn the Mighty One that is righteous?
JOB.34.18	Is it fit to say to the king, Thou art of Belial and to the princes, Ye are ungodly?
JOB.34.19	How much less to him who is not a respecter of the persons of princes, nor respects the rich more than the poor; for they all are the work of his hands.
JOB.34.20	In a moment they shall die, and the peoples shall be troubled at midnight and shall pass away; and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
JOB.34.21	For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he sees all his steps.
JOB.34.22	There is no darkness nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
JOB.34.23	For he will not lay upon man more than that which is just; that he should enter into judgment with God.
JOB.34.24	He shall break in pieces mighty men without number and set others in their stead.
JOB.34.25	Therefore, he shall cause their works to be notorious, when he shall overturn them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
JOB.34.26	He shall strike them as wicked men in the open sight of others
JOB.34.27	because thus they turned back from him and would not consider any of his ways
JOB.34.28	so that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he hears the cry of the afflicted.
JOB.34.29	When he gives rest, who then can make trouble? If he hides his face, who then can behold him? This applies to a nation and the same to a man,
JOB.34.30	that the hypocrite not reign, lest the people be ensnared.
JOB.34.31	For it is of God to say, I have forgiven, I will no longer destroy.
JOB.34.32	Teach me that which I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more.
JOB.34.33	Will he perchance finish his work by thee; whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose, or by me? Speak what thou knowest.
JOB.34.34	The men of understanding will say as I say, and the wise man will hearken unto me.
JOB.34.35	Job has spoken without knowledge, and his words were without prudence.
JOB.34.36	My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end, that there may be answers against wicked men.
JOB.34.37	For he added rebellion unto his sin, he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God.
JOB.35.1	Elihu proceeded in his reasoning and said,
JOB.35.2	Dost thou think this to be right, when thou didst say, I am more righteous than God?
JOB.35.3	For thou didst say, What advantage will it be unto thee? And, What profit shall I have, if I am cleansed from my sin?
JOB.35.4	I will answer thee and thy companions with thee.
JOB.35.5	Look unto the heavens and see; and behold the heavens which are higher than thou.
JOB.35.6	If thou dost sin, what hast thou done against him? Or if thy rebellion is multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
JOB.35.7	If thou art righteous, what shalt thou give him? Or what shall he receive of thine hand?
JOB.35.8	Thy wickedness shall hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness shall profit the son of man.
JOB.35.9	By reason of the great violence they shall call out; they cry out because of the strength of the many.
JOB.35.10	But no one shall say, Where is God my maker, who gives songs in the night;
JOB.35.11	who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
JOB.35.12	There they shall cry, but he shall give no answer because of the pride of those that are evil.
JOB.35.13	Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty look upon it.
JOB.35.14	For much that thou dost say, he will not look upon it, submit to judgment before him, and trust thou in him.
JOB.35.15	But now, because he has not visited in wrath; nor is it known in great extremity;
JOB.35.16	therefore, Job opened his mouth in vain and multiplied words without knowledge.
JOB.36.1	And Elihu added and said,
JOB.36.2	Wait for me a little, and I will teach thee; for I yet speak on God’s behalf.
JOB.36.3	I will take my knowledge from afar and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
JOB.36.4	For truly my words are not lies; for I share perfect knowledge with thee.
JOB.36.5	Behold, God is mighty and does not despise; he is mighty in virtue of heart.
JOB.36.6	He shall not give life to the wicked; but to the poor he shall give their right.
JOB.36.7	He shall not withdraw his eyes from the righteous; but with kings he shall place them on the throne for ever, and they shall be exalted.
JOB.36.8	And if they were bound in fetters and captive in cords of affliction,
JOB.36.9	then he shall show them their work and that their rebellions prevailed.
JOB.36.10	He opens their ear to instruction and commands that they turn from iniquity.
JOB.36.11	If they hearken and serve him, they shall spend their days in goodness and their years in delight.
JOB.36.12	But if they do not hearken, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
JOB.36.13	But the hypocrites in heart shall irritate him more; they shall not cry out when he binds them.
JOB.36.14	Their soul shall die in youth, and their life is among the male pagan cult prostitutes.
JOB.36.15	He shall deliver the poor from his poverty, and in affliction shall open their ears.
JOB.36.16	Likewise, he would have removed thee out of the mouth of anguish into a broad place where there is no distress and should have set thy table full of fatness.
JOB.36.17	But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked, against the judgment and the justice that sustain everything.
JOB.36.18	Therefore it is to be feared that he take thee away with a stroke, which cannot be avoided even with a great ransom.
JOB.36.19	Will he esteem thy riches? No, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
JOB.36.20	Do not desire the night, when he cuts people off in their place.
JOB.36.21	Take heed, do not regard iniquity, to choose it rather than poverty.
JOB.36.22	Behold, God is exalted by his power; what teacher is like him?
JOB.36.23	Who has prescribed his way unto him? Or who shall say unto him, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
JOB.36.24	Remember to magnify his work, which men behold.
JOB.36.25	Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
JOB.36.26	Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
JOB.36.27	For he detains the drops of water; when the rain pours down rain out of its vapour,
JOB.36.28	which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
JOB.36.29	Shall you understand the spreadings of the clouds or the noise of his tent?
JOB.36.30	Behold, he spreads his light upon it and covers the roots of the sea.
JOB.36.31	For by them he judges the peoples; he gives food to the multitude.
JOB.36.32	With the clouds he covers the light and commands them to come against the light.
JOB.36.33	The one gives news of the other; the one acquires wrath against the one that comes.
JOB.37.1	At this also my heart trembles and is moved out of its place.
JOB.37.2	Hear attentively his terrible voice and the word that goes out of his mouth.
JOB.37.3	He shall place it straight under the whole of the heavens, and his light shall extend unto the ends of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After it shall the sound roar; his valiant voice shall thunder; and he will not stay them even when his voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God shall thunder marvelously with his voice; he does great things, which we cannot comprehend.
JOB.37.6	For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; rain after rain, and rain after rain in his strength.
JOB.37.7	He seals up the hand of every man that all men may know his work.
JOB.37.8	Then the beast shall go into its lair and inhabit its dwelling.
JOB.37.9	Out of the south comes the whirlwind and cold out of the north wind.
JOB.37.10	By the breath of God ice is given; and the broad waters are constrained.
JOB.37.11	In addition to this, with clarity he wearies the thick clouds; and he scatters them with his light.
JOB.37.12	And they are turned round about by his counsels; that they may do whatever he commands them upon the face of the world in the earth.
JOB.37.13	On some occasions for correction, on others for his land, on others for mercy he causes them to appear.
JOB.37.14	Hearken unto this, Job; stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
JOB.37.15	Dost thou know when God disposed them and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
JOB.37.16	Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of the one who is perfect in knowledge?
JOB.37.17	How thy garments are warm, when he quiets the earth by the south wind?
JOB.37.18	Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong and as a molten looking glass?
JOB.37.19	Teach us what we should say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
JOB.37.20	Shall it be told him when I speak? When someone is swallowed up shall it be told him?
JOB.37.21	Also, sometimes the clear light which is in the heavens is not seen, but the wind passes and cleanses them.
JOB.37.22	Fair weather comes out of the north; with God is terrible majesty.
JOB.37.23	Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out; he is excellent in power and in judgment, and in plenty of righteousness he will not afflict.
JOB.37.24	Men, therefore, shall fear him; all the crafty of heart shall not see him.
JOB.38.1	Then the 
JOB.38.2	Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?
JOB.38.3	Now gird up thy loins like a man; for I will enquire of thee, and answer thou me.
JOB.38.4	Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Cause me to know, if thou hast understanding.
JOB.38.5	Who ordered its dimensions, if thou knowest? Or who has stretched the line upon it?
JOB.38.6	Upon what are its foundations founded? Or who laid its corner stone;
JOB.38.7	when the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
JOB.38.8	Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it broke forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
JOB.38.9	When I made the clouds its garment and thick darkness a swaddling band for it,
JOB.38.10	and established my decree upon it, and set bars and doors,
JOB.38.11	and said, Thou shalt come unto here, but no further; and there shall the pride of thy waves be stayed.
JOB.38.12	Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days? Hast thou shown the dayspring its place,
JOB.38.13	that it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
JOB.38.14	It is transformed as clay to the seal and then stands as a garment;
JOB.38.15	but the light of the wicked is taken from them, and the high arm is broken.
JOB.38.16	Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? Or hast thou walked searching out the deep?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? Or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
JOB.38.18	Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? Declare if thou knowest it all.
JOB.38.19	Where is the way to the habitation of the light, and where is the place of the darkness?/p> 
JOB.38.20	If thou shalt take it in its borders, and if thou should understand the paths to its house?
JOB.38.21	If thou didst know when thou wast to be born or if the number of thy days was to be great?
JOB.38.22	Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow, and hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
JOB.38.23	which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
JOB.38.24	By what way is the light divided; from where is the east wind scattered upon the earth?
JOB.38.25	Who has divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters or a way for the lightning of thunder,
JOB.38.26	to cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, in which there is no man;
JOB.38.27	to satisfy the desolate and waste ground and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
JOB.38.28	Has the rain a father? Or who has begotten the drops of the dew?
JOB.38.29	Out of whose womb came the ice, and the hoary frost of heaven, who has begotten it?
JOB.38.30	The waters harden as stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
JOB.38.31	Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
JOB.38.32	Canst thou bring forth the signs of the heavens in their season, or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
JOB.38.33	Dost thou know the ordinances of the heavens? Canst thou use its power in the earth?
JOB.38.34	Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
JOB.38.35	Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?
JOB.38.36	Who put wisdom in the inward parts? Or who gave intelligence to understanding?
JOB.38.37	Who declared the heavens in wisdom? Or who can stay the bottles of heaven
JOB.38.38	when the dust hardens and the clods cleave fast together?
JOB.38.39	Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the appetite of the young lions,
JOB.38.40	when they crouch in their dens and abide in their lairs to lie in wait?
JOB.38.41	Who provided food for the raven; when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of food?
JOB.39.1	Knowest thou the time when the mountain goats bring forth? Hast thou observed when the hinds calve?
JOB.39.2	Canst thou number the months that they fulfil, and knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
JOB.39.3	How they crouch down, they bring forth their young ones, and dismiss their pain.
JOB.39.4	Their young ones are healthy, they grow up with grain; they go forth and never return unto them again.
JOB.39.5	Who freed the wild ass, and who loosed its bands?
JOB.39.6	Unto whom I made a house in the wilderness, and his dwellings in the salty land.
JOB.39.7	He laughs at the multitude of the city, neither does he hearken to the voice of the exactor of tribute.
JOB.39.8	The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searches after every green thing.
JOB.39.9	Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee or abide by thy crib?
JOB.39.10	Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? Will he harrow the valleys after thee?
JOB.39.11	Wilt thou trust him because his strength is great? Or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
JOB.39.12	Wilt thou trust him, that he will bring home thy seed and gather it into thy barn?
JOB.39.13	Didst thou give beautiful wings unto the peacock, or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
JOB.39.14	Who leaves her eggs in the earth and warms them in dust
JOB.39.15	and forgets that the foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them.
JOB.39.16	She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers, not fearing that her labour is in vain,
JOB.39.17	because God caused her to forget wisdom and did not give her understanding.
JOB.39.18	In her time she lifts up herself on high; she scorns the horse and his rider.
JOB.39.19	Hast thou given the horse strength? Hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
JOB.39.20	Canst thou make him leap as a grasshopper? The glory of his nostrils is formidable.
JOB.39.21	He paws at the earth and rejoices in his strength; he goes forth to meet the armed men.
JOB.39.22	He mocks fear and is not afraid; neither does he turn his face from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The quiver rattles against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
JOB.39.24	He swallows the ground with fierceness and rage; the sound of the shofar does not trouble him;
JOB.39.25	for the blasts of the shofar fill him with courage; he smells the battle afar off, the thunder of the princes and the sound of the battle-cry.
JOB.39.26	Does the hawk fly by thy industry and stretch her wings toward the south?
JOB.39.27	Does the eagle mount up at thy command and make her nest on high?
JOB.39.28	She dwells and abides on the rock upon the crag of the rock and the strong place.
JOB.39.29	From there she seeks food, and her eyes behold afar off.
JOB.39.30	Her young ones suck up the blood; and wherever the slain are, there she is.
JOB.40.1	Moreover, the 
JOB.40.2	Shall he that contends with the Almighty instruct him? Let him that disputes with God answer this.
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the 
JOB.40.4	Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay my hand over my mouth.
JOB.40.5	Once I have spoken; but I will not answer; even twice, but I will proceed no further.
JOB.40.6	Then the 
JOB.40.7	Gird up thy loins now like a man; I will ask thee, and explain thou unto me.
JOB.40.8	Wilt thou disannul my judgment? Wilt thou condemn me, that thou may be justified?
JOB.40.9	Hast thou an arm like God? And canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
JOB.40.10	Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
JOB.40.11	Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath; and behold every one that is proud and bring him down.
JOB.40.12	Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
JOB.40.13	Hide them in the dust together; and blindfold their faces in darkness.
JOB.40.14	Then I will also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
JOB.40.15	Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eats grass as an ox.
JOB.40.16	Behold now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
JOB.40.17	He moves his tail like a cedar; the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
JOB.40.18	His bones are as strong as brass; his members are like bars of iron.
JOB.40.19	He is the beginning of the ways of God; he that made him shall make his sword draw near unto him.
JOB.40.20	Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
JOB.40.21	He shall lie down under the shade, in the covert of the reeds and of the damp places.
JOB.40.22	The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
JOB.40.23	Behold, he shall drink up a river and not change; he trusts that he can draw up the Jordan into his mouth.
JOB.40.24	His maker shall take him by the weakness of his eyes in a snare, and pierce through his nose.
JOB.41.1	Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook or with the cord which thou lettest down on his tongue?
JOB.41.2	Canst thou put a hook into his nose or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
JOB.41.3	Will he make many supplications unto thee? Will he speak soft words unto thee?
JOB.41.4	Will he make a covenant with thee that thou shall take him for a slave for ever?
JOB.41.5	Wilt thou play with him as with a bird, or wilt thou tie him up for thy maidens?
JOB.41.6	Shall the companions make a banquet of him? Shall they part him among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Canst thou cut his skin with knives or his head with a fish spear?
JOB.41.8	Lay thine hand upon him; thou shalt remember the battle and do no more.
JOB.41.9	Behold, your hope regarding him shall fail; for even at the sight of him they shall faint.
JOB.41.10	No one is so bold as to dare stir him up; who then shall be able to stand before me?
JOB.41.11	Who has preceded me, that I should repay him? All that is under the whole heaven is mine.
JOB.41.12	I will not conceal his lies, nor his might, nor the beauty of his order.
JOB.41.13	Who shall uncover the face of his garment? Or who shall come to him with a double bridle?
JOB.41.14	Who shall open the doors of his face? The orders of his teeth are terrible.
JOB.41.15	His scales {Heb. shields} are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
JOB.41.16	One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined one to another; they stick together, that they cannot be separated.
JOB.41.18	By his sneezings lights are lit, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
JOB.41.19	Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
JOB.41.20	Out of his nostrils goes forth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
JOB.41.21	His breath kindles coals, and a flame goes out of his mouth.
JOB.41.22	In his neck dwells strength, and before him the work is undone.
JOB.41.23	The failings of his flesh are joined together; his flesh is firm in him and does not move.
JOB.41.24	His heart is as firm as a stone; as hard as a piece of the lower millstone.
JOB.41.25	Of his greatness, the mighty are afraid; by reason of breakings they remove sin from themselves.
JOB.41.26	When one catches up to him, no sword or spear or dart or coat of mail shall endure against him.
JOB.41.27	He esteems iron as straw and bronze as rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	The arrow cannot make him flee; with him, slingstones are turned into stubble.
JOB.41.29	He counts any weapon as stubble; he laughs at the shaking of a spear.
JOB.41.30	Broken clay vessels are under him; he carves his imprint upon the mire.
JOB.41.31	He makes the deep to boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment.
JOB.41.32	He makes the path shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
JOB.41.33	Upon earth there is not his like, who behaves without fear.
JOB.41.34	He despises all exalted things; he is king over all the sons of pride.
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the 
JOB.42.2	I know that thou canst do every thing and that there is no thought hidden from thee.
JOB.42.3	Who is he that hides counsel without knowledge? Therefore, I have denounced that which I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.
JOB.42.4	Hear, now, and I will speak; I will ask of thee, and thou shalt cause me to know.
JOB.42.5	With my ears I had heard thee; but now my eyes see thee.
JOB.42.6	Therefore, I abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes.
JOB.42.7	And it was so, that after the 
JOB.42.8	Therefore, take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my slave Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my slave Job shall pray for you; for only because I will accept him, I shall not deal with you according to your folly, in that ye have not spoken by me in uprightness, like my slave Job.
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz, the Temanite, and Bildad, the Shuhite, and Zophar, the Naamathite, went, and did according as the 
JOB.42.10	And the 
JOB.42.11	Then all his brethren came unto him and all his sisters and all those that had been of his acquaintance before and ate bread with him in his house; and they condoled him and comforted him over all the evil that the 
JOB.42.12	So the 
JOB.42.13	He also had seven sons and three daughters.
JOB.42.14	And he called the name of the first, Jemima, and the name of the second, Kezia, and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
JOB.42.15	And in all the land no women were found as beautiful as the daughters of Job; and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
JOB.42.16	After this Job lived one hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four generations.
JOB.42.17	So Job died, being old and full of days.
PSA.1.1	Blessed is the man that does not walk in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful.
PSA.1.2	But his delight is in the law of the 
PSA.1.3	And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper.
PSA.1.4	The ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind drives away.
PSA.1.5	Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
PSA.1.6	For the 
PSA.2.1	Why do the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine a vain thing?
PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the 
PSA.2.3	let us break their bands asunder and cast away their cords from us.
PSA.2.4	He that sits in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
PSA.2.5	Then he shall speak unto them in his wrath and trouble them in his sore displeasure.
PSA.2.6	Yet I have set my king upon Zion, the mountain of my holiness.
PSA.2.7	I will declare the decree; the 
PSA.2.8	Ask of me, and I shall give thee the Gentiles for thine inheritance and unto the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
PSA.2.9	Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
PSA.2.10	Understand now therefore, O ye kings: receive chastening, ye judges of the earth.
PSA.2.11	Serve the 
PSA.2.12	Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way when his wrath is kindled in a little while. Blessed are all those that put their trust in him.
PSA.3.1	, how are they increased that trouble me! Many are they that rise up against me.
PSA.3.2	There are many who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
PSA.3.3	But thou, O 
PSA.3.4	I cried unto the 
PSA.3.5	I laid me down and slept; I awaked, for the 
PSA.3.6	I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people that have set themselves against me round about.
PSA.3.7	Arise, O 
PSA.3.8	Salvation belongs unto the 
PSA.4.1	Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness; thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
PSA.4.2	O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after the lie? Selah.
PSA.4.3	But know that the 
PSA.4.4	Stand in awe, and sin not; meditate in your heart upon your bed, and desist. Selah.
PSA.4.5	Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the 
PSA.4.6	There are many that say, Who will show us any good? 
PSA.4.7	Thou hast put gladness in my heart in the time that their grain and their wine multiplied.
PSA.4.8	I will both lay me down in peace and sleep: for thou only, O 
PSA.5.1	Give ear to my words, O 
PSA.5.2	Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God, for unto thee will I pray.
PSA.5.3	My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O 
PSA.5.4	For thou art not a God that loves wickedness; neither shall one who is evil dwell with thee.
PSA.5.5	The foolish (those who are governed by carnal thoughts or desires) shall not stand in thy sight; thou dost hate all workers of iniquity.
PSA.5.6	Thou shalt destroy those that speak lies: the 
PSA.5.7	But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear I will worship toward thy holy temple.
PSA.5.8	Lead me, O 
PSA.5.9	For there is no uprightness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
PSA.5.10	Declare them guilty, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out for the multitude of their rebellions; for they have rebelled against thee.
PSA.5.11	And all those that put their trust in thee shall rejoice: they shall ever be in jubilee, for thou shalt cover them; and all that love thy name shall be joyful in thee.
PSA.5.12	For thou, 
PSA.6.1	O 
PSA.6.2	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.6.3	My soul is also greatly troubled; but thou, O 
PSA.6.4	Return, O 
PSA.6.5	For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in Sheol who shall give thee thanks?
PSA.6.6	I am weary with my groaning; all the night I flood my bed; I water my couch with my tears.
PSA.6.7	Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxes old because of all mine enemies.
PSA.6.8	Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity, for the 
PSA.6.9	The 
PSA.6.10	All my enemies shall be ashamed; they shall be sorely troubled: they shall turn back and be ashamed suddenly.
PSA.7.1	O 
PSA.7.2	Lest they take my soul, as a lion dismembers his prey when there is none to deliver.
PSA.7.3	O 
PSA.7.4	if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me, then let my persecutor escape without retribution.
PSA.7.5	Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; let him tread down my life upon the earth and lay my honour in the dust. Selah.
PSA.7.6	Arise, O 
PSA.7.7	So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about, for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
PSA.7.8	The 
PSA.7.9	Let wickedness consume the wicked; but establish the just: for the righteous God is he who tries the hearts and kidneys.
PSA.7.10	My shield is in God, he who saves the upright in heart.
PSA.7.11	God is he who judges the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
PSA.7.12	If he does not turn, he will whet his sword; he has bent his bow and made it ready.
PSA.7.13	He has also prepared for him the weapons of death; he ordains his arrows against the persecutors.
PSA.7.14	Behold, he travails with iniquity and has conceived of his own work and brought forth falsehood.
PSA.7.15	He made a pit and deepened it and shall fall into the ditch which he made.
PSA.7.16	His work shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
PSA.7.17	I will praise the 
PSA.8.1	O 
PSA.8.2	Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou might still the enemy and the avenger.
PSA.8.3	When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
PSA.8.4	what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou dost visit him?
PSA.8.5	For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels and hast crowned him with glory and beauty.
PSA.8.6	Thou hast made him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
PSA.8.7	all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
PSA.8.8	The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, and whatever passes through the paths of the seas.
PSA.8.9	O 
PSA.9.1	I will praise thee, O 
PSA.9.2	I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High
PSA.9.3	because my enemies are turned back; they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
PSA.9.4	For thou hast accomplished my judgment and my cause; thou didst sit in the throne judging according to righteousness.
PSA.9.5	Thou hast reprehended the Gentiles, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
PSA.9.6	O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and the cities that thou hast destroyed; their memorial is perished with them.
PSA.9.7	But the 
PSA.9.8	And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall judge the peoples in uprightness.
PSA.9.9	The 
PSA.9.10	And those that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, O 
PSA.9.11	Sing unto the 
PSA.9.12	When he makes requirement for blood, he remembers them; he does not forget the cry of the humble.
PSA.9.13	Have mercy upon me, O 
PSA.9.14	that I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy saving health.
PSA.9.15	The Gentiles are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid their own foot is taken.
PSA.9.16	The 
PSA.9.17	The wicked shall be put into Sheol, all the Gentiles that forget God.
PSA.9.18	For the humble shall not always be forgotten: the hope of the poor shall not perish for ever.
PSA.9.19	Arise, O 
PSA.9.20	Put fear into them, O 
PSA.10.1	Why dost thou stand afar off, O 
PSA.10.2	The wicked in his pride persecutes the poor; let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
PSA.10.3	For the wicked boasts of his heart’s desire and blesses the covetous, whom the 
PSA.10.4	The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, does not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
PSA.10.5	His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight; as for all his enemies, he puffs at them.
PSA.10.6	He has said in his heart, I shall not be moved, for I shall never be in adversity.
PSA.10.7	His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
PSA.10.8	He sits in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places he murders the innocent: his eyes are secretly set against the poor.
PSA.10.9	He lies in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lies in wait to catch the poor: he catches the poor when he draws him into his net.
PSA.10.10	He crouches and hides himself, and many are those who fall under his power.
PSA.10.11	He has said in his heart, God has forgotten; he hides his face; he will never see it.
PSA.10.12	Arise, O 
PSA.10.13	In what does the wicked irritate God? He has said in his heart, Thou wilt not require accountability.
PSA.10.14	Thou hast seen it, for thou dost behold mischief and spite to requite it with thy hand: the poor commits himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
PSA.10.15	Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man; seek out his wickedness until thou find none.
PSA.10.16	The 
PSA.10.17	, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart; thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
PSA.10.18	to judge the fatherless and the oppressed that the man of the earth may no longer oppress.
PSA.11.1	I put my trust in the 
PSA.11.2	For, behold, the wicked bend their bow; they make ready their arrow upon the string that they may secretly shoot at the upright in heart.
PSA.11.3	The foundations shall be destroyed. What has the righteous done?
PSA.11.4	The 
PSA.11.5	The 
PSA.11.6	Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, with winds of whirlwinds: this shall be the portion of their cup.
PSA.11.7	For the righteous 
PSA.12.1	Help, 
PSA.12.2	Each one speaks vanity with his neighbour: they speak with flattering lips and with a double heart.
PSA.12.3	The 
PSA.12.4	Who have said, With our tongue we will prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
PSA.12.5	For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now I will arise, saith the 
PSA.12.6	The words of the 
PSA.12.7	Thou shalt keep them, O 
PSA.12.8	The wicked press in on every side when the vilest men are exalted.
PSA.13.1	How long wilt thou forget me, O 
PSA.13.2	How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall my enemy be exalted over me?
PSA.13.3	Consider and hear me, O 
PSA.13.4	lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
PSA.13.5	But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.
PSA.13.6	I will sing unto the 
PSA.14.1	The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is no one that does good.
PSA.14.2	The 
PSA.14.3	They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is no one that does good, no, not one.
PSA.14.4	The workers of iniquity certainly know this; those who eat up my people as they eat bread and do not call upon the 
PSA.14.5	There they were in great fear: for God is with the nation of the righteous.
PSA.14.6	Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor because the 
PSA.14.7	Oh that the saving health of Israel were come out of Zion! When the 
PSA.15.1	, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in the mountain of thy holiness?
PSA.15.2	He that walks in integrity and works righteousness, and speaks the truth in his heart.
PSA.15.3	He that does not backbite with his tongue nor do evil to his neighbour nor take up a reproach against his neighbour.
PSA.15.4	In whose eyes the vile person is not esteemed; but he honours those that fear the 
PSA.15.5	He that does not put out his money to usury nor take a bribe against the innocent. He that does these things shall never be moved.
PSA.16.1	Preserve me, O God: for in thee I have put my trust.
PSA.16.2	I said unto the 
PSA.16.3	to the saints that are in the earth and to the excellent: all my delight is towards them.
PSA.16.4	The sorrows of those that hasten after another god shall be multiplied; their drink offerings of blood I will not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
PSA.16.5	The 
PSA.16.6	The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a beautiful inheritance.
PSA.16.7	I will bless the 
PSA.16.8	I have set the 
PSA.16.9	Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest secure.
PSA.16.10	For thou wilt not leave my soul in Sheol; neither wilt thou suffer thy Merciful One to see corruption.
PSA.16.11	Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence is fullness of joy; in thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
PSA.17.1	Hear righteousness, O 
PSA.17.2	Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold uprightness.
PSA.17.3	Thou hast proved my heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou hast refined me and hast found no iniquity; that which I thought did not pass through my mouth.
PSA.17.4	Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have observed the ways of the violent.
PSA.17.5	Sustain my steps in thy ways that my footsteps not slip.
PSA.17.6	I have called upon thee, because thou dost hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me and hear my speech.
PSA.17.7	Show thy mercy to be marvellous, O Saviour of those who put their trust in thee, from those that rise up against thy right hand.
PSA.17.8	Keep me as the apple of the eye; hide me with the shadow of thy wings,
PSA.17.9	from the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.
PSA.17.10	They are closed in with their own fat; with their mouth they speak proudly.
PSA.17.11	They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes upon throwing us down to the earth
PSA.17.12	like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.
PSA.17.13	Arise, O 
PSA.17.14	from men, with thy hand, O 
PSA.17.15	As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with thy likeness.
PSA.18.1	I will love thee, O 
PSA.18.2	The 
PSA.18.3	I will call upon the 
PSA.18.4	The pain of death compassed me, and the rivers of Belial made me afraid.
PSA.18.5	The pain of Sheol compassed me about: the snares of death came before me.
PSA.18.6	In my distress I called upon the 
PSA.18.7	Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the mountains collapsed and were removed because he was wroth.
PSA.18.8	Smoke went up out of his nostrils, and fire devoured out of his mouth; coals were kindled by it.
PSA.18.9	He lowered the heavens and came down; and darkness was under his feet.
PSA.18.10	And he rode upon a cherub and flew: yea, he flew upon the wings of the wind.
PSA.18.11	He made darkness his hiding place; in his tabernacle round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the heavens.
PSA.18.12	At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
PSA.18.13	The 
PSA.18.14	He sent out his arrows and scattered them; he shot out lightnings and destroyed them.
PSA.18.15	Then the depths of the waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O 
PSA.18.16	He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
PSA.18.17	He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from those who hated me, even though they were too strong for me.
PSA.18.18	They were ready for me in the day of my calamity, but the 
PSA.18.19	He brought me forth also into a wide place; he delivered me because he delighted in me.
PSA.18.20	The 
PSA.18.21	Because I have kept the ways of the 
PSA.18.22	For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
PSA.18.23	I was perfect before him, and I kept myself from my iniquity.
PSA.18.24	Therefore the 
PSA.18.25	With the merciful thou wilt show thyself merciful; with a perfect man thou wilt show thyself perfect;
PSA.18.26	with the pure thou wilt show thyself pure; and with the perverse thou wilt show thyself adversary.
PSA.18.27	Therefore thou wilt save the humble people; but wilt bring down high looks.
PSA.18.28	For thou wilt light my fire: the 
PSA.18.29	For with thee I have scattered armies; and in my God I have overcome walled defenses.
PSA.18.30	As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the 
PSA.18.31	For who is God except the 
PSA.18.32	It is God that girds me with strength and makes my way perfect.
PSA.18.33	He makes my feet like hinds’ feet and sets me upon my high places.
PSA.18.34	He trains my hands for the battle, so that a bow of bronze shall be broken by my arms.
PSA.18.35	In the same manner thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand will hold me up, and thy meekness shall multiply me.
PSA.18.36	Thou shall enlarge my steps under me, and my knees shall not tremble.
PSA.18.37	I shall pursue my enemies and overtake them: neither shall I turn again until they are consumed.
PSA.18.38	I shall smite them, and they will not be able to rise: they shall fall under my feet.
PSA.18.39	For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued my enemies under me.
PSA.18.40	Thou hast also given me the necks of my enemies that I might destroy those that hate me.
PSA.18.41	They cried out, but there was no one to save them: even unto the 
PSA.18.42	Then I beat them as small as the dust before the wind: I scattered them as the dirt in the streets.
PSA.18.43	Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the Gentiles: a people whom I did not know served me.
PSA.18.44	As soon as they heard of me, they obeyed me: the sons of strangers submitted themselves unto me even against their will.
PSA.18.45	The strangers fell away and were afraid in their close places.
PSA.18.46	The 
PSA.18.47	It is God that avenges me and subdues the peoples under me.
PSA.18.48	He delivers me from my enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the one who would betray me.
PSA.18.49	Therefore I will give thanks unto thee, O 
PSA.18.50	He gives great deliverance to his king and shows mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
PSA.19.1	The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shows the work of his hands.
PSA.19.2	One day provides a word for the next day, and one night declares wisdom unto the next night.
PSA.19.3	There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
PSA.19.4	Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them he has set a tabernacle for the sun,
PSA.19.5	which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber and rejoices as a strong man to run a race.
PSA.19.6	His going forth is from the end of the heavens, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
PSA.19.7	The law of the 
PSA.19.8	The statutes of the 
PSA.19.9	The fear of the 
PSA.19.10	More to be desired are they than gold, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
PSA.19.11	Moreover by them is thy slave warned, and in keeping them there is great reward.
PSA.19.12	Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.
PSA.19.13	Keep back thy slave also from pride and arrogance; let them not have dominion over me; then I shall be perfect, and I shall be innocent of the great rebellion.
PSA.19.14	Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight, O 
PSA.20.1	Let the 
PSA.20.2	and send thee help from the sanctuary and strengthen thee out of Zion
PSA.20.3	and remember all thy offerings and reduce thy burnt sacrifice to the ashes of burnt fat, Selah.
PSA.20.4	Grant thee according to thine heart and fulfil all thy counsel.
PSA.20.5	We will rejoice in thy saving health, and in the name of our God we will be standard-bearers: let the 
PSA.20.6	Now know I that the 
PSA.20.7	Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we will remember the name of the 
PSA.20.8	They are brought down and fallen, but we are risen and stand upright.
PSA.20.9	The 
PSA.21.1	The king shall joy in thy strength, O 
PSA.21.2	Thou hast given him his heart’s desire and hast not withheld the request of his lips. Selah.
PSA.21.3	For thou givest him beforehand the blessings of goodness; thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
PSA.21.4	He asked life of thee, and thou didst give him length of days for ever and ever.
PSA.21.5	His glory is great in thy saving health; honour and beauty hast thou laid upon him.
PSA.21.6	For thou hast made him most blessed for ever; thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
PSA.21.7	For the king trusts in the 
PSA.21.8	Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies; thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
PSA.21.9	Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger; the 
PSA.21.10	Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of men.
PSA.21.11	For they intended evil against thee; they imagined a wicked device, but they did not prevail.
PSA.21.12	Therefore shalt thou separate them; thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
PSA.21.13	Be thou exalted, 
PSA.22.1	My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me and from the words of my cry?
PSA.22.2	O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
PSA.22.3	But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest in the midst of the praises of Israel.
PSA.22.4	Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
PSA.22.5	They cried unto thee and were delivered: they trusted in thee and were not confounded.
PSA.22.6	But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men and despised of the people.
PSA.22.7	All those that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
PSA.22.8	Turn him over to the 
PSA.22.9	But thou art he that took me out of the womb; thou hast made me wait upon thee since I was upon my mother’s breasts.
PSA.22.10	I was cast upon thee from the womb; thou art my God from my mother’s belly.
PSA.22.11	Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is no one to help.
PSA.22.12	Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round about.
PSA.22.13	They opened their mouth upon me as a ravening and a roaring lion.
PSA.22.14	I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
PSA.22.15	My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaves to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
PSA.22.16	For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
PSA.22.17	I may count all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
PSA.22.18	They part my garments among them and cast lots upon my vesture.
PSA.22.19	But be not thou far from me, O 
PSA.22.20	Deliver my soul from the sword; my life from the power of the dog.
PSA.22.21	Save me from the lion’s mouth and from the horns of the unicorns.
PSA.22.22	I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.
PSA.22.23	Ye that fear the 
PSA.22.24	For he has not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the poor in spirit; neither has he hid his face from him, but when he cried unto him, he heard.
PSA.22.25	My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation; I will pay my vows before those that fear him.
PSA.22.26	The poor shall eat and be satisfied: those that seek him shall praise the 
PSA.22.27	All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn unto the 
PSA.22.28	For the kingdom is the 
PSA.22.29	All those that are fat upon earth shall eat and worship; all those that go down to the dust shall bow before him; and no one can keep his own soul alive.
PSA.22.30	A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
PSA.22.31	They shall come and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he has done this.
PSA.23.1	The 
PSA.23.2	He makes me to lie down in green pastures; he leads me beside the still waters.
PSA.23.3	He restores my soul: he leads me in the paths of righteousness for his name’s sake.
PSA.23.4	Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me.
PSA.23.5	Thou shalt prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; thou hast anointed my head with oil; my cup is running over.
PSA.23.6	Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will rest in the house of the 
PSA.24.1	The earth is the 
PSA.24.2	For he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers.
PSA.24.3	Who shall ascend into the hill of the 
PSA.24.4	He that has clean hands and a pure heart, who has not taken my name in vain, nor sworn deceitfully.
PSA.24.5	He shall receive the blessing from the

PSA.31.8	and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy; thou hast set my feet in a wide place.
PSA.31.9	Have mercy upon me, O

PSA.31.11	I was a reproach among all my enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to my acquaintances: those that see me without flee from me.
PSA.31.12	I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I have become like a lost vessel.
PSA.31.13	For I have heard the slander of many; fear was on every side; while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.

PSA.39.2	I was dumb with silence; I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
PSA.39.3	My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned; then I spoke with my tongue,

PSA.40.11	Do not withhold thy tender mercies from me, O

PSA.41.9	Even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.
PSA.41.10	But thou, O 
PSA.41.11	In this I shall know that I have pleased thee, that my enemy does not triumph over me.
PSA.41.12	And as for me, thou sustained me in my integrity and hast seated me before thy face for ever.
PSA.41.13	Blessed be the 
PSA.42.1	As the hart pants after the water brooks, so does my soul pant after thee, O God.
PSA.42.2	My soul thirsts for God, for the living God; when shall I come and appear before God?
PSA.42.3	My tears have been my food day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
PSA.42.4	I will remember these things; I will pour out my soul in me. When I shall be included in the number; I will go with them to the house of God with voice of joy and praise, dancing in the multitude.
PSA.42.5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted against me? Wait thou for God, for I shall yet praise him for the wellbeing of his presence.
PSA.42.6	O my God, my soul is cast down within me; therefore I will remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the mountain of Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Deep calls unto deep at the voice of thy waterspouts; all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.
PSA.42.8	Yet the 
PSA.42.9	I will say unto God, My rock, why hast thou forgotten me? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.42.10	It is as death in my bones when my enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?
PSA.42.11	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Wait thou for God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the saving health of my countenance and my God.
PSA.43.1	Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against those who are not merciful; O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
PSA.43.2	For thou art the God of my strength; why dost thou cast me off? Why do I go mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
PSA.43.3	O send out thy light and thy truth; let them lead me; let them bring me unto the mountain of thy holiness and to thy tabernacles.
PSA.43.4	Then I will enter in to the altar of God, unto the God of my exceeding joy; yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
PSA.43.5	Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? Wait for God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the saving health of my countenance and my God.
PSA.44.1	We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days in the times of old.
PSA.44.2	How thou didst drive out the Gentiles with thy hand and plant them in their place; how thou didst afflict the peoples and cast them out.
PSA.44.3	For they did not get the land in inheritance by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them, but thy right hand and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance because thy delight was in them.
PSA.44.4	Thou art my King, O God; command saving health unto Jacob.
PSA.44.5	Through thee will we push down our enemies; through thy name will we tread under those that rise up against us.
PSA.44.6	For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
PSA.44.7	But thou hast saved us from our enemies and hast put to shame those that hated us.
PSA.44.8	In God we boast all the day long and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
PSA.44.9	But thou hast cast us off and put us to shame and doth not go forth with our armies.
PSA.44.10	Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy, and we are spoiled by those who hate us.
PSA.44.11	Thou hast given us over like sheep appointed for food and hast scattered us among the Gentiles.
PSA.44.12	Thou hast sold thy people for nothing and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.
PSA.44.13	Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to those that are round about us.
PSA.44.14	Thou makest us a byword among the Gentiles, a shaking of the head among the people.
PSA.44.15	My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face has covered me,
PSA.44.16	for the voice of him that reproaches and blasphemes by reason of the enemy and of the avenger.
PSA.44.17	All this is come upon us; yet we have not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
PSA.44.18	Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way
PSA.44.19	though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons and covered us with the shadow of death.
PSA.44.20	If we have forgotten the name of our God or stretched out our hands to a strange god,
PSA.44.21	shall not God search this out? For he knows the secrets of the heart.
PSA.44.22	Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
PSA.44.23	Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? Arise, do not cast us off for ever.
PSA.44.24	Why dost thou hide thy face and forget our affliction and our oppression?
PSA.44.25	For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our belly cleaves unto the earth.
PSA.44.26	Arise for our help and ransom us for thy mercies’ sake.
PSA.45.1	My heart is overflowing with a good word; I speak of the things which I have done concerning the king; my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
PSA.45.2	Thou art fairer than the sons of men, grace is poured into thy lips; therefore God has blessed thee for ever.
PSA.45.3	Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most valiant, with thy glory and thy majesty.
PSA.45.4	And in thy majesty be prospered; ride upon the word of truth and of humility and of righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
PSA.45.5	Thine arrows, by which the peoples fall under thee, penetrate the heart of the enemies of the king.
PSA.45.6	Thy throne, O God, is eternal and for ever, the rod of righteousness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
PSA.45.7	Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
PSA.45.8	All thy garments smell of myrrh and aloes and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, by which they have made thee glad.
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters were among thy honourable women; the queen stands at thy right hand with a crown of gold from Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Hearken, O daughter, and consider and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father’s house;
PSA.45.11	so shall the king greatly desire thy beauty; and bow before him, for he is thy Lord.
PSA.45.12	And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
PSA.45.13	The king’s daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
PSA.45.14	She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework; the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
PSA.45.15	With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought; they shall enter into the king’s palace.
PSA.45.16	Instead of thy fathers shall be thy sons, whom thou shalt make princes in all the earth.
PSA.45.17	I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations; therefore shall the people praise thee eternally and for ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in tribulation.
PSA.46.2	Therefore we will not fear, though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea,
PSA.46.3	though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the violence thereof. Selah.
PSA.46.4	There is a river, the streams of which shall make glad the city of God, the sanctuary of the tents of the most High.
PSA.46.5	God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved; God shall help her, as the morning dawns.
PSA.46.6	The Gentiles raged, the kingdoms were moved; he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
PSA.46.7	The 
PSA.46.8	Come, behold the works of the 
PSA.46.9	He makes wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaks the bow and cuts the spear in sunder; he burns the chariot in the fire.
PSA.46.10	Be still, and know that I am God; I will be exalted in the Gentiles, I will be exalted in the earth.
PSA.46.11	The 
PSA.47.1	O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.
PSA.47.2	For the 
PSA.47.3	He shall guide the peoples under us, and the Gentiles under our feet.
PSA.47.4	He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.
PSA.47.5	God is gone up with a shout of joy, the 
PSA.47.6	Sing praises to God, sing praises; sing praises unto our King, sing praises.
PSA.47.7	For God is the King of all the earth; sing ye praises with understanding.
PSA.47.8	God reigns over the Gentiles; God sits upon the throne of his holiness.
PSA.47.9	The princes of the peoples have joined the people of the God of Abraham; for the shields of the earth belong unto God; he is greatly exalted.
PSA.48.1	Great is the 
PSA.48.2	Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
PSA.48.3	God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
PSA.48.4	For, behold, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
PSA.48.5	They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled and hasted away.
PSA.48.6	Fear took hold upon them there and pain as of a woman in travail.
PSA.48.7	Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
PSA.48.8	As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the 
PSA.48.9	We have conceived according to thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
PSA.48.10	According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth; thy right hand is full of righteousness.
PSA.48.11	Let Mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad because of thy judgments.
PSA.48.12	Walk about Zion and go round about her; tell the towers thereof.
PSA.48.13	Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces that ye may tell it to the generation following.
PSA.48.14	For this God is our God eternally and for ever; he will be our guide even unto death.
PSA.49.1	Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
PSA.49.2	Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
PSA.49.3	My mouth shall speak wisdom; and the meditation of my heart intelligence.
PSA.49.4	I will incline mine ear to a parable; I will declare my enigma upon the harp.
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear in the days of adversity when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
PSA.49.6	Those that trust in their wealth and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
PSA.49.7	none of them can by any means ransom his brother, nor give God an atonement for him;
PSA.49.8	(for the redemption of their soul is of great price, and they shall never pay it)
PSA.49.9	that he should still live for ever and not see corruption.
PSA.49.10	For he sees that all the wise men die, likewise the fool and the ignorant perish and leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their inward thought is that their houses are eternal and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.
PSA.49.12	Nevertheless man will not abide forever in honour; he is like the beasts that are cut off.
PSA.49.13	This their way is their folly; yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
PSA.49.14	Like sheep they are laid in Sheol; death shall feed on them, and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning, and their beauty shall be consumed in the grave from their dwelling.
PSA.49.15	Surely God will ransom my soul from the hand of Sheol when he shall take me. Selah.
PSA.49.16	Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
PSA.49.17	for in his death he shall carry nothing away; nor shall his glory descend after him.
PSA.49.18	Though while he lives, his life shall be blessed: and men will praise thee when thou art prosperous.
PSA.49.19	He shall enter into the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light forever.
PSA.49.20	Man that is in honour that does not understand is like the beasts that are cut off.
PSA.50.1	The God of gods, even the 
PSA.50.2	Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God has shined forth.
PSA.50.3	Our God shall come and shall not keep silence; a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
PSA.50.4	He shall convocate the heavens of above, and the earth, that he may judge his people.
PSA.50.5	Gather my merciful ones together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
PSA.50.6	And the heavens shall declare his righteousness, for God himself is the judge. Selah.
PSA.50.7	Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee; I am God, even thy God.
PSA.50.8	I will not reprove thee regarding thy sacrifices; thy burnt offerings are continually before me.
PSA.50.9	I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.
PSA.50.10	For every beast of the forest is mine and the cattle upon a thousand hills.
PSA.50.11	I know all the fowls of the mountains; and the wild beasts of the field are with me.
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell thee; for the world is mine and the fullness thereof.
PSA.50.13	Must I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?
PSA.50.14	Sacrifice praise unto God and pay thy vows unto the most High
PSA.50.15	and call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
PSA.50.16	But unto the wicked God saith, What part hast thou to declare my statutes or that thou should take my covenant in thy mouth?
PSA.50.17	Seeing thou dost hate chastening and dost cast my words behind thee.
PSA.50.18	When thou didst see a thief, then thou didst consent with him and hast been partaker with adulterers.
PSA.50.19	Thou didst give thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frames deceit.
PSA.50.20	Thou didst sit and speak against thy brother; thou didst slander thine own mother’s son.
PSA.50.21	These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou didst think that I was altogether such a one as thyself, but I will reprove thee and set them in order before thine eyes.
PSA.50.22	Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I take you away, and there be none to deliver.
PSA.50.23	Whosoever sacrifices praise glorifies me; and to him that orders his ways aright I will show the salvation of God.
PSA.51.1	Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy mercy; according unto the multitude of thy compassion eradicate my rebellion.
PSA.51.2	Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.
PSA.51.3	For I acknowledge my rebellion; and my sin is ever before me.
PSA.51.4	Against thee, against thee only, have I sinned and done this evil in thy sight that thou be declared just in thy word and pure in thy judgment.
PSA.51.5	Behold, the pain of my iniquity has caused me to writhe; my mother conceived me so that sin might be removed from me.
PSA.51.6	Behold, thou dost desire truth in the inward parts, and in the secret things thou hast made me to know wisdom.
PSA.51.7	Remove the sin in me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Make me to hear joy and gladness that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
PSA.51.9	Hide thy face from my sins and eradicate all my iniquities.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.
PSA.51.11	Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy Holy Spirit from me.
PSA.51.12	Restore unto me the joy of thy saving health, and thy spirit of liberty shall uphold me.
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
PSA.51.14	Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation, and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
PSA.51.15	O Lord, open my lips; and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
PSA.51.16	For thou dost not desire sacrifice or else would I give it; thou dost not delight in burnt offering.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
PSA.51.18	Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion; build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then thou shalt be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, the burnt offering, the offering that has been totally consumed by the fire; then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
PSA.52.1	Why dost thou boast of evil, O strong man? The mercy of God is day by day.
PSA.52.2	Thy tongue devises wickedness like a sharp razor, working deceitfully.
PSA.52.3	Thou dost love evil more than good; and lying rather than to speak righteousness. Selah.
PSA.52.4	Thou dost love all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
PSA.52.5	God shall likewise cast thee down for ever; he shall cut thee off and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah.
PSA.52.6	The righteous also shall see and fear and shall laugh at him, saying:
PSA.52.7	Behold, this is the man that did not make God his strength, but trusted in the abundance of his riches and strengthened himself in his wickedness.
PSA.52.8	But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the eternal mercy of God for ever.
PSA.52.9	I will praise thee for ever because thou hast done it, and I will wait on thy name, for it is good before thy merciful ones.
PSA.53.1	The fool has said in his heart, There is no God. They have corrupted themselves and have done abominable iniquity; there is no one that does good.
PSA.53.2	God looked down from heaven upon the sons of Adam to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
PSA.53.3	Every one of them is gone back; they are altogether become filthy; there is no one that does good, no, not one.
PSA.53.4	Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread; they have not called upon God.
PSA.53.5	They were there in great fear where no fear was; for God has scattered the bones of him that encamps against thee: thou hast put them to shame because God has despised them.
PSA.53.6	Oh that the saving health of Israel were come out of Zion! When God brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
PSA.54.1	Save me, O God, in thy name and defend me by thy valour.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
PSA.54.3	For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul; they have not set God before them. Selah.
PSA.54.4	Behold, God is my helper; the Lord is with those that uphold my soul.
PSA.54.5	He shall reward evil unto my enemies; cut them off in thy truth.
PSA.54.6	I will freely sacrifice unto thee; I will praise thy name, O 
PSA.54.7	For he has delivered me out of all trouble, and my eye has seen his desire upon my enemies.
PSA.55.1	Give ear to my prayer, O God, and do not hide thyself from my supplication.
PSA.55.2	Attend unto me and hear me: I mourn in my complaint and make a noise
PSA.55.3	because of the voice of the enemy because of the oppression of the wicked; for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
PSA.55.4	My heart is sore pained within me, and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
PSA.55.5	Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror has overwhelmed me.
PSA.55.6	And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then I would fly away and be at rest.
PSA.55.7	Behold, then I would flee far away and dwell in the wilderness. Selah.
PSA.55.8	I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
PSA.55.9	Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues, for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof; iniquity also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
PSA.55.11	Wickedness is in the midst thereof; deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
PSA.55.12	For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it, neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
PSA.55.13	But it was thou, who in my estimation was, my lord, and of my own family.
PSA.55.14	We took sweet counsel together and walked unto the house of God in company.
PSA.55.15	Let them be condemned unto death, and let them go down alive into Sheol for wickedness is in their dwellings and among them.
PSA.55.16	As for me, I will call upon God, and the 
PSA.55.17	Evening and morning and at noon I will pray and cry aloud, and he shall hear my voice.
PSA.55.18	He has ransomed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me, for there were many against me.
PSA.55.19	God shall hear and bring them down, even he that abides from of old. Selah. Because they do not change, nor do they fear God.
PSA.55.20	He has put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him; he has defiled his covenant.
PSA.55.21	The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart; his words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
PSA.55.22	Cast thy burden upon the 
PSA.55.23	But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of the grave; bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days, but I will trust in thee.
PSA.56.1	Be merciful unto me, O God, for man would swallow me up; he oppresses me fighting me daily.
PSA.56.2	My enemies would daily swallow me up, for they are many that fight against me, O thou most High.
PSA.56.3	When I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
PSA.56.4	In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
PSA.56.5	Every day my life is filled with sorrow; all their thoughts are against me for evil.
PSA.56.6	They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps when they wait for my soul.
PSA.56.7	Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the peoples, O God.
PSA.56.8	Thou tellest my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle; are they not in thy book?
PSA.56.9	When I cry unto thee, then shall my enemies be turned back; in this I know that God is for me.
PSA.56.10	In God I will praise his word; in the 
PSA.56.11	In God I have put my trust; I will not be afraid of what man can do unto me.
PSA.56.12	Thy promises are upon me, O God; I will render praises unto thee.
PSA.56.13	For thou hast delivered my life from death; thou hast kept my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
PSA.57.1	Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul trusts in thee; and in the shadow of thy wings I will make my refuge until these calamities are overpast.
PSA.57.2	I will cry unto God most high, unto God that performs all things for me.
PSA.57.3	He shall send from the heavens and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
PSA.57.4	My soul is among lions, and I lie even among those that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.
PSA.57.5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
PSA.57.6	They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down; they have dug a pit before me, into the midst of which they are fallen themselves. Selah.
PSA.57.7	My heart is ready, O God, my heart is willing; I will sing and give praise.
PSA.57.8	Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp; I myself will arise early.
PSA.57.9	I will praise thee, O Lord, among the peoples; I will sing unto thee among the nations.
PSA.57.10	For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.
PSA.57.11	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
PSA.58.1	Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of Adam?
PSA.58.2	Yea, in heart ye work iniquity; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
PSA.58.3	The wicked are estranged from the womb; they go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.
PSA.58.4	Their poison is like the poison of a serpent; they are like the deaf adder that stops her ear,
PSA.58.5	which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
PSA.58.6	Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth; break out the great teeth of the young lions, O 
PSA.58.7	Let them melt away as waters which run continually; when he bends his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
PSA.58.8	As a snail which melts, let them pass away, like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
PSA.58.9	Before your pots can feel the fire of the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.
PSA.58.10	The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous; verily there is a God that judges in the earth.
PSA.59.1	Deliver me from my enemies, O my God; defend me from those that rise up against me.
PSA.59.2	Deliver me from the workers of iniquity and save me from bloodthirsty men.
PSA.59.3	For, behold, they lie in wait for my soul; the strong are gathered against me; I am not in rebellion, nor in sin, O 
PSA.59.4	They run and prepare themselves when I have committed no iniquity; awake to help me and behold.
PSA.59.5	Thou, therefore, O 
PSA.59.6	They will return at evening; they will bark like dogs and go round about outside the city.
PSA.59.7	Behold, they belch out with their mouth; swords are in their lips; for who, say they, doth hear?
PSA.59.8	But thou, O 
PSA.59.9	I will reserve his strength unto thee, for God is my defence.
PSA.59.10	The God of my mercy shall meet me on the way; God shall let me see my desire upon my enemies.
PSA.59.11	Slay them not lest my people forget; scatter them by thy power and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
PSA.59.12	For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips, let them even be taken in their pride; they shall be subject to weakness and to a curse.
PSA.59.13	Consume them in wrath, consume them that they may not be and let them know that God rules in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
PSA.59.14	And at evening let them return and let them bark like dogs and go round about outside the city.
PSA.59.15	Let them wander up and down for food and murmur if they are not satisfied.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing of thy power; I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning, for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
PSA.59.17	Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing, for God is my defence and the God of my mercy.
PSA.60.1	O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us; thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
PSA.60.2	Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it; heal its breaches, for it shakes.
PSA.60.3	Thou hast showed thy people hard things; thou hast made us to drink the wine of shaking.
PSA.60.4	Thou hast given a banner to those that fear thee that they raise up for the truth. Selah.
PSA.60.5	That thy beloved may be delivered, save with thy right hand and hear me.
PSA.60.6	God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;
PSA.60.8	Moab is my washpot; over Edom I will cast out my shoe; Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me into the strong city? Who will lead me into Edom?
PSA.60.10	Surely thou, O God, who had cast us off; and thou, O God, who did not go out with our armies.
PSA.60.11	Give us help from trouble, for vain is the salvation of man.
PSA.60.12	Through God we shall do valiantly, for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
PSA.61.1	Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
PSA.61.2	From the end of the earth I will cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed; lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
PSA.61.3	For thou hast been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy.
PSA.61.4	I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever; I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
PSA.61.5	For thou, O God, hast heard my vows; thou hast given an inheritance to those that fear thy name.
PSA.61.6	Thou wilt add days upon days unto the king’s life; his years shall be from generation to generation.
PSA.61.7	He shall abide before God for ever; He is aware of mercy and truth which preserve him.
PSA.61.8	So I will sing thy name for ever, performing my vows each day.
PSA.62.1	Only in God does my soul rest; from him comes my saving health.
PSA.62.2	He only is my rock and my saving health; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
PSA.62.3	How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? Shall ye murder each other until ye are as a bowing wall and as a tottering fence?
PSA.62.4	They only consult to cast him down from his greatness; they delight in lies; they bless with their mouth, but they curse in their inward parts. Selah.
PSA.62.5	My soul, rest thou only in God, for my hope is from him.
PSA.62.6	He only is my rock and my saving health; he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
PSA.62.7	In God is my saving health and my glory; the rock of my strength and my refuge is in God.
PSA.62.8	Wait in him at all times; ye peoples, pour out your heart before him; God is our refuge. Selah.
PSA.62.9	Surely the sons of Adam are vanity, and the sons of nobles are a lie; to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
PSA.62.10	Trust not in violence and become not vain in the taking of spoil; if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
PSA.62.11	God has spoken once; twice have I heard this that power belongs unto God.
PSA.62.12	Also unto thee, O Lord, belongs mercy, for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
PSA.63.1	O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee; my soul thirsts for thee; my flesh longs for thee in a dry and thirsty land where there is no water;
PSA.63.2	in this manner I beheld thee in holiness when I beheld thy power and thy glory.
PSA.63.3	Because thy mercy is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
PSA.63.4	Thus will I bless thee in my life; in thy name shall I lift up my hands.
PSA.63.5	My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips
PSA.63.6	When I remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches.
PSA.63.7	Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
PSA.63.8	My soul has followed hard after thee; thy right hand has upheld me.
PSA.63.9	But those that sought my soul, to destroy it, descended into the lower parts of the earth.
PSA.63.10	They shall be slain by the sword; they shall be a portion for foxes.
PSA.63.11	But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall be praised; for the mouth of those that speak lies shall be stopped.
PSA.64.1	Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer; preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
PSA.64.3	Who whet their tongue like a sword and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words
PSA.64.4	That they may shoot in secret at the perfect; suddenly do they shoot at him and fear not.
PSA.64.5	They encourage themselves in an evil matter; they attempt to hide the snares; they say, Who shall see them?
PSA.64.6	They search out iniquities; they perfect and put into effect that which they have invented in the inward thought of each one of them and that which they have devised in their heart.
PSA.64.7	But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
PSA.64.8	So they shall make their own council and agreements to fall upon themselves; all that see them shall flee away.
PSA.64.9	And all men shall fear and shall declare the work of God, for they shall understand his doing.
PSA.64.10	The righteous shall be glad in the 
PSA.65.1	Praise doth rest in thee, O God, in Sion and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
PSA.65.2	O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
PSA.65.3	Words of iniquity overwhelmed me, but thou shalt purge away our rebellion.
PSA.65.4	Blessed is the man whom thou dost choose and cause to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple.
PSA.65.5	With tremendous things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our saving health, who art the hope of all the ends of the earth and of those that are afar off upon the sea:
PSA.65.6	Thou art he who doth establish the mountains by thy strength, being girded with valour:
PSA.65.7	He who stills the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves and the tumult of the Gentiles.
PSA.65.8	They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy wonders; thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
PSA.65.9	Thou dost visit the earth, and when thou hast caused it to want, thou dost greatly enrich it with the river of God, which is full of water; thou dost prepare their grain, according to thy will.
PSA.65.10	Thou dost water its rows abundantly; thou dost settle its furrows; thou dost make it soft with showers of rain; thou dost bless its sprouting.
PSA.65.11	Thou dost crown the year with thy goodness, and thy clouds distill fatness.
PSA.65.12	They fall upon the habitations of the wilderness; and the hills gird themselves with happiness.
PSA.65.13	The plains clothe themselves with sheep, and the valleys cover themselves with grain; they give shouts of triumph, they even sing.
PSA.66.1	Make a joyful noise unto God, all the earth;
PSA.66.2	sing forth the glory of his name; put glory into thy praise.
PSA.66.3	Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! Through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
PSA.66.4	All the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.
PSA.66.5	Come and see the works of God; he is terrible in his doing toward the sons of men.
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land; they went through the river on foot; there did we rejoice in him.
PSA.66.7	He rules by his power for ever; his eyes watch the Gentiles; the rebellious shall not exalt themselves. Selah.
PSA.66.8	O bless our God, ye peoples, and make the voice of his praise to be heard.
PSA.66.9	It is he who placed our soul into life and did not suffer our feet to slip.
PSA.66.10	For thou, O God, hast proved us; thou hast refined us as silver is refined.
PSA.66.11	Thou didst bring us into the net; thou didst lay affliction upon our loins.
PSA.66.12	Thou hast placed a man over our head; we went through fire and through water, but thou didst bring us out into abundance.
PSA.66.13	I will go into thy house with burnt offerings; I will pay thee my vows,
PSA.66.14	which my lips have uttered and my mouth has spoken when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
PSA.66.16	Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he has done unto my soul.
PSA.66.17	I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
PSA.66.19	But verily God has heard me; he has attended to the voice of my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Blessed be God, who has not turned away my prayer nor his mercy from me.
PSA.67.1	God be merciful unto us and bless us and cause his face to shine upon us. Selah.
PSA.67.2	That thy way may be known upon the earth, thy saving health among all the Gentiles.
PSA.67.3	Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee.
PSA.67.4	O let the Gentiles be glad and sing for joy, for thou shalt judge the people righteously and shepherd the Gentiles upon the earth. Selah.
PSA.67.5	Let the peoples praise thee, O God; let all the peoples praise thee.
PSA.67.6	Then shall the earth bring forth her fruit, and God, even our own God, shall bless us.
PSA.67.7	God shall bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
PSA.68.1	Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered; let those that hate him flee before him.
PSA.68.2	As smoke is driven away; so drive them away: as wax melts before the fire, so shall the wicked perish at the presence of God.
PSA.68.3	But the righteous shall be glad; they shall rejoice before God; they shall dance with joy.
PSA.68.4	Sing unto God, sing psalms unto his name; extol him that rides upon the heavens by his name JAH and rejoice before him.
PSA.68.5	A father of the fatherless and a defender of the widows is God in his holy habitation.
PSA.68.6	God sets the solitary in families; he brings out those who are bound with chains, but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
PSA.68.7	O God, when thou didst go forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:
PSA.68.8	The earth shook, the heavens also dropped their rain at the presence of God; even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, by which thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
PSA.68.10	Thy presence was in thy congregation; thou, O God, by thy goodness thou hast provided for the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord shall give a word; great shall be the host of the evangelists thereof.
PSA.68.12	Kings of armies fled apace, and she that dwells in the house divided the spoil.
PSA.68.13	Though ye be cast among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver and her feathers with yellow gold.
PSA.68.14	When the Almighty scattered the kings that were in her, she became white as the snow in Salmon.
PSA.68.15	The mountain of Bashan is the mountain of God; the mountain of Bashan is a high mountain.
PSA.68.16	Why leap ye, ye high mountains? This is the mountain which God desires to dwell in; yea, the 
PSA.68.17	The chariots of God are two thousand, thousands of angels; the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the sanctuary.
PSA.68.18	Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive; thou hast received gifts for men, yea, for the rebellious also that the 
PSA.68.19	Blessed be the Lord, who daily lades us with benefits, even the God of our saving health. Selah.
PSA.68.20	He that is our God is the God of salvation, and unto GOD the Lord belongs the way of escape from death.
PSA.68.21	Surely God shall smite the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such a one as goes on still in his trespasses.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:
PSA.68.23	Thy foot shall be dipped in the blood of thine enemies and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.
PSA.68.24	They have seen thy ways, O God, even the ways of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.
PSA.68.25	The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; in between them were the virgins playing with timbrels.
PSA.68.26	Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, ye of the lineage of Israel.
PSA.68.27	There was little Benjamin as their ruler, the princes of Judah in their congregation, the princes of Zebulun and the princes of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	Thy God has commanded thy strength; confirm, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
PSA.68.29	From thy temple in Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.
PSA.68.30	Reprehend the company of spearmen, the multitude of the strong, with the lords of the peoples, trampling them underfoot with their pieces of silver; Destroy thou the peoples that delight in war.
PSA.68.31	Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.
PSA.68.32	Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord Selah:
PSA.68.33	To him that rides upon the heavens of the heavens which were of old; behold, he shall send forth his voice, his mighty voice.
PSA.68.34	Ascribe ye strength unto God; his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.
PSA.68.35	O God, thou art terrible out of thy sanctuaries; the God of Israel is he that gives strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
PSA.69.1	Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
PSA.69.2	I sink in deep mire where there is no standing; I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
PSA.69.3	I am weary of my crying; my throat is dried; my eyes fail while I wait for my God.
PSA.69.4	Those that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head; those that would destroy me, being my enemies wrongfully, are mighty; then I restored that which I did not take away.
PSA.69.5	O God, thou knowest my foolishness, and my guiltiness is not hid from thee.
PSA.69.6	Do not let those that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of the hosts, be ashamed for my sake; do not let those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
PSA.69.7	Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame has covered my face.
PSA.69.8	I am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother’s sons.
PSA.69.9	For the zeal of thy house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
PSA.69.10	When I wept with fasting of my soul, thou hast been a reproach unto me.
PSA.69.11	I made sackcloth also my garment, and I became a proverb to them.
PSA.69.12	They that sat in the gate spoke against me, and I was the song of the drunkards.
PSA.69.13	But I corrected my prayer unto thee, O 
PSA.69.14	Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not drown; let me be delivered from those that hate me and out of the deep waters.
PSA.69.15	Let not the violent force of the waters overcome me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
PSA.69.16	Hear me, O 
PSA.69.17	And hide not thy face from thy slave, for I am in trouble; hear me speedily.
PSA.69.18	Draw near unto my soul and redeem it; deliver me because of my enemies.
PSA.69.19	Thou hast known my reproach and my shame and my dishonour; my adversaries are all before thee.
PSA.69.20	Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness, and I looked for some to take pity, but there was no one, and for comforters, but I found none.
PSA.69.21	They also gave me gall for my food; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	Let their table become a snare before them, and that which should have been for their prosperity, let it become a stumbling block.
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be darkened that they see not and make their loins continually to shake.
PSA.69.24	Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
PSA.69.25	Let their palace be desolate, and let no one dwell in their tents.
PSA.69.26	For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten, and they boast that thou hast slain their enemies.
PSA.69.27	Add iniquity unto their iniquity, and let them not come into thy righteousness.
PSA.69.28	Let them be blotted out of the book of the living and not be written with the righteous.
PSA.69.29	But I am poor and sorrowful; let thy saving health, O God, set me up on high.
PSA.69.30	I will praise the name of God with a song and will magnify him with praises.
PSA.69.31	This also shall please the 
PSA.69.32	The humble shall see this and be glad; seek God and thy heart shall live.
PSA.69.33	For the 
PSA.69.34	Let the heavens and the earth praise him, the seas, and every thing that moves in them.
PSA.69.35	For God will protect Zion and will rebuild the cities of Judah; they shall dwell there and inherit it.
PSA.69.36	The seed of his slaves shall inherit it, and those that love his name shall dwell therein.
PSA.70.1	Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O 
PSA.70.2	Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my life; let them be turned backward and put to confusion that desire my hurt.
PSA.70.3	Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
PSA.70.4	Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee, and let such as love thy saving health say continually, Let God be magnified.
PSA.70.5	But I am poor and destitute; make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O 
PSA.71.1	In thee, O 
PSA.71.2	Deliver me in thy righteousness and cause me to escape; incline thine ear unto me and save me.
PSA.71.3	Be thou my strong habitation unto which I may continually resort; thou hast given a commandment that I should be saved because thou art my rock and my fortress.
PSA.71.4	Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the perverse and violent man.
PSA.71.5	For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD; thou art my security from my youth.
PSA.71.6	By thee have I been sustained from the womb; thou art he that took me out of my mother’s bowels; my praise has been continually of thee.
PSA.71.7	I am as a wonder unto many, but thou art my strong refuge.
PSA.71.8	Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy glory all the day.
PSA.71.9	Do not cast me off in the time of old age; do not forsake me when my strength fails.
PSA.71.10	For my enemies speak against me, and those that lay in wait for my soul take counsel together,
PSA.71.11	saying, God has forsaken him; persecute and take him for there is no one to deliver him.
PSA.71.12	O God, be not far from me; O my God, make haste for my help.
PSA.71.13	Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
PSA.71.14	But I will continually wait and will add upon all thy praise.
PSA.71.15	My mouth shall show forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day, for I know not the numbers thereof.
PSA.71.16	I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD; I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
PSA.71.17	O God, thou hast taught me from my youth and until now; I shall manifest thy wondrous works.
PSA.71.18	Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not until I have showed the strength of thy arm unto the next generation and thy power to every one that is to come,
PSA.71.19	and thy righteousness, O God, unto excellence because thou hast done great things; O God, who is like unto thee!
PSA.71.20	Thou who hast caused me to see great and sore troubles, shalt return and quicken me and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
PSA.71.21	Thou shalt increase my greatness and comfort me on every side.
PSA.71.22	I will also praise thee with an instrument of the psaltery, O my God; unto thee will I sing thy truth with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
PSA.71.23	My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing praises unto thee and my soul, which thou hast ransomed.
PSA.71.24	In the same manner my tongue shall talk of thy righteousness every day, for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
PSA.72.1	Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king’s son.
PSA.72.2	He shall judge thy people with righteousness and thy poor with judgment.
PSA.72.3	The mountains shall bring peace to the people and the little hills by righteousness.
PSA.72.4	He shall judge the poor of the people; he shall save the children of the destitute and shall break in pieces the violent.
PSA.72.5	They shall fear thee along with the sun and before the moon throughout all generations.
PSA.72.6	He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass as the dew that waters the earth.
PSA.72.7	In his days shall righteousness flourish and abundance of peace until there is no longer any moon.
PSA.72.8	He shall have dominion also from sea to sea and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
PSA.72.9	Those that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him, and his enemies shall lick the dust.
PSA.72.10	The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents; the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
PSA.72.11	Yea, all kings shall fall down before him; all Gentiles shall serve him.
PSA.72.12	For he shall deliver the destitute when he cries and the poor that has no helper.
PSA.72.13	He shall have mercy on the poor and destitute and shall save the souls of the poor in spirit.
PSA.72.14	He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence, and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
PSA.72.15	And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba; prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily he shall be given blessings.
PSA.72.16	There shall be planted a handful of grain in the earth upon the tops of the mountains; its fruit shall thunder like Lebanon; and out of the city they shall blossom like the grass of the earth.
PSA.72.17	His name shall endure for ever; before the sun his name shall be disseminated, and all Gentiles shall be blessed in him; they shall call him blessed.
PSA.72.18	Blessed be the 
PSA.72.19	And blessed be his glorious name for ever, and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.
PSA.72.20	The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
PSA.73.1	Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are pure in heart.
PSA.73.2	But as for me, my feet almost departed from the way; my steps had almost slipped.
PSA.73.3	For I became angry against the foolish when I saw the peace of the wicked.
PSA.73.4	Because there is no restraint that would bring about their death, but their strength is firm.
PSA.73.5	They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
PSA.73.6	Therefore they are crowned with pride; they cover themselves with violence as a garment.
PSA.73.7	Their eyes stand out with fatness; they easily obtain the desires of their heart.
PSA.73.8	They are lawless and speak wickedly of doing violence; they speak loftily.
PSA.73.9	They set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue walks through the earth.
PSA.73.10	Therefore his people shall return here; and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
PSA.73.11	And they say, How does God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
PSA.73.12	Behold, these ungodly men, without being troubled by the world obtain riches.
PSA.73.13	Verily, in vain have I cleansed my heart and washed my hands in innocency
PSA.73.14	and been plagued all day long and chastened every morning:
PSA.73.15	If I should say, I will speak as they do; behold, I should deny the generation of thy sons.
PSA.73.16	I shall meditate that I might understand this; it is very hard for me to see.
PSA.73.17	When I come into the sanctuary of God, then I shall understand their end.
PSA.73.18	Surely thou didst set them in slippery places; in desolation thou shalt cause them to fall.
PSA.73.19	How they are brought into desolation, as in a moment! They have come to an end; they are utterly consumed with terrors.
PSA.73.20	As the dream of one who awakes; so, O Lord, when thou shalt rise up, thou shalt despise their appearances.
PSA.73.21	Truly my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my kidneys.
PSA.73.22	But I was ignorant and did not understand; I was as a beast before thee.
PSA.73.23	Nevertheless I was continually with thee; thou hast apprehended me by my right hand.
PSA.73.24	Thou hast guided me with thy counsel, and afterward thou shalt receive me unto glory.
PSA.73.25	Whom have I in heaven but thee? And apart from thee there is nothing upon the earth that I desire.
PSA.73.26	My flesh and my heart fail; the strength of my heart is that God is my portion for ever.
PSA.73.27	For, behold, those that stray from thee shall perish; thou dost cut off all those that go a whoring from thee.
PSA.73.28	But as for me, to draw near to God is good; I have put my hope in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
PSA.74.1	O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? Why does thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed, this Mount Zion, in which thou hast dwelt.
PSA.74.3	Lift up thy feet unto the eternal desolations, unto every enemy who has done wickedly in the sanctuary.
PSA.74.4	Thine enemies have roared in the midst of thy assemblies; they set up their own banners for signs.
PSA.74.5	Renowned, as one on the way to heaven, he who lifted up axes upon the thick trees for the work of the sanctuary.
PSA.74.6	But now they break down all the carved work thereof with axes and hammers.
PSA.74.7	They have set fire to thy sanctuaries; they have defiled the tabernacle of thy name in the earth.
PSA.74.8	They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them at once; they have burned up all the meeting places of the people of God in the earth.
PSA.74.9	We no longer see our own banners; there is no longer any prophet: neither is there among us any that knows. How long shall this be?
PSA.74.10	O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
PSA.74.11	Why dost thou withdraw thy hand, even thy right hand? Why dost thou hide it in thy bosom.
PSA.74.12	For God is my King from of old, he who works saving health in the midst of the earth.
PSA.74.13	Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength; thou didst break the heads of the dragons in the waters.
PSA.74.14	Thou didst break the heads of leviathan in pieces and didst give him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
PSA.74.15	Thou didst cleave the fountain and the river; thou didst dry up mighty rivers.
PSA.74.16	The day is thine, the night also is thine; thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
PSA.74.17	Thou hast set all the borders of the earth; thou hast made summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	Remember this, that the enemy has spoken against the 
PSA.74.19	O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the beasts; forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
PSA.74.20	Have respect unto the covenant; for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of violence.
PSA.74.21	O let not the oppressed return ashamed; the poor and destitute shall praise thy name.
PSA.74.22	Arise, O God, plead thine own cause; remember how the foolish man reproaches thee daily.
PSA.74.23	Forget not the voices of thine enemies; the tumult of those that rise up against thee increases continually.
PSA.75.1	Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks, for that thy name is near, thy wondrous works declare.
PSA.75.2	When I shall receive the congregation, I will judge uprightly.
PSA.75.3	The earth and all its inhabitants are dissolved; I bore up the pillars of it. Selah.
PSA.75.4	I said unto the fools, Do not deal foolishly and to the wicked, Do not lift up the horn:
PSA.75.5	Do not lift up your horn on high; speak not with a stiff neck.
PSA.75.6	For promotion comes neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the desert.
PSA.75.7	But God is the judge; he puts down one and sets up another.
PSA.75.8	For the cup is in the hand of the 
PSA.75.9	But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	And I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
PSA.76.1	In Judah is God known; his name is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	In Salem also is his tabernacle and his dwelling place in Zion.
PSA.76.3	There he broke the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the war. Selah.
PSA.76.4	Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
PSA.76.5	The stouthearted are spoiled; they have slept their sleep; and nothing was found in the hands of the men of might.
PSA.76.6	At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
PSA.76.7	Thou, even thou, art to be feared, and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
PSA.76.8	From the heavens thou didst cause judgment to be heard; the earth feared and was still,
PSA.76.9	when thou didst arise unto judgment, O God, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
PSA.76.10	Surely the wrath of man shall cause praise to come unto thee; the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
PSA.76.11	Vow and pay unto the 
PSA.76.12	He shall cut off the spirit of princes; he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
PSA.77.1	I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
PSA.77.2	In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord; my sore bled in the night and ceased not; my soul refused to be comforted.
PSA.77.3	I remembered God and cried out; I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
PSA.77.4	Thou didst hold my eyelids open; I am broken and did not speak.
PSA.77.5	I have considered the days from the beginning, the years of the ages.
PSA.77.6	I call to remembrance my songs of the night; I commune with my own heart, and my spirit made diligent search.
PSA.77.7	Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
PSA.77.8	Is his mercy gone for ever? does his word fail from generation to generation?
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten to have mercy? has he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
PSA.77.10	And I said, This is my infirmity, but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
PSA.77.11	I remembered the works of JAH; therefore I shall remember thy wonders of old.
PSA.77.12	I meditated also on all thy works and spoke of thy doings.
PSA.77.13	Thy way, O God, is in holiness; who is so great a God as our God?
PSA.77.14	Thou art the God that doest wonders; thou hast declared thy strength among the peoples.
PSA.77.15	Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
PSA.77.16	The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid; the depths also were troubled.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured out floods of waters; the heavens thundered; thy bolts of lightning also went forth.
PSA.77.18	The voice of thy thunder was all around; the lightnings lightened the world; the earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	Thy way was in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps were not known.
PSA.77.20	Thou didst lead thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
PSA.78.2	I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter enigmas of old,
PSA.78.3	which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not hide them from their sons, showing to the generation to come the praises of the 
PSA.78.5	For he established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their sons:
PSA.78.6	That the generation to come might know them, even the sons which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their sons
PSA.78.7	that they might set their hope in God and not forget the works of God but keep his commandments
PSA.78.8	and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not set their heart aright and whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
PSA.78.9	The sons of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They did not keep the covenant of God and refused to walk in his law
PSA.78.11	and forgot his works and his wonders that he had showed them.
PSA.78.12	He did marvellous things in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
PSA.78.13	He divided the sea and caused them to pass through, and he made the waters to stand as a heap.
PSA.78.14	In the daytime also he led them with a cloud and all the night with a light of fire.
PSA.78.15	He clave the rocks in the wilderness and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
PSA.78.16	He brought streams also out of the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
PSA.78.18	And they tempted God in their heart by asking for food according to the desires of their soul.
PSA.78.19	And they spoke against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
PSA.78.20	Behold, he smote the rock that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
PSA.78.21	Therefore the 
PSA.78.22	because they had not believed God, nor had they trusted in his saving health;
PSA.78.23	and he commanded the clouds of above and opened the doors of the heavens
PSA.78.24	and caused manna to rain upon them to eat and gave them wheat of the heavens.
PSA.78.25	Man did eat the food of the strong; he sent them food to the full.
PSA.78.26	He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven, and by his power he brought in the south wind.
PSA.78.27	He rained flesh also upon them as dust and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
PSA.78.28	And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
PSA.78.29	So they did eat and were well filled; for he gave them their own desire;
PSA.78.30	they were not estranged from their lust. But while their food was yet in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	the wrath of God came upon them and slew the fattest of them and smote down the chosen of Israel.
PSA.78.32	For all this they sinned still and did not give him credit for his wondrous works.
PSA.78.33	Therefore he consumed their days in vanity and their years in tribulation.
PSA.78.34	When he slew them, then they sought him, and they returned and enquired early after God.
PSA.78.35	And they remembered that God was their rock and the high God their redeemer.
PSA.78.36	Nevertheless they flattered him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
PSA.78.37	For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
PSA.78.38	But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them; many a time turned he his anger away and did not stir up all his wrath.
PSA.78.39	For he remembered that they were but flesh: a wind that passes away and does not come again.
PSA.78.40	How often did they provoke him in the wilderness and grieve him in the desert!
PSA.78.41	And they turned back and tempted God and limited the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They did not remember his hand, nor the day when he ransomed them from anguish.
PSA.78.43	How he had wrought his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the field of Zoan
PSA.78.44	and had turned their rivers into blood and their floods, that they could not drink.
PSA.78.45	He sent swarms of flies among them, which devoured them, and frogs, which destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	He gave also their fruits unto the caterpillar and their works unto the locust.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail and their wild fig trees with stones.
PSA.78.48	He gave up their cattle also to the hail and their flocks to thunderbolts of fire.
PSA.78.49	He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation and trouble by sending evil angels among them.
PSA.78.50	He made a way to his anger; he did not spare their soul from death but gave their life over to the pestilence
PSA.78.51	and smote all the firstborn in Egypt, the firstfruits of their strength in the tents of Ham:
PSA.78.52	But made his own people to go forth like sheep and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
PSA.78.53	And he led them on safely, so that they feared not; but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
PSA.78.54	And he brought them into the borders of his holiness, into this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
PSA.78.55	He cast out the Gentiles also before them and divided them an inheritance by line and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their habitations.
PSA.78.56	Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God and did not keep his testimonies:
PSA.78.57	But turned back and rebelled like their fathers; they became like a deceitful bow.
PSA.78.58	For they provoked him to anger with their high places and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
PSA.78.59	God heard this and was wroth and greatly abhorred Israel:
PSA.78.60	For this reason he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent in which he dwelt among men
PSA.78.61	and delivered his strength into captivity and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
PSA.78.62	He gave his people over also unto the sword and was wroth with his inheritance.
PSA.78.63	The fire consumed their young men; and their virgins were not honored in marriage songs.
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep and like a mighty man that shouts by reason of wine.
PSA.78.66	And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts; he put them to a perpetual reproach.
PSA.78.67	Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph and did not choose the tribe of Ephraim:
PSA.78.68	But chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved.
PSA.78.69	And he built his sanctuary in preeminence like the earth which he has established for ever.
PSA.78.70	He chose David also his slave and took him from the sheepfolds,
PSA.78.71	from following the ewes great with young, he brought him to feed Jacob his people and Israel his inheritance.
PSA.78.72	So he fed them out of the integrity of his heart and guided them by the intelligence of his hands.
PSA.79.1	O God, the Gentiles are come into thine inheritance; they have defiled the temple of thy holiness; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
PSA.79.2	The dead bodies of thy slaves they have given to be food unto the fowls of the heavens, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.
PSA.79.3	They have shed their blood like water round about Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them.
PSA.79.4	We are reproached by our neighbours, scorned, and derided by those that are round about us.
PSA.79.5	How long, 
PSA.79.6	Pour out thy wrath upon the Gentiles that do not know thee and upon the kingdoms that do not call upon thy name.
PSA.79.7	For they have devoured Jacob and laid waste his dwelling place.
PSA.79.8	O remember not against us former iniquities; let thy tender mercies speedily meet us on the way, for we are very poor.
PSA.79.9	Help us, O God, our saving health, for the honor of thy name and deliver us and purge away our sins, for thy name’s sake.
PSA.79.10	Why should the Gentiles say, Where is their God? let him be known among the Gentiles in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy slaves which is shed.
PSA.79.11	Let the sighing of the prisoners come before thee; according to the greatness of thy power preserve those that are appointed to die
PSA.79.12	and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, with which they have reproached thee, O Lord.
PSA.79.13	So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanks for ever: from generation to generation we will sing thy praises.
PSA.80.1	Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubim, shine forth.
PSA.80.2	In the presence of Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength and come and save us.
PSA.80.3	Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
PSA.80.4	O 
PSA.80.5	Thou dost feed them with the bread of tears and give them tears to drink in great measure.
PSA.80.6	Thou dost make us a strife unto our neighbours, and our enemies laugh at us among themselves.
PSA.80.7	Turn us again, O God of the hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
PSA.80.8	Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt; thou hast cast out the Gentiles and planted it.
PSA.80.9	Thou didst prepare room before it and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the earth.
PSA.80.10	The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and its boughs were like the cedars of God.
PSA.80.11	She sent out her boughs unto the sea and her branches unto the river.
PSA.80.12	Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all those who pass by the way pluck her?
PSA.80.13	The boar out of the wood wastes it, and the wild beast of the field devours it.
PSA.80.14	Return, we beseech thee, O God of the hosts: look down from heaven and behold and visit this vine
PSA.80.15	and the vineyard which thy right hand has planted and the branch that thou didst make strong for thyself.
PSA.80.16	It is burned with fire; it is cut down; they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
PSA.80.17	Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou didst make strong for thyself,
PSA.80.18	so we will not go back from thee. Thou shalt quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
PSA.80.19	Turn us again, O 
PSA.81.1	Sing aloud unto God our strength; make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	Take the song and play the timbrel, the harp of joy with the psaltery.
PSA.81.3	Blow the shofar in the new moon in the time appointed on our solemn feast day.
PSA.81.4	For this is a statute of Israel and an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt where I heard a language that I did not understand.
PSA.81.6	I removed his shoulder from the burden; his hands were delivered from working with clay.
PSA.81.7	Thou didst call in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder; I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
PSA.81.8	Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee; O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me,
PSA.81.9	no strange god shall be in thee, neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
PSA.81.10	I am the 
PSA.81.11	But my people did not hearken to my voice, and Israel did not love me.
PSA.81.12	So I gave them up unto the hardness of their heart, and they walked in their own counsels.
PSA.81.13	Oh, if my people would hearken unto me and Israel would walk in my ways!
PSA.81.14	I would soon subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their adversaries.
PSA.81.15	The haters of the 
PSA.81.16	And God would have fed them also the finest of the wheat, and with honey out of the rock I would have satisfied thee.
PSA.82.1	God stands in the congregation of the mighty; he judges among the gods.
PSA.82.2	How long will ye judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
PSA.82.3	Do right concerning the poor and fatherless; do justice to the poor and destitute.
PSA.82.4	Deliver the poor and destitute; deliver them out of the hand of the wicked.
PSA.82.5	They do not know, neither do they understand; they walk in darkness; they move all the foundations of the earth.
PSA.82.6	I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are sons of the most High.
PSA.82.7	But ye shall die like men and fall like one of the tyrants.
PSA.82.8	Arise, O God, judge the earth, for thou shalt inherit all the Gentiles.
PSA.83.1	Do not keep silence, O God; do not hold thy peace, and do not be still, O God.
PSA.83.2	For, behold, thine enemies make a tumult, and those that hate thee have lifted up their head.
PSA.83.3	They have taken prudent counsel in secret against thy people and consulted against thy hidden ones.
PSA.83.4	They have said, Come and let us cut them off from being a people that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
PSA.83.5	Therefore they have consulted together with one consent; they are confederate against thee:
PSA.83.6	The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; of Moab and the Hagarenes;
PSA.83.7	Gebal and Ammon and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
PSA.83.8	Assur also is joined with them: they are an arm unto the sons of Lot. Selah.
PSA.83.9	Do unto them as unto the Midianites, as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison,
PSA.83.10	who perished at Endor; they became as dung for the earth.
PSA.83.11	Make them and their captains like Oreb and like Zeeb; all their princes as Zebah and as Zalmunna:
PSA.83.12	Who have said, Let us inherit for ourselves the habitations of God.
PSA.83.13	O my God, make them like a whirlwind, as the stubble before the wind.
PSA.83.14	As the fire burns a wood and as the flame sets the mountains on fire
PSA.83.15	so persecute them with thy tempest and make them afraid with thy whirlwind.
PSA.83.16	Fill their faces with shame that they may seek thy name, O 
PSA.83.17	Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; let them be put to shame and perish
PSA.83.18	That they may know that thou, whose name alone is 
PSA.84.1	How amiable are thy habitations, O 
PSA.84.2	My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of the 
PSA.84.3	Even the sparrow has found a house and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young upon thine altars, O 
PSA.84.4	Happy are those that dwell in thy house; they shall continually praise thee. Selah.
PSA.84.5	Happy is the man whose strength is in thee, in whose heart are thy ways,
PSA.84.6	who passing through the valley of Baca, shall make it a well; the rain also shall fill the pools.
PSA.84.7	They go forth in a great multitude; and in order, they shall see God in Zion.
PSA.84.8	O 
PSA.84.9	Behold, O God our shield and look upon the face of thine anointed,
PSA.84.10	for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand outside of them. I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
PSA.84.11	For the 
PSA.84.12	O 
PSA.85.1	, thou hast been favourable unto thy land; thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
PSA.85.2	Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people; thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
PSA.85.3	Thou hast taken away all thy wrath; thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
PSA.85.4	Turn us, O God our saving health and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
PSA.85.5	Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou extend thine anger from generation to generation?
PSA.85.6	Wilt thou not give us life again that thy people may rejoice in thee?
PSA.85.7	Show us thy mercy, O 
PSA.85.8	I will hear what God the 
PSA.85.9	Surely his saving health is near those that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land.
PSA.85.10	Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
PSA.85.11	Truth shall spring out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from the heavens.
PSA.85.12	The 
PSA.85.13	Righteousness shall go before him and shall set his steps in the way.
PSA.86.1	Bow down thine ear, O 
PSA.86.2	Preserve my soul; for I am merciful, O thou my God, save thy slave that trusts in thee.
PSA.86.3	Be merciful unto me, O Lord, for I cry unto thee daily.
PSA.86.4	Rejoice the soul of thy slave, for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
PSA.86.5	For thou, Lord, art good and ready to forgive and plenteous in mercy unto all those that call upon thee.
PSA.86.6	Give ear, O 
PSA.86.7	In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee, for thou wilt answer me.
PSA.86.8	Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord, neither is there any other who does thy works.
PSA.86.9	All the Gentiles whom thou hast made shall come and humble themselves before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
PSA.86.10	For thou art great and doest wondrous things; thou alone art God.
PSA.86.11	Teach me thy way, O 
PSA.86.12	I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart, and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
PSA.86.13	For great is thy mercy upon me, and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest part of Sheol.
PSA.86.14	O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul and have not set thee before them.
PSA.86.15	But thou, O Lord, art a merciful and gracious God, longsuffering and plenteous in mercy and truth.
PSA.86.16	O look into me and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy slave and keep the son of thine handmaid.
PSA.86.17	Show me a token for good that those who hate me may see it and be ashamed because thou, O 
PSA.87.1	His foundation is in mountains of holiness.
PSA.87.2	The 
PSA.87.3	Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
PSA.87.4	I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to those that know me; behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this one was born there.
PSA.87.5	And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man were born in her; and the highest himself shall establish her.
PSA.87.6	The 
PSA.87.7	And singers and players on instruments in her shall say: all my springs are in thee.
PSA.88.1	O 
PSA.88.2	let my prayer come before thee; incline thine ear unto my cry;
PSA.88.3	for my soul is full of troubles, and my life draws near unto Sheol.
PSA.88.4	I am counted with those that go down into the pit; I am as a man that has no strength:
PSA.88.5	Freed among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou dost remember no more; and they are cut off from thy hand.
PSA.88.6	Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
PSA.88.7	Thy wrath lies hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.
PSA.88.8	Thou hast put away mine acquaintances far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them; I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
PSA.88.9	My eye mourns by reason of affliction; 
PSA.88.10	Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.
PSA.88.11	Shall thy mercy be declared in the grave? or thy truth in hell?
PSA.88.12	Shall thy wonder be known in darkness? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
PSA.88.13	But unto thee have I cried, O 
PSA.88.14	, why dost thou cast off my soul? why dost thou hide thy face from me?
PSA.88.15	I am afflicted and destitute; from my youth up I have feared thee and been in awe of thee.
PSA.88.16	Thy fierce wrath goes over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
PSA.88.17	They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
PSA.88.18	Thou hast put lover and friend far from me, and placed my acquaintances into darkness.
PSA.89.1	I will sing of the mercies of the 
PSA.89.2	For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever in the heavens; in them thou shalt establish thy truth.
PSA.89.3	I have made a covenant with my chosen; I have sworn unto David my slave, saying,
PSA.89.4	Thy seed will I establish for ever and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
PSA.89.5	And the heavens shall praise thy wonder, O 
PSA.89.6	For who in the heavens can be compared unto the 
PSA.89.7	God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints and to be had in reverence of all those that are about him.
PSA.89.8	O 
PSA.89.9	Thou dost rule the raging of the sea: when its waves arise, thou dost still them.
PSA.89.10	Thou hast broken Egypt in pieces as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
PSA.89.11	The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: the world and its fullness, thou didst found.
PSA.89.12	Thou hast created the north and the south; Tabor and Hermon shall sing in thy name.
PSA.89.13	The mighty arm is thine; strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
PSA.89.14	Thy throne is composed of righteousness and judgment; mercy and truth go before thy face.
PSA.89.15	Happy are the people that know how to enter into joy; they shall walk, O 
PSA.89.16	In thy name shall they rejoice each day; and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
PSA.89.17	For thou art the glory of their strength, and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
PSA.89.18	For the 
PSA.89.19	Then thou didst speak in vision to thy holy one and didst say, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of my people.
PSA.89.20	I have found David my slave; I anointed him with the oil of my holiness,
PSA.89.21	with whom my hand shall be established; mine arm also shall strengthen him.
PSA.89.22	The enemy shall not overcome him, nor the son of iniquity break him down.
PSA.89.23	But I will break down his foes before his face and smite those that hate him.
PSA.89.24	But my truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
PSA.89.25	In the same manner I will set his hand also in the sea and his right hand in the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He shall call me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my saving health.
PSA.89.27	Also I will make him my firstborn, high above the kings of the earth.
PSA.89.28	I will keep my mercy for him for ever, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
PSA.89.29	I will also make his seed to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of the heavens.
PSA.89.30	If his sons forsake my law and do not walk in my judgments,
PSA.89.31	if they profane my statutes and do not keep my commandments,
PSA.89.32	then I will visit their rebellion with the rod and their iniquity with stripes.
PSA.89.33	Nevertheless I will not take my mercy from him, neither will I falsify my truth.
PSA.89.34	I will not profane my covenant, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
PSA.89.35	Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
PSA.89.36	His seed shall endure for ever and his throne as the sun before me.
PSA.89.37	It shall be established for ever as the moon and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
PSA.89.38	But thou hast cast off and abhorred thine anointed; thou hast been wroth with him.
PSA.89.39	Thou hast made void the covenant of thy slave; thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
PSA.89.40	Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
PSA.89.41	All that pass by the way spoil him; he is a reproach to his neighbours.
PSA.89.42	Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
PSA.89.43	Thou hast also blunted the edge of his sword and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
PSA.89.44	Thou hast made his clarity to cease and cast his throne down to the ground.
PSA.89.45	The days of his youth hast thou shortened; thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
PSA.89.46	How long, O 
PSA.89.47	Remember how short my time is; why hast thou made all men subject to vanity?
PSA.89.48	What man is he that lives and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of Sheol? Selah.
PSA.89.49	Lord, where are thy former mercies, which thou didst sware unto David in thy truth?
PSA.89.50	Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy slaves; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of many peoples,
PSA.89.51	because thine enemies have dishonoured, O 
PSA.89.52	Blessed be the 
PSA.90.1	Lord, thou hast been our refuge from generation to generation.
PSA.90.2	Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
PSA.90.3	Thou dost turn unto man until he is broken and thou saith, Become converted, ye sons of Adam.
PSA.90.4	For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night.
PSA.90.5	Thou dost cause them to pass by as the waters of a river; they are as a dream, which is strong in the morning like grass.
PSA.90.6	In the morning it blossoms and grows up; in the evening it is cut down and withers.
PSA.90.7	For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath we are troubled.
PSA.90.8	Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
PSA.90.9	For all our days decline because of thy wrath; we end our years according to the word.
PSA.90.10	The days of our years are seventy, and of the most valiant eighty years, yet their strength is labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
PSA.90.11	Who knows the power of thine anger? that thy wrath is not less than our fear.
PSA.90.12	Cause us to learn this that we might number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
PSA.90.13	Return unto us, O 
PSA.90.14	O satisfy us early with thy mercy, and we shall sing and be glad all our days.
PSA.90.15	Make us glad according to the days in which thou hast afflicted us and the years in which we have seen evil.
PSA.90.16	Let thy work appear in thy slaves and thy glory upon their sons.
PSA.90.17	And let the beauty of the 
PSA.91.1	He that dwells in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
PSA.91.2	I will say of the 
PSA.91.3	Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler and from the mortal pestilence.
PSA.91.4	He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings thou shalt be secure: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
PSA.91.5	Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrow that flies by day,
PSA.91.6	nor for the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor for the destruction that wastes at noonday.
PSA.91.7	Thousands shall fall at thy side and ten thousands at thy right hand, but it shall not come near thee.
PSA.91.8	Surely with thine eyes thou shalt behold and see the reward of the wicked.
PSA.91.9	Because thou hast made the 
PSA.91.10	no evil shall befall thee, neither shall any plague come near thy dwelling.
PSA.91.11	For he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways.
PSA.91.12	They shall bear thee up in their hands lest thy foot stumble against a stone.
PSA.91.13	Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder; the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
PSA.91.14	Because he has set his will upon me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high because he has known my name.
PSA.91.15	He shall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and glorify him.
PSA.91.16	With long life I will satisfy him and show him my saving health.
PSA.92.1	It is a good thing to give thanks unto the 
PSA.92.2	To show forth thy mercy in the morning and thy faithfulness every night
PSA.92.3	upon an instrument of ten strings and upon the psaltery, upon the harp with a pleasant sound.
PSA.92.4	For thou, O 
PSA.92.5	O 
PSA.92.6	A carnal man does not know, neither does a fool understand this:
PSA.92.7	The wicked spring forth as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity blossom, so that they shall be destroyed for ever:
PSA.92.8	But thou, O 
PSA.92.9	For, behold, thine enemies, O 
PSA.92.10	But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of a unicorn; I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
PSA.92.11	And my eye saw my desire on my enemies, and my ears heard my desire of those that rose up against me, of the wicked.
PSA.92.12	The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree; he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
PSA.92.13	Those that are planted in the house of the 
PSA.92.14	They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be vigorous and flourishing
PSA.92.15	to show that the 
PSA.93.1	The 
PSA.93.2	From this time on, thy throne shall never be moved; thou art eternal.
PSA.93.3	The rivers have lifted up, O 
PSA.93.4	The 
PSA.93.5	Thy testimonies are very sure; holiness becomes thy house, O 
PSA.94.1	O 
PSA.94.2	Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
PSA.94.3	, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
PSA.94.4	How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
PSA.94.5	They break in pieces thy people, O 
PSA.94.6	They slay the widow and the stranger and murder the fatherless.
PSA.94.7	Yet they say, JAH shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.
PSA.94.8	Understand, ye carnal ones among the people, and, ye fools, when will ye be wise?
PSA.94.9	He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
PSA.94.10	He that chastens the Gentiles, shall he not correct? he that teaches man knowledge, shall not he know?
PSA.94.11	The 
PSA.94.12	Blessed is the man whom thou dost chasten, O JAH, and teach him out of thy law,
PSA.94.13	to cause him to rest in the days of adversity, until the pit is dug for the wicked.
PSA.94.14	For the 
PSA.94.15	But the judgment shall be returned unto righteousness, and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
PSA.94.16	Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
PSA.94.17	Unless the 
PSA.94.18	When I said, My foot slips, thy mercy, O 
PSA.94.19	In the multitude of my thoughts within me, thy comforts delight my soul.
PSA.94.20	Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, who creates toil under the guise of law?
PSA.94.21	They gather themselves together as an army against the life of the righteous and condemn the innocent blood.
PSA.94.22	But the 
PSA.94.23	And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the 
PSA.95.1	O come, let us bring joy unto the 
PSA.95.2	Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving and sing unto him with joy.
PSA.95.3	For the 
PSA.95.4	In his hand are the deep places of the earth; the heights of the mountains are his also.
PSA.95.5	The sea is his, and he made it; and his hands formed the dry land.
PSA.95.6	O come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the 
PSA.95.7	For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture and the sheep of his hand. Today if ye will hear his voice,
PSA.95.8	harden not your heart, as in the provocation and as in the day of trials in the wilderness
PSA.95.9	When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
PSA.95.10	Forty years long I was grieved with this generation and said, It is a people that err from the heart, who have not known my ways;
PSA.95.11	unto whom I swore in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
PSA.96.1	O sing unto the 
PSA.96.2	Sing unto the 
PSA.96.3	Declare his glory among the Gentiles, his wonders among all peoples.
PSA.96.4	For the 
PSA.96.5	For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the 
PSA.96.6	Honour and majesty are before him; strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
PSA.96.7	Give unto the 
PSA.96.8	Give unto the 
PSA.96.9	O worship the 
PSA.96.10	Say among the Gentiles that the 
PSA.96.11	Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar and the fullness thereof.
PSA.96.12	Let the field be joyful and all that is therein; then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
PSA.96.13	before the 
PSA.97.1	The 
PSA.97.2	Clouds and darkness are round about him; righteousness and judgment are the seat of his throne.
PSA.97.3	A fire shall go before him and burn up his enemies round about.
PSA.97.4	His lightnings enlightened the world; the earth saw and trembled.
PSA.97.5	The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the 
PSA.97.6	The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory.
PSA.97.7	Let all those that serve graven images be confounded, those that boast of idols; worship him, all ye gods.
PSA.97.8	Zion heard and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O 
PSA.97.9	For thou, O 
PSA.97.10	Ye that love the 
PSA.97.11	Light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart.
PSA.97.12	Rejoice in the 
PSA.98.1	O sing unto the 
PSA.98.2	The 
PSA.98.3	He has remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel; all the ends of the earth have seen the saving health of our God.
PSA.98.4	Sing with joy unto the 
PSA.98.5	Sing praises unto the 
PSA.98.6	With trumpets and the sound of the shofar make a joyful noise before the 
PSA.98.7	Let the sea roar and the fullness thereof, the world and those that dwell therein.
PSA.98.8	Let the rivers clap their hands; let the mountains be joyful together
PSA.98.9	before the 
PSA.99.1	The 
PSA.99.2	The 
PSA.99.3	Let them praise thy great and terrible name, for it is holy.
PSA.99.4	The king’s strength is that he loves judgment; thou dost establish equity; thou dost execute judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
PSA.99.5	Exalt ye the 
PSA.99.6	Moses and Aaron are among his priests and Samuel among those that call upon his name; they called upon the 
PSA.99.7	He spoke unto them in the pillar of fire; they kept his testimonies and the order that he gave them.
PSA.99.8	Thou didst answer them, O 
PSA.99.9	Exalt the 
PSA.100.1	Make a joyful noise unto the 
PSA.100.2	Serve the 
PSA.100.3	Know ye that the 
PSA.100.4	Enter into his gates with thanksgiving and into his courts with praise; be thankful unto him and bless his name.
PSA.100.5	For the 
PSA.101.1	I will sing of mercy and judgment; unto thee, O 
PSA.101.2	When thou shalt come unto me, I will walk in the way of perfection and understand. I will walk in the midst of my house in the perfection of my heart.
PSA.101.3	I will set nothing of Belial before my eyes: I hate the work of those that betray; it shall not cleave to me.
PSA.101.4	A perverse heart shall depart from me; I will not know a wicked person.
PSA.101.5	Whosoever secretly slanders his neighbour, I will cut off; he that has a high look and a proud heart I will not suffer.
PSA.101.6	My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me; he that walks in the way of perfection, he shall serve me.
PSA.101.7	He that works deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that tells lies shall not tarry in my sight.
PSA.101.8	I will early destroy all the wicked of the land, that I may cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the 
PSA.102.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.102.2	Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me; in the day when I call, answer me speedily.
PSA.102.3	For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as in a hearth.
PSA.102.4	My heart is smitten and withered like grass so that I forget to eat my bread.
PSA.102.5	By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones cleave to my skin.
PSA.102.6	I am like a pelican of the wilderness; I am like an owl of the desert.
PSA.102.7	I watch and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
PSA.102.8	My enemies reproach me all the day, and those that are mad against me are sworn against me.
PSA.102.9	For I have eaten ashes like bread and mingled my drink with weeping,
PSA.102.10	because of thine indignation and thy wrath; for thou hast lifted me up and cast me down.
PSA.102.11	My days are like a shadow that declines, and I am withered like grass.
PSA.102.12	But thou, O 
PSA.102.13	Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion; for the time to favour her, the set time, is come.
PSA.102.14	For thy slaves love her stones and have compassion on the dust thereof.
PSA.102.15	So the Gentiles shall fear the name of the 
PSA.102.16	because the 
PSA.102.17	He shall have regarded the prayer of those who are alone and destitute and not despised their prayer.
PSA.102.18	This shall be written for the generation to come, and the people who shall be created shall praise JAH.
PSA.102.19	For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from the heavens the 
PSA.102.20	to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death,
PSA.102.21	that they might declare the name of the 
PSA.102.22	when the people are gathered together as one and the kingdoms, to serve the 
PSA.102.23	He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
PSA.102.24	I said, O my God, do not cut me off in the midst of my days; thy years are from generation to generation.
PSA.102.25	Of old thou hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
PSA.102.26	They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed:
PSA.102.27	But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
PSA.102.28	The sons of thy slaves shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
PSA.103.1	Bless the 
PSA.103.2	Bless the 
PSA.103.3	Who forgives all thine iniquities; who heals all thy diseases;
PSA.103.4	who redeems thy life from destruction; who crowns thee with mercy and compassion;
PSA.103.5	who satisfies thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle’s.
PSA.103.6	The 
PSA.103.7	He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the sons of Israel.
PSA.103.8	The 
PSA.103.9	He will not always chide, neither will he keep his anger for ever.
PSA.103.10	He has not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
PSA.103.11	For as the heavens are high above the earth so does he increase his mercy over those that fear him.
PSA.103.12	As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our rebellions from us.
PSA.103.13	Like as a father has mercy upon his children, so the 
PSA.103.14	For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust.
PSA.103.15	As for man, his days are as grass; as an open flower of the field, so he blossoms.
PSA.103.16	For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, and its place shall know it no more.
PSA.103.17	But the mercy of the 
PSA.103.18	to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
PSA.103.19	The 
PSA.103.20	Bless the 
PSA.103.21	Bless ye the 
PSA.103.22	Bless the 
PSA.104.1	Bless the 
PSA.104.2	who dost cover thyself with light as with a garment, who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain,
PSA.104.3	who dost establish his chambers between the waters, who makes the clouds his chariot, who walks upon the wings of the wind,
PSA.104.4	who makes his angels spirits, his ministers a flaming fire,
PSA.104.5	who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be moved by any age.
PSA.104.6	Thou didst cover it with the deep as with a garment; the waters stood above the mountains.
PSA.104.7	At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
PSA.104.8	The mountains were exposed; they descended through the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
PSA.104.9	Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over, that they not turn again to cover the earth.
PSA.104.10	Thou art he who sends the springs into the valleys, which run among the mountains.
PSA.104.11	They give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their thirst.
PSA.104.12	Next to them the fowls of the heavens have their habitation; they sing among the leaves.
PSA.104.13	He waters the mountains from his chambers; the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
PSA.104.14	He causes the hay to grow for the cattle and grass for the service of man, that he may bring forth bread out of the earth
PSA.104.15	and wine that makes glad the heart of man, making his face to shine with oil and bread which sustains man’s heart.
PSA.104.16	The trees of the 
PSA.104.17	that the birds may make their nests there: the stork makes her house among the fir trees.
PSA.104.18	The high mountains are a refuge for the wild goats, and the rocks for the conies.
PSA.104.19	He appointed the moon for times and seasons; the sun knows his going down.
PSA.104.20	Thou makest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest move.
PSA.104.21	The young lions roar after their prey and seek their food from God.
PSA.104.22	The sun arises, they withdraw and lay themselves down in their dens.
PSA.104.23	Man goes forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
PSA.104.24	O 
PSA.104.25	So is this great and wide sea, wherein are innumerable creeping things, both small and great beasts.
PSA.104.26	There go the ships; there is that leviathan, whom thou didst make to play therein.
PSA.104.27	These wait all upon thee, that thou may give them their food in due season.
PSA.104.28	Thou givest unto them, they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
PSA.104.29	Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest away their spirit, they cease to exist and return to their dust.
PSA.104.30	Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the earth.
PSA.104.31	Let the glory of the 
PSA.104.32	He looks on the earth, and it trembles: he touches the mountains, and they smoke.
PSA.104.33	I will sing unto the 
PSA.104.34	My meditation of him shall be sweet; I will be glad in the 
PSA.104.35	Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the 
PSA.105.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.105.2	Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him; speak of all his wondrous works.
PSA.105.3	Glory in his holy name; let the heart of those that seek the 
PSA.105.4	Seek the 
PSA.105.5	Remember his marvellous works that he has done, his wonders and the judgments of his mouth,
PSA.105.6	O ye seed of Abraham his slave, ye sons of Jacob his chosen.
PSA.105.7	He is the 
PSA.105.8	He has remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded for a thousand generations,
PSA.105.9	which covenant he made with Abraham and his oath unto Isaac
PSA.105.10	and confirmed the same unto Jacob by decree, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
PSA.105.11	Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance,
PSA.105.12	when they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
PSA.105.13	When they went from nation to nation from one kingdom to another people,
PSA.105.14	he suffered no man to do them wrong; yea, he chastened kings for their sakes:
PSA.105.15	Saying, Touch not mine anointed and do my prophets no harm.
PSA.105.16	Moreover he called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole staff of bread.
PSA.105.17	He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a slave,
PSA.105.18	whose feet they hurt with fetters; his soul was laid in iron.
PSA.105.19	Until the time that his word came, the spoken word of the 
PSA.105.20	The king sent and loosed him, the ruler of the people let him go free.
PSA.105.21	He made him lord of his house and ruler of all his substance:
PSA.105.22	To bind his princes at his pleasure and teach his elders wisdom.
PSA.105.23	Afterwards Israel entered into Egypt, and Jacob was a stranger in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.24	And he increased his people greatly and made them stronger than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	He turned their heart to hate his people to think evil against his slaves.
PSA.105.26	He sent Moses his slave and Aaron whom he had chosen.
PSA.105.27	He put the words of his signs in them and his wonders in the land of Ham.
PSA.105.28	He sent darkness and made it dark, and they did not rebel against his word.
PSA.105.29	He turned their waters into blood and slew their fish.
PSA.105.30	Their land brought forth frogs in abundance in the chambers of their kings.
PSA.105.31	He spoke, and swarms of flies and lice came within all their borders.
PSA.105.32	He turned their rain into hail, into flaming fire in their land.
PSA.105.33	He smote their vines also and their fig trees and broke the trees within their borders.
PSA.105.34	He spoke, and the locusts came and caterpillars without number,
PSA.105.35	and ate up all the grass in their land and devoured the fruit of their ground.
PSA.105.36	He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
PSA.105.37	And he brought them forth with silver and gold, and there was not one sick person among their tribes.
PSA.105.38	Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them fell upon them.
PSA.105.39	He spread a cloud for a covering and fire to give light in the night.
PSA.105.40	The people asked, and he brought quails and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
PSA.105.41	He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places and became a river.
PSA.105.42	For he remembered his holy word with Abraham his slave.
PSA.105.43	And he brought forth his people with joy and his chosen with singing
PSA.105.44	and gave them the lands of the Gentiles, and they inherited the labour of the nations,
PSA.105.45	that they might observe his statutes and keep his laws. Halelu-JAH.
PSA.106.1	Halelu-JAH. O give thanks unto the 
PSA.106.2	Who can utter the mighty acts of the 
PSA.106.3	Happy are those that keep judgment and he that does righteousness at all times.
PSA.106.4	Remember me, O 
PSA.106.5	that I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity; we have done wickedly.
PSA.106.7	Our fathers did not understand thy wonders in Egypt; they did not remember the multitude of thy mercies but rebelled by the sea, even at the Red sea.
PSA.106.8	Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
PSA.106.9	He reprehended the Red sea also, and it was dried up, so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
PSA.106.10	And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
PSA.106.11	And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
PSA.106.12	Then they believed his words; they sang his praise.
PSA.106.13	They became rash. They soon forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel:
PSA.106.14	They gave themselves over to lust in the wilderness and tempted God in the desert.
PSA.106.15	And he gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
PSA.106.16	Then they envied Moses in the camp and Aaron the saint of the 
PSA.106.17	The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the company of Abiram.
PSA.106.18	And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
PSA.106.19	They made a calf in Horeb and worshipped the molten image.
PSA.106.20	Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot the God of their saving health, who had done great things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things upon the Red sea.
PSA.106.23	Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath lest he should destroy them.
PSA.106.24	And they despised the pleasant land; they did not believe his word:
PSA.106.25	But murmured in their tents and did not hearken unto the voice of the 
PSA.106.26	Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness,
PSA.106.27	to overthrow their seed also among the Gentiles, and to scatter them in the lands.
PSA.106.28	They also joined themselves unto Baalpeor and ate the sacrifices for the dead.
PSA.106.29	Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions; and the plague broke in upon them.
PSA.106.30	Then Phinehas stood up and executed judgment, and so the plague was stayed.
PSA.106.31	And that was counted unto him for righteousness from generation to generation for evermore.
PSA.106.32	They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
PSA.106.33	Because they provoked his spirit to rebel, and he spoke it with his lips.
PSA.106.34	They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the 
PSA.106.35	But were mingled among the Gentiles and learned their works.
PSA.106.36	And they served their idols, which were a snare unto them.
PSA.106.37	Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils
PSA.106.38	and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; and the land was polluted with blood.
PSA.106.39	Thus they were defiled with their own works and went a whoring with their own inventions.
PSA.106.40	Therefore was the wrath of the 
PSA.106.41	And he gave them into the hand of the Gentiles, and those that hated them ruled over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
PSA.106.43	He delivered them many times, but they rebelled at his counsel and were brought low for their iniquity.
PSA.106.44	Nevertheless he would look upon their affliction and hear their cry
PSA.106.45	and remember his covenant with them and repent according to the multitude of his mercies.
PSA.106.46	He also caused those that carried them captives to have mercy upon them.
PSA.106.47	Save us, O 
PSA.106.48	Blessed be the 
PSA.107.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.107.2	Let the redeemed of the 
PSA.107.3	and gathered them out of the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south.
PSA.107.4	They wandered lost in the wilderness, alone and out of the way; they found no city to dwell in.
PSA.107.5	Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
PSA.107.6	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.7	And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
PSA.107.8	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.9	For he satisfies the soul that is destitute and fills the hungry soul with goodness.
PSA.107.10	Such as sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and in irons,
PSA.107.11	because they rebelled against the words of God and condemned the counsel of the most High:
PSA.107.12	Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was no one to help.
PSA.107.13	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death and broke their bonds asunder.
PSA.107.15	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.16	For he has broken the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron asunder.
PSA.107.17	The fools, because of the way of their rebellion, and because of their iniquities, were afflicted.
PSA.107.18	Their soul abhorred all manner of food, and they drew near unto the gates of death.
PSA.107.19	Then they cried unto the 
PSA.107.20	He sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their graves.
PSA.107.21	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.22	And let them offer the sacrifices of praise and publish his works with singing.
PSA.107.23	Those that go down to the sea in ships that do work in many waters,
PSA.107.24	these have seen the works of the 
PSA.107.25	For he commands and raises the stormy wind, which lifts up its waves.
PSA.107.26	They mount up to the heavens; they go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble.
PSA.107.27	They reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man, and all of their knowledge is of no avail.
PSA.107.28	Then they cry unto the 
PSA.107.29	He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
PSA.107.30	Then they are glad because they are at rest; so he brings them into the haven of his will.
PSA.107.31	Oh that men would praise the 
PSA.107.32	Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He turned rivers into a wilderness and the watersprings into dry ground;
PSA.107.34	the fruitful land into salt flats, because of the wickedness of those that dwell therein.
PSA.107.35	He turns the wilderness into reservoirs of water and dry ground into watersprings.
PSA.107.36	And there he makes the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation
PSA.107.37	and sow the fields and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
PSA.107.38	He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly and suffers not their cattle to decrease.
PSA.107.39	Again, they are diminished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
PSA.107.40	He pours contempt upon princes and causes them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
PSA.107.41	Yet he sets the poor on high from affliction and makes his families like a flock.
PSA.107.42	The righteous shall see it and rejoice, and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
PSA.107.43	Who is wise and will observe these things and shall understand the mercies of the 
PSA.108.1	O God, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise; this is my glory.
PSA.108.2	Awake, psaltery and harp; I will awake the dawn.
PSA.108.3	I will praise thee, O 
PSA.108.4	For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth reaches unto the heavens.
PSA.108.5	Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens and thy glory above all the earth;
PSA.108.6	that thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
PSA.108.7	God has spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem and mete out the valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead shall be mine; Manasseh shall be mine; Ephraim also shall be the strength of my head; Judah shall be my lawgiver;
PSA.108.9	Moab shall be my washpot; over Edom I will cast my shoe; over Philistia I will triumph.
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
PSA.108.11	Surely thou, O God, who had cast us off and did not, O God, go forth with our hosts.
PSA.108.12	Give us help from trouble; for the salvation of man is deception.
PSA.108.13	Through God we shall do valiantly, for he shall tread down our enemies again.
PSA.109.1	Do not hold thy peace, O God of my praise;
PSA.109.2	for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me; they have spoken of me with a lying tongue.
PSA.109.3	They compassed me about with words of hatred and fought against me without a cause.
PSA.109.4	They have responded to my love by becoming my adversaries, but I give myself unto prayer.
PSA.109.5	And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
PSA.109.6	Set thou the wicked man over him, and let Satan stand at his right hand.
PSA.109.7	When he shall be judged, let him be condemned, and let his prayer become sin.
PSA.109.8	Let his days be few, and let another take his office.
PSA.109.9	Let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Let his children be continually vagabonds and beg; let them seek their bread out of their desolate places.
PSA.109.11	Let the extortioner catch all that he has, and let the strangers spoil his labour.
PSA.109.12	Let there be no one to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.
PSA.109.13	Let his posterity be cut off, and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
PSA.109.14	Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the 
PSA.109.15	Let them be before the 
PSA.109.16	Because he did not remember to show mercy but persecuted the man who is poor in spirit and destitute and broken in heart, that he might slay him.
PSA.109.17	As he loved the curse, so let it come unto him; as he delighted not in the blessing, so let it be far from him.
PSA.109.18	As he clothed himself with the curse like as with his garment, and it entered into his bowels like water and like oil into his bones.
PSA.109.19	Let it be unto him as the garment which covers him and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
PSA.109.20	Let this be the reward from the 
PSA.109.21	And thou, O GOD the Lord, do unto me for thy name’s sake; because thy mercy is good, deliver me.
PSA.109.22	For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
PSA.109.23	I am gone like the shadow when it declines; I am tossed up and down by the wind as the locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak through fasting, and my flesh fails for lack of fatness.
PSA.109.25	I have become a reproach unto them; when they looked upon me they shook their heads.
PSA.109.26	Help me, O 
PSA.109.27	that they may know that this is thy hand, that thou, O 
PSA.109.28	Let them curse, but bless thou; when they arise, let them be ashamed, but let thy slave rejoice.
PSA.109.29	Let those who speak evil against me falsely be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion as with a mantle.
PSA.109.30	I will greatly praise the 
PSA.109.31	For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor in spirit to save his soul from those that judge him.
PSA.110.1	The 
PSA.110.2	The 
PSA.110.3	Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauty of holiness; as the dew which falls from the womb of the morning, thus shall those who are thine be born unto thee.
PSA.110.4	The 
PSA.110.5	The Lord at thy right hand shall smite the kings in the day of his wrath.
PSA.110.6	He shall judge among the Gentiles; he shall fill their places with dead bodies; he shall wound the head over much of the earth.
PSA.110.7	He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore he shall lift up his head.
PSA.111.1	Aleph Halelu-JAH. I will praise the 
PSA.111.2	Gimel The works of the 
PSA.111.3	He Honor and beauty are his work; Vau and his righteousness endures for ever.

PSA.112.1	Aleph Halelu-JAH. Blessed is the man that fears the 
PSA.112.2	Gimel His seed shall be mighty upon earth; Daleth the generation of the upright shall be blessed.

PSA.112.4	Zain A light has shined in the darkness upon the upright: Cheth Gracious and merciful and righteous.
PSA.112.5	Teth A good man has mercy and lends; Jod He will govern his affairs with good judgment.
PSA.112.6	Caph Surely he shall not be moved for ever; Lamed the righteous shall be in eternal remembrance.
PSA.112.7	Mem He shall not be afraid of evil rumours; Nun his heart is fixed, trusting in the 
PSA.112.8	Samech His heart is established; he shall not be afraid, Ain until he sees his desire upon his enemies.
PSA.112.9	Pe He has dispersed; he has given to the poor; Tzaddi his righteousness endures for ever; Koph his horn shall be exalted in glory.
PSA.112.10	Resh The wicked shall see it and be furious; Schin he shall gnash with his teeth and waste away: Tau The desire of the wicked shall perish.
PSA.113.1	Halelu-JAH. Praise, O ye slaves of the 
PSA.113.2	Blessed be the name of the 
PSA.113.3	From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, the 
PSA.113.4	The 
PSA.113.5	Who is like unto the 
PSA.113.6	who humbles himself to behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth!
PSA.113.7	He raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts the destitute out of the dunghill;
PSA.113.8	that he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his people.
PSA.113.9	He makes the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of sons. Halelu-JAH.
PSA.114.1	When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
PSA.114.2	Judah was his holiness, and Israel his dominion.
PSA.114.3	The sea saw it and fled; Jordan was driven back.
PSA.114.4	The mountains skipped like rams and the little hills like lambs.
PSA.114.5	What came upon thee, O thou sea, that thou didst flee? And thou O Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
PSA.114.6	Ye mountains, why didst ye skip like rams and ye little hills, like lambs?
PSA.114.7	At the presence of the Lord, the earth trembles, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
PSA.114.8	who turned the rock into a reservoir of water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
PSA.115.1	Not unto us, O 
PSA.115.2	Why should the Gentiles say, Where is now their God?
PSA.115.3	But our God is in the heavens; he has made whatever he has desired.
PSA.115.4	Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
PSA.115.5	They have mouths, but they shall never speak; they have eyes, but they shall never see:
PSA.115.6	They have ears, but they shall never hear; they have noses, but they shall never smell;
PSA.115.7	they have hands, but they shall never touch; they have feet, but they shall never walk; they shall never speak through their throat.
PSA.115.8	Let those that make them become like unto them, and every one that trusts in them.
PSA.115.9	O Israel, trust thou in the 
PSA.115.10	O house of Aaron, trust in the 
PSA.115.11	Ye that fear the 
PSA.115.12	The 
PSA.115.13	He will bless those that fear the 
PSA.115.14	The 
PSA.115.15	Ye are blessed of the 
PSA.115.16	The heavens are the heavens of the 
PSA.115.17	The dead shall not praise JAH, neither any that go down into silence.
PSA.115.18	But we will bless JAH from this time forth and for evermore. Halelu-JAH.
PSA.116.1	I love the 
PSA.116.2	Because he has inclined his ear unto me, therefore I will call upon him all of my days.
PSA.116.3	The sorrows of death compassed me and the pains of Sheol found me; I encountered trouble and sorrow.
PSA.116.4	Then I called upon the name of the 
PSA.116.5	Gracious is the 
PSA.116.6	The 
PSA.116.7	Return unto thy rest, O my soul, for the 
PSA.116.8	For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
PSA.116.9	I will walk before the 
PSA.116.10	I believed, therefore I spoke, and was greatly afflicted;
PSA.116.11	I said in my haste, All men are liars.
PSA.116.12	What shall I render unto the 
PSA.116.13	I will take the cup of saving health and invoke the name of the 
PSA.116.14	I will pay my vows unto the 
PSA.116.15	Precious in the sight of the 
PSA.116.16	This is so, O 
PSA.116.17	I will offer unto thee the sacrifice of praise and will invoke the name of the 
PSA.116.18	I will pay my vows unto the 
PSA.116.19	in the courts of the 
PSA.117.1	O praise the 
PSA.117.2	For he has greatly increased his mercy upon us; and the truth of the 
PSA.118.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.118.2	Let Israel now say that his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.118.3	Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.118.4	Let those that fear the 
PSA.118.5	From a tight place I called upon JAH; and JAH answered me and set me in a wide place.
PSA.118.6	The 
PSA.118.7	The 
PSA.118.8	It is better to wait upon the 
PSA.118.9	It is better to trust in the 
PSA.118.10	All the nations compassed me about; but in the name of the 
PSA.118.11	They compassed me about; yea, they laid hold of me; but in the name of the 
PSA.118.12	They compassed me about like bees; they were quenched as the fire of thorns; for in the name of the 
PSA.118.13	Thou hast thrust at me with violence that I might fall, but the 
PSA.118.14	JAH is my strength and song and is become my saving health.
PSA.118.15	The voice of singing and saving health is in the tents of the righteous; the right hand of the 
PSA.118.16	The right hand of the 
PSA.118.17	I shall not die, but live and declare the works of JAH.
PSA.118.18	JAH has chastened me sore, but he has not given me over unto death.
PSA.118.19	Open unto me the gates of righteousness; I will go in through them; I will praise JAH.
PSA.118.20	This gate is of the 
PSA.118.21	I will praise thee; for thou hast heard me and art become my saving health.
PSA.118.22	The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner.
PSA.118.23	This is the 
PSA.118.24	This is the day which the 
PSA.118.25	Save now, I beseech thee, O 
PSA.118.26	Blessed be he that comes in the name of the 
PSA.118.27	God is the 
PSA.118.28	Thou art my God, and I will praise thee; thou art my God, I will exalt thee.
PSA.118.29	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.119.1	ALEPH. Blessed are those who walk in the perfect way, who walk in the law of the 
PSA.119.2	Blessed are those that keep his testimonies and that seek him with their whole heart.
PSA.119.3	For those who do no iniquity walk in his ways.
PSA.119.4	Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.
PSA.119.5	O that my ways were ordered to keep thy statutes!
PSA.119.6	Then I shall not be ashamed, when I have insight unto all thy commandments.
PSA.119.7	I will praise thee with uprightness of heart when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.
PSA.119.8	I will keep thy statutes; O do not utterly forsake me.
PSA.119.9	BETH. With what shall a young man cleanse his way? when he shall keep thy word.
PSA.119.10	With my whole heart I have sought thee; O let me not err from thy commandments.
PSA.119.11	Thy spoken word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee.
PSA.119.12	Blessed art thou, O 
PSA.119.13	With my lips I have declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
PSA.119.14	I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies as above all riches.
PSA.119.15	I will meditate in thy precepts and consider thy ways.
PSA.119.16	I will delight myself in thy statutes; I will not forget thy words.
PSA.119.17	GIMEL. Deal bountifully with thy slave that I may live and keep thy word.
PSA.119.18	Open my eyes, and I shall behold the wonders of thy law.
PSA.119.19	I am a stranger in the earth; hide not thy commandments from me.
PSA.119.20	My soul is broken from desiring thy judgments at all times.
PSA.119.21	Thou hast reprehended the proud; cursed are those who err from thy commandments.
PSA.119.22	Remove from me reproach and contempt, for I have kept thy testimonies.
PSA.119.23	Princes also sat and spoke against me as thy slave spoke according to thy statutes.
PSA.119.24	For thy testimonies are my delight and my counsellors.
PSA.119.25	DALETH. My soul cleaves unto the dust; quicken me according to thy word.
PSA.119.26	I have declared my ways, and thou didst hear me; teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.27	Make me to understand the way of thy precepts; so I shall meditate of thy wondrous works.
PSA.119.28	My soul melts for heaviness; strengthen me according to thy word.
PSA.119.29	Remove from me the way of lying, and from thy law grant me mercy.
PSA.119.30	I have chosen the way of truth; I have laid thy judgments before me.
PSA.119.31	I have stuck unto thy testimonies; O 
PSA.119.32	I will run the way of thy commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart.
PSA.119.33	HE. Teach me, O 
PSA.119.34	Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.
PSA.119.35	Make me to go in the path of thy commandments, for therein do I delight.
PSA.119.36	Incline my heart unto thy testimonies and not to covetousness.
PSA.119.37	Turn away my eyes from beholding vanity, and cause me to live in thy way.
PSA.119.38	Confirm thy word unto thy slave, who is devoted to thy fear.
PSA.119.39	Turn away my reproach which I have feared, for thy judgments are good.
PSA.119.40	Behold, I have longed after thy precepts; cause me to live in thy righteousness.
PSA.119.41	VAU. Let thy mercy come unto me, O 
PSA.119.42	And I shall answer him that reproaches me, by saying that I trust in thy word.
PSA.119.43	And take not at any time the word of truth out of my mouth; for I wait for thy judgment.
PSA.119.44	So shall I keep thy law continually from age to age.
PSA.119.45	And I will walk at liberty, for I sought thy commandments.
PSA.119.46	I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings and will not be ashamed.
PSA.119.47	And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.
PSA.119.48	I will lift up My hands unto thy commandments, which I have loved, and I will meditate in thy statutes.
PSA.119.49	ZAIN. Remember the word unto thy slave, in which thou hast caused me to wait.
PSA.119.50	This is my comfort in my affliction; for thy spoken word has caused me to live.
PSA.119.51	The proud have had me greatly in derision; yet I have not deviated from thy law.
PSA.119.52	I remembered thy judgments of old, O 
PSA.119.53	Horror has taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
PSA.119.54	Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
PSA.119.55	I have remembered thy name, O 
PSA.119.56	This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
PSA.119.57	CHETH My portion, O 
PSA.119.58	I intreated thy presence with my whole heart; be merciful unto me according to thy word.
PSA.119.59	I considered my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
PSA.119.60	I made haste and did not delay to keep thy commandments.
PSA.119.61	The company of the wicked have robbed me, but I have not forgotten thy law.
PSA.119.62	At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of the judgments of thy righteousness.
PSA.119.63	I am a companion of all those that fear thee and of those that keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.64	The earth, O 
PSA.119.65	TETH. Thou hast dealt well with thy slave, O 
PSA.119.66	which teaches me discernment and knowledge, for I have believed thy commandments.
PSA.119.67	Before I was humbled, I went into error, but now I keep thy spoken word.
PSA.119.68	Thou art good and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.69	The proud have forged a lie against me, but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.
PSA.119.70	Their heart became fat like grease, but I delight in thy law.
PSA.119.71	It was good for me that I have been humbled, that I might learn thy statutes.
PSA.119.72	The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.
PSA.119.73	JOD. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me; give me understanding, and I shall learn thy commandments.
PSA.119.74	Those that fear thee will be glad when they see me because I have waited on thy word.
PSA.119.75	I know, O 
PSA.119.76	Let, I pray thee, thy mercy be for my comfort, according to thy spoken word unto thy slave.
PSA.119.77	Let thy mercy come unto me, that I may live, for thy law is my delight.
PSA.119.78	Let the proud be ashamed, for they dealt perversely with me without a cause, but I will meditate in thy precepts.
PSA.119.79	Let those that fear thee turn unto me and those that have known thy testimonies.
PSA.119.80	Let my heart be perfect in thy statutes that I not be ashamed.
PSA.119.81	CAPH. My soul faints with desire for thy salvation as I await thy word.
PSA.119.82	Mine eyes fail for thy spoken word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
PSA.119.83	For I am become like a wine skin in the smoke; yet I have not forgotten thy statutes.
PSA.119.84	How many are the days of thy slave? When wilt thou execute judgment on those that persecute me?
PSA.119.85	The proud have dug pits for me, but they do not proceed according to thy law.
PSA.119.86	All thy commandments are of the same truth; they persecute me wrongfully; help me.
PSA.119.87	They have almost consumed me upon earth, but I have not forsaken thy precepts.
PSA.119.88	Cause me to live according to thy mercy, so I shall keep the testimony of thy mouth.
PSA.119.89	LAMED. For ever, O 
PSA.119.90	Thy truth is from generation to generation; thou hast established the earth, and it perseveres.
PSA.119.91	They persevere unto this day by thy ordinance; for they are all thy slaves.
PSA.119.92	Unless thy law had been my delight, I should have perished in my affliction.
PSA.119.93	I will never forget thy precepts; for with them thou hast caused me to live.
PSA.119.94	I am thine, keep me; for I have sought thy precepts.
PSA.119.95	The wicked have waited for me to destroy me, but I will consider thy testimonies.
PSA.119.96	I have seen an end of all perfection, but thy commandment is exceeding broad.
PSA.119.97	MEM. O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.
PSA.119.98	Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies, for they are eternal unto me.
PSA.119.99	I have more understanding than all my teachers, for thy testimonies have been my meditation.
PSA.119.100	I understand more than the elders because I keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.101	I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.
PSA.119.102	I have not departed from thy judgments, for thou hast taught me.
PSA.119.103	How sweet have been thy spoken words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
PSA.119.104	Through thy precepts I have obtained understanding; therefore I have hated every false way.
PSA.119.105	NUN. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my way.
PSA.119.106	I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep the judgments of thy righteousness.
PSA.119.107	I am afflicted very much; cause me to live, O 
PSA.119.108	Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O 
PSA.119.109	My soul is continually in my hand; yet I do not forget thy law.
PSA.119.110	The wicked have laid a snare for me; yet did not I err from thy precepts.
PSA.119.111	I have taken thy testimonies as a heritage for ever; for they are the rejoicing of my heart.
PSA.119.112	I have inclined my heart to perform thy statutes always, even unto the end.
PSA.119.113	SAMECH. I hate vain thoughts; but I love thy law.
PSA.119.114	Thou art my hiding place and my shield; I have waited for thy word.
PSA.119.115	Depart from me, ye evildoers; for I will keep the commandments of my God.
PSA.119.116	Uphold me according unto thy word, and I shall live; and let me not be ashamed of my hope.
PSA.119.117	Hold me up, and I shall be saved, and I shall delight in thy statutes continually.
PSA.119.118	Thou hast trodden down all those that err from thy statutes; for their deceit is falsehood.
PSA.119.119	Thou dost cause all the wicked of the earth to come undone like dross; therefore I have loved thy testimonies.
PSA.119.120	My flesh trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgments.
PSA.119.121	AIN. I have complied with judgment and righteousness; do not leave me to my oppressors.
PSA.119.122	Be surety for thy slave for good; do not let the proud do violence unto me.
PSA.119.123	Mine eyes fail for thy saving health and for the spoken word of thy righteousness.
PSA.119.124	Deal with thy slave according to thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.125	I am thy slave; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.
PSA.119.126	It is time for thee, O 
PSA.119.127	Therefore I have loved thy commandments above gold, yea, above fine gold.
PSA.119.128	Therefore I have esteemed all thy precepts concerning all things to be right and I have hated every false way.
PSA.119.129	PE. Thy testimonies are wonderful; therefore does my soul keep them.
PSA.119.130	The exposition of thy words gives light; it gives understanding unto the simple.
PSA.119.131	I opened my mouth and panted; for I longed for thy commandments.
PSA.119.132	Look thou upon me and be merciful unto me, as thou didst use to do unto those that love thy name.
PSA.119.133	Order my steps with thy word; and let not any iniquity have dominion over me.
PSA.119.134	Ransom me from the violence of men, and I will keep thy precepts.
PSA.119.135	Make thy face to shine upon thy slave and teach me thy statutes.
PSA.119.136	Rivers of waters ran down my eyes because they did not keep thy law.
PSA.119.137	TZADDI. Righteous art thou, O 
PSA.119.138	Thou hast commanded righteousness, which consists of thy testimonies and thy truth.
PSA.119.139	My zeal has consumed me, because my enemies have forgotten thy words.
PSA.119.140	Thy word is very pure; therefore thy slave loves it.
PSA.119.141	I am small and despised; yet I have not forgotten thy precepts.
PSA.119.142	Thy righteousness is eternal righteousness, and thy law is the truth.
PSA.119.143	Trouble and anguish found me; but thy commandments were my delights.
PSA.119.144	Thy testimonies are eternal righteousness; give me understanding, and I shall live.
PSA.119.145	KOPH. I cried with my whole heart; answer me, O 
PSA.119.146	I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
PSA.119.147	I arose before the dawning of the morning and cried: I waited in thy word.
PSA.119.148	My eyes anticipate the night watches that I might meditate in thy spoken word.
PSA.119.149	Hear my voice according to thy mercy; O 
PSA.119.150	Those that persecute me draw near unto evil; they have strayed from thy law.
PSA.119.151	Thou art near, O 
PSA.119.152	Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.
PSA.119.153	RESH. Consider my affliction and deliver me; for I have not forgotten thy law.
PSA.119.154	Plead my cause and redeem me; quicken me according to thy spoken word.
PSA.119.155	Saving health is far from the wicked, for they do not seek thy statutes.
PSA.119.156	Many are thy tender mercies, O 
PSA.119.157	Many are my persecutors and my enemies; yet I do not deviate from thy testimonies.
PSA.119.158	I beheld the transgressors and was grieved because they did not keep thy words.
PSA.119.159	Consider, O 
PSA.119.160	The beginning of thy word is truth, and every one of the judgments of thy righteousness is eternal.
PSA.119.161	SCHIN. Princes have persecuted me without a cause, but my heart stands in awe of thy words.
PSA.119.162	I rejoice at thy spoken word, as one that finds great spoil.
PSA.119.163	I hate and abhor lying, but I love thy law.
PSA.119.164	Seven times a day do I praise thee because of the judgments of thy righteousness.
PSA.119.165	Those who love thy law have great peace, and nothing shall cause them to stumble.
PSA.119.166	, I have waited for thy saving health and done thy commandments.
PSA.119.167	My soul has kept thy testimonies, and I have loved them exceedingly.
PSA.119.168	I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies, for all my ways are before thee.
PSA.119.169	TAU. Let my cry come near before thee, O 
PSA.119.170	Let my supplication come before thee; deliver me according to thy spoken word.
PSA.119.171	My lips shall overflow with praise when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
PSA.119.172	My tongue shall speak thy words; for all thy commandments are righteousness.
PSA.119.173	Let thine hand help me, for I have chosen thy precepts.
PSA.119.174	I have longed for thy saving health, O 
PSA.119.175	Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee, and let thy judgments help me.
PSA.119.176	I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy slave; for I have not forgotten thy commandments.
PSA.120.1	In my distress I cried unto the 
PSA.120.2	Deliver my soul, O 
PSA.120.3	What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
PSA.120.4	Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
PSA.120.5	Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
PSA.120.6	My soul has long dwelt with those that hate peace.
PSA.120.7	I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
PSA.121.1	I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains, from whence cometh my help.
PSA.121.2	My help comes from the 
PSA.121.3	He will not suffer thy foot to be moved; he that keeps thee will not slumber.
PSA.121.4	Behold, he that keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
PSA.121.5	The 
PSA.121.6	The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
PSA.121.7	The 
PSA.121.8	The 
PSA.122.1	I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the 
PSA.122.2	Our feet stood within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem, that one which is built as a city that is well united together
PSA.122.4	Because the tribes went up there, the tribes of JAH, the testimony to Israel, to praise the name of the 
PSA.122.5	For there are set thrones of the judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
PSA.122.6	Pray for the peace of Jerusalem; those that love thee shall be brought into rest.
PSA.122.7	Peace be within thy walls and rest within thy palaces.
PSA.122.8	For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.
PSA.122.9	Because of the house of the 
PSA.123.1	Unto thee I lift up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
PSA.123.2	Behold, as the eyes of slaves look unto the hand of their masters and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress, so our eyes wait upon the 
PSA.123.3	Have mercy upon us, O 
PSA.123.4	Our soul is exceedingly weary of the scorning of those that are at ease and of the contempt of the proud.
PSA.124.1	If the 
PSA.124.2	If the 
PSA.124.3	then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us;
PSA.124.4	then the waters would have overwhelmed us; the flood would have gone over our soul;
PSA.124.5	then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
PSA.124.6	Blessed be the 
PSA.124.7	Our soul has escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers; the snare has broken, and we are escaped.
PSA.124.8	Our help is in the name of the 
PSA.125.1	Those that trust in the 
PSA.125.2	As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the 
PSA.125.3	For the rod of wickedness shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous because the righteous shall not put forth their hands unto iniquity.
PSA.125.4	Do good, O 
PSA.125.5	As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the 
PSA.126.1	When the 
PSA.126.2	Then our mouth shall be filled with laughter and our tongue with singing; then they shall say among the Gentiles, The 
PSA.126.3	The 
PSA.126.4	Turn again our captivity, O 
PSA.126.5	Those that sow with tears shall reap with joy.
PSA.126.6	He that goes forth and weeps, bearing the precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
PSA.127.1	Unless the 
PSA.127.2	It is vain for you to rise up early, to come home late, to eat the bread of sorrows, because he shall give his beloved sleep.
PSA.127.3	Behold, sons are a heritage of the 
PSA.127.4	As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the young men.
PSA.127.5	Happy is the man that has filled his quiver with them: he shall not be ashamed when he speaks with the enemies in the gate.
PSA.128.1	Blessed is every one that fears the 
PSA.128.2	When thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands; happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
PSA.128.3	Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thy house; thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
PSA.128.4	Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that fears the 
PSA.128.5	The 
PSA.128.6	Yea, thou shalt see thy children’s children and peace upon Israel.
PSA.129.1	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say:
PSA.129.2	Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth; yet they have not prevailed against me.
PSA.129.3	The plowers plowed upon my back; they made long their furrows.
PSA.129.4	The 
PSA.129.5	All those that hate Zion shall all be confounded and turned back.
PSA.129.6	They shall be as the grass upon the housetops, which withers before it grows up,
PSA.129.7	with which the reaper does not fill his hand nor he that binds sheaves his bosom.
PSA.129.8	Neither did those who go by say, The blessing of the 
PSA.130.1	Out of the depths I cry unto thee, O 
PSA.130.2	Lord, hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
PSA.130.3	If thou, O 
PSA.130.4	Therefore there is forgiveness close to thee, that thou may be feared.
PSA.130.5	I have waited for the 
PSA.130.6	My soul has waited for the Lord more than those that watch for the morning: I say, more than those that watch for the morning.
PSA.130.7	Let Israel wait for the 
PSA.130.8	And he shall ransom Israel from all his sins.
PSA.131.1	, my heart has not become haughty, nor mine eyes lofty; neither have I walked in grandeur, nor in wonderful things above and beyond that which pertains to me.
PSA.131.2	Rather I have quieted myself and caused my soul to become silent, that I might be as a child that is weaned of his mother, as one who is weaned from my own life.
PSA.131.3	Let Israel wait for the 
PSA.132.1	A Song of degrees. 
PSA.132.2	How he swore unto the 
PSA.132.3	surely I will not come into the habitation of my house nor go up into my bed,
PSA.132.4	I will not give sleep to my eyes or slumber to my eyelids,
PSA.132.5	until I find out a place for the 
PSA.132.6	Behold, we heard of her in Ephratah; we found her in the fields of the wood.
PSA.132.7	We will go into his tents; we will worship at his footstool.
PSA.132.8	Arise, O 
PSA.132.9	Thy priests are clothed with righteousness, and thy merciful ones shout for joy.
PSA.132.10	For the love of thy slave David, do not turn away thy face from thine anointed.
PSA.132.11	The 
PSA.132.12	If thy sons will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their sons shall also sit upon thy throne for ever.
PSA.132.13	For the 
PSA.132.14	This shall be my rest for ever; here I will dwell; for I have desired her.
PSA.132.15	I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.
PSA.132.16	I will also clothe her priests with saving health, and her merciful ones shall shout aloud for joy.
PSA.132.17	There will I make the horn of David to bud; I have ordained a lamp for my anointed.
PSA.132.18	His enemies I will clothe with shame, but upon himself shall his crown blossom.
PSA.133.1	Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
PSA.133.2	It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that runs down upon the beard, even Aaron’s beard, that goes down to the skirts of his garments;
PSA.133.3	as the dew of Hermon, that descends upon the mountains of Zion; for there the 
PSA.134.1	Behold, bless ye the 
PSA.134.2	Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the 
PSA.134.3	The 
PSA.135.1	Halelu-JAH. Praise ye the name of the 
PSA.135.2	Ye that stand in the house of the 
PSA.135.3	praise JAH; for the 
PSA.135.4	For JAH has chosen Jacob unto himself and Israel for his own possession.
PSA.135.5	For I know that the 
PSA.135.6	Whatever the 
PSA.135.7	He who causes the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth, made the lightnings in the rain; he who brings the winds out of his treasuries.
PSA.135.8	He who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast;
PSA.135.9	sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his slaves.
PSA.135.10	He who smote many Gentiles and slew mighty kings,
PSA.135.11	Sihon king of the Amorites and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan
PSA.135.12	gave their land for a heritage, a heritage unto Israel his people.
PSA.135.13	Thy name, O 
PSA.135.14	For the 
PSA.135.15	The idols of the Gentiles are silver and gold, the work of men’s hands.
PSA.135.16	They have a mouth, but they do not speak; they have eyes, but they do not see;
PSA.135.17	they have ears, but they do not hear; neither is there any spirit in their mouths.
PSA.135.18	Let those that make them become like unto them and every one that trusts in them.
PSA.135.19	Bless the 
PSA.135.20	Bless the 
PSA.135.21	Blessed be the 
PSA.136.1	O give thanks unto the 
PSA.136.2	O give thanks unto the God of gods, for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.3	O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.4	To the only one who does great wonders: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.5	To him that by intelligence made the heavens: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.6	To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.7	To him that made the great lights: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.8	The sun to rule in the day: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.9	The moon and stars to rule in the night: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.10	To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.11	And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.12	With a strong hand and with a stretched out arm: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.13	To him who divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.14	And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.15	But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.16	To him who led his people through the wilderness: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.17	To him who smote great kings: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.18	And slew powerful kings: for his mercy endures for ever,
PSA.136.19	Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.20	And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.21	And gave their land for an inheritance: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.22	Even an inheritance unto Israel his slave: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.23	Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endures for ever:
PSA.136.24	And has redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.25	Who gives food to all flesh: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.136.26	O give thanks unto the God of the heavens: for his mercy endures for ever.
PSA.137.1	By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
PSA.137.2	We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof;
PSA.137.3	when there, those that carried us away captive asked us for the words of the song; with our harps of joy hung upon the willows saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
PSA.137.4	How shall we sing the song of the 
PSA.137.5	If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, my right hand shall be forgotten.
PSA.137.6	If I do not remember thee, my tongue shall cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I do not prefer to lift up Jerusalem as my chief joy.
PSA.137.7	Remember, O 
PSA.137.8	O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewards thee as thou hast served us.
PSA.137.9	Happy shall he be, that takes and dashes thy offspring against the stones.
PSA.138.1	I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods I will sing praises unto thee.
PSA.138.2	I will worship the temple of thy holiness and praise thy name above thy mercy and thy truth; for thou hast made thy name to be magnificent and raised up thy spoken word above all things.
PSA.138.3	In the day when I called, thou didst answer me and strengthen me with strength in my soul.
PSA.138.4	All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O 
PSA.138.5	Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the 
PSA.138.6	For the 
PSA.138.7	Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me; thou shalt stretch forth thy hand against the wrath of my enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.
PSA.138.8	The 
PSA.139.1	O 
PSA.139.2	Thou knowest my sitting down and my rising up, thou dost understand my thoughts from afar.
PSA.139.3	Thou hast girded my walk and my rest, and hast prepared all my ways.
PSA.139.4	For the word is not even upon my tongue, and, behold, O 
PSA.139.5	Thou hast formed my face and my insides and laid thine hand upon me.
PSA.139.6	Thy knowledge is wonderful beyond my ability to comprehend; it is high, I cannot understand it.
PSA.139.7	Where shall I go from thy spirit? or where shall I flee from thy presence?
PSA.139.8	If I ascend to the heavens, thou art there: if I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.
PSA.139.9	If I take the wings of the dawn and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
PSA.139.10	even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.
PSA.139.11	If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall shine because of me.
PSA.139.12	Even the darkness does not hide from thee; but the night shines as the day; the darkness is as the light.
PSA.139.13	For thou hast possessed my kidneys: thou hast covered me in my mother’s womb.
PSA.139.14	I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works, and that, my soul knows right well.
PSA.139.15	My body was not hid from thee, even though I was made in secret and brought together in the lowest parts of the earth.
PSA.139.16	Thine eyes did see my substance yet being imperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which were then formed, without lacking one of them.
PSA.139.17	Therefore, how precious are thy thoughts unto me, O God! How great is the sum of them!
PSA.139.18	If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand; when I awake, I am still with thee.
PSA.139.19	Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God; depart from me therefore, ye bloodthirsty men.
PSA.139.20	For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.
PSA.139.21	Do I not hate all those, O 
PSA.139.22	I hate them with perfect hatred; I count them mine enemies.
PSA.139.23	Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me and know my thoughts
PSA.139.24	and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way eternal.
PSA.140.1	Deliver me, O 
PSA.140.2	Who devise evil in their heart; they are continually gathered together for war.
PSA.140.3	They have sharpened their tongue like a serpent; adders’ poison is under their lips. Selah.
PSA.140.4	Keep me, O 
PSA.140.5	The proud have hid a snare for me and cords; they have spread a net; on the path they have set snares for me. Selah.
PSA.140.6	I said unto the 
PSA.140.7	O GOD the Lord, the strength of my saving health, cover thou my head in the day of battle.
PSA.140.8	Grant not, O 
PSA.140.9	As for the head of those that compass me about, let the perversion of their own lips cover them.
PSA.140.10	Let burning coals fall upon them; let them be cast into the fire, into deep pits, that they not rise up again.
PSA.140.11	The man with an evil tongue shall not be established in the earth; evil shall hunt the man of violence to overthrow him.
PSA.140.12	I know that the 
PSA.140.13	Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name; the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
PSA.141.1	, I have called unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
PSA.141.2	Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense, the gift of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
PSA.141.3	Set a watch, O 
PSA.141.4	Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to do works with ungodliness with the men that work iniquity, and let me not eat of their dainties.
PSA.141.5	Let the righteous smite me in mercy, and let him reprove me: and let not a flattering evil prince anoint my head, for my prayer shall ever be against his evil.
PSA.141.6	Their judges shall be thrown down from strong places; they shall hearken unto my words; for they are sweet.
PSA.141.7	Our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol, as when one cuts and cleaves wood upon the earth.
PSA.141.8	Therefore mine eyes look unto thee, O GOD the Lord; in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
PSA.141.9	Keep me from the hands of the snare which they have laid for me, and from the snares of the workers of iniquity.
PSA.141.10	Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, whilst I pass on ahead forever.
PSA.142.1	I shall cry unto the 
PSA.142.2	I shall pour out my complaint before him; before him I shall tell of my trouble.
PSA.142.3	When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou didst know my path. In the way in which I walked have they secretly laid a snare for me.
PSA.142.4	I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no one that would know me; I had no refuge; no one cared for my soul.
PSA.142.5	I cried unto thee, O 
PSA.142.6	Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low; deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
PSA.142.7	Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name; the righteous shall feast with me; when thou shalt have weaned me.
PSA.143.1	Hear my prayer, O 
PSA.143.2	And enter not into judgment with thy slave; for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
PSA.143.3	For the enemy has persecuted my soul; he has smitten my life down to the ground; he has made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
PSA.143.4	Therefore my spirit has become overwhelmed within me; my heart within me has become desolate.
PSA.143.5	I remembered the days of old; I meditated on all thy works; I mused on the work of thy hands.
PSA.143.6	I stretched forth my hands unto thee; my soul thirsted after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
PSA.143.7	Hear me speedily, O 
PSA.143.8	Cause me to hear thy mercy in the morning, for in thee do I trust; cause me to know the way in which I should walk, for I lift up my soul unto thee.
PSA.143.9	Deliver me, O 
PSA.143.10	Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God. Let thy good Spirit lead me into the land of uprightness.
PSA.143.11	By thy name, O 
PSA.143.12	And by thy mercy thou shalt scatter my enemies and destroy all the adversaries of my soul; for I am thy slave.
PSA.144.1	Blessed be the 
PSA.144.2	My mercy and my fortress; my high tower and my deliverer; my shield and he in whom I trust, who subdues my people under me.
PSA.144.3	, what is man that thou knowest him? or the son of man, that thou esteemeth him?
PSA.144.4	Man is like unto vanity; his days are as a shadow that passes away.
PSA.144.5	Bow thy heavens, O 
PSA.144.6	Cast forth lightning and scatter them; shoot out thine arrows and destroy them.
PSA.144.7	Send thine hand from above; redeem me and deliver me out of many waters, from the hand of the strange sons,
PSA.144.8	whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
PSA.144.9	I will sing a new song unto thee, O God; upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings I will sing praises unto thee.
PSA.144.10	Thou, he who gives salvation unto kings, who redeems David his slave from the evil sword.
PSA.144.11	Redeem me, and save me from the hand of strange sons, whose mouth speaks vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:

PRO.1.1	The proverbs of Solomon, the son of David, king of Israel;
PRO.1.2	to know wisdom and chastening; to understand prudent words;
PRO.1.3	to receive the chastening of prudence, justice, judgment, and equity;
PRO.1.4	to give prudence to the simple, and to the young men knowledge and council.
PRO.1.5	If the wise will hear them, doctrine shall increase, and the man of understanding shall acquire wise counsel:
PRO.1.6	To understand a parable and the interpretation; the words of the wise and their enigmas.
PRO.1.7	The fear of the 
PRO.1.8	My son, hearken unto the chastening of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
PRO.1.9	For they shall be an increase of grace unto thy head and protection about thy neck.
PRO.1.10	My son, if sinners entice thee, do not consent.
PRO.1.11	If they say, Come with us, let us lay in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without cause.
PRO.1.12	Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol and whole as those that go down into the pit;
PRO.1.13	We shall find all kinds of riches, we shall fill our houses with spoil.
PRO.1.14	Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
PRO.1.15	My son, do not walk in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
PRO.1.16	For their feet shall run to evil and make haste to shed blood.
PRO.1.17	Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
PRO.1.18	And they lay in wait for their own blood; they ambush their own souls.
PRO.1.19	So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain which takes away the life of those who possess it.
PRO.1.20	Wisdom cries without; she utters her voice in the streets:
PRO.1.21	She cries in the chief place of concourse, in the entrance to the gates of the city she utters her words, saying,
PRO.1.22	How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and the fools hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	Return at my reproof; behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
PRO.1.24	Because I have called and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one responded;
PRO.1.25	for because ye have disregarded all my counsel and rejected my reproof:
PRO.1.26	I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear comes upon you;
PRO.1.27	when what you have feared comes as destruction, and your calamity comes as a whirlwind; when tribulation and anguish come upon you.
PRO.1.28	Then they shall call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
PRO.1.29	Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the 
PRO.1.30	They rejected my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
PRO.1.31	Therefore they shall eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own counsel.
PRO.1.32	For the rest of the ignorant shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
PRO.1.33	But whosoever hearkens unto me shall dwell safely and shall rest from the fear of evil.
PRO.2.1	My son, if thou wilt receive my words and hide my commandments within thee
PRO.2.2	so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom and apply thine heart to intelligence,
PRO.2.3	yea, if thou criest for understanding and givest thy voice unto intelligence,
PRO.2.4	if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hid treasures,
PRO.2.5	then shalt thou understand the fear of the 
PRO.2.6	For the 
PRO.2.7	He keeps the person of the upright; he is a buckler to those that walk perfectly,
PRO.2.8	keeping the paths of judgment and the way of his merciful ones.
PRO.2.9	Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity, yea, every good path.
PRO.2.10	When wisdom enters into thine heart and knowledge is sweet unto thy soul,
PRO.2.11	discretion shall preserve thee, intelligence shall keep thee
PRO.2.12	to deliver thee from the evil way, from the man that speaks perversion,
PRO.2.13	who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness,
PRO.2.14	who rejoice to do evil and delight in wicked perversion,
PRO.2.15	whose ways are crooked, and they are crooked in their paths;
PRO.2.16	to deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger who flatters with her words,
PRO.2.17	who forsakes the prince of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God.
PRO.2.18	Therefore her house inclines unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
PRO.2.19	None that go unto her return again, neither do they take hold of the paths of life.
PRO.2.20	That thou may walk in the way of good men and keep the paths of the righteous.
PRO.2.21	For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
PRO.2.22	But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
PRO.3.1	My son, forget not my law, but let thine heart keep my commandments:
PRO.3.2	For they shall add length of days and long life and peace unto thee.
PRO.3.3	Let not mercy and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck; write them upon the tablet of thine heart:
PRO.3.4	So shalt thou find grace and good favour in the sight of God and man.
PRO.3.5	Trust in the 
PRO.3.6	In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
PRO.3.7	Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear the 
PRO.3.8	It shall be medicine to thy navel and marrow to thy bones.
PRO.3.9	Honour the 
PRO.3.10	So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
PRO.3.11	My son, do not despise the chastening of the 
PRO.3.12	For the 
PRO.3.13	Blessed is the man that has found wisdom and who brings to light intelligence,
PRO.3.14	for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the fruits thereof more than fine gold.
PRO.3.15	She is more precious than precious stones, and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
PRO.3.16	Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour.
PRO.3.17	Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
PRO.3.18	She is a tree of life to those that lay hold upon her, and blessed is every one that retains her.
PRO.3.19	The 
PRO.3.20	By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the heavens drop down the dew.
PRO.3.21	My son, do not let them depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion,
PRO.3.22	so shall they be life unto thy soul and grace to thy neck.
PRO.3.23	Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
PRO.3.24	When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
PRO.3.25	Thou shall not be afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked when it comes.
PRO.3.26	For the 
PRO.3.27	Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
PRO.3.28	Do not say unto thy neighbour, Go and come again and tomorrow I will give when thou hast it by thee.
PRO.3.29	Do not devise evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwells securely by thee.
PRO.3.30	Do not sue a man without cause, if he has done thee no harm.
PRO.3.31	Envy thou not the oppressor and choose none of his ways.
PRO.3.32	For the perverse is an abomination to the 
PRO.3.33	The curse of the 
PRO.3.34	Surely he scorns the scorners; but he gives grace unto the humble.
PRO.3.35	The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
PRO.4.1	Hearken, ye sons, unto the chastening of the father, and pay attention that ye might know understanding.
PRO.4.2	For I give you good doctrine; do not forsake my law.
PRO.4.3	For I was my father’s son, tender and unique in the sight of my mother.
PRO.4.4	He taught me and said unto me, Sustain thine heart with my words; keep my commandments, and live.
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom, get understanding; forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
PRO.4.6	Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee; love her, and she shall keep thee.
PRO.4.7	Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.
PRO.4.8	Grow in wisdom, and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee to honour when thou hast embraced her.
PRO.4.9	She shall give to thine head an increase of grace; a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
PRO.4.10	Hear, O my son, and receive my words, and the years of thy life shall be multiplied.
PRO.4.11	I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have caused thee to walk in right paths.
PRO.4.12	When thou goest in these paths, thy steps shall not be hindered; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
PRO.4.13	Take fast hold of chastening; do not let go; keep this; for it is thy life.
PRO.4.14	Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
PRO.4.15	Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
PRO.4.16	For they do not sleep, unless they have done evil; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause someone to fall.
PRO.4.17	For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
PRO.4.18	But the path of the just is as the light of the morning star, that shines more and more until the day is perfect.
PRO.4.19	The way of the wicked is as darkness; they do not know in what they stumble.
PRO.4.20	My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my words.
PRO.4.21	Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.
PRO.4.22	For they are life unto those that find them and medicine to all their flesh.
PRO.4.23	Above all else, guard thy heart; for out of it flows the issues of life.
PRO.4.24	Put away from thee the perversion of the mouth, and the deviation of the lips put far from thee.
PRO.4.25	Let thine eyes look upon that which is right, and let thine eyelids straighten thy path before thee.
PRO.4.26	Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
PRO.4.27	Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from evil.
PRO.5.1	My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my intelligence;
PRO.5.2	that thou may keep council and that thy lips may conserve knowledge.
PRO.5.3	For the lips of the strange woman drop as a honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil,
PRO.5.4	But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
PRO.5.5	Her feet go down to death, her steps uphold Sheol,
PRO.5.6	lest thou should ponder the path of life, her ways are unstable; thou shalt not know them.
PRO.5.7	Hear me now therefore, O ye sons, and do not depart from the words of my mouth.
PRO.5.8	Remove thy way far from her, and do not come near the door of her house,
PRO.5.9	lest thou give thine honour unto others and thy years unto the cruel,
PRO.5.10	lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, and thy labours be in the house of a stranger,
PRO.5.11	and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed
PRO.5.12	and say, How have I hated chastening and my heart despised reproof
PRO.5.13	and have not obeyed the voice of those who chastened me, nor inclined my ear to those that instructed me!
PRO.5.14	I have been in almost every kind of evil, in the midst of society and of the congregation.
PRO.5.15	Drink waters out of thine own cistern and running waters out of thine own well.
PRO.5.16	Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of thy waters in the streets.
PRO.5.17	Let them be only thine own and not for strangers with thee.
PRO.5.18	Thy fountain shall be blessed; and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
PRO.5.19	Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love, without eyes for anyone else.
PRO.5.20	And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a woman belonging to someone else, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
PRO.5.21	For the ways of man are before the eyes of the 
PRO.5.22	His own iniquities shall take hold of the wicked, and he shall be imprisoned with the cords of his sins.
PRO.5.23	He shall die because he did not submit to chastening; and due to the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
PRO.6.1	My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
PRO.6.2	thou art snared with the words of thy mouth; thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
PRO.6.3	Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, for thou hast fallen into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
PRO.6.4	Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
PRO.6.5	Escape as a roe from the hand of the hunter and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
PRO.6.6	Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise,
PRO.6.7	Who having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
PRO.6.8	provides her food in the summer and gathers her food in the harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
PRO.6.10	Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO.6.11	So shall thy poverty come as one that travels and thy want as an armed man.
PRO.6.12	A wicked man of Belial walks with a perverse mouth.
PRO.6.13	He winks with his eyes, he speaks with his feet, he teaches with his fingers;
PRO.6.14	there is perversion in his heart; he devises evil continually; he sows discord.
PRO.6.15	Therefore his calamity shall come suddenly; suddenly he shall be broken without remedy.
PRO.6.16	These six things does the 
PRO.6.17	A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
PRO.6.18	a heart that devises wicked imaginations, feet that are swift in running to evil,
PRO.6.19	a false witness that speaks lies, and he that sows discord among brethren.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep thy father’s commandment and forsake not the law of thy mother:
PRO.6.21	Bind them continually upon thine heart and tie them about thy neck.
PRO.6.22	When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
PRO.6.23	For the commandment is fire, and the law is light; and reproofs of chastening are the way of life,
PRO.6.24	to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
PRO.6.25	Lust not after her beauty in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eyes.
PRO.6.26	For by means of a whorish woman a man is reduced to a piece of bread, and the woman will hunt the precious soul of the man.
PRO.6.27	Can a man take fire in his bosom and his clothes not be burned?
PRO.6.28	Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
PRO.6.29	So is he that goes in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever touches her shall not be innocent.
PRO.6.30	Men do not take a thief lightly, even if he steals to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
PRO.6.31	and once he is taken, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
PRO.6.32	But whosoever commits adultery with a woman has a fault in his heart; he that does it corrupts his own soul.
PRO.6.33	A wound and dishonour shall he get, and his reproach shall never be wiped away.
PRO.6.34	For the jealous rage of a man will not spare in the day of vengeance.
PRO.6.35	He will not regard any ransom; neither will he want to forgive, though thou givest many bribes.
PRO.7.1	My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
PRO.7.2	Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
PRO.7.3	Bind them upon thy fingers; write them upon the tablet of thine heart.
PRO.7.4	Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister, and call understanding thy kinswoman:
PRO.7.5	That they may keep thee from the woman belonging to someone else, from the stranger who flatters with her words.
PRO.7.6	For at the window of my house I looked through my casement
PRO.7.7	and beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
PRO.7.8	passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
PRO.7.9	in the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night;
PRO.7.10	and, behold, a woman met him with the attire of a harlot, and subtil of heart.
PRO.7.11	(She is loud and stubborn; her feet do not abide in her house:
PRO.7.12	Now without, now in the streets, she lies in wait at every corner.)
PRO.7.13	So she caught him and kissed him and with an impudent face said unto him,
PRO.7.14	I had promised sacrifices of peace; today I have payed my vows.
PRO.7.15	Therefore I came forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
PRO.7.16	I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
PRO.7.17	I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning; let us solace ourselves with loves.
PRO.7.19	For the husband is not at home; he is gone a long journey:
PRO.7.20	He has taken a bag of money with him and will come home at the appointed feast day.
PRO.7.21	With her much fair speech she caused him to yield; with the flattering of her lips she persuaded him.
PRO.7.22	He went after her straightway, as an ox goes to the slaughter or as a fool to the correction of the stocks,
PRO.7.23	until the arrow pierces through his liver. He is as a bird struggling in the snare and not knowing that it is against his own life.
PRO.7.24	Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye sons, and attend to the words of my mouth.
PRO.7.25	Let not thine heart decline to her ways; do not go astray in her paths.
PRO.7.26	For she has caused many to fall down dead; yea, all the strong men have been slain by her.
PRO.7.27	Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
PRO.8.1	Doth not wisdom cry, and give her voice to intelligence?
PRO.8.2	She stands in the top of high places, by the way at the crossroads of the paths.
PRO.8.3	She cries at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
PRO.8.4	Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of men.
PRO.8.5	O ye simple, understand prudence; and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
PRO.8.6	Hear, for I will speak of excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
PRO.8.7	For my mouth shall speak truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
PRO.8.8	All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing perverse or twisted in them.
PRO.8.9	They are all plain to him that understands and right to those that have found wisdom.
PRO.8.10	Receive my chastening and not silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold.
PRO.8.11	For wisdom is better than precious stones; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
PRO.8.12	I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I invent the knowledge of giving counsel.
PRO.8.13	The fear of the 
PRO.8.14	With me is counsel, and existence; I am understanding; strength belongs to me.
PRO.8.15	By me the kings reign, and the princes decree justice.
PRO.8.16	By me the princes rule, and all of the governors judge the earth.
PRO.8.17	I love those that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me.
PRO.8.18	Riches and honour are with me, yea, durable riches and righteousness.
PRO.8.19	My fruit is better than gold, yea, than precious stones, and my revenue than choice silver.
PRO.8.20	I shall lead in the way of righteousness in the midst of the paths of judgment,
PRO.8.21	that I may cause my friends to inherit existence and I will fill their treasures.
PRO.8.22	The 
PRO.8.23	I was set up with eternal dominion, from the beginning, before the earth was.
PRO.8.24	I was begotten before the depths, before the existence of the fountains of many waters.
PRO.8.25	Before the mountains were founded, before the hills was I begotten.
PRO.8.26	While as yet he had not made the earth nor the fields nor the beginning of the dust of the world,
PRO.8.27	when he composed the heavens, I was there. When he set a compass upon the face of the depth,

PRO.18.20	A man’s belly shall be filled with the fruit of his mouth, and with the product of his lips shall he be filled.
PRO.18.21	Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those that love it shall eat its fruit.
PRO.18.22	Whosoever found a wife found a good thing and has attained the favour of the 
PRO.18.23	The poor uses intreaties, but the rich answer roughly.
PRO.18.24	The man that has friends must show himself to be a friend, and there is a friend that sticks closer than a brother.
PRO.19.1	Better is the poor that walks in his integrity than he that is perverse in his lips and is a fool.
PRO.19.2	That the soul be without wisdom is not good, and he that hastens with his feet sins.
PRO.19.3	The foolishness of man perverts his way, and his heart is wroth against the 
PRO.19.4	Wealth makes many friends, but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
PRO.19.5	A false witness shall not go unpunished, and he that speaks lies shall not escape.
PRO.19.6	Many will intreat the favour of the prince, but every man is a friend to him that gives.
PRO.19.7	All the brethren of the poor hate him; how much more shall his friends separate themselves from him? He shall seek their friendship and not find it.
PRO.19.8	He that gets wisdom loves his own soul; he keeps intelligence that he might find that which is good.
PRO.19.9	The false witness shall not go unpunished, and he that speaks lies shall perish.
PRO.19.10	Delight is not suitable for a fool; much less for a slave to have rule over princes.

PRO.19.12	The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion, but his favour is as dew upon the grass.
PRO.19.13	A foolish son is a pain unto his father, and the contentions of a wife are a continual dripping.
PRO.19.14	House and riches are the inheritance from fathers, but the prudent wife is from the 
PRO.19.15	Slothfulness casts into a deep sleep, and the negligent soul shall suffer hunger.
PRO.19.16	He that keeps the commandment keeps his own soul, but he that despises his ways shall die.

PRO.19.18	Chasten thy son while there is hope, but do not stir up thy soul to destroy him.
PRO.19.19	A man of great wrath shall suffer the consequences, for even if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.
PRO.19.20	Hear counsel, and receive chastening that thou may be wise in thy old age.
PRO.19.21	There are many thoughts in the heart of man; nevertheless the counsel of the 
PRO.19.22	Contentment is unto men to show mercy, but it is better to do it unto the poor than to the liar.
PRO.19.23	The fear of the 
PRO.19.24	The slothful man hides his hand in his bosom and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
PRO.19.25	Smite a scorner, and the simple will become prudent, and reproving one that has understanding, he will understand knowledge.
PRO.19.26	He that steals from his father and chases away his mother is a son that causes shame and brings reproach.
PRO.19.27	Cease, my son, to hear the teaching that induces one to deviate from the reasons of wisdom.
PRO.19.28	A witness of Belial shall scorn judgment, and the mouth of the wicked shall cover iniquity.
PRO.19.29	Judgments are prepared for scorners and stripes for the back of fools.
PRO.20.1	Wine makes a mocker, and beer a reveler, and whoever errs concerning them shall never be wise.
PRO.20.2	The fear of the king is as the roaring of a lion; whoever provokes him to anger sins against his own soul.
PRO.20.3	It is an honour for a man to cease from strife, but every fool will be meddling.
PRO.20.4	The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore he shall beg in harvest and have nothing.
PRO.20.5	Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, but a man of intelligence will draw it out.
PRO.20.6	Most men will proclaim each one his own mercy, but who can find a man of truth?
PRO.20.7	The just man who walks in his integrity, blessed shall be his sons after him.
PRO.20.8	A king that sits in the throne of judgment scatters away all evil with his eyes.
PRO.20.9	Who shall be able to say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
PRO.20.10	Double weights and double measures, both of them are alike abomination to the 
PRO.20.11	Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work is pure and whether it is right.
PRO.20.12	The hearing ear and the seeing eye, the 
PRO.20.13	Do not love sleep lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
PRO.20.14	It is bad, it is bad, the buyer says; but when he is gone his way, then he boasts.
PRO.20.15	There is gold and a multitude of precious stones, but the lips of wisdom are a precious vessel.
PRO.20.16	Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him that is surety for a strange woman.
PRO.20.17	Bread of deceit is sweet to a man, but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
PRO.20.18	Every thought must be ordered by counsel, and with intelligence war is made.
PRO.20.19	He that goes about as a talebearer reveals secrets; therefore meddle not with him that flatters with his lips.
PRO.20.20	Whosoever curses his father or his mother, his fire shall be put out in obscure darkness.
PRO.20.21	An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning, but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
PRO.20.22	Say not thou, I will take vengeance, but wait on the 
PRO.20.23	Double weights are an abomination unto the 
PRO.20.24	Man’s steps are of the 
PRO.20.25	It is a snare unto man to devour that which is holy and afterward to reconsider his vows.
PRO.20.26	A wise king scatters the wicked and brings the wheel over them.
PRO.20.27	The spirit of man is the fire of the 
PRO.20.28	Mercy and truth preserve the king, and his throne is upheld by mercy.
PRO.20.29	The glory of young men is their strength, and the beauty of old men is the gray head.
PRO.20.30	The scars of past wounds are medicine for evil, and living reproof reaches the most secret places in the inward parts.
PRO.21.1	The king’s heart is in the hand of the 
PRO.21.2	Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the 
PRO.21.3	To do righteousness and judgment is more acceptable to the 
PRO.21.4	A high look and a proud heart, which is the fire of the wicked, is sin.
PRO.21.5	The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness, but of every one that is too hasty, only to want.
PRO.21.6	The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of those that seek death.
PRO.21.7	The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them because they refuse to do judgment.
PRO.21.8	The way of the perverse man is crooked and strange, but as for the pure, his work is right.
PRO.21.9	It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
PRO.21.10	The soul of the wicked desires evil; his neighbour finds no favour in his eyes.
PRO.21.11	When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise, and by instructing the wise, he receives wisdom.
PRO.21.12	The righteous man wisely considers the house of the wicked, how God overthrows the wicked for their evil.
PRO.21.13	Whosoever stops his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself but shall not be heard.
PRO.21.14	A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a bribe in the bosom strong wrath.
PRO.21.15	It is joy to the just to do judgment, but it shall be destruction to the workers of iniquity.
PRO.21.16	The man that wanders out of the way of wisdom shall end up in the congregation of the dead.

PRO.21.18	The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.
PRO.21.19	It is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and an angry woman.

PRO.21.24	Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who deals in proud wrath.
PRO.21.25	The desire of the slothful kills him; for his hands refuse to labour.
PRO.21.26	There is one who covets greedily all day long, but the righteous gives and keeps on giving.
PRO.21.27	The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination; how much more, when he brings it with lewdness?
PRO.21.28	The false witness shall perish, but the man that hears shall stand fast in his word.
PRO.21.29	The wicked man hardens his face, but as for the upright, he orders his ways.
PRO.21.30	There is no wisdom nor intelligence nor counsel against the 
PRO.21.31	The horse is prepared against the day of battle, but salvation is of the 
PRO.22.1	A good reputation is rather to be chosen than great riches and good grace rather than silver and gold.
PRO.22.2	The rich and poor meet together; the 
PRO.22.3	A prudent man foresees the evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and receive hurt.
PRO.22.4	Riches and honour and life are the remuneration of humility and of the fear of the 
PRO.22.5	Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse; he that keeps his soul shall be far from them.
PRO.22.6	Train up a child in the way he should go; even when he is old, he will not depart from it.

PRO.22.9	He that has a merciful eye shall be blessed, for he gives of his bread to the destitute.
PRO.22.10	Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; strife and reproach shall cease.
PRO.22.11	He that loves pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend.
PRO.22.12	The eyes of the 
PRO.22.13	The slothful man says, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.
PRO.22.14	The mouth of strange women is a deep pit; he that is abhorred of the 
PRO.22.15	Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child, but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
PRO.22.16	He that oppresses the poor to increase his riches and who gives to the rich shall surely come to want.
PRO.22.17	Bow down thine ear and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my wisdom.
PRO.22.18	For it is a delightful thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall be ordered together in thy lips.
PRO.22.19	That thy trust may be in the 
PRO.22.20	Have I not written unto thee three times in counsels and knowledge,
PRO.22.21	that I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth, that thou mightest answer the words of truth to those that send unto thee?
PRO.22.22	Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither destroy the destitute in judgment:
PRO.22.23	For the 
PRO.22.24	Do not meddle with an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not go:
PRO.22.25	Lest thou learn his ways and get a snare to thy soul.
PRO.22.26	Be not thou one of them that strike hands or of them that are sureties for debts.
PRO.22.27	If thou hast nothing to pay, why should they take away thy bed from under thee?
PRO.22.28	Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.
PRO.22.29	Seest thou a man diligent in his work? He shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before obscure men.
PRO.23.1	When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee;
PRO.23.2	and put a knife to thy throat if thou art a man given to appetite.
PRO.23.3	Do not be desirous of his dainties; for they are deceitful food.
PRO.23.4	Do not labour to be rich; cease from thine own wisdom.
PRO.23.5	Wilt thou set thine eyes upon riches which are not? For they shall certainly make themselves wings; they shall fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
PRO.23.6	Do not eat the bread of anyone who has an evil eye, neither desire his dainty foods;
PRO.23.7	for as he thinks in his soul, so is he; Eat and drink, he shall say unto thee, but his heart is not with thee.
PRO.23.8	Didst thou eat thy part? Thou shalt vomit it up and lose thy sweet words.
PRO.23.9	Do not speak in the ears of a fool, for he will despise the prudence of thy words.
PRO.23.10	Do not remove the old landmark, and do not enter into the inheritance of the fatherless:
PRO.23.11	For their redeemer is mighty; he shall judge their cause against thee.
PRO.23.12	Apply thine heart unto chastening and thine ears to the words of wisdom.
PRO.23.13	Do not withhold correction from the child; for if thou shall beat him with the rod, he shall not die.
PRO.23.14	Thou shalt beat him with the rod and shalt deliver his soul from Sheol.
PRO.23.15	My son, if thy heart is wise, my heart shall also rejoice;
PRO.23.16	my kidneys shall also rejoice when thy lips speak right things.
PRO.23.17	Let not thy heart envy sinners, but persevere in the fear of the 
PRO.23.18	For surely there is an end, and thy hope shall not be cut off.
PRO.23.19	Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and straighten thy heart in the way.
PRO.23.20	Do not be among those who are drunk with wine; nor among gluttonous eaters of food;
PRO.23.21	for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty, and drowsiness shall cause them to wear rags.
PRO.23.22	Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.
PRO.23.23	Buy the truth and sell it not, also wisdom and instruction and understanding.
PRO.23.24	The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice, and he that begets a wise child shall have joy with him.
PRO.23.25	Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bore thee shall rejoice.
PRO.23.26	My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
PRO.23.27	For a whore is a deep ditch and a strange woman is a narrow pit.
PRO.23.28	She also lies in wait as for a prey and increases the transgressors among men.
PRO.23.29	For who shall be the woe? for who shall be the woe? for who contention? for who quarrels? for who the wounds without cause? who shall have redness of eyes?
PRO.23.30	For those that tarry long at the wine; those that go to seek mixed wine.
PRO.23.31	Do not look upon the wine when it is red, when it gives its colour in the cup, it goes down smoothly.
PRO.23.32	At the last it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder.
PRO.23.33	Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
PRO.23.34	Yea, thou shalt be as he that lies down in the midst of the sea or as he that sleeps at the rudder.
PRO.23.35	They have stricken me, thou shalt say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not; when I shall awake, I will seek it yet again.
PRO.24.1	Do not be envious of evil men, neither desire to be with them.
PRO.24.2	For their heart studies robbery, and their lips speak evil.
PRO.24.3	Through wisdom the house shall be built, and with intelligence it shall be established:
PRO.24.4	And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and beautiful riches.
PRO.24.5	The wise man is strong; and the man of understanding is a mighty man of valour.
PRO.24.6	For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war, and in the multitude of counsellors there is saving health.
PRO.24.7	Wisdom, is too high for a fool; he shall not open his mouth in the gate.
PRO.24.8	He that devises to do evil shall be called a man of evil designs.
PRO.24.9	The thought of the foolish is sin, and the scorner is an abomination to men.
PRO.24.10	If thou art slack in the day of tribulation, thy strength shall be reduced.
PRO.24.11	If thou forbear to deliver those that are drawn unto death and those that are ready to be slain,
PRO.24.12	if thou should say, Behold, we knew it not; shall not he that weighs the hearts understand it? and he that keeps thy soul, does he not know it? and shall he not render to every man according to his works?
PRO.24.13	My son, eat of the honey, because it is good, and of the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:
PRO.24.14	So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: if thou shalt find it, and in the end thy hope shall not be cut off.
PRO.24.15	Do not lay in wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the righteous; do not spoil his resting place.
PRO.24.16	For a just man falls seven times and rises up again, but the wicked shall fall into evil.
PRO.24.17	Do not rejoice when thy enemy falls, and do not let thy heart be glad when he stumbles
PRO.24.18	lest the 
PRO.24.19	Do not meddle with those who are evil, neither be envious of the wicked;
PRO.24.20	for the evil man shall not come to a good end; the fire of the wicked shall be put out.
PRO.24.21	My son, fear the 
PRO.24.22	for their calamity shall rise suddenly; and the ruin of them both, who shall know it?
PRO.24.23	These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons in judgment.
PRO.24.24	He that saith unto the wicked, Thou art righteous; him shall the peoples curse, nations shall abhor him:
PRO.24.25	But unto those that rebuke him shall be delight, and a blessing of good shall come upon them.
PRO.24.26	The lips of the one that gives a right answer shall be kissed.
PRO.24.27	Prepare thy work without and make it fit for thyself in thine inheritance, and afterwards thou shalt build thine house.
PRO.24.28	Do not be a false witness against thy neighbour, and do not flatter with thy lips.
PRO.24.29	Do not say, I will do unto him as he has done unto me; I will render to the man according to his work.
PRO.24.30	I went by the field of the slothful and by the vineyard of the man void of understanding,
PRO.24.31	and, behold, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had covered its face, and its stone wall was broken down.
PRO.24.32	Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it and received chastening.
PRO.24.33	Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
PRO.24.34	So shall thy poverty come as one that travels and thy want as an armed man.
PRO.25.1	These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
PRO.25.2	It is the glory of God to conceal the word, but the honour of kings is to search out the word.
PRO.25.3	For the height of the heavens and depth of the earth and for the heart of kings, there is no investigation.
PRO.25.4	Take away the dross from the silver, and a vessel shall come forth for the finer.
PRO.25.5	Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
PRO.25.6	Do not praise thyself in the presence of the king, and do not stand in the place of great men;
PRO.25.7	for it is better that it be said unto thee, Come up here than that thou should be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.
PRO.25.8	Do not go forth hastily to strive lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof when thy neighbour has put thee to shame.
PRO.25.9	Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself and do not uncover the secret to another
PRO.25.10	lest he that hears it put thee to shame and thine infamy not turn away.
PRO.25.11	A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold inscribed with silver.
PRO.25.12	As an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold, so is he who reproves a wise man who has a docile ear.
PRO.25.13	As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to those that send him, for he refreshes the soul of his master.
PRO.25.14	Whosoever boasts in a gift of falsehood is like clouds and wind without rain.
PRO.25.15	By long forbearing a prince is persuaded, and a soft tongue breaks the bones.
PRO.25.16	Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
PRO.25.17	Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour’s house lest he be weary of thee and so hate thee.
PRO.25.18	A man that bears false witness against his neighbour is a maul and a sword and a sharp arrow.
PRO.25.19	Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
PRO.25.20	As he that takes away a garment in cold weather and as vinegar upon soap, so is he that sings songs to a heavy heart.
PRO.25.21	If thy enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink,
PRO.25.22	for thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the 
PRO.25.23	The north wind drives away rain, so does an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
PRO.25.24	It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
PRO.25.25	As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
PRO.25.26	A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain and a corrupt spring.
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat much honey, so for men to search their own glory is not glory.
PRO.25.28	The man whose spirit has no restraint is like a city that is broken down and without walls.
PRO.26.1	As snow in summer and as rain in harvest, so honour is not suited for a fool.
PRO.26.2	As the sparrow in its wandering, as the swallow in its flight, so the curse causeless shall never come.
PRO.26.3	A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool’s back.
PRO.26.4	Never answer a fool according to his folly lest thou also be like unto him.
PRO.26.5	Answer the fool showing him his folly lest he be wise in his own conceit.
PRO.26.6	He that gives responsibility to one who is not able to carry it out is like him that sends a message by the hand of a fool, and he shall drink the damage.
PRO.26.7	Like unto the way that the one who is lame walks, so is a proverb in the mouth of the fool.
PRO.26.8	As he that binds the stone in the sling, so is he that gives honour to a fool.
PRO.26.9	As thorns sunk into the hand of one who is drunk, so is a proverb in the mouth of fools.
PRO.26.10	The great God that formed all things rewards both the fool and transgressors.
PRO.26.11	As a dog returns to his vomit, so the fool returns to his folly.
PRO.26.12	Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
PRO.26.13	The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.
PRO.26.14	As the door turns upon his hinges, so does the slothful upon his bed.
PRO.26.15	The slothful hides his hand in his bosom; it grieves him to bring it again to his mouth.
PRO.26.16	The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can give him counsel.
PRO.26.17	He that passes by and meddles with strife not belonging to him is like one that takes a dog by the ears.
PRO.26.18	As a mad man who casts firebrands, arrows, and death,
PRO.26.19	so is the man that destroys his friend and says, Am I not in sport?
PRO.26.20	Where there is no wood, the fire goes out, so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceases.
PRO.26.21	Charcoal for burning coals and wood for fire, and a contentious man to kindle strife.
PRO.26.22	The words of a talebearer seem smooth, but they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
PRO.26.23	Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
PRO.26.24	He that hates dissembles with his lips and lays up deceit within him;
PRO.26.25	when he speaks fair, do not believe him, for there are seven abominations in his heart.
PRO.26.26	Even though his hatred is covered up in the desert, his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation.
PRO.26.27	Whosoever digs a pit shall fall therein, and he that rolls a stone, it will return upon him.
PRO.26.28	A lying tongue hates those that are afflicted by it, and a flattering mouth works ruin.
PRO.27.1	Boast not thyself of tomorrow for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
PRO.27.2	Let another man praise thee and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.
PRO.27.3	A stone is heavy and the sand weighty; but a fool’s wrath is heavier than them both.
PRO.27.4	Wrath is cruel, and anger is impetuous, but who is able to stand before envy?
PRO.27.5	Open rebuke is better than secret love.
PRO.27.6	Faithful are the wounds of a friend, but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
PRO.27.7	The full soul loathes a honeycomb, but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
PRO.27.8	As a bird that wanders from her nest, so is a man that wanders from his place.
PRO.27.9	Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, so does the sweetness of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.
PRO.27.10	Do not forsake thine own friend and thy father’s friend, neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity, for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.
PRO.27.11	My son, be wise and make my heart glad that I may answer him that reproaches me.
PRO.27.12	A prudent man foresees the evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are hurt by it.
PRO.27.13	Take his garment that is surety for a stranger and take a pledge of him that is surety for a strange woman.
PRO.27.14	He that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
PRO.27.15	A continual dripping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
PRO.27.16	Whosoever hides her hides the wind, because the oil in his right hand cries out.
PRO.27.17	Iron sharpens iron; so a man sharpens the countenance of his friend.
PRO.27.18	Whosoever keeps the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof, so he that waits on his master shall be honoured.
PRO.27.19	As in water face corresponds to face, so the heart of man to man.
PRO.27.20	Sheol and hell are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
PRO.27.21	As the fining pot tries the silver and the furnace the gold; so the man is tried by the mouth of whoever praises him.
PRO.27.22	Though thou should bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet his foolishness will not depart from him.
PRO.27.23	Be thou diligent to know the countenance of thy sheep, and put thy heart into thy herds.
PRO.27.24	For riches are not for ever, and does the crown endure to every generation?
PRO.27.25	The tender grass shows itself, and the hay appears, and the herbs of the mountains are reaped.
PRO.27.26	The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are for the price of the field.
PRO.27.27	And thou shalt have goats’ milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance of thy maidens.
PRO.28.1	The wicked flee when no man pursues, but the righteous are bold as a young lion.
PRO.28.2	By the rebellion of the land, many are its princes, but by the man of understanding and wisdom the land shall remain stable.
PRO.28.3	A poor man that oppresses the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaves no food.
PRO.28.4	Those that forsake the law praise the wicked, but such as keep the law contend with them.

PRO.28.6	Better is the poor that walks in his perfection than he that is perverse in his ways, though he is rich.
PRO.28.7	Whosoever keeps the law is a wise son, but he that is a companion of gluttons shames his father.
PRO.28.8	He that by usury and unjust gain increases his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
PRO.28.9	He that turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.
PRO.28.10	Whosoever causes the upright to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit, but the perfect shall inherit every good thing.
PRO.28.11	The rich man is wise in his own conceit, but the poor that has understanding is wiser than he.
PRO.28.12	When the righteous rejoice, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, the sane man hides himself.
PRO.28.13	He that covers his sins shall not prosper, but whosoever confesses and forsakes them shall attain mercy.
PRO.28.14	Blessed is the man that fears God always, but he that hardens his heart shall fall into evil.
PRO.28.15	As a roaring lion and a hungry bear, so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.
PRO.28.16	The prince void of intelligence is also a great oppressor, but he that hates covetousness shall prolong his days.
PRO.28.17	A man that does violence to the blood of any person shall flee all the way to the grave, and no one shall sustain him.
PRO.28.18	Whosoever walks in integrity shall be saved, but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall into one of them.
PRO.28.19	He that tills his land shall be filled with bread, but he that follows after vain persons shall be filled with poverty.
PRO.28.20	The man of truth shall abound with blessings, but he that makes haste to be rich shall not be absolved.
PRO.28.21	To have respect of persons in judgment is not good; even for a piece of bread, man will transgress.
PRO.28.22	He that hastens to be rich has an evil eye and does not consider that poverty shall come upon him.
PRO.28.23	He that rebukes a man, afterwards shall find more favour than he that flatters with the tongue.
PRO.28.24	Whosoever robs his father or his mother and says, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of the destroyer.
PRO.28.25	He that is of a proud heart stirs up strife, but he that puts his trust in the 
PRO.28.26	He that trusts in his own heart is a fool, but whosoever walks in wisdom, he shall be saved.

PRO.29.6	In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare, but the righteous shall sing and rejoice.
PRO.29.7	The righteous considers the cause of the poor, but the wicked does not understand wisdom.

PRO.29.14	The king that judges the poor with truth, his throne shall be established for ever.
PRO.29.15	The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself shall bring his mother to shame.
PRO.29.16	When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increases, but the righteous shall see their fall.
PRO.29.17	Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; he shall give delight unto thy soul.
PRO.29.18	Without prophetic vision, the people shall perish, but he that keeps the law is blessed.
PRO.29.19	A slave will not be corrected by words, for though he understands he will not obey.
PRO.29.20	Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
PRO.29.21	He that gives freely unto his slave from a child shall have him become his son in the end.

PRO.30.1	The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spoke unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
PRO.30.2	Surely I am more carnal than any man and have not the understanding of a man.
PRO.30.3	I neither learned wisdom nor have the knowledge of the holy.
PRO.30.4	Who has ascended up into heaven, or descended? who has gathered the wind in his fists? who has bound the waters in a garment? who has established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou canst tell?
PRO.30.5	Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto those that put their trust in him.
PRO.30.6	Do not add unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
PRO.30.7	Two things have I required of thee; do not deny me them before I die:
PRO.30.8	Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the bread of my judgment:
PRO.30.9	Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the 
PRO.30.10	Do not accuse a slave in the presence of his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
PRO.30.11	There is a generation that curses their father, and does not bless their mother.
PRO.30.12	There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.
PRO.30.13	There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
PRO.30.14	There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their molars as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the destitute from among men.
PRO.30.15	The horseleach has two daughters, which are called, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:
PRO.30.16	Sheol; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that never says, It is enough.
PRO.30.17	The eye that mocks at his father, and despises the teaching of his mother, the ravens shall pluck it out of the river, and the young eagles shall eat it.
PRO.30.18	There are three things which are hidden from me, yea, four which I know not:
PRO.30.19	The track of the eagle in the air; the track of the serpent upon the rock; the track of the ship in the midst of the sea; and the track of the man in the maid.
PRO.30.20	Such is the track of an adulterous woman; she eats, and wipes her mouth, and says, I have done no wickedness.
PRO.30.21	For three things the earth is disquieted, and the fourth it cannot bear:
PRO.30.22	For a slave when he reigns; and a fool when he is filled with bread;
PRO.30.23	for a rejected woman when she is married; and a handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
PRO.30.24	There are four things which are little upon the earth, but they are wiser than the wise men:
PRO.30.25	The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their food in the summer;
PRO.30.26	the conies are but a feeble folk, yet they make their houses in the rocks;
PRO.30.27	the locusts have no king, yet all of them go forth by bands;
PRO.30.28	the spider takes hold with her hands and is in kings’ palaces.
PRO.30.29	There are three things which have a magnificent walk; yea, the fourth is stately in going:
PRO.30.30	The lion which is strongest among beasts and does not turn away for any;
PRO.30.31	the greyhound who is girded up of loins; a he goat also, and the king, against whom no one rises up.
PRO.30.32	If thou hast fallen, it is because thou hast lifted thyself up; and if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.
PRO.30.33	Surely the churning of milk brings forth butter and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood; so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife.
PRO.31.1	The words of King Lemuel, the prophecy with which his mother taught him.
PRO.31.2	What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
PRO.31.3	Do not give thy strength nor thy ways unto the women who destroy kings.
PRO.31.4	It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor is beer for princes
PRO.31.5	lest they drink and forget the law and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
PRO.31.6	Give beer unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that have heavy hearts.
PRO.31.7	They drink and forget their need and remember their misery no more.
PRO.31.8	Open thy mouth for those who cannot speak in the judgment of all the sons of death.
PRO.31.9	Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and destitute.

ECC.1.1	The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.2	Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
ECC.1.3	What profit does a man have of all his labour which he takes under the sun?
ECC.1.4	One generation passes away, and another generation comes, but the earth abides for ever.
ECC.1.5	The sun arises, and the sun goes down, and with desire returns to his place from which he arises again.
ECC.1.6	The wind goes toward the south and turns about unto the north; it whirls about continually, and the wind returns again according to its circuits.
ECC.1.7	All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, there they return again.
ECC.1.8	All things are full of labour; more than man can express; the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing.
ECC.1.9	The thing that has been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done; and there is no new thing under the sun.
ECC.1.10	Is there any thing of which it may be said, See, this is new? it has been already of old time which was before us.
ECC.1.11	There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.
ECC.1.12	I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.13	And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven (this sore travail God has given to the sons of man that they be occupied in it).
ECC.1.14	I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.1.15	That which is crooked cannot be made straight, and that which is lacking cannot be numbered.
ECC.1.16	I communed with my own heart, saying, Behold, I am come to great estate and have gotten more wisdom than all those that have been before me in Jerusalem; and my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.
ECC.1.17	And I gave my heart to know wisdom and knowledge and to know folly and those who are mad; I learned in the end that this also is vexation of spirit.
ECC.1.18	For in much wisdom is much grief, and he that increases knowledge increases sorrow.
ECC.2.1	I said in my heart, Come now, I will prove thee with mirth, therefore enjoy good things; and, behold, this also is vanity.
ECC.2.2	I said of laughter, It is mad, and of mirth, What does it do?
ECC.2.3	I proposed in my heart to regale my flesh with wine and that my heart would walk in wisdom; and to lay hold on folly, until I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.
ECC.2.4	I made myself great works; I built myself houses; I planted myself vineyards;
ECC.2.5	I made myself gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits;
ECC.2.6	I made myself pools of water, to water with them the forest that brings forth trees;
ECC.2.7	I got myself slaves and maidens and had sons born in my house; also I had great possessions of cattle and sheep above all that were in Jerusalem before me;
ECC.2.8	I gathered unto myself also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces; I obtained men singers and women singers and all the delights of the sons of men, musical instruments, and those of all sorts.
ECC.2.9	So I was great and increased more than all that were before me in Jerusalem, and more than that, my wisdom remained with me.
ECC.2.10	And whatever my eyes desired I did not keep from them; I did not withhold my heart from any pleasure; for my heart rejoiced in all my labour, and this was my portion of all my labour.
ECC.2.11	At last I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought and on the labour that I had laboured to do; and, behold, all was vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under the sun.
ECC.2.12	And I turned myself to behold wisdom and those who are mad, and folly; for what can the man do that comes after the king? even that which has already been done.
ECC.2.13	And I have seen that wisdom excels folly as far as light excels darkness.
ECC.2.14	The wise man has his eyes in his head, but the fool walks in darkness: And I myself also understood that one event happens to the one and to the other.
ECC.2.15	Then I said in my heart, As it shall happen to the fool, so it shall happen even to me. Why have I worked until now to make myself wiser? Then I said in my heart that this also is vanity.
ECC.2.16	For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever, seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten. And also the wise man shall die the same as the fool.
ECC.2.17	Therefore I hated life because every work that is wrought under the sun was grievous unto me; for all was vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.2.18	Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun, which I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.
ECC.2.19	And who knows whether he shall be a wise man or a fool, he who shall have rule over all my labour in which I have laboured and in which I have showed myself wise under the sun? This is also vanity.
ECC.2.20	Therefore my heart began to despair again regarding all the labour which I took under the sun.
ECC.2.21	That the man who worked with wisdom and with knowledge and with uprightness would have to leave his portion to a man that has not laboured therein. This also is vanity and a great evil.
ECC.2.22	For what does man have of all his labour and of the vexation of his heart in which he has laboured under the sun?
ECC.2.23	For all his days are only sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his heart does not take rest in the night. This is also vanity.
ECC.2.24	There is nothing better for a man than that he should eat and drink and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his labour. I also have seen that this is from the hand of God.
ECC.2.25	For who can eat, or who can care for himself better than I?
ECC.2.26	For God gives to the man that is good in his sight wisdom and knowledge and joy, but to the sinner he gives travail, to gather and to heap up, that he may give to the one that is good before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.3.1	For all things there is a season, and every will under the heaven has its time determined.
ECC.3.2	A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;
ECC.3.3	a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;
ECC.3.4	a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
ECC.3.5	a time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
ECC.3.6	a time to seek, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;
ECC.3.7	a time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;
ECC.3.8	a time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.
ECC.3.9	What profit does the one that works have in that in which he labours?
ECC.3.10	I have seen the travail which God has given to the sons of men that they may be occupied in it.
ECC.3.11	He has made every thing beautiful in his time: even the world he has given over to their will, in such a way that no man can attain to this work that God makes from the beginning to the end.
ECC.3.12	I have learned that there is nothing better for them, but to rejoice and to do good in his life.
ECC.3.13	And also that every man should eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labour; it is the gift of God.
ECC.3.14	I have understood that whatever God does, it shall be for ever; nothing can be added to it, nor any thing taken from it because God does it that men should fear before him.
ECC.3.15	That which has been is now, and that which is to be has already been and God shall seek that which is past.
ECC.3.16	And moreover I saw under the sun that instead of judgment, there was wickedness; and instead of righteousness, that iniquity was there.
ECC.3.17	I said in my heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked; for there is a time determined to judge every will and regarding everything that is done.
ECC.3.18	I said in my heart concerning the estate of the sons of men that God might manifest them and that they might see that they themselves are beasts one to another.
ECC.3.19	For that which befalls the sons of men befalls beasts; even one thing befalls them: as the one dies, so dies the other; and they all have one breath; so that a man has no more breath than a beast: for all is vanity.
ECC.3.20	All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all shall turn to dust again.
ECC.3.21	Who knows that the spirit of the sons of men goes upward and that the spirit of the beast goes downward to the earth?
ECC.3.22	Therefore I perceive that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion; for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
ECC.4.1	So I returned and considered all the violence that is done under the sun and behold the tears of such as are oppressed, and they have no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power; but the oppressed had no comforter.
ECC.4.2	Therefore I praised the dead who are already dead more than the living who are yet alive.
ECC.4.3	And I thought that better is he than both of them who has not yet been, who has not seen the evil works that are done under the sun.
ECC.4.4	Again, I considered all travail and every right work, that for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.4.5	The fool folds his hands together and eats his own flesh.
ECC.4.6	Better is a handful with rest than both the hands full with travail and vexation of spirit.
ECC.4.7	Then I returned, and I saw another vanity under the sun.
ECC.4.8	It is the man who is alone, without a successor, who has neither son nor brother; yet is there no end of all his labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither saith he, For whom do I labour and bereave my soul of good? This is also vanity and sore travail.
ECC.4.9	Two are better than one because they have a better reward for their labour.
ECC.4.10	For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falls, for he has not another to help him up.
ECC.4.11	Again, if two sleep together, then they have heat, but how can one be warm alone?
ECC.4.12	And if one prevails against him, two shall withstand him; and a threefold cord is not quickly broken.
ECC.4.13	Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish king who will no longer be admonished.
ECC.4.14	For he came out of prison to reign, even though he was born poor into his kingdom.
ECC.4.15	I saw all the living who are under the sun walking with the child, the successor that shall stand up in his stead.
ECC.4.16	There is no end of all the people that have been before them; those also that come after shall not be content in him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.5.1	Watch thy feet when thou goest to the house of God and draw near with more willingness to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools, for they do not know how to do what God wants.
ECC.5.2	Do not be rash with thy mouth and do not let thy heart be hasty to utter any thing before God, for God is in heaven and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few.
ECC.5.3	For out of much preoccupation comes the dream, and the voice of the fool out of a multitude of words.
ECC.5.4	When thou dost vow a vow unto God, do not defer to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools; pay that which thou hast vowed.
ECC.5.5	It is better that thou should not vow than that thou should vow and not pay.
ECC.5.6	Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was ignorance. Why should thou cause God to be angry because of thy voice and destroy the work of thine hands?
ECC.5.7	Because dreams abound, and vanities and the words are many, but fear thou God.
ECC.5.8	If thou seest violence unto the poor and the extortion of rights and justice in a province, do not marvel at the matter, for height is looking upon height; and there is one higher than they.
ECC.5.9	And there is higher authority in all of the things of the earth, but he who serves the field is king.
ECC.5.10	He that loves money shall not be satisfied with money; nor he that loves abundance with increase; this is also vanity.
ECC.5.11	When goods increase, those that eat them are increased; and what good is there to the owners thereof, except the beholding of them with their eyes?
ECC.5.12	The sleep of the servant is sweet whether he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to sleep.
ECC.5.13	There is another sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt;
ECC.5.14	which are lost by evil pursuits and to the sons which he has begotten; there is nothing left in his hand.
ECC.5.15	As he came forth of his mother’s womb, naked shall he return to go as he came and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
ECC.5.16	And this also is a sore evil; that in all points as he came, so shall he go; and what profit has he that has laboured for the wind?
ECC.5.17	In addition to this, all the days of his life he shall eat in darkness, with much wrath and pain and sorrow sickness.
ECC.5.18	Behold therefore the good which I have seen: that good is to eat and to drink and to enjoy of the good of all his labour that he takes under the sun all the days of his life, which God gives him; for it is his portion.
ECC.5.19	Likewise, unto every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, he has also given him power to eat thereof and to take his portion and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.
ECC.5.20	To such a one, God will remove the concerns common to others, for God shall answer him with joy from his heart.
ECC.6.1	There is another evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is very common among men:
ECC.6.2	A man to whom God has given riches, wealth, and honour so that he lacks nothing for his soul of all that he desires, yet God does not give him power to eat of it, but the strangers eat it; this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.
ECC.6.3	If a man begets a hundred sons and lives many years so that the days of his years are many, if his soul is not filled with good and also that he have no burial; I say that an aborted birth is better than he.
ECC.6.4	For he came in vain and departs unto darkness, and his name shall be covered with darkness.
ECC.6.5	Even though he has not seen the sun nor known any thing; this one has more rest than the other.
ECC.6.6	For though the other should live a thousand years twice and has not enjoyed good; both shall surely go to the same place.
ECC.6.7	All the labour of man is for his mouth, and with all this the appetite is not filled.
ECC.6.8	For what has the wise more than the fool? what more has the poor that knows how to walk among the living?
ECC.6.9	It is better to enjoy the good that is present than the wandering of desire; this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.
ECC.6.10	He that is has been named already; and it is known that he is man and that he shall not be able to contend with him that is mightier than he.
ECC.6.11	Certainly the many words multiply vanity, what more does man have?
ECC.6.12	For who knows what is good for man in this life, all the days of the life of his vanity which he causes to be as a shadow? for who shall teach the man what shall be after him under the sun?
ECC.7.1	A good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one’s birth.
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to the house of mourning than to go to the house of feasting, for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter; for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made whole.
ECC.7.4	The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning, but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure.
ECC.7.5	It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise than to hear the song of fools.
ECC.7.6	The laughter of the fool is as the crackling of thorns under a pot, and this also (the laughter or prosperity of the fool) is vanity.
ECC.7.7	Surely oppression makes a wise man mad, and a gift destroys the heart.
ECC.7.8	Better is the end of a thing than its beginning, and he who has suffered in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
ECC.7.9	Do not be hasty in thy spirit to be angry, for anger rests in the bosom of fools.
ECC.7.10	Never say, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
ECC.7.11	Knowledge is good with an inheritance and is the excellency of those that see the sun.
ECC.7.12	For knowledge is a defence, and money is a defence; but wisdom excels in that it gives life to those that have it.
ECC.7.13	Consider the work of God; for who can make straight that which he has twisted?
ECC.7.14	In the day of good enjoy that which is good, but in the day of adversity open your eyes and learn: God also has made the one (the day of adversity) before the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
ECC.7.15	All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perishes for his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongs his days by his wickedness.
ECC.7.16	Do not be too legalistic; neither make thyself over wise in thine own eyes: why should thou destroy thyself?
ECC.7.17	Do not be hasty to condemn, neither be thou foolish: why should thou die in the midst of thy labours?
ECC.7.18	It is good that thou should take hold of this; and also from the other not withdraw thy hand; for he that fears God shall come through with everything.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom strengthens the wise more than ten mighty men who are in the city.
ECC.7.20	For surely there is not a just man upon earth that in doing good does not sin.
ECC.7.21	Also do not take to heart all the words that are spoken lest thou hear thy slave speak evil of thee:
ECC.7.22	For thine own heart knows that thou thyself likewise hast spoken evil of others many times.
ECC.7.23	All this I have proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise, but it was far from me.
ECC.7.24	That which has been is far off and that which is exceeding deep, who can find it out?
ECC.7.25	I applied my heart to know and to search and to seek out wisdom and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly and the madness of error;
ECC.7.26	and I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands are bonds; whosoever pleases God shall escape from her, but the sinner shall be held prisoner in her.
ECC.7.27	Behold, this I have found, saith the preacher, weighing things one by one to find out the answer,
ECC.7.28	which my soul yet seeks, but I find not: one man among a thousand I have found, but a woman among all those I have not found.
ECC.7.29	Behold, this only have I found: that God has made man upright, but they have sought out many perversions.
ECC.8.1	Who is as the wise man? and who is as he who knows the interpretation of all things? The wisdom of this man shall make his face to shine, and the coarseness of his face shall be changed.
ECC.8.2	I counsel thee to keep the king’s commandment and the word of the covenant that thou hast made with God.
ECC.8.3	Do not be hasty to rebel against him; do not persist in any evil thing, for he shall do whatsoever pleases him;
ECC.8.4	because the word of the king is his power and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
ECC.8.5	Whosoever keeps the commandment shall experience no evil thing, and a wise man’s heart discerns both time and judgment.
ECC.8.6	Because for every will there is time and judgment, because the evil of man is great upon him,
ECC.8.7	for he does not know that which shall be; nor when it shall be. Who will teach it to him?
ECC.8.8	There is no man that has power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither does he have power over the day of death, and weapons are of no use in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.
ECC.8.9	All this I have seen and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: the time in which one man rules over another to his own hurt.
ECC.8.10	Then I also saw that the wicked who were buried came into remembrance more than those who had frequented the holy place, and these were forgotten in the city where they had worked uprightly. This also is vanity.
ECC.8.11	Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner does evil one hundred times and his judgment is prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with those that fear God, who fear before his presence;
ECC.8.13	but it shall never be well with the wicked, neither shall his days be prolonged, which are as a shadow, because he did not fear before the presence of God.
ECC.8.14	There is another vanity which is done upon the earth: that there are just men, who are recompensed as if they had done according to the work of the wicked; again, there are wicked men, who are recompensed as if they had done according to the work of the righteous; I say that this also is vanity.
ECC.8.15	Therefore I commended joy because a man has no better thing under the sun than to eat and to drink and to be merry, for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God gives him under the sun.
ECC.8.16	Therefore I applied mine heart to know wisdom and to see the business that is done upon the earth (for also there is he that neither day nor night sees sleep with his eyes).
ECC.8.17	And I have seen regarding all the works of God that man cannot attain to understand the work that is being done under the sun, because though a man labours to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; even though the wise man says that he knows it, yet he shall not be able to attain it.
ECC.9.1	Certainly I applied my heart unto all of this that I might declare all of this: that the righteous and the wise and their works are in the hand of God; no man knows either love or hatred by all that passes before them.
ECC.9.2	All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean and to the unclean; to him that sacrifices and to him that does not sacrifice: as unto the good so unto the sinner; and unto him that swears as unto him that fears the oath.
ECC.9.3	This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all; and also that the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.
ECC.9.4	For to him that is still among the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion.
ECC.9.5	For the living know that they shall die, but the dead do not know any thing; neither do they have any more reward, for their memory is placed into oblivion.
ECC.9.6	Even their love and their hatred and their envy is now perished; neither have they any more a portion in the age in any thing that is done under the sun.
ECC.9.7	Go, eat thy bread with joy and drink thy wine with a joyful heart that thy works might be acceptable unto God.
ECC.9.8	Thy garments shall always be white, and thy head shall never lack ointment.
ECC.9.9	Live joyfully with the wife whom thou dost love all the days which thou art to live in this lake of vanity, which are given unto thee; all the days of thy vanity under the sun: for that is thy portion in this life, and in thy labour in which thou dost work under the sun.
ECC.9.10	Whatever thy hand finds to do, do it with all thy might, for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, where thou goest.
ECC.9.11	I returned and saw under the sun that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of prudence, nor yet grace to men of eloquence; but time and chance happens to them all.
ECC.9.12	For man also does not know his time: as the fishes that are taken in an evil net and as the birds that are caught in the snare, so are the sons of men snared in the evil time, when it falls suddenly upon them.
ECC.9.13	I have also seen this wisdom under the sun, which is important unto me:
ECC.9.14	There was a little city and few men within it; and a great king came against it and besieged it and built great bulwarks against it;
ECC.9.15	now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no one remembered that same poor man.
ECC.9.16	Then I said, Wisdom is better than strength: even though the poor man’s knowledge is despised, and his words are not heard.
ECC.9.17	The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that rules among fools.
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner destroys much good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: likewise a small act of folly unto him that is esteemed for wisdom and honour.
ECC.10.2	A wise man’s heart is at his right hand, but a fool’s heart at his left.
ECC.10.3	Even when the fool walks by the way, he lacks prudence, and he says unto every one that he is a fool.
ECC.10.4	If the spirit of the ruler rises up against thee, do not leave thy place; for meekness pacifies great sins.
ECC.10.5	There is another evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceeds from the ruler:
ECC.10.6	Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich are seated in a low place.
ECC.10.7	I saw slaves upon horses, and princes walking as slaves upon the earth.
ECC.10.8	He that digs a pit shall fall into it, and whosoever breaks a hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
ECC.10.9	Whosoever moves the stones shall have tribulation along with it, and he that cuts the firewood shall be endangered by it.
ECC.10.10	If the iron is blunt, and he does not whet the edge, then he must put forth more strength, but the advantages of wisdom excel.
ECC.10.11	If the serpent bites without being enchanted, then the babbler is no more.
ECC.10.12	The words from the mouth of the wise man are grace, but the lips of the fool will swallow up himself.
ECC.10.13	The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness, and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
ECC.10.14	The fool multiplies words and says, Man cannot tell what shall be, and what shall be after him, who can tell him?
ECC.10.15	The labour of the foolish wearies all of them because they do not know how to go to the city.
ECC.10.16	Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes banquet in the morning!
ECC.10.17	Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season for strength, and not for drunkenness!
ECC.10.18	By much slothfulness the building decays, and through idleness of the hands the rain drips throughout the house.
ECC.10.19	The banquet is made for pleasure, and wine makes merry; but money answers all things.
ECC.10.20	Do not curse the king, not even in thy thought; and do not curse the rich even in the secret place of thy bedchamber; for the birds of the air shall carry the voice, and those who have wings shall tell the matter.
ECC.11.1	Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou shalt find it after many days.
ECC.11.2	Give a portion to seven and even to eight, for thou dost not know what evil shall come upon the earth.
ECC.11.3	If the clouds are full of rain, they shall empty themselves upon the earth; and if the tree falls toward the south or toward the north, in the place where the tree falls, there it shall remain.
ECC.11.4	He that observes the wind shall not sow, and he that regards the clouds shall not reap.
ECC.11.5	As thou dost not know what is the way of the spirit nor how the bones grow in the womb of her that is with child, even so thou dost not know the works of God who makes all.
ECC.11.6	In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand; for thou knowest not which shall prosper, either this or that or whether they both shall be equally good.
ECC.11.7	Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun,
ECC.11.8	but if a man lives many years and rejoices in them all; yet if afterwards he remembers the days of darkness, for they shall be many, he shall say that everything that shall have happened to him is vanity.
ECC.11.9	Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the sight of thine eyes; but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
ECC.11.10	Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thy flesh; for childhood and youth are vanity.
ECC.12.1	Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days do not come nor the years draw near when thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them;
ECC.12.2	before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars are darkened and the clouds return after the rain:
ECC.12.3	In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble and the strong men shall bow themselves and the grinders cease because they are few and those that look out of the windows are darkened;
ECC.12.4	and the doors outside shall be shut because the voice of the grinder is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird and all the daughters of song shall be humbled;
ECC.12.5	when they shall also be afraid of that which is high, and fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and appetite shall fail: because man goes to the home of his age, and the mourners shall go about the streets;
ECC.12.6	before the silver chain is broken, and the golden bowl is broken, and the pitcher is broken at the fountain, and the wheel is broken at the cistern;
ECC.12.7	and the dust returns to the earth as it was before and the spirit returns unto God who gave it.
ECC.12.8	Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.
ECC.12.9	And the wiser the preacher became that much more did he teach wisdom to the people, causing them to listen and to search things out, and he composed many proverbs.
ECC.12.10	The preacher sought to find willing words and upright writings, even words of truth.
ECC.12.11	The words of the wise are as goads and as nails hammered into place, those of the teachers of the congregations, who are placed under one Shepherd.
ECC.12.12	My son, in addition to this, be admonished: of making many books there is no end, and much study is a weariness of the flesh.
ECC.12.13	The conclusion of the entire sermon is heard: Fear God and keep his commandments, for this is the whole happiness of man.
ECC.12.14	For God shall bring every work to judgment with every secret thing, whether it is good or whether it is evil.
SNG.1.1	The song of songs, which is of Solomon.
SNG.1.2	Oh! if he would kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! for thy love is better than wine.
SNG.1.3	Because of the savour of thy good ointments (ointment poured forth is thy name), therefore have the virgins loved thee.
SNG.1.4	Draw me after thee, we will run. The king has brought me into his chambers; we will be glad and rejoice in thee; we will remember thy love more than the wine; the upright love thee.
SNG.1.5	I am dark, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, more desirable as the booths of Kedar, as the tents of Solomon.
SNG.1.6	Do not look upon me because I am dark because the sun has looked upon me; my mother’s sons were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards, but I have not kept my own vineyard.
SNG.1.7	Tell me, O thou whom my soul loves, where thou dost feed, where thou dost make thy flock to rest at noon; for why did I have to be as a wanderer after the flocks of thy companions?
SNG.1.8	If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go forth, following the footprints of the flock and feed thy little female goats beside the booths of the shepherds.
SNG.1.9	I have compared thee, O my love, to a mare of the chariots of Pharaoh.
SNG.1.10	Thy cheeks are beautiful between the earrings, thy neck between the necklaces.
SNG.1.11	We will make thee earrings of gold with studs of silver.
SNG.1.12	While the king was on his couch, my spikenard gave forth its fragrance.
SNG.1.13	A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me that rests between my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire {Heb. ransom} in the vineyards of Engedi.
SNG.1.15	Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’ eyes.
SNG.1.16	Behold, thou art fair, O my beloved, and pleasant; also our bed has flowers.
SNG.1.17	The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
SNG.2.1	I am the lily of the field {Heb. Sharon} and the rose of the valleys.
SNG.2.2	As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the virgins.
SNG.2.3	As the apple tree among the trees of the wild, so is my beloved among the sons. I desired to sit under his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the wine chamber and placed his banner of love over me.
SNG.2.5	Sustain me with flagons of wine, strengthen me with apples; for I am sick with love.
SNG.2.6	His left hand is under my head, and his right hand embraces me.
SNG.2.7	I charge you, O ye virgins of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field that ye not awake nor stir up love, until he pleases.
SNG.2.8	The voice of my beloved! behold, he comes leaping over the mountains, skipping over the hills.
SNG.2.9	My beloved is like a roe or a young hart; behold, he stands behind our wall; he looks through the windows, blossoming through the lattice.
SNG.2.10	My beloved spoke and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
SNG.2.11	For, behold, the winter is past; the rain is over and gone;
SNG.2.12	the flowers appear on the earth; the time of the song is come, and the voice of the turtle dove has been heard in our land;
SNG.2.13	the fig tree has put forth her green figs, and the vines in blossom have given forth their fragrance. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
SNG.2.14	O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is beautiful.
SNG.2.15	Hunt the foxes for us, the little foxes, that spoil the vines; for our vines are in blossom.
SNG.2.16	My beloved is mine, and I am his; he feeds among the lilies.
SNG.2.17	Until the day breaks and the shadows flee away, return, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
SNG.3.1	By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but I did not find him.
SNG.3.2	I will rise now and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loves; I sought him, but I did not find him.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen that go about the city found me, to whom I said, Have ye seen him whom my soul loves?
SNG.3.4	It was but a little that I passed from them that I found him whom my soul loves: I held him and would not let him go until I had brought him into my mother’s house and into the chamber of her that brought me into the light.
SNG.3.5	I charge you, O ye virgins of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that ye not awake nor stir up love, until he pleases.
SNG.3.6	Who is she that rises out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense and with all the aromatic powders?
SNG.3.7	Behold it is the bed of Solomon; sixty valiant men are about it of the valiant of Israel.
SNG.3.8	They all hold swords, being expert in war; each one has his sword upon his thigh because of the fears of the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon made himself a palanquin of the wood of Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made its pillars of silver, the bottom of it of gold, the covering of it of purple, its interior being paved with love, for the virgins of Jerusalem.
SNG.3.11	Go forth, O ye virgins of Zion, and behold King Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
SNG.4.1	Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves’ eyes within thy locks; thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Mount Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; of which every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.
SNG.4.3	Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is lovely; thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
SNG.4.4	Thy neck is like the tower of David built for teaching, upon which there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
SNG.4.5	Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which are fed among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day breaks, and the shadows flee away, I will go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.
SNG.4.7	Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.
SNG.4.8	With me from Lebanon, my spouse, thou shalt come with me from Lebanon; thou shalt look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions’ dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
SNG.4.9	Thou hast taken hold of my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast imprisoned my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
SNG.4.10	How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
SNG.4.11	Thy lips, O my spouse, drip as the honeycomb; honey and milk are under thy tongue, and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	A closed garden is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
SNG.4.13	Thy newly budded plants are a paradise of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, {Heb. ransom}, with spikenard,
SNG.4.14	spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
SNG.4.15	A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, that flow from Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden that the aroma of its spices may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his sweet fruits.
SNG.5.1	I came into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh and my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk: eat, O friends; drink, beloved, drink abundantly.
SNG.5.2	I sleep, but my heart watches for the voice of my beloved that knocks at the door, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my perfect one: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
SNG.5.3	I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
SNG.5.4	My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.
SNG.5.5	I rose up to open to my beloved, and my hands dripped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
SNG.5.6	I opened to my beloved, but my beloved had withdrawn himself and was gone; my soul went after his speech; I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my outer cloak from me.
SNG.5.8	I charge you, O virgins of Jerusalem, if ye should find my beloved that ye cause him to know how sick I am with love.
SNG.5.9	What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? What is thy beloved more than another beloved that thou dost so charge us?
SNG.5.10	My beloved is white and ruddy; the standard-bearer among the ten thousands.
SNG.5.11	His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy and black as a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are as doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, as doves that are next to abundance.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are as a bed of aromatic spices, as fragrant flowers; his lips like lilies, dripping sweet smelling myrrh that transcends.
SNG.5.14	His hands are as gold rings set with beryls; his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.
SNG.5.15	His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold; his countenance is as Lebanon, chosen as the cedars.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is most sweet; he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O virgins of Jerusalem.
SNG.6.1	Where has thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? where didst thy beloved separate himself? that we may seek him with thee.
SNG.6.2	My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather the lilies.
SNG.6.3	I am my beloved’s, and my beloved is mine; he feeds among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, as desirable as Jerusalem, imposing as the standard-bearer of the army.
SNG.6.5	Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me; thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, of which every one bears twins, and there is not one barren among them.
SNG.6.7	As slices of pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.
SNG.6.8	There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and virgins without number.
SNG.6.9	My dove is but one, my perfect one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that brought her into the light. The virgins saw her and called her blessed; yea, the queens and the concubines and they praised her.
SNG.6.10	Who is she that shows herself forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and imposing as the standard-bearer of the army?
SNG.6.11	I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vines flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
SNG.6.12	Or ever I was aware, my soul made me return like the chariots of Amminadib.
SNG.6.13	Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? She shall be as a multitude of tabernacles.
SNG.7.1	How beautiful are thy feet in thy shoes, O prince’s daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of an excellent workman.
SNG.7.2	Thy navel is like a round goblet, which does not lack liquor; thy belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.
SNG.7.4	Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon by the gate of Bathrabbim; thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looks toward Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Thine head upon thee is like scarlet, and the hair of thine head like the purple of the king hung in the galleries.
SNG.7.6	How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
SNG.7.7	This, thy stature is like unto the palm tree, and thy breasts to the clusters.
SNG.7.8	I said, I will climb up the palm tree, I will take hold of the clusters thereof; now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine and the smell of thy nose like apples;
SNG.7.9	and thy palate like the best wine that goes into my beloved sweetly and causes the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
SNG.7.10	I am my beloved’s, and with me he has his contentment.
SNG.7.11	Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
SNG.7.12	Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vines flourish, whether the tender flowers appear, if the pomegranates bud forth; there I will give thee my loves.
SNG.7.13	The mandrakes have given their fragrance, and at our gates are all manner of sweet fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
SNG.8.1	O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; and I should not be despised.
SNG.8.2	I would lead thee and bring thee into my mother’s house, that thou would instruct me; I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
SNG.8.3	His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
SNG.8.4	I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye not awake nor stir up love until he pleases.
SNG.8.5	Who is she that comes up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I woke thee up under the apple tree; there thy mother had birth pains; there she had pains that brought thee into the light.
SNG.8.6	Set me as a seal upon thine heart as a sign upon thine arm; for love is strong as death; jealousy is hard as Sheol; the coals thereof are coals of fire, which have a most vehement flame.
SNG.8.7	The many waters cannot quench love, neither can the rivers drown it; if a man would give all the substance of his house for this love, it would certainly be despised.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister, and she still has no breasts; what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver; and if she is a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
SNG.8.10	I am a wall, and my breasts like towers since I was in his eyes as the one that found peace.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; for its fruit each one was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
SNG.8.12	My vineyard, which is mine, is before me; the thousand pieces shall be thine, O Solomon, and two hundred for those that keep the fruit.
SNG.8.13	Thou, she that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice; cause me to hear it.
SNG.8.14	Run, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
ISA.1.1	The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
ISA.1.2	Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the 
ISA.1.3	The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master’s crib; but Israel does not know, my people do not have understanding.
ISA.1.4	O sinful nation, people laden with iniquity, generation of evildoers, corrupt sons! They have forsaken the 
ISA.1.5	Why should I chastise you any more? Ye will revolt more and more; every head is sick, and every heart faint.
ISA.1.6	From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in him; but wounds, and bruises, and putrefying sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with ointment.
ISA.1.7	Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.
ISA.1.8	And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
ISA.1.9	Except the 
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the 
ISA.1.11	To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me? shall the 
ISA.1.12	When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand, to tread my courts?
ISA.1.13	Bring no more vain oblations; the incense is an abomination unto me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I cannot stand them; iniquity and the solemn meeting.
ISA.1.14	Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates: they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.
ISA.1.15	And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; likewise, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.
ISA.1.16	Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;
ISA.1.17	learn to do good; seek judgment; restore unto the oppressed; hear the fatherless in right judgment; protect the widow.
ISA.1.18	Then come, shall the 
ISA.1.19	If ye are willing and hearken, ye shall eat the good of the land;
ISA.1.20	But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of the 
ISA.1.21	How is the faithful city become a harlot! It was full of judgment; righteousness lodged in it, but now murderers.
ISA.1.22	Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:
ISA.1.23	Thy princes are rebellious and companions of thieves; every one loves bribes and follows after rewards; they do not hear the fatherless in judgment, neither does the cause of the widow come unto them.
ISA.1.24	Therefore saith the Lord, the 
ISA.1.25	and I will turn my hand upon thee and according to pureness purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin;
ISA.1.26	and I will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counsellors as at the beginning; afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, the faithful city.
ISA.1.27	Zion shall be ransomed with judgment and her converts with righteousness.
ISA.1.28	And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together, and those that forsook the 
ISA.1.29	For ye shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the groves that ye have chosen.
ISA.1.30	For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf falls and as a garden that has no water.
ISA.1.31	And the strong idol shall be as tow and the maker of it as a spark, and they shall both burn together, and no one shall be able to quench them.
ISA.2.1	The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.
ISA.2.2	And it shall come to pass in the last of the days or times, that the mountain of the 
ISA.2.3	And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
ISA.2.4	And he shall judge among the Gentiles and shall rebuke many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.
ISA.2.5	O house of Jacob, come and let us walk in the light of the 
ISA.2.6	Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are replenished from the east and are soothsayers like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the children of strangers.
ISA.2.7	Their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:
ISA.2.8	Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:
ISA.2.9	And the mean man bows down, and the great man humbles himself; therefore thou shalt not forgive them.
ISA.2.10	Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust from the terrible presence of the 
ISA.2.11	The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and the 
ISA.2.12	For the day of the 
ISA.2.13	And upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up and upon all the oaks of Bashan,
ISA.2.14	and upon all the high mountains and upon all the hills that are lifted up,
ISA.2.15	and upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,
ISA.2.16	and upon all the ships of Tarshish and upon all pleasant pictures.
ISA.2.17	And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be made low; and the 
ISA.2.18	And he shall utterly abolish the idols.
ISA.2.19	And they shall go into the holes of the rocks and into the caves of the earth, because of the terrible presence of the 
ISA.2.20	In that day man shall cast his idols of silver and his idols of gold (which they made each one for himself to worship) into the caves of the moles and of the bats,
ISA.2.21	to go into the clefts of the rocks and into the caverns of the cliffs from before the fearful presence of the 
ISA.2.22	Cease from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for of what is he to be accounted of?
ISA.3.1	For, behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.3.2	the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, the fortune-teller and the ancient,
ISA.3.3	the captain of fifty and the honourable man and the counsellor and the cunning artificer and the eloquent wise man.
ISA.3.4	And I will give children to be their princes, and young fools shall rule over them.
ISA.3.5	And the people shall do violence, one against another, and each one against his neighbour; the child shall rise up against the ancient and the base against the honourable.
ISA.3.6	When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand;
ISA.3.7	in that day he shall swear, saying, I will not be a healer for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: do not make me a ruler of the people.
ISA.3.8	For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen because their tongue and their doings have been against the 
ISA.3.9	The appearance of their countenance witnesses against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom; they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! For they have rewarded evil unto themselves.
ISA.3.10	Say unto the righteous that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat of the fruit of their doings.
ISA.3.11	Woe unto the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for according to the work of his hands it shall be done unto him.
ISA.3.12	The oppressors of my people are many, and women rule over him. O my people, those who lead thee cause thee to err and twist the way of thy paths.
ISA.3.13	The 
ISA.3.14	The 
ISA.3.15	What do you mean that ye beat my people to pieces and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of the hosts.
ISA.3.16	Moreover the 
ISA.3.17	Therefore the Lord will make bare the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the 
ISA.3.18	In that day the Lord will take away the adornment of their shoes and their hair nets and their crystals,
ISA.3.19	the chains and the jewels and the bracelets,
ISA.3.20	the bonnets and the ornaments of the legs and the headbands and the powders and the earrings,
ISA.3.21	the rings, and nose jewels,
ISA.3.22	the changeable suits of apparel and the mantles and the veils and the crisping pins,
ISA.3.23	the looking glasses and the fine linen and the hoods and the hairdos.
ISA.3.24	And it shall come to pass that instead of sweet perfumes, there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent and instead of well-set hair baldness and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth and burning instead of beauty.
ISA.3.25	Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.
ISA.3.26	Thy gates shall lament and mourn, and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.
ISA.4.1	And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread and wear our own apparel; only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach.
ISA.4.2	In that day the branch of the 
ISA.4.3	And it shall come to pass that he that is left in Zion and he that remains in Jerusalem shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem,
ISA.4.4	When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning.
ISA.4.5	And the 
ISA.4.6	And there shall be a covert for a shadow in the daytime from the heat and for a place of refuge and for a shelter from storm and from rain.
ISA.5.1	Now will I sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard in the horn of the sons of oil;
ISA.5.2	and he had fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a winepress therein; and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.
ISA.5.3	And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? Therefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, did it bring forth wild grapes?
ISA.5.5	And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up; and break down its wall, and it shall be trodden down:
ISA.5.6	And I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned, nor hoed; but briers and thorns shall come up there; I will even command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.
ISA.5.7	For the vineyard of the 
ISA.5.8	Woe unto those that join house to house, that lay field to field, until they have done away with the borders! Will ye dwell alone in the midst of the earth?
ISA.5.9	In my ears, the 
ISA.5.10	For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah.
ISA.5.11	Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may continue their drunkenness; that continue until night until wine inflames them!
ISA.5.12	And the harp and the viol, the tambourine and flutes and wine are in their feasts; but they do not regard the work of the 
ISA.5.13	Therefore my people are gone into captivity because they have no knowledge; their glory died of hunger, and their multitude dried up of thirst.
ISA.5.14	Therefore Sheol has enlarged himself and opened his mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude descended into it and their pomp and he that rejoiced in him.
ISA.5.15	And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:
ISA.5.16	But the 
ISA.5.17	Then the lambs shall be fed after their manner, and strangers shall eat the fat ones that are forsaken.
ISA.5.18	Woe unto those that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as it were with a cart rope,
ISA.5.19	that say, Let him make speed and hasten his work that we may see it, and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come that we may know it!
ISA.5.20	Woe unto those that call evil good and good evil; that put darkness for light and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!
ISA.5.21	Woe unto those that are wise in their own eyes and prudent in their own sight!
ISA.5.22	Woe unto those that are mighty to drink wine and men of strength to mingle strong drink;
ISA.5.23	who justify the wicked for bribes and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!
ISA.5.24	Therefore as the fire devours the stubble and the flame consumes the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go away as dust because they have cast away the law of the 
ISA.5.25	Therefore is the anger of the 
ISA.5.26	And he will lift up a banner as an example to Gentiles that are far and will hiss unto those that are in the end of the earth; and behold, they shall come with speed swiftly:
ISA.5.27	None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken;
ISA.5.28	whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses’ hoofs shall be counted like flint, and the wheels of their chariots like a whirlwind;
ISA.5.29	their roaring shall be like a lion: they shall roar like young lions; they shall gnash their teeth and lay hold of the prey and shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.
ISA.5.30	And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring of the sea; and if one looks unto the land, behold darkness and sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.
ISA.6.1	In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
ISA.6.2	Above it stood the seraphims; each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.
ISA.6.3	And one cried out unto another and said, Holy, holy, holy is the 
ISA.6.4	And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.
ISA.6.5	Then I said, Woe is me! for I am dead because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the 
ISA.6.6	Then one of the seraphim flew unto me, having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:
ISA.6.7	And he laid it upon my mouth and said, Behold, this has touched thy lips; and it shall take away thy guilt, and thy sin shall be cleansed.
ISA.6.8	After this, I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I answered, Here am I; send me.
ISA.6.9	Then he said, Go and tell this people, Hear indeed, but do not understand; and see indeed, but do not perceive.
ISA.6.10	Make the heart of this people fat and make their ears heavy and blind their eyes that they not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their heart, nor convert and there be healing for him.
ISA.6.11	And I said, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities are wasted without inhabitant and not a man in the houses, and the land is turned into desert,
ISA.6.12	until the 
ISA.6.13	But yet in it shall remain a tenth, and it shall return and shall be razed; as the teil tree and as the oak, of which the stump remains alive when they are cut down, likewise in these his stump shall remain holy seed.
ISA.7.1	And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.
ISA.7.2	And it was told the house of David, saying Syria is confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved and the heart of his people as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind.
ISA.7.3	Then the 
ISA.7.4	and say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; do not fear, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.
ISA.7.5	Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have taken evil counsel against thee saying,
ISA.7.6	Let us go up against Judah and vex it, and let us divide it between us and set a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeal:
ISA.7.7	Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it come to pass.
ISA.7.8	For the head of Syria shall be Damascus, and the head of Damascus Rezin; and within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken, and it shall never again be a people.
ISA.7.9	In the meantime the head of Ephraim shall be Samaria, and the head of Samaria, Remaliah’s son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.
ISA.7.10	Moreover the 
ISA.7.11	Ask a sign of the 
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the 
ISA.7.13	Then said Isaiah, Hear ye now, O house of David, Is it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?
ISA.7.14	Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Immanuel.
ISA.7.15	He shall eat butter and honey that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good.
ISA.7.16	For before the child shall know to refuse the evil and choose the good; the land that thou dost abhor shall be forsaken of both her kings.
ISA.7.17	The 
ISA.7.18	And it shall come to pass in that day, that the 
ISA.7.19	And they shall come and all of them shall rest in the desolate valleys and in the holes of the rocks and upon all thorns and upon all bushes.
ISA.7.20	In the same day the Lord shall raze with a razor that is hired, namely, by them beyond the river by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet and it shall also consume the beard.
ISA.7.21	And it shall come to pass in that day that a man shall nourish a young cow and two sheep;
ISA.7.22	and it shall come to pass for the abundance of milk that they shall give, he shall eat butter; for butter and honey shall every one eat that is left in the land.
ISA.7.23	And it shall come to pass in that day that in the place where there were a thousand vines that were worth a thousand shekels of silver, it shall even be for the briers and for the thorns.
ISA.7.24	With arrows and with bows shall men come there because all the land shall become briers and thorns.
ISA.7.25	But the fear of briers and thorns shall not come unto all the hills that were dug with the hoe, but they shall be for pasture of oxen and for the treading of the lesser cattle.
ISA.8.1	Moreover the 
ISA.8.2	And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the priest and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.
ISA.8.3	And I went unto the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the 
ISA.8.4	For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.
ISA.8.5	The 
ISA.8.6	Forasmuch as this people refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly and rejoiced in Rezin and Remaliah’s son,
ISA.8.7	now therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon them the waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of Assyria and all his power, and he shall come up over all his channels and go over all his banks:
ISA.8.8	And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.
ISA.8.9	strong> 
ISA.8.9	 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries, prepare yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces.
ISA.8.10	Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the word, and it shall not stand, for God is with us.
ISA.8.11	For the 
ISA.8.12	Do not say, A confederacy, to all those to whom this people shall say, A confederacy; neither fear their fear, nor be afraid.
ISA.8.13	Sanctify the 
ISA.8.14	Then he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock to cause a fall to both the houses of Israel, for a snare and for a net to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
ISA.8.15	And many among them shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken.
ISA.8.16	Bind up the testimony; seal the law among my disciples.
ISA.8.17	And I will wait for the 
ISA.8.18	Behold, I and the children whom the 
ISA.8.19	And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto spiritists and unto wizards that peep and that mutter; shall the people not seek unto their God? Shall we appeal for the living unto the dead?
ISA.8.20	To the law and to the testimony! If they do not speak according to this word, it is because there is no light in them.
ISA.8.21	Then they shall pass through this land, fatigued and hungry, and it shall come to pass that when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves and curse their king and their God. And raising their face high,
ISA.8.22	they shall look upon the earth and behold tribulation and gross darkness, darkness and anguish; and they shall be submerged in gross darkness.
ISA.9.1	Nevertheless this darkness shall not be the same as the affliction that came upon her when they lightly touched the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, nor afterward when they more grievously afflicted her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, in Galilee of the Gentiles.
ISA.9.2	The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; those that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them has the light shined.
ISA.9.3	As thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast not increased the joy. They shall rejoice before thee as they rejoice in the harvest and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
ISA.9.4	For thou hast broken his heavy yoke and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of Midian.
ISA.9.5	For every battle of him who fights is with shaking of the earth and the rolling of garments in blood; but this shall be with burning and consuming of fire.
ISA.9.6	For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government is placed upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called The Wonderful One, The Counsellor, The God, The Mighty One, The Eternal Father, The Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	The multitude of his dominion and the peace shall have no end upon the throne of David and upon his Kingdom, ordering it and confirming it in judgment and in righteousness from now on even for ever. The zeal of the 
ISA.9.8	The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted upon Israel.
ISA.9.9	And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and arrogance of heart,
ISA.9.10	The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the wild fig trees are cut down, but we will put cedars in their place.
ISA.9.11	Therefore the 
ISA.9.12	the Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.9.13	But the people did not turn unto him that smote them, neither did they seek the 
ISA.9.14	Therefore the 
ISA.9.15	The ancient and venerable to look upon is the head; the prophet that teaches lies, he is the tail.
ISA.9.16	For the governors of this people are deceivers, and those who are governed by them are lost.
ISA.9.17	Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall he have mercy on their fatherless and widows, for every one is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.9.18	For wickedness burns as the fire, it shall devour the briers and thorns and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest, and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.
ISA.9.19	Through the wrath of the 
ISA.9.20	And he shall snatch on the right hand and be hungry, and he shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied; they shall eat each man the flesh of his own arm:
ISA.9.21	Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh; and they together shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.1	Woe unto those that establish unrighteous laws and that wilfully prescribe tyranny
ISA.10.2	to turn aside the poor from right judgment and to take away the right from the afflicted of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fatherless!
ISA.10.3	And what will ye do in the day of visitation and in the desolation which shall come from far? To whom will ye flee for help and where will ye leave your glory?
ISA.10.4	They shall bow down among the prisoners, and they shall fall among the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.
ISA.10.5	O Assyrian, rod and staff of my anger, in thy hand have I placed my indignation.
ISA.10.6	I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and upon the people of my wrath will I send him to take spoil and to take prey and to ready them that they might be tread down like the mire of the streets.
ISA.10.7	Howbeit he shall not think like this; not even in his heart shall he imagine this way of doing things, but his thought shall be to destroy and cut off nations not a few.
ISA.10.8	For he shall say, Are not my princes altogether kings?
ISA.10.9	Is not Calno as Carchemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not Samaria as Damascus?
ISA.10.10	As my hand has found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose graven images did excel those of Jerusalem and of Samaria;
ISA.10.11	shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do to Jerusalem and her idols?
ISA.10.12	Therefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord has performed his whole work upon Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I will come upon the fruit of the pride of the heart of the king of Assyria, and upon the glory of his high looks.
ISA.10.13	For he said, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom; for I have been prudent: and I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and I have cast down as valiant ones those who were seated:
ISA.10.14	And my hand has found as a nest the riches of the peoples: and as one gathers eggs that are left, I have taken control over all the earth; and there was no one that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or peeped.
ISA.10.15	Shall the axe boast itself against him that hews with it? or shall the saw magnify itself against him that moves it? as if the rod should rise up against those that lift it up, or as if the staff should lift itself up. Is it not wood?
ISA.10.16	Therefore shall the Lord, the 
ISA.10.17	And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his briers in one day;
ISA.10.18	and shall consume the glory of his forest and of his fruitful field, from the soul unto the flesh; and they shall come to be as a standard-bearer in defeat.
ISA.10.19	And the trees that shall remain in his forest shall be in number such that a child may count them.
ISA.10.20	And it shall come to pass in that day that those who shall be left of Israel and those who shall be left of the house of Jacob shall no more again stay upon him that smote them, but shall stay upon the 
ISA.10.21	The remnant shall become converted, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the mighty God.
ISA.10.22	For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet the remnant of them shall become converted; when the consumption comes to an end, righteousness shall overflow.
ISA.10.23	For the Lord GOD of the hosts shall make a consumption and an end in the midst of all the land.
ISA.10.24	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of the hosts, O my people, dweller of Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian; he shall smite thee with a rod and shall lift up his stick against thee by the way of Egypt;
ISA.10.25	yet from now until a very little while the indignation and my anger shall cease, to make an end of them.
ISA.10.26	And the 
ISA.10.27	And it shall come to pass in that day that his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall be consumed in the presence of the anointing.
ISA.10.28	He is come to Aiath; he is passed unto Migron; in Michmash he shall number his army:
ISA.10.29	They are gone over the fords; they have taken up their lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.
ISA.10.30	Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim; Laish cause poor Anathoth to hear thee.
ISA.10.31	Madmenah is in upheaval; the inhabitants of Gebim shall gather themselves together.
ISA.10.32	Even yet shall come a day when he shall rest at Nob; he shall raise his hand unto the mountain of the daughter of Zion unto the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	Behold, the Lord, the 
ISA.10.34	And he shall cut down the thickness of the forest with iron, and Lebanon shall fall by force.
ISA.11.1	And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:
ISA.11.2	And the Spirit of the 
ISA.11.3	and shall make him of quick olfaction in the fear of the 
ISA.11.4	But with righteousness shall he judge the poor and reprove with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall smite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the spirit of his lips he shall slay the wicked.
ISA.11.5	And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faith the girdle of his kidneys.
ISA.11.6	The wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a child shall shepherd them.
ISA.11.7	The cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
ISA.11.8	And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice’ den.
ISA.11.9	They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the 
ISA.11.10	And it shall be in that day that the Root of Jesse, who shall be lifted up as a banner, as an example to the Gentiles shall be sought by the Gentiles; and his Kingdom of peace shall be glorious.
ISA.11.11	And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall return to set his hand again to possess the remnant of his people which were left from Assyria and from Egypt and from Pathros and from Cush and from Elam and from Shinar and from Hamath and from the islands of the sea.
ISA.11.12	And he shall raise up a banner, as an example for the Gentiles and shall assemble the outcasts of Israel and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.
ISA.11.13	The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off; Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.
ISA.11.14	But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines toward the west; they shall spoil those of the east together; they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the sons of Ammon shall obey them.
ISA.11.15	And the 
ISA.11.16	And there shall be a highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left from Assyria like as it was for Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	And in that day thou shalt say, O 
ISA.12.2	Behold, O God my saving health, I will trust and not be afraid for JAH, the 
ISA.12.3	Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of saving health.
ISA.12.4	And in that day ye shall say, Sing unto the 
ISA.12.5	Sing psalms unto the 
ISA.12.6	Rejoice and sing, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.
ISA.13.1	The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw.
ISA.13.2	Lift ye up a banner as an example upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, raise the hand, that they may enter in by gates of princes.
ISA.13.3	I have commanded my sanctified ones; I have also called my mighty ones for my anger that they might rejoice with my glory.
ISA.13.4	The noise of a multitude in the mountains like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of kingdoms, of Gentiles gathered together: the 
ISA.13.5	They come from a far land, from the end of the heavens, even the 
ISA.13.6	Howl; for the day of the 
ISA.13.7	Therefore all hands shall be faint, and every heart of man shall melt:
ISA.13.8	And they shall be filled with terror; anguish and pain shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travails: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.
ISA.13.9	Behold, the day of the 
ISA.13.10	For this reason the stars of the heavens and the lights thereof shall not shine: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not give forth her light.
ISA.13.11	And I will visit evil upon the world and iniquity upon the wicked, and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease and will lay low the haughtiness of the strong.
ISA.13.12	I will make the noble man more precious than fine gold and man more than the gold of Ophir.
ISA.13.13	Because I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall be moved out of her place, in the indignation of the 
ISA.13.14	And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep without a shepherd: they shall each man look unto his own people, and flee each one unto his own land.
ISA.13.15	Every one that is found shall be thrust through, and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.
ISA.13.16	Their children shall also be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.
ISA.13.17	Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not look for silver, nor covet gold.
ISA.13.18	They shall shoot at the young boys with bows, and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare the sons.
ISA.13.19	And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
ISA.13.20	It shall never again be inhabited; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation; neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there, neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
ISA.13.21	But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures, and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.
ISA.13.22	And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their palaces, and dragons in their pleasant palaces; and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.
ISA.14.1	For the 
ISA.14.2	And the peoples shall take them and bring them to their place; and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the 
ISA.14.3	And it shall come to pass in the day that the 
ISA.14.4	that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon and say, How has the oppressor ceased! The city that covets gold has ceased!
ISA.14.5	The 
ISA.14.6	who smote the peoples in wrath with a continual stroke, he that ruled the Gentiles in anger and who did not defend the persecuted.
ISA.14.7	The whole earth is at rest and is quiet; they sing praises.
ISA.14.8	Even the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon, saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against us.
ISA.14.9	Sheol from beneath is aghast at thee; it stirs up the dead to meet thee at thy coming; it has raised up from their thrones all the princes of the earth, all the kings of the Gentiles.
ISA.14.10	They all shall shout and say unto thee, Art thou also become sick as we? Art thou become like unto us?
ISA.14.11	Thy pride is brought down to Sheol, and the noise of thy viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.
ISA.14.12	How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! How art thou cut down to the ground, who didst claim the Gentiles as an inheritance!
ISA.14.13	Thou who said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven; upon high next to the stars of God I will exalt my throne: and I will sit upon the mount of the testimony and in the sides of the north;
ISA.14.14	I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the most High.
ISA.14.15	Yet thou shalt be cast down to Sheol, to the sides of the pit.
ISA.14.16	Those that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble; that shook the kingdoms;
ISA.14.17	that made the world as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof; that did not open the prison to his prisoners?
ISA.14.18	All the kings of the Gentiles, even all of them, lie in glory, each one in his own house.
ISA.14.19	But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that went down to the bottom of the pit, as a carcase trodden under feet.
ISA.14.20	Thou shalt not be numbered with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people; the seed of evildoers shall not be forever.
ISA.14.21	Prepare slaughter for his sons for the iniquity of their fathers that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill the face of the world with cities.
ISA.14.22	For I will rise up upon them, saith the 
ISA.14.23	I will also make it a possession for the bittern and pools of water, and I will sweep it with brooms of destruction, saith the 
ISA.14.24	The 
ISA.14.25	That I will break the Assyrian in my land and upon my mountains tread him under foot; then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.
ISA.14.26	This is the counsel that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the Gentiles.
ISA.14.27	For the 
ISA.14.28	In the year that King Ahaz died was this burden.
ISA.14.29	Rejoice not thou, whole Philistia, because thou didst break the rod of him that smote thee: for out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.
ISA.14.30	And the firstborn of the poor shall be fed, and the needy shall lie down in safety; and I will cause thy root to die of famine, and he shall slay thy remnant.
ISA.14.31	Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Philistia, art dissolved; for there shall come from the north a smoke, and not one shall be left in thy assemblies.
ISA.14.32	What shall one then answer the messengers of the Gentiles? That the 
ISA.15.1	The burden of Moab. Certainly in the night Ar of Moab was laid waste and brought to silence; certainly in the night Kir of Moab was laid waste and brought to silence.
ISA.15.2	He is gone up to Bajith and to Dibon, the altars, to weep; Moab shall howl over Nebo and over Medeba: every head among her shall become bald, and every beard shall be cut off.
ISA.15.3	In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth; on the tops of their houses and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping as they come down.
ISA.15.4	And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard even unto Jahaz; therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall cry out; each one of them shall cry out for his soul.
ISA.15.5	My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall go up with weeping by the hill of Luhith unto Zoar, a heifer of three years; for in the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.
ISA.15.6	For the waters of Nimrim have run out: for the grass of the courtyard is withered away, the herb fails, there is no green thing.
ISA.15.7	Therefore that which each one has laid up and their riches they shall carry away to the brook of the willows.
ISA.15.8	For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim and the clamour thereof unto Beerelim.
ISA.15.9	For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood; for I will bring more upon Dimon: lions upon him that escapes of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.
ISA.16.1	Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land, from the rock of the wilderness unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.
ISA.16.2	For it shall be that as a wandering bird cast out of the nest so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.
ISA.16.3	Take counsel; execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; do not betray him that escapes.
ISA.16.4	Let my outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to them from the presence of the destroyer; for the extortioner shall come to an end, the destroyer shall cease, the oppressor shall be consumed out of the land.
ISA.16.5	And in mercy shall the throne be established; and he shall sit upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging and seeking judgment and hastening righteousness.
ISA.16.6	We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud, even of his haughtiness and his pride and his wrath, but his lies shall not be so.
ISA.16.7	Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab; every one shall howl; for the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are stricken.
ISA.16.8	For the vines of Heshbon were cut off and the vines of Sibmah; the lords of the Gentiles have trodden down the offshoots thereof, which had come even unto Jazer and extended through the wilderness; they had gone over the sea.
ISA.16.9	Therefore I will bewail with the weeping Jazer of the vine of Sibmah; I will cause thee to drink my tears, O Heshbon and Elealeh, for the song shall cease upon thy summer fruits and thy harvest.
ISA.16.10	And gladness is taken away and joy out of the fertile field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither shall there be rejoicing: the treaders shall tread out no wine in their presses; I have made their vintage song to cease.
ISA.16.11	Therefore my bowels shall sound like a harp for Moab and my inward parts for Kirharesh.
ISA.16.12	And it shall come to pass when it is seen that Moab is weary upon the high places that he shall come to his sanctuary to pray, but he shall be unable to.
ISA.16.13	This is the word that the 
ISA.16.14	But now the 
ISA.17.1	The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.
ISA.17.2	The cities of Aroer are forsaken; they shall be for flocks, which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.
ISA.17.3	The succour of Ephraim shall cease, and the kingdom from Damascus and the remnant of Syria; they shall be as the glory of the sons of Israel, saith the 
ISA.17.4	And in that day it shall come to pass that the glory of Jacob shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax lean.
ISA.17.5	And it shall be as when the harvestman gathers the sheaves and reaps the grain with his arm; and it shall be as he that gathers grain in the valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.6	Yet gleaning shall be left in it as when the olive tree is shaken; two or three berries are left in the top of the uppermost bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof, saith the 
ISA.17.7	At that day man shall look to his Maker, and his eyes shall see the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.17.8	And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands; neither shall he look upon that which his fingers have made, either the groves or the images of the sun.
ISA.17.9	In that day the cities of his strength shall be as the gleanings which remain on the shoots and on the branches, which were left of the sons of Israel; and there shall be desolation.
ISA.17.10	Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy saving health and hast not been mindful of the Rock of thy strength; therefore thou shalt plant pleasant plants and set it with strange slips:
ISA.17.11	In the day that thou shalt plant them, thou shalt make them to grow and shalt make thy seed to flourish early; but in the day of gathering, the harvest shall flee and shall be desperate sorrow.
ISA.17.12	Woe to the multitude of many peoples, which shall make a noise like the noise of the sea; and the rushing of nations, that make an uprising like the rushing of mighty waters!
ISA.17.13	The peoples shall make noise like the rushing of great waters, but God shall reprehend them, and they shall flee far off and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind and like the tumbleweed before the whirlwind.
ISA.17.14	And behold at eveningtide trouble, and before the morning she is not. This is the portion of them that tread on us and the lot of them that spoil us.
ISA.18.1	Woe to the land which makes shade with her wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia:
ISA.18.2	He who sends ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to the people scattered and peeled, to the people full of fears from their beginning, and until now, a people tired of waiting and trodden down, whose land the rivers have spoiled!
ISA.18.3	All ye inhabitants of the world and neighbours of the land, when he lifts up a banner as an example on the mountains, ye shall see it; and when he blows the shofar, ye shall hear it.
ISA.18.4	For so the 
ISA.18.5	For before the harvest, when the fruit is perfect, and after the flower is past and the fruit is mature, then he shall both cut off the sprigs with pruning hooks and take away and cut down the branches.
ISA.18.6	They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains and to the beasts of the earth; and the fowls shall summer upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon them.
ISA.18.7	In that time the present shall be brought unto the 
ISA.19.1	The burden of Egypt. Behold, the 
ISA.19.2	And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians, and they shall fight each one against his brother, and each one against his neighbour; city against city and kingdom against kingdom.
ISA.19.3	And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof, and I will destroy the counsel thereof; and they shall seek to the idols and to the charmers and to the spiritists and to the wizards.
ISA.19.4	And I will give the Egyptians over into the hand of a cruel lord; and a violent king shall rule over them, saith the Lord, the 
ISA.19.5	And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be wasted and dried up.
ISA.19.6	And they shall turn the rivers far away, and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried up; the reeds and flags shall wither.
ISA.19.7	The vegetables by the river, by the mouth of the river, and every thing sown beside the river shall dry up, wither away, and be no more.
ISA.19.8	The fishermen also shall mourn, and all those that cast fishhooks into the river shall lament, and those that spread nets upon the waters shall languish.
ISA.19.9	Moreover those that work in fine flax and those that weave networks shall be confounded.
ISA.19.10	Because all their nets shall be broken; all that make ponds to raise fish shall be discontented.
ISA.19.11	Surely the princes of Zoan are fools; the counsel of the prudent counsellors of Pharaoh is become carnal; how say ye unto Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of the ancient kings?
ISA.19.12	Where are they? Where are thy wise men? Let them tell thee now, or let them cause thee to know what the 
ISA.19.13	The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even those that are the stay of the tribes thereof.
ISA.19.14	The 
ISA.19.15	Neither shall it be of any value unto Egypt, any work which the head or tail, branch or rush, may do.
ISA.19.16	In that day Egypt shall be like unto women, and it shall be afraid and fear in the presence of the tall hand of the 
ISA.19.17	And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt; every one that makes mention of it shall be afraid in himself because of the counsel of the 
ISA.19.18	In that day five cities in the land of Egypt shall speak the language of Canaan and swear to the 
ISA.19.19	In that day shall there be an altar to the 
ISA.19.20	And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the 
ISA.19.21	And the 
ISA.19.22	And the 
ISA.19.23	In that day there shall be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve the 
ISA.19.24	In that day Israel shall be the third part with Egypt and with Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the earth.
ISA.19.25	For the 
ISA.20.1	In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod (when Sargon the king of Assyria sent him) and fought against Ashdod and took it;
ISA.20.2	at the same time the 
ISA.20.3	And the 
ISA.20.4	so shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt.
ISA.20.5	And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their hope and of Egypt their glory.
ISA.20.6	And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold, such was our hope which we clung to for help that we might be free from the presence of the king of Assyria. How shall we escape?
ISA.21.1	The burden of the desert of the sea. As the whirlwinds which pass through the wilderness in the land of the south, so they come from the terrible land.
ISA.21.2	A grievous vision is shown unto me. For one who is treacherous, another who deals treacherously, and for one destroyer, another destroyer. Rise up, Elam; besiege Media; all the sighing thereof I have made to cease.
ISA.21.3	Therefore my loins are filled with pain; pangs have taken hold upon me as the pangs of a woman that travails; I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.
ISA.21.4	My heart panted; the horror frightened me; the night of my pleasure he has turned into fear unto me.
ISA.21.5	Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink; arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.
ISA.21.6	For thus has the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman who shall declare what he sees.
ISA.21.7	And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; then he looked with more diligence;
ISA.21.8	and he cried, A lion upon the watchman. My lord, I stand continually all the day and all night long upon my watchtower.
ISA.21.9	And, behold, this chariot of men comes with a couple of horsemen. Afterwards he spoke and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he has broken unto the ground.
ISA.21.10	O my harvest, and the people of my threshing floor, that which I have heard of the 
ISA.21.11	The burden of Dumah. He calls to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of this night? Watchman, what of this night?
ISA.21.12	The watchman said, The morning comes and then the night; if ye will enquire, enquire ye; return, and come.
ISA.21.13	The burden upon Arabia. In the forest ye shall pass the night in Arabia, O ye walkers of Dedanim.
ISA.21.14	Go ye out to meet them bringing water for the thirsty, O inhabitants of the land of Tema; succour those who are fleeing with your bread.
ISA.21.15	For they flee from the presence of the sword, from the presence of the drawn sword, from the presence of the bent bow, from the presence of the grievousness of the battle.
ISA.21.16	For thus has the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of a hireling, all the glory of Kedar shall be undone:
ISA.21.17	And the residue of the number of valiant archers, sons of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the 
ISA.22.1	The burden of the valley of the vision. What ails thee now that thou art completely gone up to the housetops?
ISA.22.2	Thou that art full of tumults, a tumultuous city, a joyous city, thy dead are not slain with the sword nor slain in battle.
ISA.22.3	All thy princes together fled from the bow; they were bound; all that were found in thee were bound together; the others fled far away.
ISA.22.4	Therefore I said, Leave me; I will weep bitterly; do not labour to comfort me of the destruction of the daughter of my people.
ISA.22.5	For a day of trouble and of treading down and of wearing down by the Lord GOD of the hosts is sent in the valley of the vision to break down the wall and give a cry unto the mountain.
ISA.22.6	Also Elam bore the quiver in a chariot of men and of horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.
ISA.22.7	And it came to pass, that thy choicest valleys were full of chariots, and the soldiers set themselves in array at the gate.
ISA.22.8	And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look in that day to the house of weapons of the forest.
ISA.22.9	Ye have also seen the breaches of the city of David that they are multiplied, and ye gathered together the waters of the lower pool.
ISA.22.10	And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and ye have broken down houses to fortify the wall.
ISA.22.11	Ye also made a moat between the two walls with the water of the old pool, but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof, nor had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.
ISA.22.12	Therefore the Lord GOD of the hosts did call in this day unto weeping and to mourning and to baldness and to girding with sackcloth:
ISA.22.13	And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine while they say, let us eat and drink for tomorrow we shall die.
ISA.22.14	This was revealed in my ears by the 
ISA.22.15	Thus saith the Lord GOD of the hosts, Go, get thee unto this treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,
ISA.22.16	What hast thou here? or whom hast thou here that thou hast hewed thee out a sepulchre here as he that hews himself out a sepulchre on a high place or that graves a habitation for himself in a rock?
ISA.22.17	Behold, the 
ISA.22.18	He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a large country, there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of thy glory shall come to an end, the shame of the house of thy Lord.
ISA.22.19	And I will drive thee from thy place, and he shall pull thee down from thy state.
ISA.22.20	And it shall come to pass in that day that I will call my slave Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:
ISA.22.21	And I will clothe him with thy robe and strengthen him with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand, and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah.
ISA.22.22	And the key of the house of David I will lay upon his shoulder; so he shall open, and no one shall shut; and he shall shut, and no one shall open.
ISA.22.23	And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place, and he shall be for a glorious throne to his father’s house.
ISA.22.24	And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father’s house, the sons and the grandsons, all the vessels of small quantity, from the cups to drink from even unto all the instruments of music.
ISA.22.25	In that day, saith the 
ISA.23.1	The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in; from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.
ISA.23.2	Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou mart of Zidon, that by passing over the sea thou wert replenished.
ISA.23.3	Her provision was from the plantings that grow with the many waters of the Nile, of the harvest of the river. She was also the mart of the Gentiles.
ISA.23.4	Be thou ashamed, O Zidon, for the sea has spoken, even the strength of the sea, saying, I have never travailed nor brought forth children, neither did I nourish up young men nor bring up virgins.
ISA.23.5	When the report comes unto Egypt, they shall be sorely pained at the news from Tyre.
ISA.23.6	Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.
ISA.23.7	Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days? Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.
ISA.23.8	Who has decreed this against Tyre, the crowning city, whose merchants were princes, whose traders were the honourable of the earth?
ISA.23.9	The 
ISA.23.10	Pass by as a river from thy land, O daughter of Tarshish; for thou shalt have no more strength.
ISA.23.11	He stretched out his hand over the sea; he shook the kingdoms; the 
ISA.23.12	And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed virgin, daughter of Zidon; arise, pass over to Chittim, and even there thou shalt have no rest.
ISA.23.13	Behold the land of the Chaldeans. This people was not until the Assyrian founded it for those that dwell in the wilderness; they set up its towers; they raised up its palaces, and he brought it to ruin.
ISA.23.14	Howl, ye ships of Tarshish, for your strength is laid waste.
ISA.23.15	And it shall come to pass in that day that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years according to the days of one king; after the end of seventy years Tyre shall sing as a harlot.
ISA.23.16	Take a harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; make sweet melody, sing the song again that thou may be remembered.
ISA.23.17	And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that the 
ISA.23.18	But her profit and her hire shall be consecrated unto the 
ISA.24.1	Behold, the 
ISA.24.2	And it shall be, as with the people so with the priest; as with the slave so with his master; as with the maid so with her mistress; as with the buyer so with the seller; as with the lender so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury so with the giver of usury to him.
ISA.24.3	The land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled: for the 
ISA.24.4	The earth has destroyed itself and fallen; the world has become sick and fallen; the haughty peoples of the earth are become sick.
ISA.24.5	The earth is also become bankrupt under its inhabitants because they have transgressed the laws, falsified the order, broken the everlasting covenant.
ISA.24.6	Therefore the curse has consumed the earth, and those that dwell therein are found guilty; therefore, the inhabitants of the earth are consumed, and few men left.
ISA.24.7	The new wine is lost; the vine is sick; all those who were merryhearted sigh.
ISA.24.8	The mirth of tambourines ceases; the noise of those that rejoice ends; the joy of the harp ceases.
ISA.24.9	They shall not drink wine with a song; the drink shall be bitter to them that would drink it.
ISA.24.10	The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up that no man may come in.
ISA.24.11	There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is darkened; the mirth of the land is gone.
ISA.24.12	In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with destruction.
ISA.24.13	For thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the peoples as the shaking of an olive tree, as the gleanings when the vintage is done.
ISA.24.14	These shall lift up their voice; they shall sing joyfully in the majesty of the 
ISA.24.15	Therefore glorify ye the 
ISA.24.16	From the uttermost part of the earth we have heard psalms, Glory to the righteous one. But I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto me! The treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously; yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.
ISA.24.17	Fear and the pit and the snare are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth.
ISA.24.18	And it shall come to pass that he who shall flee from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that shall come up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: because from on high, windows have been opened, and the foundations of the earth shall shake.
ISA.24.19	The earth shall be utterly broken down; the earth is clean dissolved; the earth is moved exceedingly.
ISA.24.20	The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard and shall be removed like a cottage; and its transgression shall be heavy upon it; and it shall fall and never rise again.
ISA.24.21	And it shall come to pass in that day that the 
ISA.24.22	And they shall be gathered together as prisoners are gathered in the pit and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many days they shall be visited.
ISA.24.23	Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when the 
ISA.25.1	O 
ISA.25.2	That thou hast turned the city into a heap; the defenced city into a ruin: the palace of strangers to not be a city; it shall never be rebuilt.
ISA.25.3	Therefore the strong people shall glorify thee; the city of the strong Gentiles shall fear thee.
ISA.25.4	For thou hast been strength to the poor, strength to the needy in his distress, refuge from the storm, shadow from the heat, for the force of the violent is as a storm against the wall.
ISA.25.5	As the heat in a dry place, thou shalt bring down the pride of the strangers; even as with heat that burns beneath a cloud, thou shalt cause the offshoot of the stout ones to wither.
ISA.25.6	And in this mountain the 
ISA.25.7	And he will undo in this mountain the mask of the covering with which all the peoples are covered and the veil that is extended over all the Gentiles.
ISA.25.8	He will destroy death forever; and the Lord GOD shall wipe away every tear from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people he shall take away from off all the earth: for the 
ISA.25.9	And it shall be said in that day, Behold, this is our God, whom we have waited for, and he has saved us: this is the 
ISA.25.10	For in this mountain the hand of the 
ISA.25.11	And he shall extend his hand in the midst of him as he that swims spreads forth his hand to swim: and he shall bring down his pride with the members of his hands
ISA.25.12	and lay siege to the fortress of thy high walls; he shall humble it and bring it down to the ground, even to the dust.
ISA.26.1	In that day they shall sing this song in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; God has appointed saving health for walls and bulwarks.
ISA.26.2	Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keeps the truth may enter in.
ISA.26.3	Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusts in thee.
ISA.26.4	Trust ye in the 
ISA.26.5	For he has brought down those that dwelt on high; he has humbled the lofty city; he humbled her, even to the ground; he brought her down even to the dust.
ISA.26.6	The foot shall tread her down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.
ISA.26.7	The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
ISA.26.8	Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O 
ISA.26.9	With my soul I desire thee in the night; yea, even as long as the spirit is within me I will seek thee early: for as long as thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.
ISA.26.10	Let favour be showed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness he will deal unjustly and will not behold the majesty of the 
ISA.26.11	, when thy hand is withdrawn, they will not see: but they shall see in the end and be ashamed with the zeal of the people. And fire shall consume thine enemies.
ISA.26.12	, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought in us all our works.
ISA.26.13	O 
ISA.26.14	They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise because thou hast visited and destroyed them and made all their memory to perish.
ISA.26.15	Thou hast added the Gentiles, O 
ISA.26.16	, in the tribulation they have sought thee, they poured out prayer when thy chastening was upon them.
ISA.26.17	Like as a woman with child, that draws near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and cries out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O 
ISA.26.18	We have conceived, we have had birth pangs; we have, as it were, brought forth wind; we have not wrought any health in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
ISA.26.19	Thy dead shall live, and together with my body they shall arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the covering of light, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
ISA.26.20	Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself, as it were, for a little moment until the indignation is overpast.
ISA.26.21	For, behold, the 
ISA.27.1	In that day the 
ISA.27.2	In that day sing ye unto the vineyard of the red wine.
ISA.27.3	I the 
ISA.27.4	Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against me in battle? I would tread them down, I would burn them together.
ISA.27.5	Or who shall take hold of my strength? Make peace with me, yea, make peace with me.
ISA.27.6	Days shall come when Jacob shall take root: Israel shall blossom and bud, and the face of the world shall be filled with fruit.
ISA.27.7	Has he been smitten as he who smote him? or has he been slain as those who slew him?
ISA.27.8	In measure, she shall be chastised in her stalks: he stays his rough wind in the day of the east wind.
ISA.27.9	Therefore, in this manner shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and this shall be all the fruit, the removal of his sin; when he shall return all the stones of the altar, as chalkstones that are beaten in sunder that they may not raise up the groves, or the images of the sun.
ISA.27.10	Otherwise the defenced city shall be made desolate, and the habitation shall be forsaken and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf feed, and there shall he lie down and consume the branches thereof.
ISA.27.11	When its boughs are withered, they shall be broken off: women shall come and set them on fire: for this is not a people of understanding: therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will show them no favour.
ISA.27.12	And it shall come to pass in that day that the 
ISA.27.13	And it shall come to pass in that day that the great shofar shall be blown, and those who were ready to perish in the land of Assyria and the outcasts in the land of Egypt shall come and worship the 
ISA.28.1	Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim and to the open flower of the beauty of their glory which is upon the head of the fertile valley of those that are overcome with wine!
ISA.28.2	Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one who as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing shall cast down to the earth with the hand.
ISA.28.3	The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden under feet:
ISA.28.4	And the fading flower of the beauty of their glory, which is upon the head of the fertile valley, shall be as the early fig, which comes first before the other fruits of the summer; which when he that looks upon it sees it; as soon as he has it in his hand, he eats it up.
ISA.28.5	In that day the 
ISA.28.6	And for a spirit of judgment to him that sits upon the throne of judgment, and for strength to those that turn the battle to the gate.
ISA.28.7	But they also have erred through wine, and through strong drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have erred through strong drink; they are swallowed up of wine, they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in vision, they stumble in judgment.
ISA.28.8	For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there is no place clean.
ISA.28.9	Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to understand doctrine? Those that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breasts.
ISA.28.10	For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:
ISA.28.11	For with stammering lips and another tongue he will speak to this people.
ISA.28.12	To whom he said, This is the rest with which ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not hear.
ISA.28.13	But the word of the 
ISA.28.14	Therefore hear the word of the 
ISA.28.15	Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and with Sheol we are at agreement; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood we have hid ourselves:
ISA.28.16	Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.
ISA.28.17	Judgment also will I lay to the line and righteousness to the plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding place.
ISA.28.18	And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overflowing scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by it.
ISA.28.19	From the time that it goes forth, it shall take you: for it shall come suddenly, by day and by night: and it shall be that the terror only causes one to understand the report.
ISA.28.20	For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in it.
ISA.28.21	For the 
ISA.28.22	Now therefore do not be mockers lest your bands be made strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of the hosts that consumption and destruction are determined upon the whole earth.
ISA.28.23	Give ye ear and hear my voice; hearken and hear my speech.
ISA.28.24	Does the plowman plow all day to sow? does he open and break the clods of his ground?
ISA.28.25	When he has levelled the face thereof, does he not cast abroad the fitches and scatter the cummin and cast in the principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rye in their place?
ISA.28.26	For his God teaches him to know how to judge and instructs him.
ISA.28.27	For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument, neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the fitches are beaten out with a staff and the cummin with a rod.
ISA.28.28	Grain is thrashed to make bread; but he will not ever be threshing it, nor shall he grind it with the wheel of his cart, nor crush it with the teeth of his thrashing instrument.
ISA.28.29	This also comes forth from the 
ISA.29.1	Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye one year to another; the lambs shall cease.
ISA.29.2	Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.
ISA.29.3	And I will camp against thee round about and will lay siege against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against thee.
ISA.29.4	And thou shalt be brought down and shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be as that of a spiritist, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.
ISA.29.5	Moreover the multitude of thy enemies that shall come from afar shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the strong ones shall be as chaff that passes away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.
ISA.29.6	Thou shalt be visited of the 
ISA.29.7	And the multitude of all the Gentiles that shall fight against Ariel, even all that shall fight against her and their siege weapons, and those that shall distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.
ISA.29.8	It shall even be as he who dreams that he is hungry, and in his dream, he eats; but when he awakes, his soul is empty; and as he who dreams that he is thirsty, and, in his dream, he drinks; but he awakes, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul is still thirsty: so shall the multitude of all the Gentiles be, that shall fight against Mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	Become ye dumb, and make others dumb; become ye blind, and blind others: they are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong drink.
ISA.29.10	For the 
ISA.29.11	And every vision is unto you as the words of a book that is sealed, which if it were delivered to one that knows how to read, saying, Read this, I pray thee: he shall say, I cannot; for it is sealed:
ISA.29.12	And if the book were delivered to him that does not know how to read, saying, Read this, I pray thee: he shall say, I do not know how to read.
ISA.29.13	Therefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people sacrifice unto me and honour me with their lips, but have removed their heart far from me, and their worship with which they honour me was taught by the commandment of men:
ISA.29.14	Therefore, behold, I will again do a marvellous work among this people with a fearful miracle: for the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the prudence of their prudent men shall fade away.
ISA.29.15	Woe unto those that hide themselves from the 
ISA.29.16	Surely your subversion shall be as the potter’s clay: for shall the work say of him that made it, He did not make me? or shall the vessel say of him that made it, He did not understand?
ISA.29.17	Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into Carmel a fruitful field, and shall not Carmel be esteemed as a forest?
ISA.29.18	And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see in the midst of darkness, and of gross darkness.
ISA.29.19	Then the humble shall grow in joy in the 
ISA.29.20	For the violent one shall be done away with, and the scorner shall be consumed, and all those that rose early unto iniquity shall be cut off:
ISA.29.21	Those that made men to sin in word; those that laid a snare for him that reproved in the gate, and turned that which is just into vanity.
ISA.29.22	Therefore thus saith the 
ISA.29.23	for he shall see his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel;
ISA.29.24	and those that erred in spirit shall learn understanding, and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.
ISA.30.1	Woe to the sons that leave, saith the 
ISA.30.2	They leave to descend into Egypt and have not asked for a word from my mouth, to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh and to place their hope in the shadow of Egypt.
ISA.30.3	But the strength of Pharaoh shall become your shame, and the hope in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.
ISA.30.4	When his princes shall be in Zoan, and his ambassadors have come to Hanes,
ISA.30.5	all shall be ashamed of the people that shall not profit them, nor be a help, nor bring them increase, but a shame, and also a reproach.
ISA.30.6	The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent; they will carry their riches upon the shoulders of young asses and their treasures upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit them.
ISA.30.7	For the Egyptians shall help in vain and to no purpose; therefore I have cried out concerning this that your strength should be to sit still.
ISA.30.8	Now go, write this vision before them on a tablet and note it in a book that it may remain unto the last day, for ever, unto all ages.
ISA.30.9	That this is a rebellious people, lying sons, sons that did not desire to hear the law of the 
ISA.30.10	Who say to those that see, See not; and to the prophets, Do not prophesy right things unto us, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits:
ISA.30.11	Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the Holy One of Israel to leave our presence.
ISA.30.12	Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in violence and perversity and build upon this:
ISA.30.13	Therefore this sin shall be to you as an open wall ready to fall and as a breach in a high defence, whose breaking comes suddenly at an instant.
ISA.30.14	And your destruction shall be as the breaking of a potter’s vessel that without mercy is broken to pieces so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it even a shard to take fire from the hearth or to take water from the well.
ISA.30.15	For the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel has said; In returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.
ISA.30.16	But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall they that pursue you be even more swift.
ISA.30.17	One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of five ye shall all flee: until ye are left as a mast upon the top of a mountain and as a banner of example on a hill.
ISA.30.18	And therefore will the 
ISA.30.19	For the people shall dwell in Zion, in Jerusalem: thou shalt weep no more: he who has mercy shall show mercy unto thee; at the voice of thy cry when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.
ISA.30.20	But the Lord shall give you the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction; thy rain shall never more be taken away, but thine eyes shall see thy rain:
ISA.30.21	Then thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it, that ye not turn to the right hand and that ye not turn to the left hand.
ISA.30.22	Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of silver and the protection of thy molten images of gold: thou shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say unto it, Go away from here.
ISA.30.23	Then he shall give the rain unto thy planting when thou shalt sow the ground; and bread of the fruit of the earth, and it shall be fat and fertile: in that day thy cattle shall feed in large pastures.
ISA.30.24	Thine oxen and thine asses that work the ground shall eat clean grain, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fan.
ISA.30.25	And there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the great slaughter, when the towers shall fall.
ISA.30.26	Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold as the light of seven days, in the day that the 
ISA.30.27	Behold, the name of the 
ISA.30.28	And his Spirit, as an overflowing stream, shall break even unto the neck to sift the Gentiles with the sieve of vanity and to put a bridle in the jaws of the people, causing them to err.
ISA.30.29	Ye shall have a song, as in the night in which the Passover is kept and gladness of heart as when one goes with a flute to come into the mountain of the 
ISA.30.30	And the 
ISA.30.31	For through the voice of the 
ISA.30.32	And in every evil place there shall be a staff that the 
ISA.30.33	For Tophet is ordained of yesterday for the king of Babylon, it is also prepared; he has deepened and enlarged the pile of her fire and much wood; the breath of the 
ISA.31.1	Woe to those that go down to Egypt for help; and trust in horses and place their hope in chariots because they are many and in horsemen, because they are valiant, but they did not look unto the Holy One of Israel, neither did they seek the 
ISA.31.2	Yet he also is wise to guide evil and will not cause his words to lie but will arise against the house of the evildoers and against the help of those that work iniquity.
ISA.31.3	Now the Egyptian is a man, and not God, and his horses flesh, and not spirit, so that as the 
ISA.31.4	For thus has the 
ISA.31.5	As birds flying, so will the 
ISA.31.6	Turn ye unto him against whom ye have deeply revolted, O sons of Israel.
ISA.31.7	For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you as a sin.
ISA.31.8	Then the Assyrian shall fall by the sword, not of a mighty man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but he shall flee from the presence of the sword, and his young men shall faint.
ISA.31.9	And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his princes shall be afraid of the banner, saith the 
ISA.32.1	Behold, one king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall preside unto judgment.
ISA.32.2	And that man shall be as a hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a hot land.
ISA.32.3	And the eyes of those that see shall not be dim, and the ears of those that hear shall hearken.
ISA.32.4	The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.
ISA.32.5	The vile person shall no longer be called liberal, nor the greedy said to be bountiful.
ISA.32.6	For the vile person will speak villainy, and his heart will invent iniquity to work unrighteousness and to speak scornfully against the 
ISA.32.7	Certainly the greedy use evil measures: he devises wicked devices to ensnare the simple with lying words and to speak in judgment against the poor.
ISA.32.8	But the liberal devises liberal things; and by liberal things shall he rise.
ISA.32.9	Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless daughters; give ear unto my speech.
ISA.32.10	Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women: for the vintage shall fail, and the harvest shall not come in.
ISA.32.11	Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless ones: strip you, and make yourselves bare, and gird sackcloth upon your loins.
ISA.32.12	Upon their breasts they shall lament for the pleasant fields, for the fruitful vine.
ISA.32.13	Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers; even upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:
ISA.32.14	Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the noise of the city shall cease; the forts and towers shall be for dens for ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;
ISA.32.15	until the spirit is poured upon us from on high, and the wilderness is turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field is counted for a forest.
ISA.32.16	Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness shall remain in the fruitful field.
ISA.32.17	And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect of righteousness rest and security for ever.
ISA.32.18	And my people shall dwell in a habitation of peace and in secure dwellings and in the refreshing of rest.
ISA.32.19	And the hail, when it shall come down, shall be in the forest; and the city shall be completely laid low.
ISA.32.20	Blessed are ye that sow upon all waters, ye that plow with the ox and with the ass.
ISA.33.1	Woe to thee that dost spoil, and thou wast not spoiled; and dost deal treacherously, and they did not deal treacherously with thee! When thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.
ISA.33.2	O 
ISA.33.3	At the noise of the tumult the peoples fled; at the lifting up of thyself the Gentiles were scattered.
ISA.33.4	And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpillar: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.
ISA.33.5	The 
ISA.33.6	And in thy times wisdom and knowledge, and the strength of salvation shall reign: the fear of the 
ISA.33.7	Behold, their ambassadors shall cry without: the messengers of peace shall weep bitterly.
ISA.33.8	The highways shall be broken down; the travellers shall cease; he has broken the covenant; he has despised the cities; he does not regard man.
ISA.33.9	The earth mourns and languishes: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel were shaken.
ISA.33.10	Now I will rise up, saith the 
ISA.33.11	Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.
ISA.33.12	And the peoples shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up they shall be burned in the fire.
ISA.33.13	Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? Who among us shall dwell with eternal flames?
ISA.33.15	He that walks in righteousness, he that speaks uprightly; he that despises the gain of violence, he that shakes his hands from receiving bribes; he that stops his ears to not hear of blood; he who shuts his eyes to not see evil;
ISA.33.16	he shall dwell upon the high places: fortresses of rocks shall be his place of refuge: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.
ISA.33.17	Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.
ISA.33.18	Thine heart shall imagine the terror. Where is the scribe? Where is the receiver of tribute? Where is he that counted the towers?
ISA.33.19	Thou shalt not see that fierce people, a people of a darker speech than thou can perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou can not understand.
ISA.33.20	Thou shalt see Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of its stakes shall ever be removed, neither shall any of its cords be broken.
ISA.33.21	For the 
ISA.33.22	For the 
ISA.33.23	Thy tacklings are loosed; they did not strengthen well their mast, nor could they spread the sail: {Heb. banner}: then the prey of a great spoil shall be divided; even the lame shall take prey.
ISA.33.24	And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be absolved from sin.
ISA.34.1	Come near, ye Gentiles, to hear; and hearken, ye peoples; let the earth hear, and all that is therein, the world and all things that come forth of it.
ISA.34.2	For the indignation of the 
ISA.34.3	Their slain shall be cast out, and their stink shall come up out of their carcasses, and the mountains shall be melted with their blood.
ISA.34.4	And all the host of heavens shall be dissolved, and the heavens shall be rolled together as a scroll; and all their host shall fall down as the leaf falls off from the vine and as the leaf falls from the fig tree.
ISA.34.5	For in the heavens my sword shall become drunk; behold, it shall come down in judgment upon Idumea or Edom and upon the people of my anathema.
ISA.34.6	The sword of the 
ISA.34.7	And the unicorns shall fall with them, and the bulls with the calves; and their land shall become drunk with blood, and their dust shall be greased with fatness.
ISA.34.8	For it shall be the day of the 
ISA.34.9	And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into sulphur, and the land thereof shall become burning pitch.
ISA.34.10	It shall not be quenched night nor day; its smoke shall go up for ever; from generation to generation it shall lie waste; no one shall pass through it for ever and ever.
ISA.34.11	But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl also and the raven shall dwell in it; and he shall stretch out upon it the line of confusion and the level of desolation.
ISA.34.12	They shall call the princes thereof, princes without a kingdom; and all her great ones shall be nothing.
ISA.34.13	And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof; and it shall be a habitation of dragons and a court for young owls.
ISA.34.14	The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow; the screech owl shall have his seat there and find for himself a place of rest.
ISA.34.15	There shall the great owl make his nest and conserve his eggs and hatch his young and gather them under his wings; there shall the vultures also be gathered, each one with his mate.
ISA.34.16	Seek ye out that which is written in the book of the 
ISA.34.17	And he has cast the lot for them, and his hand has divided it unto them by line; therefore they shall have it as an inheritance for ever; from generation to generation they shall dwell therein.
ISA.35.1	The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad; the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the lily.
ISA.35.2	It shall blossom abundantly and shall also praise and sing for joy; the honour of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the beauty of Carmel and Sharon. They shall see the glory of the 
ISA.35.3	Comfort ye the tired hands and strengthen the knees that tremble.
ISA.35.4	Say to those that are of a fearful heart, Be comforted, fear not; behold, your God comes with vengeance, with recompense; God himself will come and save you.
ISA.35.5	Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
ISA.35.6	Then the lame one shall leap as a hart, and the tongue of the dumb shall praise; for waters shall be dug in the wilderness, and streams in the desert.
ISA.35.7	The parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land springs of water; in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
ISA.35.8	And a highway shall be there and a way, and it shall be called The Way of Holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; and for those in it there shall be someone to go with them, in such a manner that the foolish shall not err therein.
ISA.35.9	No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, nor shall any be found there so that the redeemed can walk there:
ISA.35.10	And the ransomed of the 
ISA.36.1	Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defenced cities of Judah and took them.
ISA.36.2	And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he camped by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the washer’s field.
ISA.36.3	Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah’s son, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph’s son, the writer of chronicles.
ISA.36.4	And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is this in which thou dost trust?
ISA.36.5	I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust that thou dost rebel against me?
ISA.36.6	Behold, thou dost trust in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt upon which if a man leans, it will go into his hand and pierce it, so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.
ISA.36.7	But if thou say to me, We trust in the 
ISA.36.8	Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou art able on thy part to set riders upon them.
ISA.36.9	How, therefore, wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the least of my master’s slaves even if thou art trusting in Egypt for chariots and for horsemen?
ISA.36.10	And peradventure am I now come up without the 
ISA.36.11	Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I pray thee, unto thy slaves in the Syrian language, for we understand it, and do not speak to us in the Jewish language, in the ears of the people that are on the wall.
ISA.36.12	But Rabshakeh said, Has my master sent me to thy master and to thee to speak these words? Has he not sent me to the men that sit upon the wall that they may eat their own dung and drink their own piss with you?
ISA.36.13	Then Rabshakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
ISA.36.14	Thus saith the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you.
ISA.36.15	Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the 
ISA.36.16	Do not hearken unto Hezekiah, for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make peace with me and come out to me and eat each one of his vine and each one of his fig tree and drink each one the waters of his own cistern
ISA.36.17	until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
ISA.36.18	Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The 
ISA.36.19	Where is the god of Hamath and Arphad? Where is the god of Sepharvaim? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?
ISA.36.20	What god is there among all the gods of these lands that have delivered their land out of my hand that the 
ISA.36.21	But they held their peace and did not answer him a word, for the king had commanded thus, saying, Answer him not.
ISA.36.22	Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and Joah, the son of Asaph, the writer of chronicles, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent and told him the words of Rabshakeh.
ISA.37.1	And it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the 
ISA.37.2	And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna the scribe and the elders of the priests covered with sackcloth unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.
ISA.37.3	And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day of trouble and of rebuke and of blasphemy, for the sons are come to the breaking of the water, and there is no strength in her who is to bring them forth.
ISA.37.4	It may be the 
ISA.37.5	So the slaves of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.
ISA.37.6	And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith the 
ISA.37.7	Behold, that I am sending a spirit in him, and he shall hear a rumour and return to his own land; and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own land.
ISA.37.8	So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring against Libnah, for he had heard that he was departed from Lachish.
ISA.37.9	And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
ISA.37.10	Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Do not let thy God, in whom thou dost trust, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.
ISA.37.11	Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them utterly, and shalt thou be delivered?
ISA.37.12	Have the gods of the Gentiles delivered those whom my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan and Haran and Rezeph and the sons of Eden which were in Telassar?
ISA.37.13	Where is the king of Hamath and the king of Arphad and the king of the city of Sepharvaim Hena, and Ivah?
ISA.37.14	And Hezekiah took the letters from the hand of the messengers and read them; and Hezekiah went up unto the house of the 
ISA.37.15	And Hezekiah prayed unto the 
ISA.37.16	O 
ISA.37.17	Incline thine ear, O 
ISA.37.18	Of a truth, 
ISA.37.19	and have cast their gods into the fire, for they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; therefore they have destroyed them.
ISA.37.20	Now therefore, O 
ISA.37.21	Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus saith the 
ISA.37.22	This is the word which the 
ISA.37.23	Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice and lifted up thine eyes on high? even against the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.37.24	By the hand of thy slaves thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast said, By the multitude of my chariots I shall come up to the height of the mountains to the sides of Lebanon, and I will cut down the tall cedars thereof and the choice fir trees thereof; and I will enter into the height of his border and the forest of his Carmel.
ISA.37.25	I have dug and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet shall I dry up all the rivers of sustenance.
ISA.37.26	Hast thou not heard long ago how I have done it and of ancient times that I have formed it? Now I have brought it to pass, that thou should be to lay waste defenced cities into ruinous heaps.
ISA.37.27	And their inhabitants, of little strength, dismayed and confounded shall be as the grass of the field and as the green shrub as the grass on the housetops, that before it comes to maturity it is dried up.
ISA.37.28	I have understood thy state, thy going out and thy coming in, and thy rage against me.
ISA.37.29	Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into my ears, therefore I will put my hook in thy nose and my bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou didst come.
ISA.37.30	And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year such as grows of itself; and the second year that which springs of the same: and in the third year ye shall sow and shall reap and shall plant vineyards and shall eat the fruit thereof.
ISA.37.31	And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall again take root downward and bear fruit upward:
ISA.37.32	For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant and from Mount Zion shall come an escape; the zeal of the 
ISA.37.33	Therefore thus saith the 
ISA.37.34	By the way that he came, by the same shall he return and shall not come into this city, saith the 
ISA.37.35	For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake and for my slave David’s sake.
ISA.37.36	Then the angel of the 
ISA.37.37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and went and returned and dwelt at Nineveh.
ISA.37.38	And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.
ISA.38.1	In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz came unto him and said unto him, Thus saith the 
ISA.38.2	Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the 
ISA.38.3	And said, Remember now, O 
ISA.38.4	Then came the word of the 
ISA.38.5	Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the 
ISA.38.6	And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.
ISA.38.7	And this shall be a sign unto thee from the 
ISA.38.8	Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
ISA.38.9	The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and was recovered of his sickness:
ISA.38.10	I said in the cutting off of my days; I shall go to the gates of Sheol: I am deprived of the residue of my years.
ISA.38.11	I said, I shall not see JAH, even JAH, in the land of the living; I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants of the world.
ISA.38.12	My dwelling place has been moved and is removed from me as a shepherd’s tent; he has cut off my life like a weaver: he has cut me off with sickness: between the day and the night thou shalt consume me.
ISA.38.13	I reckoned that I had until morning. As a lion, he broke all my bones: from the morning even unto the night thou shalt make an end of me.
ISA.38.14	Like a crane or a swallow, so did I complain; I mourned as a dove; I raised my eyes upward, O 
ISA.38.15	What shall I say? He has both spoken unto me, and he himself has done it; I shall walk softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul.
ISA.38.16	O Lord, even unto all those that shall live, in these fifteen years I shall proclaim the life of my spirit in them and how thou caused me to sleep, and afterwards hast given me life.
ISA.38.17	Behold, for peace I had great bitterness; but it has pleased thee to deliver my life from the pit of corruption, for thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.
ISA.38.18	For the grave shall not confess thee, nor shall death praise thee; nor shall those that go down into the pit wait for thy truth.
ISA.38.19	He who lives, he who lives, even he shall confess thee, as I do this day; the father to the sons shall make known thy truth.
ISA.38.20	The 
ISA.38.21	Isaiah then said, Let them take a lump of figs and lay it for a plaster upon the boil and he shall be healed.
ISA.38.22	And Hezekiah had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the 
ISA.39.1	At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and presents to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered.
ISA.39.2	And Hezekiah rejoiced with them and showed them the house of his precious things, the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious ointments and all the house of his weapons and all that was found in his treasures; there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion that Hezekiah did not show them.
ISA.39.3	Then Isaiah the prophet came unto king Hezekiah and said unto him, What did these men say? and from where did they come unto thee? And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me, even from Babylon.
ISA.39.4	Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah answered, All that is in my house have they seen; there is nothing among my treasures that I have not showed them.
ISA.39.5	Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the 
ISA.39.6	Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house and that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the 
ISA.39.7	And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.
ISA.39.8	Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, Good is the word of the 
ISA.40.1	Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.
ISA.40.2	Speak ye according to the heart of Jerusalem and cry unto her that her time is now fulfilled that her iniquity is pardoned; for she has received of the 
ISA.40.3	The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the 
ISA.40.4	Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places made plain:
ISA.40.5	And the glory of the 
ISA.40.6	The voice that said, Cry. And I said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the mercy thereof is as the open flower of the field:
ISA.40.7	The grass withers, the flower fades because the spirit of the 
ISA.40.8	The grass withers, the open flower fades; but the word of our God shall stand for ever.
ISA.40.9	O Zion, that brings good tidings, go up into the high mountain; lift up thy voice with strength O bearer of good tidings of Jerusalem; lift it up, do not be afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!
ISA.40.10	Behold, the Lord GOD will come with a strong hand, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
ISA.40.11	He shall feed his flock like a shepherd; he shall gather the lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and shall gently lead those that are with young.
ISA.40.12	Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and prepared the heavens with his palm and with three fingers measured the dust of the earth and weighed the mountains in a balance and the hills with weights?
ISA.40.13	Who has directed the Spirit of the 
ISA.40.14	With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him? Who taught him in the path of judgment and taught him knowledge and showed unto him the way of intelligence?
ISA.40.15	Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket and are counted as the small dust of the balance: behold, he causes the isles to disappear as dust.
ISA.40.16	And all Lebanon is not sufficient for the fire, nor all the beasts thereof sufficient for the sacrifice.
ISA.40.17	All the Gentiles are as nothing before him, and they are counted to him as vanity and as less than nothing.
ISA.40.18	To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him?
ISA.40.19	The workman prepares the graven image, and the goldsmith spreads it over with gold and casts silver chains.
ISA.40.20	He that is so impoverished that he has no oblation chooses a tree that will not rot; he seeks unto himself a cunning workman to prepare a graven image that shall not be moved.
ISA.40.21	Have ye not known? Have ye not heard? Has it not been told you from the beginning? Have ye not been taught since the land was founded?
ISA.40.22	He is seated upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; he stretches out the heavens as a curtain and spreads them out as a tent to dwell in:
ISA.40.23	He brings the powerful to nothing; he makes the judges of the earth as if they had never been,
ISA.40.24	As if they had never been planted, as if they had never been sown, as if their stock had never taken root in the earth; even blowing upon them, they wither, and the whirlwind takes them away as stubble.
ISA.40.25	To whom then will ye liken me, or what shall ye compare me to? saith the Holy One.
ISA.40.26	Lift up your eyes on high and behold who has created these things; he brings out his host by number; he calls them all by their names; none shall be lacking by the greatness of his might and by the strength of his power.
ISA.40.27	Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest thou, O Israel, My way is hid from the 
ISA.40.28	Hast thou not known? Hast thou not heard that the God of the age is the 
ISA.40.29	He gives power to the faint; and to those that have no might he increases strength.
ISA.40.30	The young men faint and are weary; the children stumble and fall;
ISA.40.31	but those that wait for the 
ISA.41.1	Listen unto me, O islands; and let the peoples strengthen themselves; let them come near; then let them speak; let us come near together to judgment.
ISA.41.2	Who raised up righteousness from the east, called him that he might follow him, gave the Gentiles before him, and made him rule over kings? He gave them as the dust to his sword and as driven stubble to his bow.
ISA.41.3	He pursued them and passed in peace by the way that his feet had never entered.
ISA.41.4	Who has wrought and done it? Who calls the generations from the beginning? I the 
ISA.41.5	The isles saw it and feared; the ends of the earth were afraid; they congregated and came.
ISA.41.6	Each one helped his neighbour; and each one said to his brother, Be of good courage.
ISA.41.7	So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smooths with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is well joined and he strengthened it with nails, that it should not be moved.
ISA.41.8	But thou, Israel, my slave, Jacob whom I have chosen, art the seed of Abraham my friend.
ISA.41.9	For I have taken thee from the ends of the earth and called thee from the boundaries thereof and said unto thee Thou shalt be my slave; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.
ISA.41.10	Do not fear for I am with thee; do not be dismayed, for I am thy God, who strengthens thee; I will help thee always; I will always uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.
ISA.41.11	Behold, all those that were incensed against thee shall be ashamed and confounded; they shall be as nothing; and those that strive with thee shall perish.
ISA.41.12	Thou shalt seek them and shalt not find them, even those that contended with thee; those that war against thee shall be as nothing and as a thing of nought.
ISA.41.13	For I am the 
ISA.41.14	Fear not, thou worm Jacob, ye dead of Israel; I will help thee, saith the 
ISA.41.15	Behold, I have placed thee as a threshing instrument, as a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth; thou shalt thresh the mountains and beat them small and shalt make the hills as chaff.
ISA.41.16	Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind shall scatter them; but thou shalt rejoice in the 
ISA.41.17	The poor and needy seek the waters that are not; their tongue fails for thirst; I the 
ISA.41.18	I will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the plains; I will turn the wilderness into pools of water and the dry land into springs of water.
ISA.41.19	I will bring forth in the wilderness cedars, thorns, myrtles, and olive trees; I will set in the desert the fir tree and the pine and the box tree together:
ISA.41.20	That they may see and know and take warning and understand together that the hand of the 
ISA.41.21	Explain your cause, saith the 
ISA.41.22	Let them bring forth and declare unto us what shall happen; tell us what has happened from the beginning, and we shall consider it in our hearts; and we shall know what his end shall be, and cause us to understand that which is to come.
ISA.41.23	Give us news of that which is to come hereafter that we may know that ye are gods; or at least do good or do evil that we may have something to tell, and together we shall marvel.
ISA.41.24	Behold, ye are of nothing and your works of vanity; an abomination is he that chooses you.
ISA.41.25	I have raised up one from the north, and he came from the rising of the sun; he called in my name and came unto princes as upon clay and as the potter treads clay.
ISA.41.26	Who has declared from the beginning, that we shall know? and beforetime that we shall say, He is righteous? yea, there is no one that declares this, yea, there is no one that teaches, yea, there is no one that hears your words.
ISA.41.27	I am the first that has taught these things unto Zion, and unto Jerusalem I brought the news.
ISA.41.28	For I beheld, and there was no one; and I asked regarding these things, and there was no counsellor; I asked them, and they did not answer a word.
ISA.41.29	Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their molten images are wind and confusion.
ISA.42.1	Behold my slave, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my Spirit upon him; he shall give judgment unto the Gentiles.
ISA.42.2	He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the streets.
ISA.42.3	He shall not break a bruised reed, nor shall he quench the smoking flax; he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.
ISA.42.4	He shall not tire nor faint until he has set judgment in the earth; and the isles shall wait for his law.
ISA.42.5	Thus saith God the 
ISA.42.6	I the 
ISA.42.7	that thou might open the eyes of the blind, that thou might bring out the prisoners from the prison and those that sit in darkness out of the prison house.
ISA.42.8	I am the 
ISA.42.9	Behold, the former things are come to pass, and I declare new things: before they spring forth I tell you of them.
ISA.42.10	Sing unto the 
ISA.42.11	Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar inhabits; let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout {Heb. command} from the top of the mountains.
ISA.42.12	Let them give glory unto the 
ISA.42.13	The 
ISA.42.14	I have long time held my peace; I have been still and refrained myself; now will I cry out like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.
ISA.42.15	I will make waste mountains and hills and dry up all their grass, and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.
ISA.42.16	And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will cause them to walk in paths that they have not known; I will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them and not forsake them.
ISA.42.17	They shall be turned back; they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.
ISA.42.18	Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.
ISA.42.19	Who is blind, but my slave? or deaf, as my messenger that I sent? Who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the slave of the 
ISA.42.20	who sees many things and does not warn; who opens his ears and does not hear.
ISA.42.21	The 
ISA.42.22	Therefore this people is robbed and spoiled; all of them shall be snared in holes and hid in prison houses; they shall be for a prey, and no one delivers; for a spoil, and no one saith, Restore.
ISA.42.23	Who among you will give ear to this? Who will warn and consider regarding the time to come?
ISA.42.24	Who gave Jacob for a spoil and Israel to the robbers? Did not the 
ISA.42.25	Therefore he has poured upon him the fury of his anger and the strength of battle; he put fire round about him, yet he was careless; and it set him on fire, yet he did not lay it to heart.
ISA.43.1	But now thus saith the 
ISA.43.2	When thou dost pass through the waters, I will be with thee; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee; when thou dost walk through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.
ISA.43.3	For I am the 
ISA.43.4	Because thou wast precious in my sight, thou wast worthy of honour, and I have loved thee.
ISA.43.5	Do not fear; for I am with thee: I will bring thy generation from the east and gather thee from the west;
ISA.43.6	I will say to the north wind, Give up, and to the south, Do not keep back; bring my sons from far and my daughters from the ends of the earth
ISA.43.7	even every one that is called by my name, for I have created them for my glory; I have formed them; yea, I have made them.
ISA.43.8	Bring forth the people that is blind that have eyes and the deaf that have ears.
ISA.43.9	Let all the Gentiles be gathered together as one, and let the peoples be joined; who among them can declare this and show us former things? Let them bring forth their witnesses that they may be justified or let them hear and say, It is truth.
ISA.43.10	Ye are my witnesses, saith the 
ISA.43.11	I, even I, am the 
ISA.43.12	I have declared and have saved, and I have showed when there was no strange god among you; therefore ye are my witnesses, saith the 
ISA.43.13	Even before the day was I existed; and there is no one that can deliver out of my hand; if I work, who shall hinder it?
ISA.43.14	Thus saith the 
ISA.43.15	I am the 
ISA.43.16	Thus saith the 
ISA.43.17	when he brings forth the chariot and horse, the army and the power; they shall fall together, and never rise; they are extinct; they are quenched as wick.
ISA.43.18	Do not remember the former things, nor consider the things of old.
ISA.43.19	Behold, I will do a new thing; it shall come to light quickly; shall ye not know it? I will again make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.
ISA.43.20	The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the owls because I give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people, my chosen.
ISA.43.21	This people I have formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.
ISA.43.22	But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been weary of me, O Israel.
ISA.43.23	Thou hast not brought me the animals of thy burnt offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied thee with incense.
ISA.43.24	Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices, but thou hast made me to serve with thy sins; thou hast wearied me with thine iniquities.
ISA.43.25	I, even I, am he that uproots thy rebellions for mine own sake and will not remember thy sins.
ISA.43.26	Cause me to remember; let us enter into judgment together; declare, thou, that it may be put to thy account.
ISA.43.27	Thy first father sinned, and thy teachers have transgressed against me.
ISA.43.28	Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary and have set up Jacob as anathema, and Israel as a reproach.
ISA.44.1	Yet now hear, O Jacob my slave and Israel, whom I have chosen:
ISA.44.2	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.3	For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground; I will pour my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing upon thine offspring:
ISA.44.4	And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.
ISA.44.5	One shall say, I am the 
ISA.44.6	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.7	And who shall call as I do and declare this in advance and set it in order for me, since I made the people of the world? Let them declare unto them the things that are near and the things that shall come.
ISA.44.8	Do not fear, neither be afraid; have I not caused thee to hear from of old and declared unto thee beforehand that which was to come? Then ye are my witnesses that there is no God but me, and there is no Strong One that I do not know.
ISA.44.9	Those that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and that which is most precious to them is useful for nothing; and they are their own witnesses that they do not see, nor understand; therefore, they shall be ashamed.
ISA.44.10	Who has formed God? And who cast a graven image that is profitable for nothing?
ISA.44.11	Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed; for the workmen, they are of men; even if all of them are gathered together and stand, they shall fear and shall be ashamed together.
ISA.44.12	The smith shall take the tongs; he shall work among the coals; he shall give it form with the hammers and bring forth in it the arm of his strength; though he is hungry and his strength fails: he shall not drink water, even if he faints.
ISA.44.13	The carpenter stretches out his rule; he measures it with a line; he fits it with planes; he marks it out with the compass; he makes it after the form of a noble man, in the likeness of the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.
ISA.44.14	He shall hew down cedars and take the cypress and the oak, and he shall strengthen himself with the trees of the forest; he shall plant a fir tree, which shall be nourished with the rain.
ISA.44.15	The man shall then use of it for firewood; for he will take thereof and warm himself; he will kindle it and bake bread; he will also make a god and worship it; he will fabricate an idol and shall kneel down before it.
ISA.44.16	He shall burn part of it in the fire; with another part thereof he shall eat flesh; he shall roast meat and shall satisfy himself. Afterwards he shall warm himself and say, Aha, I have warmed myself, I have seen fire;
ISA.44.17	the residue of it he turns into god, into his graven image; he humbles himself before it and worships it and prays unto it and says, Deliver me; for thou art my god.
ISA.44.18	They did not know nor understand; for he has anointed their eyes that they not see and their hearts that they not understand.
ISA.44.19	He does not return to his right mind; he does not have knowledge nor intelligence to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; I have also baked bread upon the coals of it; I have roasted flesh and eaten it and shall I make the residue of it an abomination? Do I have to humble myself before the trunk of a tree?
ISA.44.20	The ashes feed him; his deceived heart inclines him, that he not deliver his soul and say, Is not the lie at my right hand?
ISA.44.21	Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel: that thou art my slave: I have formed thee; thou art my slave, O Israel, do not forget me.
ISA.44.22	I have undone, as a cloud, thy rebellions, and thy sins, as a mist, return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
ISA.44.23	Sing praises, O ye heavens; for the 
ISA.44.24	Thus saith the 
ISA.44.25	that undoes the signs of the fortune tellers and makes the diviners mad; that turns the wise men backward and makes their wisdom fade away;
ISA.44.26	that awakes the word of his slave and fulfills the counsel of his messengers, that says unto Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be rebuilt, and I will raise up thy ruins
ISA.44.27	that says to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers
ISA.44.28	that calls Cyrus, my shepherd, and all that I desire, he shall fulfil, by saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
ISA.45.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.2	I will go before thee and make the crooked places straight; I will break in pieces the gates of bronze and cut in sunder the bars of iron:
ISA.45.3	And I will give thee the hidden treasures and the well-guarded secrets that thou may know that I am the 
ISA.45.4	For Jacob my slave’s sake and Israel my elect, I have even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though thou hast not known me.
ISA.45.5	I am the 
ISA.45.6	that it may be known from the rising of the sun and from where it goes down that there is no one beside me. I am the 
ISA.45.7	I form the light and create darkness; I make peace and create evil: I am the 
ISA.45.8	Release, ye heavens, from above, and the clouds shall pour down righteousness; let the earth open up, and let salvation and righteousness bear their fruit; let them produce fruit together; I the 
ISA.45.9	Woe unto him that strives with his Maker! Let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to him that fashions it, What doth thou make; thy work has no form?
ISA.45.10	Woe unto him that says unto his father, Why dost thou beget? or to the woman, Why hast thou brought forth?
ISA.45.11	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.12	I have made the earth, and created man upon it, I, even my hands, have stretched out the heavens and I have commanded all their host.
ISA.45.13	I have awakened him in righteousness, and I will make straight all his ways; he shall build my city, and he shall loose my captives, not for price nor for bribes, saith the 
ISA.45.14	Thus saith the 
ISA.45.15	Verily thou art God, that thou might hide thyself; God of Israel, who saves.
ISA.45.16	They shall be ashamed and also confounded, all of them; all the makers of idols shall go forth ashamed.
ISA.45.17	Israel is saved in the 
ISA.45.18	For thus has the 
ISA.45.19	I have not spoken in secret in a dark place of the earth. Not without substance did I say unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me; I am the 
ISA.45.20	Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, all ye that are escaped of the Gentiles. They have no knowledge that set up the wood of their graven image and pray unto the god that does not save.
ISA.45.21	Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel together; who caused this to be heard from the beginning and has declared it from that time, except me, the 
ISA.45.22	Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth; for I am God, and there is no one else.
ISA.45.23	I have sworn by myself; the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow; every tongue shall swear.
ISA.45.24	And unto me he shall say, Surely in the 
ISA.45.25	In the 
ISA.46.1	Bel bowed down; Nebo is fallen; their images were placed upon animals and upon beasts of burden that will carry you, laden with yourselves, burden of weariness.
ISA.46.2	They stoop, they are fallen together; they could not escape from the burden, and their soul had to go into captivity.
ISA.46.3	Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:
ISA.46.4	And even to your old age I am he, and even to grey hairs I will carry you; I have made, and I will bear; I will carry and will deliver you.
ISA.46.5	To whom will ye liken me and make me equal and compare me that we may be alike?
ISA.46.6	They lavish gold out of the bag and weigh silver in the balance and hire a goldsmith, and he makes it a god; they fall down and worship.
ISA.46.7	They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him and set him in his place. There he is; he does not move from his place; they cry unto him, and neither does he answer, nor save from the tribulation.
ISA.46.8	Remember this, and be ashamed, bring it again to mind, O ye transgressors.
ISA.46.9	Remember the former things of old, for I am God, and there is no one else; I am God, and there is no one like me,
ISA.46.10	declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure:
ISA.46.11	Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executes my counsel from a far country; I have spoken it; I will also bring it to pass; I have purposed it; I will also do it.
ISA.46.12	Hearken unto me, ye hard of heart, that are far from righteousness;
ISA.46.13	I cause my righteousness to come near; it shall not go away; and my salvation shall not be stayed: and I will place salvation in Zion; and my glory in Israel.
ISA.47.1	Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon; sit on the ground, without a throne, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no longer be called tender and delicate.
ISA.47.2	Take the millstones and grind meal; uncover thy locks, remove the shoes from thy feet, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.
ISA.47.3	Thy nakedness shall be uncovered and thy shame shall be seen; I will take vengeance, and I will not help any man.
ISA.47.4	As for our redeemer, the 
ISA.47.5	Sit, be silent, and go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans; for thou shalt no longer be called, The lady of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	I was wroth with my people; I have profaned my inheritance and given them into thine hand; thou didst show them no mercy; upon the ancient thou hast very heavily laid thy yoke.
ISA.47.7	And thou didst say, I shall be a lady for ever. Until now thou hast not laid these things to heart, neither didst thou remember thy latter end.
ISA.47.8	Therefore now hear this, thou delicate one, that dost sit in confidence and say in thine heart, I am, and no one else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I be fatherless.
ISA.47.9	But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day; the loss of thy fathers and widowhood: they shall come upon thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.
ISA.47.10	For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, No one sees me. Thy wisdom and thine own knowledge; it has deceived thee; for thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and no one else beside me.
ISA.47.11	Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from where it rises; and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou shalt not be able to put it off: and destruction shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.
ISA.47.12	Stand now with thine enchantments and with the multitude of thy sorceries in which thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to better thyself, if so be thou may prevail.
ISA.47.13	Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now those that contemplate the heavens, those that speculate regarding the stars, those that teach the courses of the moon, stand up and defend thee from these things that shall come upon thee.
ISA.47.14	Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver their lives from the hand of the flame; there shall not be a coal left to warm at, nor light to sit before it.
ISA.47.15	Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander each one to his own way; there shall be no one to save thee.
ISA.48.1	Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, who call yourselves by the name of Israel, those that are come forth out of the waters of Judah, those who swear by the name of the 
ISA.48.2	For they call themselves of the holy city and stay themselves upon the God of Israel. The 
ISA.48.3	That which happened, I have already declared many days ago; and it went forth out of my mouth, and I published it; I did it suddenly, and it came to pass.
ISA.48.4	Because I know that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy brow bronze;
ISA.48.5	I have already declared it many days ago; before it came to pass I showed it to thee: lest thou should say, My idol has done it, my graven image, and my molten image, has commanded these things.
ISA.48.6	Thou hast heard it, thou hast seen it all; and will ye not declare it? I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.
ISA.48.7	They are created now, and not in days past; nor before this day hast thou heard them lest thou should say, Behold, I knew them.
ISA.48.8	Certainly thou hast never heard this; certainly thou hast never known this; certainly thine ear was never before opened: for I knew that being unfaithful thou would disobey; therefore, I called thee a rebel from the womb.
ISA.48.9	For my name’s sake I will defer my anger, and for my praise I will wait patiently for thee that I not cut thee off.
ISA.48.10	Behold, I have refined thee, and not as silver; I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.
ISA.48.11	For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, I will do it, for how should my name be profaned? and I will not give my glory unto another.
ISA.48.12	Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am the first, I also am the last.
ISA.48.13	Certainly my hand founded the earth, and my right hand measured the heavens with the palm; as I named them, they appeared together.
ISA.48.14	All ye, assemble yourselves and hear; who is there among them that declares these things? The 
ISA.48.15	I, even I, have spoken; I have called him: I have brought him, and therefore his way shall be prospered.
ISA.48.16	Come near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; from the time that it was done, I was there: and now the 
ISA.48.17	Thus has the 
ISA.48.18	O that thou would look unto my commandments! Then thy peace would be as a river and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea:
ISA.48.19	Thy seed would be as the sand, and the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name would never be cut off nor destroyed from before me.
ISA.48.20	Come out of Babylon, flee from among the Chaldeans. Give news of this with a voice of joy; publish this; take this news to the end of the earth; say, The 
ISA.48.21	And they did not thirst when he led them through the deserts; he caused water to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock, and the waters gushed out.
ISA.48.22	There is no peace for the wicked, said the 
ISA.49.1	Listen, O isles, unto me, and hearken, ye peoples, from far, The 
ISA.49.2	And he has made my mouth like a sharp sword; with the shadow of his hand he has covered me, and made me a clean arrow; in his quiver he has kept me.
ISA.49.3	And he said unto me, Thou art my slave, O Israel; in thee I will glory.
ISA.49.4	But I said, I have laboured in vain; I have spent my strength for nothing, and in vain; yet surely my judgment is before the 
ISA.49.5	And now, saith the 
ISA.49.6	And he said, It is a light thing that thou should be my slave to wake up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the desolations of Israel; I have also given thee for a light to the Gentiles that thou may be my saving health unto the end of the earth.
ISA.49.7	Thus has the 
ISA.49.8	Thus has the 
ISA.49.9	that thou may say to the prisoners, Go forth; and unto those that are in darkness, Show yourselves. Upon the ways shall they be fed, and upon all the high places shall be their pastures.
ISA.49.10	They shall never hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor sun smite them: for he that has mercy on them shall lead them, even by the springs of water he shall feed them.
ISA.49.11	And I will turn all my mountains into a way, and my highways shall be exalted.
ISA.49.12	Behold, these shall come from far; and, behold, these from the north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.
ISA.49.13	Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into singing, O mountains: for the 
ISA.49.14	But Zion said, The 
ISA.49.15	Can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Even though they may forget, I will not forget thee.
ISA.49.16	Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.
ISA.49.17	Thy builders shall come in haste; thy destroyers and those that made thee waste shall go forth of thee.
ISA.49.18	Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the 
ISA.49.19	For thy waste and thy desolate places and the land of thy destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and those that destroyed thee shall be separated far away.
ISA.49.20	Even thy sons which were fatherless, shall say in thine ears, The place is too strait for me; give place to me that I may dwell.
ISA.49.21	Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who has begotten me these, seeing I had lost my children and was desolate, a stranger removed from my land? and who has brought up these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?
ISA.49.22	Thus has the Lord GOD said, Behold, I will lift up my hand to the Gentiles and raise up my banner as an example to the peoples: and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.
ISA.49.23	And kings shall be thy nursing fathers and their princesses thy nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face toward the earth and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the 
ISA.49.24	Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?
ISA.49.25	But thus saith the 
ISA.49.26	And I will feed those that oppress thee with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet wine: and all flesh shall know that I the 
ISA.50.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.50.2	for I came, and no one showed himself; I called, and no one answered. Is my hand shortened at all, that it cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their fish stink because there is no water and die for thirst.
ISA.50.3	I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth their covering.
ISA.50.4	The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the wise that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary; he wakes up early, early shall he awaken my ear, that I might hear, as the wise.
ISA.50.5	The Lord GOD has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, neither turned away back.
ISA.50.6	I gave my back to the smiters and my cheeks to those that plucked off the hair: I did not hide my face from shame and spitting.
ISA.50.7	For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore, I was not ashamed; therefore, I have set my face like a flint, and I know that I shall not be ashamed.
ISA.50.8	He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand together; who is my adversary? let him come near to me.
ISA.50.9	Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall condemn me? behold, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth shall eat them up.
ISA.50.10	Who is among you that fears the 
ISA.50.11	Behold, that all of you kindle fire and are compassed about with sparks; walk in the light of your fire and of the sparks that ye have kindled. From my hand has come this; ye shall be buried in sorrow.
ISA.51.1	Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that seek the 
ISA.51.2	Look unto Abraham your father and unto Sarah that bore you; for I called him alone and blessed him and multiplied him.
ISA.51.3	For the 
ISA.51.4	Hearken unto me, my people, and give ear unto me, O my nation: for the law shall proceed from me, and I will uncover my judgment for a light of the peoples.
ISA.51.5	My righteousness is near; my saving health is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me; and on my arm shall they place their hope.
ISA.51.6	Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth beneath; for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and those that dwell therein shall perish in like manner; but my saving health shall be for ever, and my righteousness shall never perish.
ISA.51.7	Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in whose heart is my law; do not fear the reproach of men, neither be afraid of their revilings.
ISA.51.8	For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my saving health from age to age.
ISA.51.9	Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the 
ISA.51.10	Art thou not he who dried up the sea, the waters of the great deep; he who turned the depths of the sea into a way, that the redeemed might pass over?
ISA.51.11	Therefore the ransomed of the 
ISA.51.12	I, even I, am he that comforts you. Who art thou that thou should be afraid of man that is mortal and of the son of man which shall be counted as stubble?
ISA.51.13	And thou hast already forgotten the 
ISA.51.14	The prisoner is anxious that he may be loosed and that he should not die in the pit nor that his bread should fail.
ISA.51.15	And I am the 
ISA.51.16	That has placed my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee with the shadow of my hand, that thou may plant the heavens and lay the foundations of the earth and say unto Zion, Thou art my people.
ISA.51.17	Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the hand of the 
ISA.51.18	There is no one to guide her among all the sons whom she has brought forth; neither is there any that takes her by the hand of all the sons that she has brought up.
ISA.51.19	These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the sword. Who shall comfort thee?
ISA.51.20	Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the streets as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of the 
ISA.51.21	Therefore now hear this, thou afflicted and drunken, but not with wine:
ISA.51.22	Thus has thy Lord said, I AM thy God who pleads the cause of his people; Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury; thou shalt no more drink it again:
ISA.51.23	But I will put it into the hand of those that afflict thee, which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground and as the street to those that went over.
ISA.52.1	Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on the uncircumcised and the unclean shall no longer come into thee.
ISA.52.2	Shake thyself from the dust; arise and sit down, O Jerusalem: loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.
ISA.52.3	For thus saith the 
ISA.52.4	For thus has the Lord GOD said, My people went down aforetime into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian captured them without cause.
ISA.52.5	Now therefore, what have I here, saith the 
ISA.52.6	Therefore my people shall know my name for this reason in that day: for even I that speak, behold, I shall be present.
ISA.52.7	How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that brings good tidings, that publishes peace, that brings good tidings of good, that publishes saving health, that saith unto Zion, Thy God reigns!
ISA.52.8	The voice of thy watchmen! They shall lift up the voice; together they shall rejoice: for they shall see eye to eye, how the 
ISA.52.9	Sing praises, rejoice together, ye waste places of Jerusalem: for the 
ISA.52.10	The 
ISA.52.11	Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from there, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the 
ISA.52.12	For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the 
ISA.52.13	Behold, my slave shall be prospered; he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.
ISA.52.14	As many rejected thee, in such manner was his likeness and his beauty, disfigured from the sons of men:
ISA.52.15	But he shall sprinkle many Gentiles; the kings shall shut their mouths over him: for that which had not been told them they shall see; and that which they had not heard they shall understand.
ISA.53.1	Who shall believe our report? and upon whom shall the arm of the 
ISA.53.2	With all this he shall grow up before him as a tender sprout and as a root out of a dry ground. There is no outward appearance in him, nor beauty. We shall see him, yet nothing attractive about him that we should desire him.
ISA.53.3	He is despised and rejected among men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with weakness; and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
ISA.53.4	Surely he has borne our sicknesses and suffered our pain: and we considered him stricken, smitten of God, and cast down.
ISA.53.5	But he was wounded for our rebellions; he was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and by his stripes healing was provided for us.
ISA.53.6	All we like sheep have become lost; we have turned each one to his own way; and the 
ISA.53.7	He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he did not open his mouth.
ISA.53.8	He was taken from prison and from judgment; and who shall count his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the rebellion of my people he was smitten.
ISA.53.9	And he made his grave with the wicked, and his death with the rich; even though he had never done evil, neither was any deceit in his mouth.
ISA.53.10	With all this the 
ISA.53.11	He shall see of the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied. And by his knowledge shall my righteous slave justify many, for he shall bear their iniquities.
ISA.53.12	Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil unto the strong because he has poured out his soul unto death, and he was numbered with the rebellious, having borne the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.
ISA.54.1	Rejoice, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into singing, and cry aloud with joy, thou that didst not travail with child: for more shall be the sons of the desolate than the sons of the married wife, said the 
ISA.54.2	Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes;
ISA.54.3	for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left, and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.
ISA.54.4	Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more.
ISA.54.5	For thy Maker shall be thine husband; the 
ISA.54.6	For as a woman forsaken and grieved in spirit has the 
ISA.54.7	For a small moment I have forsaken thee; but with great mercies I will gather thee.
ISA.54.8	In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with eternal mercy I will have compassion on thee, said the 
ISA.54.9	For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so I have sworn that I would not be wroth again with thee, nor reprehend thee.
ISA.54.10	For the mountains shall be removed, and the hills shall tremble; but my mercy shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be changed, said the 
ISA.54.11	O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will cement thy stones upon carbuncle and lay thy foundations upon sapphires.
ISA.54.12	And I will make thy windows of precious stones, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy borders of stones of great price.
ISA.54.13	And all thy sons shall be taught of the 
ISA.54.14	With righteousness shalt thou be adorned: thou shalt be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear it; and from terror; for it shall not come near thee.
ISA.54.15	If anyone should conspire against thee, it shall be without me, whosoever would conspire against thee shall fall before thee.
ISA.54.16	Behold, I have created the smith that blows the coals in the fire, and that brings forth the instrument for his work; and I have created the waster to destroy.
ISA.54.17	No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the slaves of the 
ISA.55.1	Ho, every one that thirsts, come ye to the waters, and he that has no money; come ye, buy, and eat; come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.
ISA.55.2	Why do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and your labour for that which does not satisfy? Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in fatness.
ISA.55.3	Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an eternal covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.
ISA.55.4	Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples, a captain and teacher to the peoples.
ISA.55.5	Behold, thou shalt call a people that thou knowest not, and Gentiles that did not know thee shall run unto thee because of the 
ISA.55.6	Seek the 
ISA.55.7	Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts: and let him return unto the 
ISA.55.8	For my thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are your ways as my ways, saith the 
ISA.55.9	For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts more than your thoughts.
ISA.55.10	For as the rain comes down, and the snow from the heavens, and does not return there, but waters the earth and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater:
ISA.55.11	So shall my Word be that goes forth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall be prospered in that for which I sent it.
ISA.55.12	For ye shall go out with joy, and be returned with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
ISA.55.13	Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to the 
ISA.56.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.56.2	Blessed is the man that does this, and the son of man that lays hold on it; that keeps from polluting the sabbath, and keeps his hand from doing any evil.
ISA.56.3	Neither let the son of the stranger that has joined himself to the 
ISA.56.4	For thus has the 
ISA.56.5	even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls a place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, that shall never be cut off.
ISA.56.6	Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the 
ISA.56.7	even them will I bring to the mountain of my holiness, and refresh them in the house of my prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices shall be accepted upon my altar; for my house shall be called, House of prayer for all peoples.
ISA.56.8	The Lord GOD who gathers the outcasts of Israel says, I will still gather upon him his gathered ones.
ISA.56.9	All ye beasts of the field, all ye beasts of the forest; come to devour.
ISA.56.10	His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant; they are all dumb dogs; they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, they love to slumber.
ISA.56.11	And these anxious dogs are insatiable, and even the shepherds did not know enough to understand: they all look to their own ways, each one for his gain, from his quarter.
ISA.56.12	Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day, or much more excellent.
ISA.57.1	The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart: and merciful men are taken away, none considering that the righteous is taken away from the evil to come.
ISA.57.2	He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each one walking in his uprightness.
ISA.57.3	But come here, ye sons of the sorceress, generation of the adulterer and the whore.
ISA.57.4	Against whom do ye sport yourselves? Against whom do ye make a wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? Are ye not rebellious sons, a lying seed of transgression,
ISA.57.5	inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree, slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the rocks?
ISA.57.6	Among the smooth stones of the valley is thy portion; they, they are thy lot: even unto them hast thou poured a drink offering, thou hast offered a present. Should I not avenge these things?
ISA.57.7	Upon the lofty and high mountain thou hast set thy bed: even there thou didst go up to offer sacrifice.
ISA.57.8	Behind the doors also and the posts thou hast set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed and made thee a covenant with them; thou didst love their bed wherever thou didst see it.
ISA.57.9	And thou didst go to the king with ointment and didst multiply thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst debase thyself even unto Sheol.
ISA.57.10	Thou became wearied in the multitude of thy ways; yet thou didst not say, There is no remedy: thou hast found that which thou wast searching for; therefore thou repented not.
ISA.57.11	And of whom hast thou reverenced or feared? Why dost thou lie; that thou hast not remembered me, nor have I come to thy thought? Have I not held my peace even of old, and thou hast never feared me?
ISA.57.12	I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they shall not profit thee.
ISA.57.13	When thou criest, let thy companions deliver thee; but the wind shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that waits in me shall have the land by inheritance and shall possess the mountain of my holiness.
ISA.57.14	And shall say, Clear away, clear away, level the way, take away the stumblingblocks out of the way of my people.
ISA.57.15	For thus has said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is The Holy One; I dwell in the high place and in holiness and with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to cause the spirit of the humble to live and to cause the heart of the contrite ones to live.
ISA.57.16	For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for by me is the spirit covered by the body, and I have made the souls.
ISA.57.17	For the iniquity of his covetousness I was wroth and smote him: I hid my face and was wroth, and he went on rebelliously in the way of his heart.
ISA.57.18	I have seen his ways and will heal him: I will lead him also and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.
ISA.57.19	I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is far off and to him that is near, said the 
ISA.57.20	But the wicked are like the sea in tempest, that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.
ISA.57.21	There is no peace, saith my God, for the wicked.
ISA.58.1	Cry aloud, do not hold back; lift up thy voice like a shofar and preach to my people their rebellion and to the house of Jacob their sin.
ISA.58.2	That they seek me daily and want to know my ways, as people that do righteousness and have not forsaken the rights of their God: they ask me of the rights of righteousness and desire to approach God.
ISA.58.3	Why have we fasted, they say, and thou dost not see? why have we afflicted our soul, and thou dost take no knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find your own pleasure and exact your own estates.
ISA.58.4	Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day to make your voice to be heard on high.
ISA.58.5	Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a fast and an acceptable day to the 
ISA.58.6	Is not rather the fast that I have chosen, to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the ties of oppression, to release into freedom those who are broken, and that ye break every yoke?
ISA.58.7	Is it not to share thy bread with the hungry and that thou bring the poor that are cast out into thy house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him; and that thou not hide thyself from thy brother?
ISA.58.8	Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness shall go before thee; the glory of the 
ISA.58.9	Then shalt thou call, and thou shalt hear the 
ISA.58.10	and if thou pour out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and thy darkness be as the noonday:
ISA.58.11	And the 
ISA.58.12	And they shall build up out of thee the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the fallen foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
ISA.58.13	If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy will on my holy day; and call the sabbath the delightful, holy, glorious day of the 
ISA.58.14	Then shalt thou delight thyself in the 
ISA.59.1	Behold, the 
ISA.59.2	But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.
ISA.59.3	For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips pronounce lies; your tongue speaks evil.
ISA.59.4	No one calls for righteousness, nor do any judge by the truth; they trust in vanity, and speak vanities; they conceive trouble and bring forth iniquity.
ISA.59.5	They hatch cockatrice’ eggs and weave the spider’s web; whosoever shall eat of their eggs shall die, and if they should squeeze them, a viper shall come out.
ISA.59.6	Their cloth is unfit to be a garment, neither shall they cover themselves with their works; their works are works of violence, and the work of iniquity is in their hands.
ISA.59.7	Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and destruction are their paths.
ISA.59.8	The way of peace they did not know; nor is there anything straight about their ways; they have wilfully made themselves crooked paths; whosoever goes therein shall not know peace.
ISA.59.9	Therefore judgment has withdrawn from us, and righteousness has never overtaken us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for brightness, but we walk in darkness.
ISA.59.10	We grope for the wall like the blind, and as if we had no eyes we walk by touch; we stumble at noonday as in the night; we are in graves as dead men.
ISA.59.11	We all roar like bears and mourn sore like doves: we look for judgment, but there is none; for saving health, but it has withdrawn from us.
ISA.59.12	For our rebellions are multiplied before thee, and our sins have testified against us; for our iniquities are with us; and we know our sins:
ISA.59.13	To rebel and to lie against the 
ISA.59.14	and that which is right has departed, and righteousness withdrew afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity could not enter.
ISA.59.15	And the truth was taken captive; and he that departed from evil was imprisoned: and the 
ISA.59.16	And he saw that there was no man and wondered that there was no intercessor; therefore his arm brought salvation unto him, and his righteousness, it sustained him.
ISA.59.17	For he put on righteousness as a coat of mail, and a helmet of saving health upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing and was clad with zeal as a cloak,
ISA.59.18	so as to give payment, so as to repay the vengeance of his enemies, and repay his adversaries; to the islands he will give recompense.
ISA.59.19	So shall they fear the name of the 
ISA.59.20	And the Redeemer shall come to Zion and unto those that turn from the rebellion in Jacob, said the 
ISA.59.21	And this shall be my covenant with them, said the 
ISA.60.1	Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the 
ISA.60.2	For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the peoples: but the 
ISA.60.3	And the Gentiles shall walk to thy light, and the kings to the brightness of thy birth.
ISA.60.4	Lift up thine eyes round about and see: they all gather themselves together; they come to thee; thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.
ISA.60.5	Then thou shall see, and thou shall shine, and thine heart shall marvel, and be enlarged because the abundance of the sea shall be converted unto thee, the strength of the Gentiles shall have come unto thee.
ISA.60.6	The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense; and they shall show forth the praises of the 
ISA.60.7	All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, rams of Nebaioth shall be served unto thee: they shall be offered up with grace upon my altar, and I will glorify the house of my glory.
ISA.60.8	Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
ISA.60.9	For the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish from the first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold with them, unto the name of the 
ISA.60.10	And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall serve thee; for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my good favour I shall have mercy on thee.
ISA.60.11	Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; that the strength of the Gentiles may be brought unto thee, and their kings guided.
ISA.60.12	For the people or the kingdom that will not serve thee shall perish and shall be utterly wasted.
ISA.60.13	The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary; and I will honour the place of my feet.
ISA.60.14	The sons also of those that afflicted thee shall come humbled unto thee; and at the steps of thy feet all those that despised thee shall bow themselves down; and they shall call thee, The city of the 
ISA.60.15	Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee, I will place thee in eternal glory, in joy from generation to generation.
ISA.60.16	Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breast of the kings: and thou shalt know that I the 
ISA.60.17	For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for the stones iron; I will also put peace in the place of thy government, and righteousness in the place of thine oppressors.
ISA.60.18	Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls Saving Health and thy gates Praise.
ISA.60.19	The sun shall no longer be thy light by day; nor shall the moon give light unto thee for brightness; but the 
ISA.60.20	Thy sun shall set no more; neither shall thy moon wane: for the 
ISA.60.21	And thy people shall all be righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever; they shall be shoots of my planting, the work of my hands, that I may be glorified.
ISA.60.22	The small one shall be as a thousand; the youngest as a strong nation; I the 
ISA.61.1	The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me because the 
ISA.61.2	to proclaim the year of the 
ISA.61.3	to order in Zion those that mourn, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the 
ISA.61.4	And they shall build the old wastes; they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall restore the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
ISA.61.5	And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
ISA.61.6	But ye shall be named the Priests of the 
ISA.61.7	Instead of your double shame, and your dishonour, they shall praise you in your inheritance; therefore in your land ye shall possess double, and ye shall have everlasting joy.
ISA.61.8	For I the 
ISA.61.9	And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles and their offspring among the peoples; all that saw them shall acknowledge them that they are the seed which the 
ISA.61.10	I will greatly rejoice in the 
ISA.61.11	For as the earth brings forth her shoot and as the garden causes her seed to spring forth so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the Gentiles.
ISA.62.1	For Zion’s sake I will not hold my peace; and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest until her righteousness goes forth as brightness and her saving health is lit as a flaming torch.
ISA.62.2	And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness and all the kings thy glory; and thou shalt be given a new name, which the mouth of the 
ISA.62.3	Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the 
ISA.62.4	Thou shalt no longer be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any longer be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called Hephzibah {Heb. my will in her} and thy land Beulah; {Heb. married}; for the will of the 
ISA.62.5	For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee; and as the bridegroom rejoices with the bride, so shall thy God rejoice with thee.
ISA.62.6	I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night; ye that make mention of the 
ISA.62.7	and give him no rest, until he establishes and until he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
ISA.62.8	The 
ISA.62.9	But those that have gathered it shall eat it and praise the 
ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; clear up, clear up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a banner as an example for the people.
ISA.62.11	Behold, the 
ISA.62.12	And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the 
ISA.63.1	Who is this that comes from Edom, with red garments from Bozrah? This glorious one in his apparel, travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.
ISA.63.2	Why art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treads in the winefat?
ISA.63.3	I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was no one with me; for I have trodden them with my anger and have trampled them with my fury; and their blood sprinkled my garments and stained all my raiment.
ISA.63.4	For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.
ISA.63.5	And I looked, and there was no one to help; and I wondered that there was no one to uphold me; therefore my own arm brought salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.
ISA.63.6	And I have trampled down the people with my anger and made them drunk in my fury, and I brought down their strength to the earth.
ISA.63.7	I will mention the mercies of the 
ISA.63.8	For he said, Surely they are my people, sons that do not lie: and he was their Saviour.
ISA.63.9	In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his face saved them: with his love and with his clemency he redeemed them; and he bore them and carried them all the days of the age.
ISA.63.10	But they were rebels and angered his holy Spirit; therefore, he was turned to be their enemy, and he himself fought against them.
ISA.63.11	Then he remembered the days of old, of Moses, and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his flock? Where is he that put his Holy Spirit within him?
ISA.63.12	He that led them by the right hand of Moses with the arm of his glory, he who divided the water before them, thus making himself an everlasting name.
ISA.63.13	He that led them through the deep, as a horse in the wilderness, they never stumbled.
ISA.63.14	The Spirit of the 
ISA.63.15	Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory; where is thy zeal and thy strength, the feeling of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are they restrained?
ISA.63.16	Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel not acknowledge us; thou, O 
ISA.63.17	O 
ISA.63.18	The people of thy holiness have possessed the promised land but a little while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.
ISA.63.19	We have been like those over whom thou didst never rule, who were never called by thy name.
ISA.64.1	Oh that thou would rend the heavens, that thou would come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
ISA.64.2	as when the melting fire burns, the fire causes the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the Gentiles may tremble at thy presence!
ISA.64.3	As thou didst come down when thou didst terrible things which we did not look for, that the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
ISA.64.4	Nor have men heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen a God beside thee, that thou might do it again for the one who waits in him.
ISA.64.5	Thou didst come out to meet him that with rejoicing had worked righteousness. In thy ways they remembered thee. Behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: thy ways are eternal, and we shall be saved.
ISA.64.6	But we were all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses as filthy rags; and we all fell as the leaves of a tree; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
ISA.64.7	And there is none that calls upon thy name, that wakes himself up to take hold of thee; therefore, thou hast hid thy face from us and hast allowed us to wither in the power of our iniquities.
ISA.64.8	But now, O 
ISA.64.9	Be not wroth very sore, O 
ISA.64.10	Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
ISA.64.11	Our house of our Sanctuary and of our glory, where our fathers praised thee, was burned up with fire; and all our precious things were destroyed.
ISA.64.12	Wilt thou refrain thyself regarding these things, O 
ISA.65.1	I was sought of those that did not ask for me; I was found of those that did not seek me; I said, Here I am, Here I am, unto a people that did not invoke my name.
ISA.65.2	I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious people, who walk in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts;
ISA.65.3	a people that provokes me to anger continually to my face; that sacrifices in gardens, and burns incense upon altars of brick;
ISA.65.4	who remain asleep among the graves, and lodge in the deserts, who eat swine’s flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;
ISA.65.5	who say, Stand by thyself, do not come near to me; for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.
ISA.65.6	Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,
ISA.65.7	For your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, saith the 
ISA.65.8	Thus has the 
ISA.65.9	And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains; and my elect shall possess the land for an inheritance, and my slaves shall dwell there.
ISA.65.10	And Sharon shall be for a fold of flocks and the valley of Achor a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have sought me.
ISA.65.11	But ye that forsake the 
ISA.65.12	I also will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter because when I called, ye did not respond; I spoke, and ye did not hear, but did evil before my eyes and did choose that which displeased me.
ISA.65.13	Therefore thus has the Lord GOD said, Behold, my slaves shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold, my slaves shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold, my slaves shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed:
ISA.65.14	Behold, my slaves shall rejoice by the joy of their heart, but ye shall cry for the sorrow of your heart and shall howl for the destruction of spirit.
ISA.65.15	And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen; for the Lord GOD shall slay thee and call his slaves by another name.
ISA.65.16	He who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth because the former troubles shall be forgotten and shall be covered from my eyes.
ISA.65.17	For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
ISA.65.18	But ye shall be glad and rejoice from age to age in the things which I shall create; for, behold, I create joy unto Jerusalem and unto her people joy.
ISA.65.19	And I will be glad with Jerusalem and rejoice with my people: and the voice of weeping shall no longer be heard in her, nor the voice of crying.
ISA.65.20	There shall no longer be there an infant of days, nor an old man that has not filled his days, for the child shall die one hundred years old; and he who sins at one hundred years of age shall be accursed.
ISA.65.21	And they shall build houses and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them.
ISA.65.22	They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of the trees shall be the days of my people, and my elect shall perpetuate the work of their hands.
ISA.65.23	They shall not labour in vain, nor give birth with fear; for their births are the seed of the blessed of the 
ISA.65.24	And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
ISA.65.25	The wolf and the lamb shall be fed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent’s food. They shall not afflict nor do evil in all my holy mountain, said the 
ISA.66.1	Thus saith the 
ISA.66.2	For all these things my hand has made, by my hand has these things been, said the 
ISA.66.3	He that kills an ox is as if he slew a man; he that sacrifices a lamb as if he cut off a dog’s neck; he that offers an oblation as if he offered swine’s blood; he that burns incense as if he blessed iniquity. They have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations.
ISA.66.4	I also will choose their delusions and will bring their fears upon them because I called, and no one answered; I spoke, and they did not hear: but they did evil before my eyes and chose that which displeased me.
ISA.66.5	Hear the word of the 
ISA.66.6	A voice of noise from the city, a voice of the temple, a voice of the 
ISA.66.7	Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came, she was delivered of a man child.
ISA.66.8	Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall the earth bring forth in one day? Shall an entire nation be born at once? that Zion travailed, and shall bring forth her sons together?
ISA.66.9	I, who make births to happen, shall I not be with child? saith the 
ISA.66.10	Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her: be filled with joy with her, all ye that mourn for her:
ISA.66.11	That ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations; that ye may milk out, and be delighted with the splendour of her glory.
ISA.66.12	For thus saith the 
ISA.66.13	As a man child whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
ISA.66.14	And ye shall see, your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like grass; and the hand of the 
ISA.66.15	For, behold, the 
ISA.66.16	For by fire and by his sword will the 
ISA.66.17	Those that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, one behind another; those that eat swine’s flesh and abomination, and the mouse shall be cut off together, saith the 
ISA.66.18	For I understand their works and their thoughts. The time shall come to gather all the Gentiles and tongues; and they shall come and see my glory.
ISA.66.19	And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those that escape of them unto the Gentiles, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal, and Javan, to the isles afar off, that have never heard my name, nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
ISA.66.20	And they shall bring all your brethren for an offering unto the 
ISA.66.21	And I will also take of them for priests and for Levites, saith the 
ISA.66.22	For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I make, shall remain before me, saith the 
ISA.66.23	And it shall come to pass that from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another all flesh shall come to worship before me, said the 
ISA.66.24	And they shall go forth and look upon the carcasses of the men that rebelled against me; for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.
JER.1.1	The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:
JER.1.2	To whom the word of the 
JER.1.3	It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month.
JER.1.4	Then the word of the 
JER.1.5	Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Gentiles.
JER.1.6	Then I said, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I do not know how to speak: for I am a child.
JER.1.7	But the 
JER.1.8	Do not be afraid of their faces; for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the 
JER.1.9	Then the 
JER.1.10	See, I have placed thee in this day over Gentiles and over kingdoms, to root out, and to destroy, and to throw out, and to cast down, to build, and to plant.
JER.1.11	Moreover the word of the 
JER.1.12	Then the 
JER.1.13	And the word of the 
JER.1.14	Then the 
JER.1.15	For, behold, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the 
JER.1.16	And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me and have burned incense unto other gods and worshipped the works of their own hands.
JER.1.17	Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and thou shalt arise and speak unto them all that I shall command thee; do not fear them lest I confound thee before them.
JER.1.18	For, behold, I have made thee this day as a defenced city and as an iron pillar and as a wall of brass upon all the earth against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.
JER.1.19	And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the 
JER.2.1	Moreover the word of the 
JER.2.2	Go and cry out in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the 
JER.2.3	Israel was holiness unto the 
JER.2.4	Hear ye the word of the 
JER.2.5	thus hath the 
JER.2.6	Neither did they say, Where is the 
JER.2.7	And I brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination.
JER.2.8	The priests did not say, Where is the 
JER.2.9	Therefore I will yet enter into judgment with you, saith the 
JER.2.10	For pass over the isles of Chittim and see; and send unto Kedar and consider diligently and see if there be such a thing.
JER.2.11	Has a nation changed their gods? Even though they are not gods. But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.
JER.2.12	Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this; and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, said the 
JER.2.13	For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters to hew them out cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.
JER.2.14	Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn slave? Why has he been given over as a prey?
JER.2.15	The young lions roared upon him and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are deserted without inhabitant.
JER.2.16	Even the sons of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head.
JER.2.17	Could this not have come upon you peradventure because thou hast forsaken the 
JER.2.18	And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt? to drink the waters of the Nile? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria? to drink the waters of the river Eufrates?
JER.2.19	Thine own wickedness shall chastise thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee; know therefore and see how evil and bitter it is, that thou hast forsaken the 
JER.2.20	For of old time I have broken thy yoke and burst thy bands; and thou didst say, I will not serve sin. With all this, upon every high hill and under every green tree thou dost wander, playing the harlot.
JER.2.21	Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, a seed of Truth, all of her; how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?
JER.2.22	For though thou wash thee with nitre and take thee much soap, yet thine iniquity is sealed before me, saith the Lord GOD.
JER.2.23	How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? See thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways;
JER.2.24	a wild ass used to the wilderness that breaths according to the desire of her soul; from her lust, who shall stop her? All those that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.
JER.2.25	Withhold thy foot from being unshod and thy throat from thirst; but thou didst say, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.
JER.2.26	As the thief is ashamed when he is taken, so shall the house of Israel be ashamed: they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,
JER.2.27	saying to a piece of firewood, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they say, Arise and deliver us.
JER.2.28	But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? Let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble, for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah.
JER.2.29	Why will ye plead with me? Ye have all rebelled against me, saith the 
JER.2.30	I have smitten your children in vain; they have received no correction; your own sword has devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.
JER.2.31	O generation, see ye the word of the 
JER.2.32	Shall the virgin, perchance, forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number.
JER.2.33	Why dost thou trim thy way to seek love? therefore thou hast also taught the wicked ones thy ways.
JER.2.34	Even in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents; thou didst not find them in any trespass, but by all these things.
JER.2.35	Yet thou didst say, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee because thou hast said, I did not sin.
JER.2.36	Why dost thou talk so much, changing thy ways? Thou shalt also be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.
JER.2.37	Thou shalt also go forth from him with thine hands upon thine head; for the 
JER.3.1	They say, If a man puts away his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man’s, shall he return unto her again? Is she not a land that is now completely polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, said the 
JER.3.2	Lift up thine eyes unto the high places and see if there is anywhere thou hast not been ravished. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wickedness.
JER.3.3	Therefore the rain has been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and thou dost have a whore’s forehead, thou dost refuse to be ashamed.
JER.3.4	Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth?
JER.3.5	Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done as many evil things as thou could.
JER.3.6	The 
JER.3.7	And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me. But she did not return. And her rebellious sister Judah saw it.
JER.3.8	And I saw when for all the causes by which rebellious Israel committed adultery, I had put her away and given her a bill of divorce; yet her rebellious sister Judah did not fear, but went and played the harlot also.
JER.3.9	And it came to pass through her judging her whoredom to be a light thing that the land became defiled and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.
JER.3.10	And yet for all this her rebellious sister Judah has never turned unto me with her whole heart, but untruthfully, said the 
JER.3.11	And the 
JER.3.12	Go and proclaim these words toward the north wind and say, Return, thou rebellious Israel, said the 
JER.3.13	Only acknowledge thine iniquity that thou hast rebelled against the 
JER.3.14	Turn, O rebellious sons, said the 
JER.3.15	And I will give you pastors according to my heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.
JER.3.16	And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied and increased in the land; in those days, said the 
JER.3.17	At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the 
JER.3.18	In those times they shall go out from the house of Judah unto the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north wind to the land which I caused your fathers to inherit.
JER.3.19	But I said, How shall I place thee as sons and give thee the desirable land, the heritage that the hosts of Gentiles desire? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father, and shalt not turn away from following me.
JER.3.20	Surely as the woman breaks the faith of her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, said the 
JER.3.21	A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping of the supplications of the sons of Israel; for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the 
JER.3.22	Return, ye rebellious sons, and I will heal your rebellion. Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the 
JER.3.23	Truly the hills are vanity, the multitude of mountains; truly in the 
JER.3.24	For shame has devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth: their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.
JER.3.25	We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covers us; for we have sinned against the 
JER.4.1	If thou wilt return unto me, O Israel, said the 
JER.4.2	And thou shalt swear, The 
JER.4.3	For thus has the 
JER.4.4	Circumcise yourselves to the 
JER.4.5	Declare ye in Judah and publish in Jerusalem and say, Blow ye the shofar in the land; cry, gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.
JER.4.6	Set up the banner in Zion: come together, do not delay: for I bring evil from the north wind, and a great destruction.
JER.4.7	The lion is come up from his den, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant.
JER.4.8	For this, gird yourselves with sackcloth; lament and howl; for the fierce anger of the 
JER.4.9	And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the 
JER.4.10	(Then I said, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; when the sword reaches unto the soul.)
JER.4.11	At that time it shall be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places of the wilderness came toward the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse.
JER.4.12	A wind much more violent than these shall come unto me; for now I will also speak judgments against them.
JER.4.13	Behold, he shall come up as a cloud, and his chariots as a whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us, for we are given over to be spoiled!
JER.4.14	O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness that thou may be saved. How long shalt thou entertain the thoughts of thy iniquity within thee?
JER.4.15	For the voice is heard from him who brings the news from Dan and from him who causes to hear the affliction from Mount Ephraim.
JER.4.16	Say ye of the Gentiles; behold, cause it to be heard upon Jerusalem, Watchmen come from a far country and shall give out their voice upon the cities of Judah.
JER.4.17	As the watchmen of the heritages, they were upon her round about because she has been rebellious against me, saith the 
JER.4.18	Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this is thy wickedness because it is bitter, because it reaches unto thine heart.
JER.4.19	My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart makes a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the shofar, the alarm of war.
JER.4.20	Destruction upon destruction is cried, for the whole land is destroyed; suddenly are my tents destroyed, and my curtains in a moment.
JER.4.21	How long shall I see the banner and hear the voice of the shofar?
JER.4.22	For my people are foolish; the ignorant sons with no understanding have not known me; they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.
JER.4.23	I beheld the earth, and, behold, it was without order, and empty; and the heavens, and they had no light.
JER.4.24	I beheld the mountains, and, behold, they trembled, and all the hills were destroyed.
JER.4.25	I beheld, and, behold, there was no man, and all the birds of the heavens had fled.
JER.4.26	I beheld, and, behold, Carmel was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the 
JER.4.27	For thus hath the 
JER.4.28	For this shall the earth be made desolate, and the heavens above be darkened because I spoke; I purposed and did not repent, neither will I turn back from it.
JER.4.29	The whole city fled from the thunder of the horsemen and bowmen; they went into the thickets of the forests and climbed up upon the rocks; every city was forsaken, and not a man dwells therein.
JER.4.30	And thou who art destroyed, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothe thyself with crimson, though thou deck thee with ornaments of gold, though thou paint thy eyes with antimony, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee; they will seek thy life.
JER.4.31	For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, the anguish as of her that brings forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewails herself, that spreads her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is faint because of the murderers.
JER.5.1	Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem and see now and find out and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that execute judgment, that seek the truth; and I will pardon the city.
JER.5.2	And if they should say, The 
JER.5.3	O 
JER.5.4	Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they have become foolish; for they do not know the way of the 
JER.5.5	I will go unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they have known the way of the 
JER.5.6	Therefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the desert shall destroy them and a tiger shall lie in wait over their cities; anyone that goes out from there shall be torn in pieces because their rebellions have been multiplied, and their backslidings are increased.
JER.5.7	How shall I pardon thee for this? Thy sons have forsaken me and sworn by them that are not gods: when I had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots’ houses.
JER.5.8	They were as fed horses in the morning; each one neighed after his neighbour’s wife.
JER.5.9	Shall I not visit for these things? said the 
JER.5.10	Go ye up upon her walls and destroy; but make not a full end; take away her battlements for they are not the 
JER.5.11	For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have made a firm decision to rebel against me, saith the 
JER.5.12	They have denied the 
JER.5.13	but the prophets shall become like wind, and there is no word in them: thus shall it be done unto them.
JER.5.14	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.5.15	Behold, I will bring a nation upon you from afar, O house of Israel, saith the 
JER.5.16	Their quiver is as an open sepulcher; they are all mighty men.
JER.5.17	And they shall eat up thine harvest and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine herds; they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees; and thy fenced cities, in which thou dost trust, they shall bring to nothing with the sword.
JER.5.18	Nevertheless in those days, saith the 
JER.5.19	And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why does the 
JER.5.20	Declare this in the house of Jacob and publish it in Judah, saying,
JER.5.21	Hear now this, O foolish people and without heart, who have eyes and do not see; who have ears, and do not hear:
JER.5.22	Do ye not fear me? saith the 
JER.5.23	But this people have a false and rebellious heart; they turned and went.
JER.5.24	Neither do they say in their heart, Let us now fear the 
JER.5.25	Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good things from you.
JER.5.26	For among my people were found wicked men: they lay in wait as he that sets snares; they set a trap of perdition to catch men.
JER.5.27	As a cage full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit; thus they became great and rich.
JER.5.28	They are become fat; they shine; yea, they overpass in deeds of wickedness; they did not judge the cause, the cause of the fatherless; with all this they made themselves prosperous; and they did not judge the cause of the poor.
JER.5.29	Shall I not visit for these things? saith the 
JER.5.30	A horrible and ugly thing is committed in the land:
JER.5.31	The prophets prophesied falsely, and the priests bore rule by their hands; and my people love to have it so. What will ye do in the end thereof?
JER.6.1	O ye sons of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem and blow the shofar in Tekoa and set up as a sign smoke in Bethhaccerem; for evil appears out of the north wind and great destruction.
JER.6.2	I shall liken the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman.
JER.6.3	The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed each one his portion.
JER.6.4	Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up towards the south. Woe unto us! for the day goes away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out.
JER.6.5	Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her palaces.
JER.6.6	For thus hath the 
JER.6.7	As the waters never cease to flow from a fountain, so her wickedness never ceases to flow; injustice and robbery is heard in her; in my presence continually, sickness and wounds.
JER.6.8	Chastise Jerusalem lest peradventure my soul be disjointed from thee, lest peradventure I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.
JER.6.9	Thus hath the 
JER.6.10	To whom shall I speak, and give warning that they may hear? behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken, behold, the word of the 
JER.6.11	Therefore I am full of the fury of the 
JER.6.12	And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the 
JER.6.13	For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them each one is given to greed; and from the prophet even unto the priest every one deals falsely.
JER.6.14	They treat also the destruction of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.
JER.6.15	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush; therefore, they shall fall among those that shall fall: at the time that I visit them they shall fall, saith the 
JER.6.16	Thus hath the 
JER.6.17	Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the shofar. But they said, We will not hearken.
JER.6.18	Therefore hear, ye Gentiles, and know, O congregation of Gentiles.
JER.6.19	Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts because they have not hearkened unto my words, and they hated my law.
JER.6.20	To what purpose does this incense come to me from Sheba and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt offerings are not according to my will, nor are your sacrifices sweet unto me.
JER.6.21	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.6.22	Thus hath the 
JER.6.23	They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and they shall have no mercy; their voice shall roar like the sea; and they shall ride upon horses set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.
JER.6.24	We have heard the fame thereof; our hands wax feeble; anguish has taken hold of us, and pain as of a woman in travail.
JER.6.25	Do not go forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side.
JER.6.26	O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth and wallow thyself in ashes; make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation; for the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us.
JER.6.27	I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people; thou shalt know and examine their way.
JER.6.28	They are all rebellious princes; they walk with deception: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters.
JER.6.29	The bellows are burned; the lead is consumed of the fire; the founder melts in vain; for the wicked are not plucked away.
JER.6.30	Reprobate silver shall men call them because the 
JER.7.1	The word that was sent to Jeremiah from the 
JER.7.2	Stand in the gate of the 
JER.7.3	Thus hath the 
JER.7.4	Do not trust in lying words, saying, The temple of the 
JER.7.5	For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if ye thoroughly do right between a man and his neighbour,
JER.7.6	if ye do not oppress the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed no innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt,
JER.7.7	then I will cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers for ever and ever.
JER.7.8	Behold, ye trust in lying words that cannot profit.
JER.7.9	Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not,
JER.7.10	and come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are free to do all these abominations?
JER.7.11	Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, said the 
JER.7.12	But go now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel.
JER.7.13	And now because ye have done all these works, said the 
JER.7.14	therefore I will do unto this house, which is called by my name, in which ye trust, and unto this place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.
JER.7.15	And I will cast you out of my sight as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.
JER.7.16	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee.
JER.7.17	Dost thou not see what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
JER.7.18	The sons gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead their dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto other gods that they may provoke me to anger.
JER.7.19	Shall they provoke me to anger? said the 
JER.7.20	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man and upon beast and upon the trees of the field and upon the fruit of the ground, and it shall burn and shall not be quenched.
JER.7.21	Thus hath the 
JER.7.22	For I did not speak unto your fathers, nor command them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices:
JER.7.23	But this thing I commanded them, saying, Hear my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the way that I have commanded you that it may be well unto you.
JER.7.24	But they did not hearken, nor incline their ear, but walked in their own counsels in the imagination of their evil heart and went backward, and not forward
JER.7.25	since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt unto this day. I have even sent unto you all my slaves, the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them;
JER.7.26	yet they did not hearken unto me, nor incline their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.
JER.7.27	Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt even call unto them; but they will not answer thee.
JER.7.28	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation that did not hear the voice of the 
JER.7.29	Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away and take up a lamentation on high places; for the 
JER.7.30	For the sons of Judah have done evil in my sight, said the 
JER.7.31	And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, which I did not command them, neither did it come into my heart.
JER.7.32	Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.7.33	And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth; and there shall be no one to chase them away.
JER.7.34	Then I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate.
JER.8.1	At that time, said the 
JER.8.2	and they shall spread them before the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved and whom they have served and after whom they have walked and whom they have sought and whom they have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth.
JER.8.3	And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of those that remain of this evil generation, in all the places where I have driven those that remain, said the 
JER.8.4	Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the 
JER.8.5	Why then is this people of Jerusalem rebellious with a perpetual rebellion? They hold fast deceit; they refuse to return.
JER.8.6	I hearkened and heard, but they did not speak aright: there was no man that repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? each one returned to his course as the horse rushes into the battle.
JER.8.7	Even the stork in the heaven knows her appointed time; and the turtle dove and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people did not know the judgment of the 
JER.8.8	How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the 
JER.8.9	The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: behold, they have rejected the word of the 
JER.8.10	Therefore I will give their wives unto others and their fields unto those that shall inherit them: for each one from the least even unto the greatest is given to greed; from the prophet even unto the priest every one deals falsely.
JER.8.11	For they have treated the destruction of the daughter of my people lightly, saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace.
JER.8.12	Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? No, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among those that should fall: when I visit them, they shall fall, saith the 
JER.8.13	I will surely cut them off completely, said the 
JER.8.14	Upon what shall we secure ourselves? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the 
JER.8.15	We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold trouble!
JER.8.16	/strong> The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan; the whole earth trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are come and have devoured the land and all that is in it, the city and those that dwell therein.
JER.8.17	For, behold, I send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, said the 
JER.8.18	Because of my strong sorrow, my heart is faint in me.
JER.8.19	Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people that comes from a far country: Is not the 
JER.8.20	The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.
JER.8.21	For the destruction of the daughter of my people I am devastated; I am in darkness; astonishment has taken hold on me.
JER.8.22	Is there no balm in Gilead; is there no physician there? Why then was there no medicine for the daughter of my people?
JER.9.1	Oh that my head were waters and my eyes a fountain of tears that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!
JER.9.2	Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men that I might leave my people and go from them! for they are all adulterers, a congregation of rebels.
JER.9.3	And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies, but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth for they proceed from evil to evil, and they did not recognize me, said the 
JER.9.4	Take heed each one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour will walk with slanders.
JER.9.5	And they will deceive each one his neighbour and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies and weary themselves to commit iniquity.
JER.9.6	Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the 
JER.9.7	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.9.8	Their tongue is as a sharp arrow; it speaks deceit: one speaks peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth but in heart he lays in wait.
JER.9.9	Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the 
JER.9.10	Upon the mountains I will lift up weeping and wailing and lamentation upon the habitations of the wilderness because they are burned up, so that no one can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and even the beasts of the earth are fled; they are gone.
JER.9.11	And I will make Jerusalem heaps and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.
JER.9.12	Who is the wise man that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the 
JER.9.13	And the 
JER.9.14	but have walked after the imagination of their own heart and after the Baalim, which their fathers taught them,
JER.9.15	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.9.16	I will scatter them also among Gentiles whom neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send a sword after them until I have consumed them.
JER.9.17	Thus hath the 
JER.9.18	and let them make haste and take up a wailing for us that our eyes may run down with tears and our eyelids gush out with waters.
JER.9.19	For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we destroyed! We are greatly confounded. Why have we forsaken the land? Why have our dwellings cast us out?
JER.9.20	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.9.21	For death is come up into our windows and is entered into our palaces to cut off the children from without and the young men from the streets.
JER.9.22	Speak, Thus hath the 
JER.9.23	Thus hath the 
JER.9.24	but let him that glories glory in this, that he understands me and knows me, that I am the 
JER.9.25	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.9.26	Egypt and Judah and Edom and the sons of Ammon and Moab and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all the Gentiles are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.
JER.10.1	Hear ye the word which the 
JER.10.2	Thus hath the 
JER.10.3	For the customs of the peoples are vanity: for one cuts a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.
JER.10.4	They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with hammer and nails, that it not move.
JER.10.5	They compare them to the palm tree, and they do not speak: they must be carried, because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither do they have power to do good.
JER.10.6	Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O 
JER.10.7	Who would not fear thee, O King of the Gentiles? for unto thee does it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the Gentiles and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.
JER.10.8	But they shall become altogether carnal and foolish. The stock is a doctrine of vanities.
JER.10.9	Silver spread into plates shall be brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, shall the workman work and the hands of the founder: they shall dress them in blue and purple: they are all the work of cunning men.
JER.10.10	But the 
JER.10.11	Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens or the earth, even they shall perish from the earth and from under these heavens.
JER.10.12	He that makes the earth by his power, he that orders the world with his wisdom and extends the heavens with his intelligence:
JER.10.13	at his voice, there is given a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causes the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes the lightnings with the rain and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.
JER.10.14	Every man is carnal in his knowledge: let every founder be ashamed of his graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no spirit in them.
JER.10.15	They are vanity and the work of scorn: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
JER.10.16	The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the Former of all things, and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The 
JER.10.17	Gather up thy wares out of the lands, O inhabitant of the fortress.
JER.10.18	For thus hath the 
JER.10.19	Woe is me for my hurt! my wound is grievous, but I said, Truly this is my sickness, and I must bear it.
JER.10.20	My tent is destroyed, and all my cords are broken: my sons were taken from me, and they are lost; there is no one to stretch forth my tent any more and to set up my curtains.
JER.10.21	For the pastors are become carnal and have not sought the 
JER.10.22	Behold, the voice of the rumour is come, and a great commotion out of the land of the north wind to make the cities of Judah desolate and a den of dragons.
JER.10.23	O 
JER.10.24	O 
JER.10.25	Pour out thy fury upon the Gentiles that do not know thee and upon the nations that do not call on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob and devoured him and consumed him and have destroyed his habitation.
JER.11.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.11.2	Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak unto every man of Judah and to every inhabitant of Jerusalem;
JER.11.3	and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the 
JER.11.4	which I commanded your fathers the day that I brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying unto them, hear my voice and comply with my words according to all which I command you; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God
JER.11.5	that I may confirm the oath which I have sworn unto your fathers, that I would give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then I answered, and said, Amen, O 
JER.11.6	And the 
JER.11.7	For I earnestly protested unto your fathers in the day that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, even unto this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Hear my voice.
JER.11.8	Yet they did not hear, nor did they incline their ear, but walked each one in the imagination of their evil heart; therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not.
JER.11.9	And the 
JER.11.10	They have returned to the iniquities of their first fathers, who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers.
JER.11.11	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.11.12	Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they offer incense, who shall not be able to save them in the time of their trouble.
JER.11.13	For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of thy streets, O Jerusalem, have ye set up altars of confusion, even altars to burn incense unto Baal.
JER.11.14	Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them for I will not hear them in the time that they cry unto me in their trouble.
JER.11.15	What part has my beloved in my house, seeing she has wrought lewdness with many? The holy flesh shall pass from upon thee, for in thy evil thou didst glory.
JER.11.16	The 
JER.11.17	For the 
JER.11.18	And the 
JER.11.19	But I was like a ram or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; for I did not understand that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name may no longer be remembered.
JER.11.20	But, O 
JER.11.21	Therefore, thus hath the 
JER.11.22	therefore, thus hath the 
JER.11.23	and there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation.
JER.12.1	Righteous art thou, O 
JER.12.2	Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they grow, and they bring forth fruit; thou art near in their mouth and far from their kidneys.
JER.12.3	But thou, O 
JER.12.4	How long shall the land be desolate, and the grass of all the field wither, for the wickedness of those that dwell therein? The cattle are lacking, and the birds, because they said, He shall not see our latter end.
JER.12.5	If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, in which thou didst trust, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan?
JER.12.6	For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee, even they have raised their voice after thee, O congregation; do not believe them, when they speak fair words unto thee.
JER.12.7	I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.
JER.12.8	My heritage was unto me as a lion in the forest; it cried out against me, therefore I have hated it.
JER.12.9	My heritage is unto me as a speckled bird; the birds round about are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour her.
JER.12.10	Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard; they have trodden my heritage under foot; they have made my precious heritage a desolate wilderness.
JER.12.11	They have made it desolate; it cries against me, desolate; the whole land was made desolate because there was no man that would see.
JER.12.12	The spoilers are come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the 
JER.12.13	They have sown bread, but shall reap thorns; they had the heritage, but they did not profit; and they shall be ashamed because of your fruits, by the fierce anger of the 
JER.12.14	Thus hath the 
JER.12.15	And it shall come to pass that after I have plucked them out, I will return and have mercy on them, and will cause them to return, each one to his heritage, and each one to his land.
JER.12.16	And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear in my name, saying, The 
JER.12.17	But if they will not hear, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the 
JER.13.1	Thus hath the 
JER.13.2	And I bought the girdle according to the word of the 
JER.13.3	And the word of the 
JER.13.4	Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise; go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a hole of the rock.
JER.13.5	So I went and hid it in the Euphrates, as the 
JER.13.6	And it came to pass after many days that the 
JER.13.7	Then I went to the Euphrates and dug and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it; and, behold, the girdle was rotted, it was good for nothing.
JER.13.8	Then the word of the 
JER.13.9	Thus hath the 
JER.13.10	This evil people that refuses to hear my words, which walk in the imagination of their heart and went after other gods to serve them and to worship them shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing.
JER.13.11	For as the girdle cleaves to the loins of a man, so I have caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the 
JER.13.12	Therefore thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus hath the 
JER.13.13	Then shalt thou say unto them, Thus hath the 
JER.13.14	And I will break them one against another, even the fathers with the sons together, saith the 
JER.13.15	Hear ye and give ear; do not be proud: for the 
JER.13.16	Give glory to the 
JER.13.17	But if ye will not hear this, my soul shall weep in secret because of your pride; and weeping bitterly, my eyes shall be undone in tears because the 
JER.13.18	Say unto the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down in the dust because the crown of your glory has come down off your heads.
JER.13.19	The cities of the south were shut up, and no one could open them: Judah was carried away captive; all of it, it was completely carried away captive.
JER.13.20	Lift up your eyes, and behold those that come from the north wind: where is the flock that was given thee, the cattle of thy beauty?
JER.13.21	What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee? For thou hast taught them to be princes and as head over thee; shall not sorrows take thee as a woman in travail?
JER.13.22	When thou shalt say in thine heart, Why do these things come upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts discovered and thy heels made bare.
JER.13.23	Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Likewise ye also cannot do good, being taught to do evil.
JER.13.24	Therefore I will scatter them as the stubble that passes away by the wind of the wilderness.
JER.13.25	This shall be thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me said the 
JER.13.26	Therefore I uncovered thy skirts before thy face, and thy shame was manifested.
JER.13.27	I have seen thine adulteries and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy whoredom upon the hills; in the same field I saw thine abominations. Woe unto thee, O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean at last? How long then shall it be?
JER.14.1	The word of the 
JER.14.2	Judah mourns, and its gates languish; they are black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up.
JER.14.3	And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded and covered their heads.
JER.14.4	Because the ground is chapped, for there was no rain in the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads.
JER.14.5	Even the hind calved in the field and forsook it, because there was no grass.
JER.14.6	And the wild asses stood in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes failed because there was no grass.
JER.14.7	O 
JER.14.8	O the hope of Israel, the Keeper thereof in time of trouble, why should thou be as a stranger in the land and as a wayfaring man that turns aside to tarry for a night?
JER.14.9	Why should thou be as a speechless man as a mighty man that cannot save? Yet thou, O 
JER.14.10	Thus hath the 
JER.14.11	Then the 
JER.14.12	When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt offering and an oblation, I will not accept them; but I will consume them by sword and by famine and by pestilence.
JER.14.13	Then I said, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, the prophets say unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have famine; but I will give you true peace in this place.
JER.14.14	Then the 
JER.14.15	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.14.16	And the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword; and they shall have no one to bury them, their wives, nor their sons, nor their daughters; for I will pour their wickedness upon them.
JER.14.17	Therefore thou shalt say this word unto them: Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease, for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow.
JER.14.18	If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold those that are sick with famine! for both the prophet and the priest walked around in circles in the land, and they did not know it.
JER.14.19	Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? Hath thy soul loathed Zion? Why didst thou cause us to be smitten when no healing remains for us? We waited for peace, and there was no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble!
JER.14.20	We acknowledge, O 
JER.14.21	Do not cast us away; for thy name’s sake, do not disgrace the throne of thy glory; remember, do not break thy covenant with us.
JER.14.22	Are there any among the vanities of the Gentiles that can cause it to rain? or can the heavens give rain? art not thou he, O 
JER.15.1	Then the 
JER.15.2	And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Where shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus hath the 
JER.15.3	And I will visit over them four kinds of evil, saith the 
JER.15.4	And I will give them over to be sifted by all the kingdoms of the earth because of Manasseh, the son of Hezekiah king of Judah, for that which he did in Jerusalem.
JER.15.5	For who shall have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall bemoan thee? or who is to come to ask regarding thy peace?
JER.15.6	Thou hast forsaken me, saith the 
JER.15.7	And I fanned them with a fan unto the gates of the land; I bereaved them of children, I wasted my people; they did not turn from their ways.
JER.15.8	Their widows are multiplied unto me more than the sand of the sea: I have brought upon them a destroyer at noonday against the young; I have caused him to fall upon her suddenly, and terrors upon the city.
JER.15.9	She that has borne seven languishes; her soul is filled with sorrow; her sun is gone down while it was yet day; she has been ashamed and confounded; and the residue of them I will deliver to the sword before their enemies, saith the 
JER.15.10	Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me a man of strife and a man of contention to the whole earth! I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent to me on usury; yet every one of them curses me.
JER.15.11	The 
JER.15.12	Shall iron break the iron from the place of the north wind and the bronze?
JER.15.13	Thy riches and thy treasures I will give to the spoil without price, and that for all thy sins, even in all thy borders.
JER.15.14	And I will make thee to serve thine enemies in a land which thou dost not know; for a fire is kindled in my anger, which shall burn upon you.
JER.15.15	O 
JER.15.16	Thy words were found, and I ate them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of my heart: for thy name was called upon me, O 
JER.15.17	I did not sit in the assembly of the mockers, nor did I become puffed up by reason of thy prophecy; I sat alone because thou hast filled me with indignation.
JER.15.18	Why was my pain perpetual and my wound incurable, which refuses to be healed? Wilt thou be altogether unto me as a liar and as waters that fail?
JER.15.19	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.15.20	And I will give thee unto this people as a fenced brazen wall, and they shall fight against thee but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to keep thee and to defend thee, said the 
JER.15.21	And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will ransom thee out of the hand of the strong.
JER.16.1	And the word of the 
JER.16.2	Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons or daughters in this place.
JER.16.3	For thus hath the 
JER.16.4	They shall die of grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth; and they shall be consumed by the sword and by famine; and their carcasses shall be food for the fowls of heaven and for the beasts of the earth.
JER.16.5	For thus hath the 
JER.16.6	Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them:
JER.16.7	neither shall they break the bread of mourning for them, to comfort themselves for their death; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.
JER.16.8	In the same manner thou shalt not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink.
JER.16.9	For thus hath the 
JER.16.10	And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these things, they shall say unto thee, Why has the 
JER.16.11	Then thou shalt say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the 
JER.16.12	and ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk each one after the imagination of his evil heart, not hearkening unto me:
JER.16.13	Therefore I will cause you to be cast out of this land into a land that ye do not know, neither ye nor your fathers; and there ye shall serve other gods day and night; for I will not grant you mercy.
JER.16.14	Therefore, behold, the days come, said the 
JER.16.15	but, The 
JER.16.16	Behold, I send many fishers, saith the 
JER.16.17	For my eyes are upon all their ways, which they have not hid from me, neither does their iniquity hide from the presence of my eyes.
JER.16.18	But first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double because they have defiled my land with the carcasses of their abominations, and they have filled my inheritance with abominable things.
JER.16.19	O 
JER.16.20	Shall a man make gods unto himself? But they shall not be gods.
JER.16.21	Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know this time; I will cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The 
JER.17.1	The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron and with the point of a diamond; it is graven upon the table of their heart and upon the horns of your altars
JER.17.2	that their sons might remember their altars and their groves, by the green trees and upon the high hills.
JER.17.3	My mountain dweller! In the field are thy riches; all thy treasures I will give to the spoil, because of the sin of thy high places throughout all thy borders.
JER.17.4	And thou, even thyself, shalt discontinue from thine heritage that I gave thee; and I will cause thee to serve thine enemies in the land which thou dost not know: for ye have kindled a fire in my anger, which shall burn for ever.
JER.17.5	Thus hath the 
JER.17.6	For he shall be like the heath in the desert and shall not see when good comes, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land and not inhabited.
JER.17.7	Blessed is the man that is steadfast in the 
JER.17.8	For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, that spreads out her roots by the river and shall not see when heat comes, but her leaf shall be green and shall not be fatigued in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.
JER.17.9	The heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked; who shall know it?
JER.17.10	I the 
JER.17.11	As the partridge that steals that which she did not hatch, is he that gets riches and not with righteousness; in the midst of his days he shall leave them, and at his end shall be a fool.
JER.17.12	The throne of glory, height from the beginning, is the place of our sanctification.
JER.17.13	O hope of Israel! 
JER.17.14	Heal me, O 
JER.17.15	Behold, they say unto me, Where is the word of the 
JER.17.16	For I did not take it upon myself to be a pastor following thee; neither have I desired the woeful day; thou dost know: that which came out of my lips has come forth in thy presence.
JER.17.17	Do not be a terror unto me; thou art my hope in the day of evil.
JER.17.18	Let them be confounded that persecute me, but do not let me be confounded; let them be dismayed; but do not let me be dismayed: bring upon them the day of evil and destroy them with double destruction.
JER.17.19	Thus said the 
JER.17.20	and say unto them, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.17.21	Thus hath the 
JER.17.22	neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do any work, but sanctify the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers,
JER.17.23	who did not hear, nor inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive correction.
JER.17.24	And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto me, saith the 
JER.17.25	then shall there enter in by the gates of this city, the kings and the princes, who sit upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they, and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever.
JER.17.26	And they shall come from the cities of Judah and from the places about Jerusalem and from the land of Benjamin and from the fields and from the mountain and from the south, bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices and presents and incense, and bringing the sacrifice of praise unto the house of the 
JER.17.27	But if ye will not hearken unto me to sanctify the sabbath day, and not to bring burdens nor bring it in through the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then I will kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.
JER.18.1	The word which came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.18.2	Arise and go down to the potter’s house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words.
JER.18.3	Then I went down to the potter’s house; and, behold, he wrought a work upon a wheel.
JER.18.4	And the vessel that he made of clay was broken in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as seemed good to the potter to make it.
JER.18.5	Then the word of the 
JER.18.6	O house of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter? saith the 
JER.18.7	In an instant I shall speak against Gentiles and against kingdoms, to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy.
JER.18.8	But if these Gentiles shall turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.
JER.18.9	And in an instant I shall speak concerning the nation and concerning the kingdom, to build and to plant it;
JER.18.10	but if it should do evil in my sight, not hearing my voice, then I will repent of the good that I had determined to do unto them.
JER.18.11	Now therefore, speak to every man of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus hath the 
JER.18.12	And they said, This is useless, for we must walk after our own devices, and we must each one do the imagination of his evil heart.
JER.18.13	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.18.14	Will anyone leave the snow of the rock of the field that flows from Lebanon? or shall they forsake the singular, cold, flowing waters?
JER.18.15	Because my people have forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused themselves to stumble in their ways, in the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not trodden;
JER.18.16	to make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished and wag his head.
JER.18.17	I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their perdition.
JER.18.18	Then they said, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not consider any of his words.
JER.18.19	Consider me, O 
JER.18.20	Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have dug a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them and to turn away thy wrath from them.
JER.18.21	Therefore deliver up their sons to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle.
JER.18.22	Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have dug a pit to take me and hid snares for my feet.
JER.18.23	Yet, 
JER.19.1	Thus hath the 
JER.19.2	and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry by the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee.
JER.19.3	Therefore thou shalt say, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.19.4	Because they have forsaken me and have estranged this place; and have burned incense in it unto other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah and have filled this place with the blood of innocents;
JER.19.5	and have built high places unto Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings unto this same Baal, which I did not command, nor speak, neither did it come into my mind.
JER.19.6	Therefore, behold, the days come, said the 
JER.19.7	And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies and by the hands of those that seek their souls and I will give their carcasses to be food for the fowls of the heaven and for the beasts of the earth.
JER.19.8	And I will make this city desolate and a hissing; every one that passes thereby shall be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues.
JER.19.9	And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and each one shall eat the flesh of his friend in the siege and straitness, with which their enemies and those that seek their souls shall straiten them.
JER.19.10	Then thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee,
JER.19.11	and shalt say unto them, Thus hath the 
JER.19.12	Thus will I do unto this place, saith the 
JER.19.13	And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be as the place of Tophet, defiled, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of the heaven and have poured out drink offerings unto other gods.
JER.19.14	Then Jeremiah returned from Tophet, where the 
JER.19.15	Thus hath the 
JER.20.1	And Pashur the priest, the son of Immer, who presided as prince in the house of the 
JER.20.2	Then Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were at the gate of Benjamin on the high place, which is in the house of the 
JER.20.3	And it came to pass on the morrow that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then Jeremiah said unto him: The 
JER.20.4	For thus hath the 
JER.20.5	Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city and all its labours and all its precious things and all the treasures of the kings of Judah I will give into the hand of their enemies, who shall spoil them and take them and carry them to Babylon.
JER.20.6	And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thine house shall go into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die and shalt be buried there, thou and all those who love thee well, unto whom thou hast prophesied with lies.
JER.20.7	O 
JER.20.8	For since I spoke out, I raised my voice crying, Violence and destruction; because the word of the 
JER.20.9	And I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But he was in my heart as a burning fire and within my bones; I tried to forbear, and I could not.
JER.20.10	For I heard the murmuring of many, fear on every side, Report, and we will report it. All my friends watched to see if I would stumble. Peradventure he will deceive himself, they said, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.
JER.20.11	But the 
JER.20.12	O 
JER.20.13	Sing unto the 
JER.20.14	Cursed be the day in which I was born; do not let the day in which my mother bore me be blessed.
JER.20.15	Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee; making him very glad.
JER.20.16	And let that man be as the cities which the 
JER.20.17	because he did not slay me in the womb, and my mother would have been my grave, and her womb perpetual conception.
JER.20.18	Why did I come forth out of the womb? To see labour and sorrow that my days should be consumed with shame?
JER.21.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.21.2	Enquire, I pray thee, of the 
JER.21.3	And said Jeremiah unto them: Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah
JER.21.4	Thus hath the 
JER.21.5	And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger and in fury and in great wrath.
JER.21.6	And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.
JER.21.7	And afterward, thus hath the 
JER.21.8	And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus hath the 
JER.21.9	He that abides in this city shall die by the sword or by the famine or by the pestilence, but he that goes out and falls to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his soul shall be unto him for a spoil.
JER.21.10	For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the 
JER.21.11	And to the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the 
JER.21.12	O house of David, thus hath the 
JER.21.13	Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley of the rock of the plain (saith the 
JER.21.14	I will visit you according to the fruit of your doings, said the 
JER.22.1	Thus hath the 
JER.22.2	and say, Hear the word of the 
JER.22.3	Thus hath the 
JER.22.4	For if ye effectively obey this word, then shall there enter in by the gates of this house the kings seated by David upon his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, he and his slaves and his people.
JER.22.5	But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, said the 
JER.22.6	For thus hath the 
JER.22.7	And I will appoint destroyers against thee, each one with his weapons, and they shall cut down thy choice cedars and cast them into the fire.
JER.22.8	And many Gentiles shall pass by this city, and each man shall say to his neighbour, Why has the 
JER.22.9	Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the 
JER.22.10	Do not weep for the dead nor bemoan him, but weep sore for him that goes away, for he shall return no more nor see his native country.
JER.22.11	For thus hath the 
JER.22.12	but he shall die in the place where they have led him captive and shall see this land no more.
JER.22.13	Woe unto him that builds his house and not in righteousness and his chambers and not in judgment, using his neighbour’s service without wages and not giving him the wages of his work!
JER.22.14	That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cuts out windows in it and covers it with cedar and anoints it with vermilion.
JER.22.15	Shalt thou reign, because thou dost enclose thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and righteousness, and then it was well with him?
JER.22.16	He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him. Is this not to know me? said the 
JER.22.17	But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetousness and for to shed innocent blood and for oppression and for violence, to do it.
JER.22.18	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.22.19	He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.
JER.22.20	Go up to Lebanon and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan and cry unto all parts: for all thy lovers are destroyed.
JER.22.21	I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity, but thou didst say, I will not hear. This has been thy way from thy youth, that thou hast never heard my voice.
JER.22.22	The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confound thyself because of all thy malice.
JER.22.23	Thou didst inhabit Lebanon, thou didst make thy nest in the cedars. How shalt thou cry out when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail!
JER.22.24	As I live, saith the 
JER.22.25	and I will give thee into the hand of those that seek thy soul and into the hand of those whose face thou dost fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and into the hand of the Chaldeans.
JER.22.26	And I will cast thee out and thy mother that bore thee into another country, where ye were not born, and there ye shall die.
JER.22.27	But to the land unto which they de sire to return, they shall not return there.
JER.22.28	Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? Is he a vessel in which there is no pleasure? Why are they cast out, he and his generation, and are cast into a land which they know not?
JER.22.29	O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the 
JER.22.30	Thus hath the 
JER.23.1	Woe be unto the pastors that waste and scatter the sheep of my pasture! said the 
JER.23.2	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.23.3	And I will gather the remnant of my sheep out of all the lands where I have driven them and will cause them to return to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase.
JER.23.4	And I will set up shepherds over them which shall feed them; and they shall fear no more nor be dismayed neither shall they be lacking, said the 
JER.23.5	Behold, the days come, saith the 
JER.23.6	In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this shall be his name by which they shall call him, THE 
JER.23.7	Therefore, behold, the days come, said the 
JER.23.8	but, The 
JER.23.9	My heart is broken within me because of the prophets, all my bones shake; I was like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine has overcome, before the 
JER.23.10	For the land is full of adulterers; for because of the oath the land is deserted; the booths of the wilderness are dried up, and their course was evil, and their force was not right.
JER.23.11	For both prophet and priest are feigned; even in my house I have found their wickedness, said the 
JER.23.12	Therefore their way shall be unto them as slippery ways in the darkness; they shall be driven on and fall therein; for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the 
JER.23.13	And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal and caused my people Israel to err.
JER.23.14	I have also seen a horrible thing in the prophets of Jerusalem: they committed adultery and walked by lies; they strengthened also the hands of evildoers, that no none is converted from his malice; they are all of them unto me as Sodom and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.
JER.23.15	Therefore, thus hath the 
JER.23.16	Thus hath the 
JER.23.17	They say boldly unto those that stir me to anger, The 
JER.23.18	For who has stood in the secret of the 
JER.23.19	Behold, that the whirlwind of the 
JER.23.20	The anger of the 
JER.23.21	I did not send those prophets, yet they ran; I did not speak to them, yet they prophesied.
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in my secret, they would also have caused my people to hear my words, and they would have caused them to return from their evil way and from the evil of their doings.
JER.23.23	Am I a God of the near only, said the 
JER.23.24	Can any hide himself in hiding places that I shall not see him? said the 
JER.23.25	I have heard what those prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.
JER.23.26	How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies and that prophesy the deceit of their own heart?
JER.23.27	Do they not think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which each one tells his neighbour, so much that their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal?
JER.23.28	The prophet with whom the dream came, let him tell the dream; and he with whom my word came, let him speak my true word. What is the chaff to the wheat? said the 
JER.23.29	Is not my word like as a fire? saith the 
JER.23.30	Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith the 
JER.23.31	Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the 
JER.23.32	Behold, I am against those that prophesy false dreams, saith the 
JER.23.33	And when this people or the prophet or the priest shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the 
JER.23.34	And as for the prophet and the priest and the people, that shall say, The burden of the 
JER.23.35	Thus shall ye say each one to his neighbour and each one to his brother, What has the 
JER.23.36	And never again shall it come to your memory to say, The burden of the 
JER.23.37	Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What has the 
JER.23.38	But if ye say, The burden of the 
JER.23.39	therefore, behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will uproot you from my presence and the city that I gave you and your fathers:
JER.23.40	and I will place an everlasting reproach upon you, and eternal shame, which shall never be forgotten.
JER.24.1	The 
JER.24.2	One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very evil figs, which could not be eaten, they were so evil.
JER.24.3	Then the 
JER.24.4	Again the word of the 
JER.24.5	Thus hath the 
JER.24.6	For I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will return them to this land, and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up.
JER.24.7	And I will give them a heart that they might know me, that I am the 
JER.24.8	And as the evil figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil, surely thus saith the 
JER.24.9	And I give them to be removed, for evil unto all the kingdoms of the earth, for infamy, and for reproach and for a proverb, and for a curse unto all the places where I shall drive them.
JER.24.10	And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence upon them until they be consumed from off the land that I gave unto them and to their fathers.
JER.25.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, which is the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon;
JER.25.2	this spoke Jeremiah the prophet unto all the people of Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,
JER.25.3	From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even unto this day, which are twenty-three years, the word of the 
JER.25.4	And the 
JER.25.5	when they said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the 
JER.25.6	and do not go after other gods to serve them and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt.
JER.25.7	Yet ye have not hearkened unto me, saith the 
JER.25.8	Therefore thus saith the 
JER.25.9	behold, I will send and take all the families of the north wind, saith the 
JER.25.10	And I will cause them to lose the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the lamp.
JER.25.11	And this whole land shall be a desolation and an astonishment; and these Gentiles shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years.
JER.25.12	And it shall come to pass when seventy years are accomplished, that I will visit upon the king of Babylon and upon that people their own evil, said the 
JER.25.13	And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have spoken against it, with all that is written in this book, prophesied by Jeremiah against all the Gentiles.
JER.25.14	For many Gentiles and great kings shall serve themselves of them also; and I will recompense them according to their deeds and according to the works of their own hands.
JER.25.15	For thus hath the 
JER.25.16	And they shall drink and be moved and become mad, before the sword that I will send among them.
JER.25.17	Then took I the cup from the 
JER.25.18	unto Jerusalem and to the cities of Judah and to its kings and to its princes, that I might place them into desolation, into astonishment, and into hissing, and into a curse, as this day,
JER.25.19	unto Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his slaves and to his princes and to all his people,
JER.25.20	and to all the mingled people and to all the kings of the land of Uz and to all the kings of the land of the Philistines and to Ashkelon and to Gaza and to Ekron and to the remnant of Ashdod,
JER.25.21	to Edom and to Moab and to the sons of Ammon,
JER.25.22	and to all the kings of Tyre and to all the kings of Zidon and to all the kings of the isles which are of that side of the sea,
JER.25.23	and to Dedan, and to Tema and to Buz and to all that are in the utmost corners,
JER.25.24	and to all the kings of Arabia and to all the kings of the mingled peoples, the Arabia that dwells in the desert,
JER.25.25	and to all the kings of Zimri and to all the kings of Elam and to all the kings of the Medes,
JER.25.26	and to all the kings of the north wind, those of far and those of near, one with another and to all the kingdoms of the earth, which are upon the face of the earth and the king of Sheshach {Babylon} shall drink after them.
JER.25.27	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the 
JER.25.28	And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup from thine hand to drink, then thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the 
JER.25.29	For, Behold, I begin to bring evil upon the city which is called by my name, and should ye only be absolved? Ye shall not be absolved, for I bring the sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, said the 
JER.25.30	Therefore, thou shalt prophesy against them all these words, and say unto them, The 
JER.25.31	The noise came even to the ends of the earth; for it is judgment of the 
JER.25.32	Thus saith the 
JER.25.33	And the slain of the 
JER.25.34	Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the dust, ye principals of the flock; for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like an enticing vessel.
JER.25.35	And the shepherds shall have no way to flee, nor for the principals of the flock to escape.
JER.25.36	The voice of the cry of the shepherds and a howling of the principals of the flock shall be heard! For the 
JER.25.37	And the quiet pastures shall be cut off by the fierce anger of the 
JER.25.38	He has forsaken his habitation, as the young lion; for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor and because of his fierce anger.
JER.26.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the 
JER.26.2	Thus hath the 
JER.26.3	peradventure they will hearken and turn each man from his evil way, that I may repent of the evil, which I purpose to do unto them because of the evil of their doings.
JER.26.4	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the 
JER.26.5	to hearken to the words of my slaves the prophets, whom I send unto you, rising up early and sending them, unto whom ye have not hearkened,
JER.26.6	then I will make this house like Shiloh and will give this city as a curse to all the Gentiles of the earth.
JER.26.7	And the priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the 
JER.26.8	Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the 
JER.26.9	Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.10	When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king’s house unto the house of the 
JER.26.11	Then the priests and the prophets spoke unto the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he has prophesied against this city as ye have heard with your ears.
JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah spoke unto all the princes and to all the people, saying, The 
JER.26.13	Therefore now amend your ways and your doings and hear the voice of the 
JER.26.14	As for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me as seems good and meet unto you.
JER.26.15	But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye shall surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves and upon this city and upon its inhabitants; for of a truth the 
JER.26.16	Then the princes and all the people said unto the priests and to the prophets: This man is not worthy to die, for he has spoken to us in the name of the 
JER.26.17	Then certain of the elders of the land rose up and spoke to all the congregation of the people, saying,
JER.26.18	Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus hath the 
JER.26.19	Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? Did he not fear the 
JER.26.20	There was also a man that prophesied in the name of the 
JER.26.21	And Jehoiakim the king heard his words and all his mighty men and all the princes, and the king sought to put him to death, but when Urijah understood it, he was afraid and fled and went into Egypt.
JER.26.22	And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor and certain men with him into Egypt;
JER.26.23	and they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt and brought him unto Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people.
JER.26.24	Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death.
JER.27.1	In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.27.2	Thus hath the 
JER.27.3	and thou shalt send them to the king of Edom and to the king of Moab and to the king of the Ammonites and to the king of Tyre and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the ambassadors which come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah;
JER.27.4	and thou shalt command them to say unto their masters, Thus hath the 
JER.27.5	I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the face of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom was upright in my eyes.
JER.27.6	And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my slave; and even the beasts of the field I have given him that they might serve him.
JER.27.7	And all the Gentiles shall serve him and his son and his son’s son, until the time of his own land shall come also; and many nations and great kings shall serve him.
JER.27.8	And it shall come to pass, that the people and the kingdom which will not serve Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that people I will visit, saith the 
JER.27.9	Therefore do not hearken unto your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreams, nor to your sorcerers, nor to your enchanters, which speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon:
JER.27.10	For they prophesy a lie unto you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish.
JER.27.11	But the people that submit their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, said the 
JER.27.12	I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Submit your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people and live.
JER.27.13	Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the 
JER.27.14	Therefore do not hearken unto the words of the prophets that speak unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie unto you.
JER.27.15	For I have not sent them, saith the 
JER.27.16	Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus hath the 
JER.27.17	Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon and live: why should this city be laid waste?
JER.27.18	But if they are prophets, and if the word of the 
JER.27.19	For thus hath the 
JER.27.20	which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem;
JER.27.21	yea, thus hath the 
JER.27.22	they shall be carried to Babylon, and there they shall be until the day that I visit them, said the 
JER.28.1	And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, which was of Gibeon, spoke unto me in the house of the 
JER.28.2	Thus hath the 
JER.28.3	Within two full years I will bring again into this place all the vessels of the 
JER.28.4	and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the 
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the 
JER.28.6	therefore the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the 
JER.28.7	Nevertheless hear thou now this word that I speak in thine ears and in the ears of all the people,
JER.28.8	The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.
JER.28.9	The prophet which prophesied of peace, when the word of the prophet should come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the 
JER.28.10	Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah’s neck and broke it.
JER.28.11	And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus hath the 
JER.28.12	And after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, the word of the 
JER.28.13	Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus hath the 
JER.28.14	For thus hath the 
JER.28.15	Then said the prophet Jeremiah unto Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The 
JER.28.16	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.28.17	So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month.
JER.29.1	Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem unto the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests and to the prophets and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;
JER.29.2	(after Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, were departed from Jerusalem;)
JER.29.3	by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent unto Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,
JER.29.4	Thus hath the 
JER.29.5	Build houses and dwell in them; and plant gardens and eat the fruit of them;
JER.29.6	take wives and beget sons and daughters; give wives unto your sons and give husbands unto your daughters, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be multiplied there and not diminished.
JER.29.7	And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray unto the 
JER.29.8	For thus hath the 
JER.29.9	For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not sent them, said the 
JER.29.10	For thus hath the 
JER.29.11	For I know the thoughts that I think concerning you, said the 
JER.29.12	Then ye shall call upon me, and ye shall walk in my ways and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you.
JER.29.13	And ye shall seek me, and find me, for ye shall seek me with all your heart.
JER.29.14	And I will be found of you, said the 
JER.29.15	But ye have said, The 
JER.29.16	know that thus hath the 
JER.29.17	thus hath the 
JER.29.18	And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will give them over as a reproach to all the kingdoms of the earth, as a curse, and as an astonishment, and a hissing, and an affront, unto all the Gentiles where I have driven them:
JER.29.19	because they did not hearken unto my words, said the 
JER.29.20	Hear ye therefore the word of the 
JER.29.21	Thus hath the 
JER.29.22	and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, The 
JER.29.23	because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbours’ wives, and have spoken a word falsely in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know and am a witness, saith the 
JER.29.24	Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,
JER.29.25	Thus hath the 
JER.29.26	The 
JER.29.27	Now therefore why hast thou not reprehended Jeremiah of Anathoth, for prophesying falsely unto you?
JER.29.28	For therefore he sent unto us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build houses and dwell in them and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.
JER.29.29	And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet.
JER.29.30	Then the word of the 
JER.29.31	Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus hath the 
JER.29.32	therefore thus hath the 
JER.30.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.30.2	Thus hath the 
JER.30.3	For, Behold, the days come, said the 
JER.30.4	And these are the words that the 
JER.30.5	For thus hath the 
JER.30.6	Ask now, and see whether the man doth travail with child? for I have seen that every man has his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail; and all faces have turned pale.
JER.30.7	Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob’s trouble; but he shall be saved out of it.
JER.30.8	For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
JER.30.9	but they shall serve the 
JER.30.10	Therefore fear thou not, O my slave Jacob, saith the 
JER.30.11	For I shall be with thee, saith the 
JER.30.12	For thus hath the 
JER.30.13	There is no one to judge thy cause unto health; there is no cure, nor are there any medicines for thee.
JER.30.14	All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they do not seek thee; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the whip of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased.
JER.30.15	Why dost thou cry out for thine affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the greatness of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased, I have done these things unto thee.
JER.30.16	Therefore all those that devour thee shall be devoured; and all those that afflict thee, every one of them, shall go into captivity; and those that trampled upon thee shall be trodden down, and all that prey upon thee I will give for a prey.
JER.30.17	For I will cause healing to come for thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, said the 
JER.30.18	Thus hath the 
JER.30.19	And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of people that live in joy: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be decreased; I will multiply them, and they shall not be cut down.
JER.30.20	Their sons shall also be as at first, and their congregation shall be confirmed before me, and I will visit all their oppressors.
JER.30.21	And of him shall be their Rock, and from the midst of him shall their Governor come forth; and I will cause him to come near, and he shall draw near unto me: for who is this that softened his heart to approach unto me? said the 
JER.30.22	And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
JER.30.23	Behold, the whirlwind of the 
JER.30.24	The fierce anger of the 
JER.31.1	In that time, said the 
JER.31.2	Thus hath the 
JER.31.3	The 
JER.31.4	Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt again be adorned with thy tambourines and shalt go forth in the chorus of dancers.
JER.31.5	Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant and shall eat them as common things.
JER.31.6	For there shall be a day in which the watchmen upon the Mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise, and let us go up into Zion unto the 
JER.31.7	For thus hath the 
JER.31.8	Behold, I turn them from the land of the north wind and gather them from the coasts of the earth; there shall be blind and lame among them, and women with child and those that travail with child together; a great company shall return there.
JER.31.9	They shall come with weeping, but with mercies I will cause them to return; I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, in which they shall not stumble; for I shall be a father to Israel, and Ephraim shall be my firstborn.
JER.31.10	Hear the word of the 
JER.31.11	For the 
JER.31.12	Therefore they shall come and do praises in the height of Zion and shall run unto the goodness of the 
JER.31.13	Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together; for I will turn their mourning into joy and will comfort them and make them rejoice from their sorrow.
JER.31.14	And I will satiate the soul of the priest with fatness, and my people shall be filled with my goodness, said the 
JER.31.15	Thus hath the 
JER.31.16	Thus hath the 
JER.31.17	There is also hope for thine end, saith the 
JER.31.18	I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus, Thou hast afflicted me, and I was chastised as an indomitable bullock: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the 
JER.31.19	Surely after I was turned, I repented; and after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh; I was ashamed, and even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth.
JER.31.20	Peradventure is Ephraim a precious son unto me? Peradventure is he unto me a delightful child? With all this since I spoke of him, I have remembered him constantly. Therefore my bowels are troubled for him; in tenderness I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the 
JER.31.21	Establish signs, make thee high markers; consider the highway with great care, even the way which thou didst come; return, O virgin of Israel, return unto these thy cities.
JER.31.22	How long wilt thou wander, O thou backsliding daughter? for the 
JER.31.23	Thus hath the 
JER.31.24	And Judah shall dwell in her, and also in all her cities, husbandmen, and those that go forth with flocks.
JER.31.25	For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have filled every sorrowful soul.
JER.31.26	Upon this I awoke, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet unto me.
JER.31.27	Behold, the days come, said the 
JER.31.28	And it shall come to pass, that like as I have watched over them, to pluck up and to break down and to throw down and to destroy and to afflict, so will I watch over them, to build and to plant, said the 
JER.31.29	In those days they shall no longer say, The fathers have eaten the sour grapes, and the children’s teeth are set on edge.
JER.31.30	But each one shall die for his own iniquity; every man that eats the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
JER.31.31	Behold, the days come, said the 
JER.31.32	not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt because they invalidated my covenant although I was a husband unto them, said the 
JER.31.33	But this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, said the 
JER.31.34	And they shall no longer teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother, saying, Know the 
JER.31.35	Thus hath the 
JER.31.36	If these laws depart from before me, said the 
JER.31.37	Thus hath the 
JER.31.38	Behold, the days come, said the 
JER.31.39	And the measuring line shall extend before him upon the hill Gareb and shall compass about to Goath.
JER.31.40	And the whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes with the burnt fat, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, unto the corner of the horse gate toward the east shall be holy unto the 
JER.32.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.32.2	for then the king of Babylon’s army besieged Jerusalem; and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard, which was in the king of Judah’s house.
JER.32.3	For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus hath the 
JER.32.4	And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;
JER.32.5	and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, said the 
JER.32.6	And Jeremiah said, The word of the 
JER.32.7	Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thine uncle comes unto thee, saying, Buy my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is thine to buy it.
JER.32.8	So Hanameel my uncle’s son came to me in the court of the guard according to the word of the 
JER.32.9	And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle’s son, that was in Anathoth and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver.
JER.32.10	And I subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witnesses and weighed him the money in the balances.
JER.32.11	So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open.
JER.32.12	And I gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel my uncle’s son and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase before all the Jews that were in the court of the guard.
JER.32.13	And I charged Baruch before them, saying,
JER.32.14	Thus hath the 
JER.32.15	For thus hath the 
JER.32.16	Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed unto the 
JER.32.17	Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and stretched out arm, and there is nothing hidden from thee;
JER.32.18	that thou dost show mercy in thousands and recompense the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their sons after them, the Great, the Mighty God, the 
JER.32.19	great in counsel and magnificent in works: for thine eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men to give unto each one according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings;
JER.32.20	who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even unto this day, and in Israel, and in the man, and hast made thee a name, as at this day;
JER.32.21	and hast brought forth thy people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm and with great terror;
JER.32.22	and hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey;
JER.32.23	and they came in and possessed it; but they did not hear thy voice, neither did they walk in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou didst command them to do, therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them.
JER.32.24	Behold the siege engines are come unto the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans that fight against it because of the sword and of the famine and of the pestilence, and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and, behold, thou dost see it.
JER.32.25	And thou hast said unto me, O Lord GOD, Buy the field for money and take witnesses; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.
JER.32.26	Then came the word of the 
JER.32.27	Behold, I am the 
JER.32.28	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.32.29	and the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal, and poured out drink offerings unto other gods, to provoke me to anger.
JER.32.30	For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done only evil before me from their youth: for the sons of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, said the 
JER.32.31	For this city has been unto me as a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto this day; that I should remove it from before my face
JER.32.32	because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and of the sons of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
JER.32.33	And they have turned unto me the back and not the face: when I taught them, rising up early and teaching them, yet they did not hearken to receive chastisement;
JER.32.34	but they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it.
JER.32.35	And they built altars unto Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I did not command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
JER.32.36	And now therefore thus saith the 
JER.32.37	behold, I will gather them out of all countries where I have driven them in my anger, in my fury and in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place, and I will cause them to dwell safely:
JER.32.38	and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
JER.32.39	and I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever for the good of them and of their sons after them:
JER.32.40	and I will make an eternal covenant with them, that I will not turn away from doing them good, and I will put my fear in their hearts that they shall not depart from me.
JER.32.41	And, I will rejoice with them doing them good, and I will plant them in this land with truth, with my whole heart and with my whole soul.
JER.32.42	For thus hath the 
JER.32.43	And they shall possess inheritance in this land, of which ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
JER.32.44	Men shall buy fields for money and subscribe evidences and seal them and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin and in the places about Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah and in the cities of the mountains and in the cities of the valley and in the cities of the south; for I will cause their captivity to turn, saith the 
JER.33.1	Moreover the word of the 
JER.33.2	Thus hath said the 
JER.33.3	Call unto me, and I will answer thee and show thee great and difficult things, which thou dost not know.
JER.33.4	For thus hath the 
JER.33.5	(because they came to fight with the Chaldeans, to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury and because I hid my face from this city due to all her wickedness):
JER.33.6	behold, I will bring her healing and medicine, and I will cure them and will reveal unto them the abundance of peace and truth.
JER.33.7	And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to turn and will build them, as at the first.
JER.33.8	And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, with which they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their sins, with which they have sinned against me and with which they rebelled against me.
JER.33.9	And it shall be unto me a name of joy, of praise and of glory among all the Gentiles of the earth, who shall have heard all the good that I do unto them and they shall fear and tremble for all the good and for all the peace that I shall do unto them.
JER.33.10	Thus hath the 
JER.33.11	the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of those that shall say, Praise the 
JER.33.12	Thus hath the 
JER.33.13	In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counts them, said the 
JER.33.14	Behold, the days come, said the 
JER.33.15	In those days and at that time, I will cause the Branch of righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land.
JER.33.16	In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name with which she shall be called, The 
JER.33.17	For thus hath the 
JER.33.18	neither shall the priests the Levites lack a man before me to offer burnt offerings and to kindle grain offerings and to do sacrifice continually.
JER.33.19	And the word of the 
JER.33.20	Thus hath the 
JER.33.21	then may also my covenant be broken with David my slave, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites and priests, my ministers.
JER.33.22	As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the seed of David my slave and the Levites that minister unto me.
JER.33.23	Moreover the word of the 
JER.33.24	Dost thou not consider what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the 
JER.33.25	Thus hath the 
JER.33.26	then I will cast away the seed of Jacob and David my slave, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to turn, and I will have mercy on them.
JER.34.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.2	Thus hath the 
JER.34.3	and thou shalt not escape out of his hand but shalt surely be taken and delivered into his hand; and thine eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.
JER.34.4	Yet hear the word of the 
JER.34.5	but thou shalt die in peace: and according to the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings which were before thee, so shall they burn odours for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, said the 
JER.34.6	Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words unto Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
JER.34.7	when the king of Babylon’s army fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah, for of the strong cities of Judah these had remained.
JER.34.8	This is the word that came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.34.9	that every man should let his manslave, and every man his maidslave, being a Hebrew or a Hebrewess, go free; that no one should use of his brethren, the Jews, as a slave.
JER.34.10	Now when all the princes and all the people, who had entered into the covenant, heard that each one should let his manslave and each one his maidslave go free, that no one should use them any more as servants, then they listened and let them go.
JER.34.11	But afterward they repented and caused the slaves and the handmaids, whom they had let go free, to return and brought them into subjection for slaves and for handmaids.
JER.34.12	Therefore the word of the 
JER.34.13	Thus saith the 
JER.34.14	At the end of seven years each one shall let his Hebrew brother go, who has been sold unto thee; therefore he shall serve thee six years, and thou shalt send him forth free from thee: but your fathers did not hearken unto me, nor incline their ear.
JER.34.15	And ye were now converted and had done right in my sight in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name:
JER.34.16	but ye turned and polluted my name and caused each man his slave and each man his handmaid, whom ye had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return and brought them into subjection, to be unto you for slaves and for handmaids.
JER.34.17	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.34.18	And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two and passed between the parts thereof,
JER.34.19	the princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;
JER.34.20	I will even give them into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their soul; and their dead bodies shall be for food unto the fowls of the heaven and to the beasts of the earth.
JER.34.21	And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies and into the hand of those that seek their soul and into the hand of the king of Babylon’s army, which are gone up from you.
JER.34.22	Behold, I command, said the 
JER.35.1	The word which came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.35.2	Go unto the house of the Rechabites and speak with them and bring them into the house of the 
JER.35.3	Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites;
JER.35.4	and I brought them into the house of the 
JER.35.5	and I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine and cups, and I said unto them, Drink wine.
JER.35.6	But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever:
JER.35.7	neither shall ye build a house, nor sow seed, nor plant a vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye are strangers.
JER.35.8	Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab our father, the son of Rechab, in all that he has charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters;
JER.35.9	nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed:
JER.35.10	But we have dwelt in tents and have obeyed and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.
JER.35.11	But it came to pass, nevertheless, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem from before the army of the Chaldeans and from before of the army of the Syrians: and so we remain in Jerusalem.
JER.35.12	Then the word of the 
JER.35.13	Thus hath the 
JER.35.14	The word of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, was not moved; for unto this day they drink none, but obey their father’s commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye did not hearken unto me.
JER.35.15	I have sent also unto you all my slaves the prophets, rising up early and sending them, saying, Turn ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and do not go after other gods to serve them, and ye shall live in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened unto me.
JER.35.16	Certainly the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have not moved the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people has not hearkened unto me:
JER.35.17	therefore thus hath the 
JER.35.18	And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus hath the 
JER.35.19	therefore thus hath the 
JER.36.1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came unto Jeremiah from the 
JER.36.2	Take thee a roll of a book and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the Gentiles, from the day I began to speak unto thee, from the days of Josiah, unto today.
JER.36.3	If peradventure the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may turn each one from his evil way; and I will forgive their iniquity and their sin.
JER.36.4	Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the 
JER.36.5	And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the 
JER.36.6	therefore go thou, and read from the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the 
JER.36.7	if peradventure their prayer will fall into the presence of the 
JER.36.8	And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the 
JER.36.9	And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the 
JER.36.10	Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the 
JER.36.11	When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the 
JER.36.12	then he went down into the king’s house, into the scribe’s chamber; and, behold, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.
JER.36.13	Then Michaiah declared unto them all the words that he had heard when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people.
JER.36.14	Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take in thine hand the roll wherein thou hast read in the ears of the people and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand and came unto them.
JER.36.15	And they said unto him, Sit down now and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears.
JER.36.16	Now it came to pass when they had heard all the words, each one turned to his companion in fear, and they said unto Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words.
JER.36.17	And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth?
JER.36.18	Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words unto me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book.
JER.36.19	Then the princes said unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye be.
JER.36.20	And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe and told all the words in the ears of the king.
JER.36.21	So the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll: and he took it out of Elishama the scribe’s chamber. And Jehudi read in it in the ears of the king and in the ears of all the princes which stood beside the king.
JER.36.22	Now the king sat in the winterhouse in the ninth month, and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him.
JER.36.23	And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the penknife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.
JER.36.24	Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his slaves that heard all these words.
JER.36.25	Nevertheless when Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah made intercession to the king that he not burn the roll; he would not hear them.
JER.36.26	But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but the 
JER.36.27	Then the word of the 
JER.36.28	Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah has burned.
JER.36.29	And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus hath the 
JER.36.30	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.36.31	And I will visit upon him and upon his seed and upon his slaves, their iniquity; and I will bring upon them and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem and upon the men of Judah all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they did not hearken.
JER.36.32	Then Jeremiah took another roll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah, who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire, and there were added besides upon them many like words.
JER.37.1	And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah.
JER.37.2	But neither he nor his slaves nor the people of the land hearkened unto the words of the 
JER.37.3	And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto the 
JER.37.4	(Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison.
JER.37.5	And as Pharaoh’s army was come forth out of Egypt; and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem.)
JER.37.6	Then came the word of the 
JER.37.7	Thus hath the 
JER.37.8	And the Chaldeans shall come again and fight against this city and take it and burn it with fire.
JER.37.9	Thus hath the 
JER.37.10	For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you and there remained but wounded men among them, yet should they rise up each man from his tent and burn this city with fire.
JER.37.11	And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh’s army,p> 
JER.37.12	then Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin to separate himself there in the midst of the people.
JER.37.13	And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans.
JER.37.14	Then said Jeremiah It is false; I do not fall away to the Chaldeans. But he did not hearken to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.
JER.37.15	Therefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah and smote him and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe; for they had made that the prison.
JER.37.16	When Jeremiah was entered into the dungeon and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days;
JER.37.17	then Zedekiah the king sent and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house and said, Is there any word from the 
JER.37.18	Moreover Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, In what have I sinned against thee or against thy slaves or against this people that ye have put me in prison?
JER.37.19	Where are now your prophets which prophesied unto you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you nor against this land?
JER.37.20	Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there.
JER.37.21	Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the guard and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the bakers’ street until all the bread in the city was spent. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
JER.38.1	Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all the people, saying,
JER.38.2	Thus hath the 
JER.38.3	Thus hath the 
JER.38.4	Therefore the princes said unto the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakens the hands of the men of war that remain in this city and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words unto them; for this man does not seek the peace of this people, but the hurt.
JER.38.5	Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand, for the king can not do any thing against you.
JER.38.6	Then they took Jeremiah and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the guard: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire; so Jeremiah sunk in the mire.
JER.38.7	Now when Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, one of the eunuchs which was in the king’s house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king was then sitting in the gate of Benjamin,
JER.38.8	Ebedmelech went forth out of the king’s house and spoke to the king, saying,
JER.38.9	My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die for hunger in the place where he is, for there is no more bread in the city.
JER.38.10	Then the king commanded Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Take from here thirty men with thee and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon before he dies.
JER.38.11	So Ebedmelech took the men with him and went into the house of the king under the treasury and took from there old cast clouts and old rotten rags and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah.
JER.38.12	And Ebedmelech the Ethiopian said unto Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and rotten rags under thine armholes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so.
JER.38.13	So they drew up Jeremiah with cords and took him up out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.
JER.38.14	Then Zedekiah the king sent and took Jeremiah the prophet unto him into the third entry that is in the house of the 
JER.38.15	Then Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare it unto thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.
JER.38.16	So Zedekiah the king swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying, As the 
JER.38.17	Then said Jeremiah unto Zedekiah, Thus hath the 
JER.38.18	but if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, then this city shall be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand.
JER.38.19	And Zedekiah the king said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that are fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me.
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Hear now the voice of the 
JER.38.21	But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word that the 
JER.38.22	and, behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah’s house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon’s princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have deceived thee and have prevailed against thee; thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back.
JER.38.23	So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans; and thou shalt not escape out of their hand but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon; and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.
JER.38.24	Then said Zedekiah unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die.
JER.38.25	But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said unto thee:
JER.38.26	then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan’s house, to die there.
JER.38.27	Then all the princes came unto Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all those words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived.
JER.38.28	So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day that Jerusalem was taken; and he was there when Jerusalem was taken.
JER.39.1	In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
JER.39.2	And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.
JER.39.3	And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate even Nergalsharezer, Samgarnebo, Sarsechim, Rabsaris, Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon.
JER.39.4	And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them and all the men of war, then they fled and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king’s garden, by the gate between the two walls; and the king went out by the way of the desert.
JER.39.5	But the Chaldeans’ army pursued after them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and when they had taken him, they brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he sentenced him.
JER.39.6	Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes; also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah.
JER.39.7	Moreover he put out Zedekiah’s eyes and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon.
JER.39.8	And the Chaldeans burned the king’s house and the houses of the people with fire and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
JER.39.9	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that had come over to him, with the rest of the people that remained.
JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, which had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.
JER.39.11	Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard, saying,
JER.39.12	Take him, and look well to him and do him no harm; but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.
JER.39.13	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rabsaris, and Nergalsharezer, Rabmag, and all the king of Babylon’s princes;
JER.39.14	even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the guard, and committed him unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people.
JER.39.15	Now the word of the 
JER.39.16	Go and speak to Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus hath the 
JER.39.17	But I will deliver thee in that day, said the 
JER.39.18	For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey unto thee, because thou hast put thy trust in me, said the 
JER.40.1	The word that came to Jeremiah from the 
JER.40.2	And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said unto him, The 
JER.40.3	Now the 
JER.40.4	And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thine hand. If it seems good unto thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well unto thee: but if it seems ill unto thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee; where it seems good and convenient for thee to go, go there.
JER.40.5	Now while he had not yet replied that he would go back, the captain said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah and dwell with him among the people, or go wherever it seems convenient unto thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward and sent him forth.
JER.40.6	Then Jeremiah came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land.
JER.40.7	And all the princes of the army which were in the field, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor over the land and had committed unto him the men and the women and the children and the poor of the land, those that were not carried away captive to Babylon;
JER.40.8	then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men.
JER.40.9	And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans; dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you.
JER.40.10	As for me, behold, I dwell in Mizpah to serve the Chaldeans, which will come unto us; but ye, gather ye the wine and the bread and the oil and put them in your vessels and dwell in your cities that ye have taken.
JER.40.11	Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab and among the Ammonites and in Edom and that were in all the lands heard how the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
JER.40.12	all these Jews returned out of all places where they were driven and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah in Mizpah, and gathered wine and much fruit.
JER.40.13	Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah and all the princes of the armies that were in the fields came to Gedaliah to Mizpah
JER.40.14	and said unto him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites has sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam did not believe them.
JER.40.15	Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, I will go now, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it; why should he slay thee, that all the Jews which are gathered unto thee should be scattered and the remnant in Judah perish?
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing, for thou dost speak falsely of Ishmael.
JER.41.1	Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, and some princes of the king, and ten men with him, came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam in Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah.
JER.41.2	Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan with the sword and slew him whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land.
JER.41.3	Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Chaldean soldiers that were found there.
JER.41.4	And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, when no one knew of it yet
JER.41.5	that there came certain men of Shechem, of Shiloh, and of Samaria, eighty men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the 
JER.41.6	And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam.
JER.41.7	And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them and cast them into the midst of a pit, he, and the men that were with him.
JER.41.8	But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat and of barley and of oil and of honey. So he forbare, and did not slay them among their brethren.
JER.41.9	Now the pit in which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was the same which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with those that were slain.
JER.41.10	Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king’s daughters and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive and departed to go over to the Ammonites.
JER.41.11	But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the princes of the armies that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done,
JER.41.12	then they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon.
JER.41.13	Now it came to pass, that when all the people which were with Ishmael heard Johanan the son of Kareah and all the princes of the armies that were with him, then they were glad.
JER.41.14	So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned and went unto Johanan the son of Kareah.
JER.41.15	But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to the Ammonites.
JER.41.16	Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the princes of the armies that were with him, took all the remnant of the people which had turned from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam; men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom Johanan had caused to turn from Gibeon:
JER.41.17	and they departed and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, that they might go and enter into Egypt
JER.41.18	because of the Chaldeans; for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land.
JER.42.1	Then all the princes of the armies, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even unto the greatest, came near,
JER.42.2	and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the 
JER.42.3	that the 
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray unto the 
JER.42.5	Then they said to Jeremiah, The 
JER.42.6	Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will hear the voice of the 
JER.42.7	And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the 
JER.42.8	Then he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the princes of the armies which were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest,
JER.42.9	and said unto them, Thus hath the 
JER.42.10	If ye will still abide in this land, then I will build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up; for I repent of the evil that I have done unto you.
JER.42.11	Do not be afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; do not be afraid of him, said the 
JER.42.12	And I will show mercies unto you, that he may have mercy upon you and cause you to dwell in your own land.
JER.42.13	But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, not listening to the voice of the 
JER.42.14	saying, No, but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the shofar, nor have hunger of bread; and there we will dwell:
JER.42.15	and now therefore hear the word of the 
JER.42.16	then it shall come to pass that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine, of which ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die.
JER.42.17	So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.
JER.42.18	For thus hath the 
JER.42.19	The 
JER.42.20	Why did ye cause your souls to err? For ye sent me unto the 
JER.42.21	And now I have this day declared it to you, but ye have not obeyed the voice of the 
JER.42.22	Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where ye desire to go and to sojourn.
JER.43.1	And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking unto all the people all the words of the 
JER.43.2	Then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying unto Jeremiah, Thou dost speak falsely; the 
JER.43.3	but Baruch the son of Neriah sets thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they might put us to death and carry us away captives into Babylon.
JER.43.4	So Johanan the son of Kareah and all the princes of the armies and all the people, did not hear the voice of the 
JER.43.5	But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the princes of the armies, took all the remnant of Judah, that had returned from among all the Gentiles, where they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah;
JER.43.6	men and women and children and the king’s daughters, and every soul that Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah;
JER.43.7	and they left for the land of Egypt; because they did not listen to the voice of the 
JER.43.8	Then the word of the 
JER.43.9	Take great stones in thine hand and cover them with clay in a brickkiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh’s house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah;
JER.43.10	and say unto them, Thus hath the 
JER.43.11	And he shall come and smite the land of Egypt and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword.
JER.43.12	And I will put fire to the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt as a shepherd puts on his garment; and he shall go forth from there in peace.
JER.43.13	He shall also break the images of Bethshemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire.
JER.44.1	The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews which dwelt in the land of Egypt, which dwelt at Migdol and at Tahpanhes and at Noph and in the country of Pathros, saying,
JER.44.2	Thus hath the 
JER.44.3	because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers.
JER.44.4	Howbeit I sent unto you all my slaves the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.
JER.44.5	But they did not hearken, nor incline their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.
JER.44.6	Therefore my fury and my anger was poured forth and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day.
JER.44.7	Therefore now thus hath the 
JER.44.8	In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, where ye are gone to dwell. Why do ye cut yourselves off that ye might be a curse and a reproach to all the Gentiles of the earth?
JER.44.9	Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which was committed in the land of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem?
JER.44.10	They are not broken even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my rights, that I set before you and before your fathers.
JER.44.11	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.44.12	And I will take the remnant of Judah that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to dwell there, and they shall all be consumed and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine; they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine; and they shall be for an oath and an astonishment and a curse and a reproach.
JER.44.13	For I will visit those that dwell in the land of Egypt as I visited Jerusalem with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence:
JER.44.14	so that none of the remnant of Judah, which are gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall escape or remain alive to return into the land of Judah, unto which they have a desire to return to dwell there; for none shall return but some fugitives.
JER.44.15	Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,
JER.44.16	As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the 
JER.44.17	But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goes forth out of our own mouth to burn incense unto the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem; for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil.
JER.44.18	But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have lacked all things and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine.
JER.44.19	And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men?
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people who had given him that answer, saying,
JER.44.21	The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the 
JER.44.22	So that the 
JER.44.23	Because ye have burned incense and because ye have sinned against the 
JER.44.24	Moreover Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the 
JER.44.25	Thus hath spoken the 
JER.44.26	Therefore hear ye the word of the 
JER.44.27	Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine until there is an end of them.
JER.44.28	Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of Egypt into the land of Judah, so that all the remnant of Judah, that are gone into the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs.
JER.44.29	And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the 
JER.44.30	thus hath the 
JER.45.1	The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto Baruch the son of Neriah, when he had written these words in a book at the mouth of Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying,
JER.45.2	Thus hath the 
JER.45.3	Thou didst say, Woe is me now! for the 
JER.45.4	Thus shalt thou say unto him, The 
JER.45.5	And dost thou seek great things for thyself? seek them not; for, behold, I bring evil upon all flesh, said the 
JER.46.1	The word of the 
JER.46.2	To Egypt: against the army of Pharaohnecho king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates in Carchemish, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah.
JER.46.3	Order ye the buckler and shield, and draw near to battle.
JER.46.4	Harness the horses; and get up, ye horsemen, and stand forth with your helmets; furbish the spears, and put on the brigandines.
JER.46.5	Why have I seen them dismayed and turned away back? and their mighty ones are beaten down and are fled in haste, and do not look back: for fear was round about, said the 
JER.46.6	Do not let the swift flee away, nor the mighty man escape; they stumbled and fell toward the north by the river Euphrates.
JER.46.7	Who is this that comes up as a flood, whose waters move as rivers?
JER.46.8	Egypt rises up like a flood, and his waters move like rivers; and he said, I will go up and will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and its inhabitants.
JER.46.9	Come up, ye horses; and rage, ye chariots; and let the mighty men come forth; the Ethiopians and the Libyans, that handle the shield; and the Lydians, that handle and bend the bow.
JER.46.10	But this day shall be unto the Lord GOD of the hosts, a day of vengeance, that he may avenge him of his adversaries; and the sword shall devour, and it shall be satiated and made drunk with their blood; for it shall be a slaughter unto the Lord GOD of the hosts in the north country by the river Euphrates.
JER.46.11	Go up into Gilead, and take balm, O virgin, the daughter of Egypt: in vain shalt thou use many medicines; for there is no cure for thee.
JER.46.12	The nations have heard of thy shame, and thy cry has filled the land; for the mighty man has stumbled against the mighty, and they are both fallen together.
JER.46.13	The word that the 
JER.46.14	Declare ye in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in Memphis and in Tahpanhes: say ye, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for the sword shall devour round about thee.
JER.46.15	Why is thy fortress swept away? It could not stand because the 
JER.46.16	He multiplied the fallen; yea, one fell upon another; and they said, Arise, and let us go again to our own people and to the land of our nativity, away from the overcoming sword.
JER.46.17	They cried there: Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise; he allowed the appointed time to pass by.
JER.46.18	As I live, saith the King, whose name is the 
JER.46.19	O thou daughter dwelling in Egypt, furnish thyself to go into captivity; for Memphis shall be a pasture and shall be made desolate without an inhabitant.
JER.46.20	Egypt is like a very fair heifer, but destruction comes; it comes out of the north.
JER.46.21	Also her soldiers are in the midst of her like fatted bullocks; for they also turned back, and all fled away without stopping: because the day of their calamity was come upon them and the time of their visitation.
JER.46.22	Her voice shall go forth like a serpent; for they shall march with an army and come against her with axes as hewers of wood.
JER.46.23	They shall cut down her forest, saith the 
JER.46.24	The daughter of Egypt shall be confounded; she shall be delivered into the hand of the people of the north.
JER.46.25	The 
JER.46.26	And I will deliver them into the hand of those that seek their soul and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of his slaves; and afterward it shall be inhabited, as in the days of old, saith the 
JER.46.27	But fear not thou, O my slave Jacob, and be not dismayed, O Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar off, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return and be in rest and be prospered, and no one shall make him afraid.
JER.46.28	Fear thou not, O Jacob my slave, saith the 
JER.47.1	The word of the 
JER.47.2	Thus hath the 
JER.47.3	At the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his strong horses, at the rushing of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels, the fathers shall not look back to their children for feebleness of hands;
JER.47.4	because of the day that comes to destroy all the Palestinians, and to cut off from Tyre and Zidon every helper that remains: for the 
JER.47.5	Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ashkelon is cut off with the remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?
JER.47.6	O thou sword of the 
JER.47.7	How can it be quiet, seeing the 
JER.48.1	Against Moab thus hath the 
JER.48.2	Moab shall no longer be praised; they have devised evil against Heshbon, saying, Come, and let us cut it off from being a nation. Also thou shalt be cut down, O Madmen; the sword shall pursue thee.
JER.48.3	A voice of crying shall be from Horonaim, spoiling and great destruction.
JER.48.4	Moab is destroyed; they have caused the cry of her little ones to be heard.
JER.48.5	For in the ascending road of Luhith he that weeps shall go up weeping; for in the descending road of Horonaim the enemies have heard a cry of destruction.
JER.48.6	Flee, save your lives, and be like the heath in the wilderness.
JER.48.7	For because thou hast trusted in thy works; in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken; and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his priests and his princes together.
JER.48.8	And the spoiler shall come upon every city, and no city shall escape; the valley also shall perish, and the plain shall be destroyed as the 
JER.48.9	Give wings {Heb. open flowers} unto Moab that he may flee and get away, for his cities shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein.
JER.48.10	Cursed be he that does the work of the 
JER.48.11	Moab has been at ease from his youth, and he has settled on his lees and has not been emptied from vessel to vessel, neither has he gone into captivity; therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed.
JER.48.12	Therefore, behold, the days come, said the 
JER.48.13	And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence.
JER.48.14	How do ye say, We are mighty and strong men for the war?
JER.48.15	Moab is spoiled, and his cities destroyed, and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, said the King whose name is the 
JER.48.16	The calamity of Moab is near to come, and his affliction hastens fast.
JER.48.17	All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken: the beautiful rod!
JER.48.18	Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from thy glory, and sit in thirst; for the spoiler of Moab has come against thee and has dissipated thy strong holds.
JER.48.19	O inhabitant of Aroer, stand by the way and watch; ask her that flees and her that escapes and say, What has happened?
JER.48.20	Moab is confounded, for it is broken down; howl and cry; tell it in Arnon that Moab is spoiled,
JER.48.21	and judgment is come upon the plain country; upon Holon, and upon Jahazah, and upon Mephaath,
JER.48.22	and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Bethdiblathaim,
JER.48.23	and upon Kiriathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmeon,
JER.48.24	and upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab, those that are far and those that are near.
JER.48.25	The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, said the 
JER.48.26	Make him drunken, for he magnified himself against the 
JER.48.27	For was not Israel a derision unto thee, as if he were found among thieves? for since thou hast spoken of him, thou hast slipped.
JER.48.28	O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities and dwell in the rock and be like the dove that makes her nest in the sides of the hole’s mouth.
JER.48.29	We have heard the pride of Moab, (he is exceeding proud) his loftiness and his arrogancy and his pride and the haughtiness of his heart.
JER.48.30	I know his wrath, saith the 
JER.48.31	Therefore I will weep over Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab; my heart shall mourn for the men of Kirheres.
JER.48.32	O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with the weeping of Jazer; thy shoots are gone over the sea; they reach even to the sea of Jazer; the spoiler is fallen upon thy summer fruits and upon thy vintage.
JER.48.33	And joy and gladness shall be taken from the plentiful field and from the land of Moab; and I shall cause wine to cease from the winepresses; no one shall tread with song; their song shall be no song.
JER.48.34	The cry, from Heshbon even unto Elealeh, and even unto Jahaz, they have uttered their voice; from Zoar even unto Horonaim, as a heifer of three years old; for the waters of Nimrim shall also be destroyed.
JER.48.35	Moreover I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the 
JER.48.36	Therefore my heart shall sound like flutes for Moab, and my heart shall sound like flutes for the men of Kirheres because the riches that he has gotten are perished.
JER.48.37	For every head shall be bald, and every beard shaved: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon all the loins sackcloth.
JER.48.38	There shall be lamentation generally upon all the housetops of Moab and in the streets thereof; for I have broken Moab like a vessel in which there is no pleasure, said the 
JER.48.39	They shall howl, saying, How is it broken down! how has Moab turned the back with shame! so shall Moab be a derision and a dismaying to all those about him.
JER.48.40	For thus hath the 
JER.48.41	The cities are taken, and the strong holds are taken, and the mighty men’s hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
JER.48.42	And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people because he has magnified himself against the 
JER.48.43	Fear and the pit and the snare shall be upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, said the 
JER.48.44	He that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for I will bring upon him, even upon Moab, the year of their visitation, said the 
JER.48.45	Those that fled from the force stood under the shadow of Heshbon; because fire came forth out of Heshbon and a flame from the midst of Sihon and burned the corner of Moab and the crown of the head of the rebellious sons.
JER.48.46	Woe be unto thee, O Moab! the people of Chemosh have perished; for thy sons are taken prisoners into captivity, and thy daughters are captives.
JER.48.47	Yet I will turn again the captivity of Moab in the last of the times, said the 
JER.49.1	Concerning the Ammonites, thus hath the 
JER.49.2	Therefore, behold, the days come, said the 
JER.49.3	Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled; cry, ye daughters of Rabbah, gird yourselves with sackcloth; lament and run to and fro by the hedges, for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.
JER.49.4	Why gloriest thou in the valleys? Thy valley has slipped, O backsliding daughter that trusted in her treasures, she that saith, Who shall come against me?
JER.49.5	Behold, I bring fear upon thee, saith the Lord GOD of the hosts, from all sides; and ye shall be driven out each man right forth in the direction he is facing; and no one shall gather up him that wanders.
JER.49.6	And afterward I will turn again the captivity of the sons of Ammon, said the 
JER.49.7	Concerning Edom, thus hath the 
JER.49.8	Flee, turn back, hide in the deeps to remain, O inhabitants of Dedan; for I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, at the time that I have to visit him.
JER.49.9	If grapegatherers came against thee, would they not leave some gleaning grapes? If thieves by night, they will take what they have need of.
JER.49.10	But I will make Esau bare, I will uncover his secret places, and he shall not be able to hide himself; his seed shall be destroyed, and his brethren and his neighbours and he shall no longer be.
JER.49.11	Leave thy fatherless children; I will raise them; and thy widows shall trust in me.
JER.49.12	For thus hath the 
JER.49.13	For I have sworn by myself, said the 
JER.49.14	I have heard the news, that from the 
JER.49.15	For, behold, I have placed thee as small among the Gentiles and despised among men.
JER.49.16	Thy arrogance has deceived thee, and the pride of thine heart, O thou that dost dwell in the clefts of the rock, that dost hold the height of the mountain: though thou should make thy nest as high as the eagle, I will bring thee down from there, said the 
JER.49.17	Also Edom shall be a desolation; every one that goes by it shall be astonished and shall hiss at all its plagues.
JER.49.18	As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, said the 
JER.49.19	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan to the strong habitation: for I will make rest and make him run from upon her, and he who is chosen I shall appoint over her; for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
JER.49.20	Therefore hear the counsel of the 
JER.49.21	The earth is moved at the noise of their fall; at the cry the noise thereof was heard in the Red sea.
JER.49.22	Behold, he shall rise up and fly as the eagle and spread his wings over Bozrah; and at that day the heart of the mighty men of Edom shall be as the heart of a woman in her pangs.
JER.49.23	Concerning Damascus. Hamath is confounded, and Arpad, for they have heard bad news; they have melted in waters of feebleness; they cannot be reassured.
JER.49.24	Damascus is waxed feeble and turns herself to flee, and fear has seized on her; anguish and sorrows have taken her as a woman in travail.
JER.49.25	How did they not forgive the city of praise, the city of my joy!
JER.49.26	Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all the men of war shall be cut off in that day, said the 
JER.49.27	And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall consume the houses of Benhadad.
JER.49.28	Concerning Kedar, and concerning the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote, thus hath the 
JER.49.29	Their tents and their flocks shall they take away; they shall take to themselves their curtains and all their vessels and their camels; and they shall invoke fear on every side against them.
JER.49.30	Flee, get you far off, dwell in the deeps that ye may stand, O ye inhabitants of Hazor, said the 
JER.49.31	Arise, get you up unto the wealthy nation that dwells without care, saith the 
JER.49.32	And their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their cattle a spoil: and I will scatter them into all the winds, throwing them out unto the utmost corner; and from all their sides I will bring their ruin, said the 
JER.49.33	And Hazor shall be a dwelling for dragons and a desolation for ever: no man shall abide there, nor any son of man dwell in it.
JER.49.34	The word of the 
JER.49.35	Thus hath the 
JER.49.36	And upon Elam I will bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.
JER.49.37	For I will cause Elam to fear before their enemies and before those that seek their soul; and I will bring evil upon them, even my fierce anger, said the 
JER.49.38	And I will set my throne in Elam and will destroy from there the king and the princes, said the 
JER.49.39	But it shall come to pass in the last of the days that I will turn again the captivity of Elam, said the 
JER.50.1	The word that the 
JER.50.2	Declare ye among the Gentiles, and publish, and set up a banner; publish, and do not conceal: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
JER.50.3	For out of the north there comes up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and no one shall dwell therein: they shall leave, they shall depart, both man and beast.
JER.50.4	In those days, and in that time, saith the 
JER.50.5	They shall ask the way to Zion, unto where they shall turn their faces, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the 
JER.50.6	My people have been lost sheep; their shepherds have caused them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains; they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten their restingplace.
JER.50.7	All that found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said, We are not guilty because they have sinned against the 
JER.50.8	Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the meek in front of the flocks.
JER.50.9	For, behold, I awake and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country, and from there they shall set themselves in array against her; she shall be taken; their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert one, who shall not return in vain.
JER.50.10	And the land of the Chaldeans shall be for a spoil; all that spoil her shall come forth full, saith the 
JER.50.11	Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced destroying my heritage, because ye filled yourselves as a heifer on grass and neighed like horses;
JER.50.12	your mother was sore confounded; she that bore you was ashamed: see here the latter end of the Gentiles: wilderness, dry land, and desert.
JER.50.13	Because of the wrath of the 
JER.50.14	Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about; all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows; for she has sinned against the 
JER.50.15	Shout against her round about; she has given her hand; her foundations are fallen; her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the 
JER.50.16	Cut off the sower from Babylon and him that handles the sickle in the time of harvest; for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn each one to his people, and they shall flee each one to his own land.
JER.50.17	Israel has been like scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away; first the king of Assyria has devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.
JER.50.18	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.50.19	And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon Mount Ephraim and Gilead.
JER.50.20	In those days, and in that time, said the 
JER.50.21	Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it and against the inhabitants of Pekod; waste and utterly destroy after them, said the 
JER.50.22	A sound of battle is in the land and of great destruction.
JER.50.23	How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! How is Babylon become a desolation among the Gentiles!
JER.50.24	I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware; thou art found, and also caught because thou hast provoked the 
JER.50.25	The 
JER.50.26	Come against her from the ends of the earth, open her storehouses; cast her up as heaps and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
JER.50.27	Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter. Woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
JER.50.28	The voice of those that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the 
JER.50.29	Call together the archers against Babylon; all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she has done, do unto her; for she has become proud against the 
JER.50.30	Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, said the 
JER.50.31	Behold, I am against thee, O thou proud one, said the Lord GOD of the hosts; for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.
JER.50.32	And the proud one shall stumble and fall and have no one to raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
JER.50.33	Thus hath the 
JER.50.34	Their Redeemer is strong; the 
JER.50.35	A sword is upon the Chaldeans, said the 
JER.50.36	A sword is upon the fortune-tellers; and they shall be fools: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be broken.
JER.50.37	A sword is upon their horses and upon their chariots and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women; a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
JER.50.38	A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up; for it is the land of graven images, and they are become mad upon their idols.
JER.50.39	Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall no longer be inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
JER.50.40	As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the 
JER.50.41	Behold, a people comes from the north, and a great nation and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
JER.50.42	They shall hold the bow and the lance; they shall be cruel and will not show mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon has heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble; anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
JER.50.44	Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the strong habitation; but I will rest and will make him run from upon her; and he who shall be chosen I will appoint over her. For who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
JER.50.45	Therefore hear ye the counsel of the 
JER.50.46	At the noise of the taking of Babylon, the earth was moved, and the cry was heard among the Gentiles.
JER.51.1	Thus hath the 
JER.51.2	And I will send unto Babylon fanners that shall fan her and shall empty her land; for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about.
JER.51.3	I shall say to the archer that bends his bow and unto him that lifts himself up in his brigandine, Spare ye not her young men; utterly destroy all her host.
JER.51.4	Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans and those that are thrust through in her streets.
JER.51.5	For Israel and Judah have not been made widows of their God, of the 
JER.51.6	Flee out of the midst of Babylon and deliver each one his soul that ye not perish because of her iniquity, for this is the time of the 
JER.51.7	Babylon has been a golden cup in the 
JER.51.8	Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed; howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
JER.51.9	We applied the medicine to Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go each one into his own land; for her judgment is come unto heaven and is lifted up even to the clouds.
JER.51.10	The 
JER.51.11	Make bright the arrows; gather the shields; the 
JER.51.12	Set up the banner upon the walls of Babylon, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for the 
JER.51.13	O thou that dwellest among many waters, rich in treasures, thine end is come, the measure of thy covetousness.
JER.51.14	The 
JER.51.15	He is the one who makes the earth by his power; he upholds the world by his wisdom and extends the heavens by his intelligence;
JER.51.16	he who gives with his voice a multitude of waters from heaven, then he causes the clouds to ascend from the ends of the earth; he makes lightnings with the rain and brings forth the wind out of his treasures.
JER.51.17	Every man has become carnal and is without knowledge; let every founder be ashamed of the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
JER.51.18	They are vanity, the work of errors; in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
JER.51.19	The portion of Jacob is not like them; for he is the Former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance; the 
JER.51.20	Thou art my hammer, O weapons of war: for with thee I will break in pieces the Gentiles, and with thee I will destroy kingdoms;
JER.51.21	and with thee I will break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee I will break in pieces the chariots and their riders;
JER.51.22	with thee also I will break in pieces men and women; and with thee I will break in pieces old and young; and with thee I will break in pieces young men and virgins;
JER.51.23	I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee I will break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee I will break in pieces dukes and princes.
JER.51.24	And I will render unto Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, said the 
JER.51.25	Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, said the 
JER.51.26	And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, said the 
JER.51.27	Set ye up a banner in the land, blow the shofar among the Gentiles, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as raised up locusts.
JER.51.28	Prepare the nations against her: the kings of Media, the captains thereof, and all the princes thereof, and all the land of their dominion.
JER.51.29	And the land shall tremble and sorrow for every thought of the 
JER.51.30	The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight; they have remained in their holds; their might has failed; they became as women: the enemies have burned her dwellingplaces; they have broken her bars.
JER.51.31	One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken in all places,
JER.51.32	And the fords were taken, and they have burned the reeds with fire, and the men of war were astounded.
JER.51.33	For thus hath the 
JER.51.34	Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me; he has crushed me; he has made me an empty vessel, he has swallowed me up like a dragon; he has filled his belly with my delicates; he has cast me out.
JER.51.35	The violence against me and my flesh be upon Babylon, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
JER.51.36	Therefore thus hath the 
JER.51.37	And Babylon shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and a hissing, without an inhabitant.
JER.51.38	They shall roar together like lions; they shall roar as lions’ whelps.
JER.51.39	In their heat I will place their feasts before them, and I will make them drunken that they may rejoice and sleep an eternal sleep and not wake, said the 
JER.51.40	I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats.
JER.51.41	How is Sheshach a prey! and how is she who was the praise of the whole earth taken! how is Babylon become an astonishment among the Gentiles!
JER.51.42	The sea is come up upon Babylon; she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof.
JER.51.43	Her cities were devastated, the land dry and desert, a land in which no man dwells, neither shall any son of man pass thereby.
JER.51.44	And I will visit Bel himself in Babylon, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up; and the Gentiles shall not flow together any more unto him; and the wall of Babylon shall fall.
JER.51.45	Come out of the midst of her, my people, and save each one his life from the fierce anger of the 
JER.51.46	And lest your heart faint, and ye fear because of the news that shall be heard in the land; in one year shall the news come, and after that in the next year shall come the rumour, and then shall come the violence in the land, and the ruler over him who rules.
JER.51.47	Therefore, behold, the days come that I will visit the graven images of Babylon; and her whole land shall be ashamed, and all her dead shall fall in the midst of her.
JER.51.48	Then the heavens and the earth and all that is therein shall sing praises over Babylon; for the destroyers shall come unto her from the north, said the 
JER.51.49	As Babylon has caused the dead of Israel to fall, so because of Babylon the dead of all the earth fell.
JER.51.50	Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, do not tarry: remember the 
JER.51.51	We are ashamed, because we have heard the reproach; confusion has covered our faces; for strangers are come against the sanctuaries of the 
JER.51.52	Therefore, behold, the days come, said the 
JER.51.53	Though Babylon should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify her strength upon high, yet from me shall destroyers come unto her, said the 
JER.51.54	The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans!
JER.51.55	Because the 
JER.51.56	because the destroyer is come against her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, their bow is broken: for the 
JER.51.57	And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep an eternal sleep and shall not wake, saith the King, whose name is the 
JER.51.58	Thus hath the 
JER.51.59	The word which Jeremiah the prophet sent to Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was the chief steward of the bedchambers.
JER.51.60	So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon.
JER.51.61	And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon and shalt see and shalt read all these things;
JER.51.62	then thou shalt say, O 
JER.51.63	And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates;
JER.51.64	and thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be overcome. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
JER.52.2	And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the 
JER.52.3	For because of the anger of the 
JER.52.4	Therefore it came to pass after nine years of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem and pitched camp against it and built forts against it round about.
JER.52.5	So the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
JER.52.6	And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine prevailed in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.
JER.52.7	Then the city was breached, and all the men of war fled and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden, and they went by the way of the desert, even though the Chaldeans were by the city round about.
JER.52.8	But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king and took Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.
JER.52.9	So they took the king and caused him to come up unto the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath where he pronounced the sentence upon him.
JER.52.10	And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes; he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
JER.52.11	But he put out the eyes of Zedekiah and bound him in chains; and the king of Babylon caused him to be taken to Babylon and put him in prison until the day of his death.
JER.52.12	And in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem
JER.52.13	and burned the house of the 
JER.52.14	And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, destroyed all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
JER.52.15	Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives that had fled to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.
JER.52.17	Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the 
JER.52.18	The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away.
JER.52.19	And the basins, and the censers, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, the captain of the guard took away.
JER.52.20	The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which King Solomon had made in the house of the 
JER.52.21	And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits did compass it; and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.
JER.52.22	And a chapiter of brass was upon it; and the height of one chapiter was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the chapiters round about, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like unto these.
JER.52.23	And there were ninety-six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were one hundred round about.
JER.52.24	And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door.
JER.52.25	He also took out of the city a eunuch, who had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of those that were near the king’s person, who were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land for war; and sixty men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city.
JER.52.26	So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
JER.52.27	And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.
JER.52.28	This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand and twenty-three Jews:
JER.52.29	In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons:
JER.52.30	In the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty-five persons: all the persons were four thousand six hundred.
JER.52.31	And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him forth out of prison
JER.52.32	and spoke kindly unto him and set his seat above the seat of the kings that were with him in Babylon
JER.52.33	and changed his prison garments: and he continually ate bread before him all the days of his life.
JER.52.34	And for his diet, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every thing in its day for all the days of his life, until the day of his death.
LAM.1.1	Aleph How does the city sit solitary, that was full of people! The great one among the nations is become as a widow; the princess of provinces is become tributary.
LAM.1.2	Beth She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; among all her lovers she has none to comfort her; all her friends have dealt treacherously with her; they are become her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Gimel Judah is gone into captivity because of the affliction and because of the greatness of the servitude; she dwells among the Gentiles; she finds no rest; all her persecutors overtook her between the straits.
LAM.1.4	Daleth The streets of Zion mourn because there are none to come to the solemnities; all her gates are destroyed; her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.
LAM.1.5	He Her enemies have been made the head; those who hated her have been prospered; for the 
LAM.1.6	Vau And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed; her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.
LAM.1.7	Zain Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction and of her rebellions and of all her desirable things that she had in the times of old when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and no one helped her; the enemies saw her and mocked at her days of rest.
LAM.1.8	Cheth Jerusalem has grievously sinned; therefore she is removed; all that honoured her despise her because they have seen her nakedness; yea, she sighs and is turned backward.
LAM.1.9	Teth Her filthiness is in her skirts; she did not remember her latter end; therefore she came down surprisingly; she has no comforter. O 
LAM.1.10	Jod The enemy has spread out his hand upon all her precious things, and she saw the Gentiles enter into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.
LAM.1.11	Caph All her people sought their bread with sadness; they have given all their precious things for food to maintain life; see, O

LAM.1.14	Nun The yoke of my rebellions is bound in his hand; they are wreathed and come up upon my neck; he has made my strength to fall; the Lord has delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise up.
LAM.1.15	Samech The Lord has trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me; he has called a company against me to crush my young men; the Lord has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a winepress.
LAM.1.16	Ain For these things I weep; my eyes, my eyes stream with water because the comforter that gives rest unto my soul has left me; my sons are desolate because the enemy prevailed.
LAM.1.17	Pe Zion spread forth her hands and has no comforter; the 
LAM.1.18	Tzaddi The 
LAM.1.19	Koph I called unto my lovers, but they have deceived me; my priests and my elders in the city perished seeking food to maintain their lives.
LAM.1.20	Resh Look, O 
LAM.1.21	Schin They have heard that I sigh; and there is no comforter for me; all my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it. Thou hast brought the day that thou hast spoken of, but they shall be like unto me.
LAM.1.22	Tau Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them as thou hast done unto me for all my rebellions; for my sighs are many, and my heart is filled with pain.
LAM.2.1	Aleph How has the Lord darkened the daughter of Zion in his anger! He has cast down from heaven unto the earth the beauty of Israel and not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger!
LAM.2.2	Beth The Lord has destroyed and has not forgiven; he has destroyed in his wrath all the habitations of Jacob; he has thrown down to the ground the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he has polluted the kingdom and its princes.
LAM.2.3	Gimel He has cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel; he has caused his right hand to draw back in the presence of the enemy, and he burned in Jacob like a flaming fire, which devours round about.
LAM.2.4	Daleth He has bent his bow like an enemy; he strengthened his right hand as an adversary and slew everything of beauty that could be seen in the tent of the daughter of Zion; he poured out his fury like fire.
LAM.2.5	He The Lord was as an enemy, he has destroyed Israel; he has destroyed all her palaces; he has dissipated his strong holds and has multiplied in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.
LAM.2.6	Vau And he has violently taken away his tabernacle as if it were of a garden; he has destroyed his congregation; the 
LAM.2.7	Zain The Lord has cast off his altar; he has abhorred his sanctuary; he has given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have shouted in the house of the

LAM.2.11	Caph My eyes fail with tears; my bowels are troubled; my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people because the children and the sucklings faint in the streets of the city.
LAM.2.12	Lamed They said to their mothers, Where is the wheat and the wine? fainting as the dead in the streets of the city, pouring out their souls into their mothers’ bosom.
LAM.2.13	Mem What witness shall I take to thee? Or unto whom shall I liken thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? Unto whom shall I compare thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is as great as the sea: who shall heal thee?
LAM.2.14	Nun Thy prophets have preached vanity and foolishness unto thee; and they have not uncovered thine iniquity to turn away thy captivity but have preached unto thee vain prophecies and digressions.
LAM.2.15	Samech All that passed by clapped their hands over thee and whistled and wagged their heads over the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?
LAM.2.16	Pe All thine enemies opened their mouths regarding thee; they whistled and gnashed their teeth; they said, Swallow her up; certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found it, we have seen it.
LAM.2.17	Ain The 
LAM.2.18	Tsade Their heart cried unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion; let tears run down like a river day and night; give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thine eye cease.
LAM.2.19	Koph Arise, cry out in the night; in the beginning of the watches; pour out thine heart like water before the face of the Lord; lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children that faint for hunger in the top of every street.
LAM.2.20	Resh Look, O 
LAM.2.21	Schin The young and the old lay on the ground in the streets; my virgins and my young men fell by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thine anger; thou hast killed and hast not forgiven.
LAM.2.22	Tau Thou hast called as to a day of solemnity my terrors from everywhere, so that in the day of the 
LAM.3.1	Aleph I am a man that sees affliction in the rod of his wrath.
LAM.3.2	Aleph He has led me and brought me into darkness, but not into light.
LAM.3.3	Aleph Surely he is turned against me; he turns his hand against me all the day.
LAM.3.4	Beth My flesh and my skin he has made old; he has broken my bones.
LAM.3.5	Beth He has built against me and compassed me with gall and travail.
LAM.3.6	Beth He has set me in dark places as those that are dead for ever.
LAM.3.7	Gimel He has hedged me about that I cannot get out; he has made my chain heavy.
LAM.3.8	Gimel Even when I cried and shouted, he shut out my prayer.
LAM.3.9	Gimel He has enclosed my ways with hewn stone; he has made my paths crooked.
LAM.3.10	Daleth He was unto me as a bear lying in wait and as a lion in secret places.
LAM.3.11	Daleth He has made my ways crooked and pulled me in pieces; he has made me desolate.
LAM.3.12	Daleth He has bent his bow and set me as a mark for the arrow.
LAM.3.13	He He has caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my kidneys.
LAM.3.14	He I was a derision to all my people and their song every day.
LAM.3.15	He He has filled me with bitterness, he has made me drunk with wormwood.
LAM.3.16	Vau He has broken my teeth with gravel stones; he has covered me with ashes.
LAM.3.17	Vau My soul removed itself far from peace; I forgot about good.

LAM.3.30	Jod He shall turn his cheek unto him that smites him; he shall be filled with reproach.
LAM.3.31	Caph For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
LAM.3.32	Caph But though he causes grief, yet he will also have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
LAM.3.33	Caph For he does not afflict nor grieve the sons of men from his heart.

LAM.3.66	Tau Persecute them in thy anger and cut them off from under the heavens, oh 
LAM.4.1	Aleph How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are scattered through the crossings of every street.
LAM.4.2	Beth The sons of Zion, precious and esteemed more than pure gold, how are they taken for earthen vessels, the work of the hands of the potter!
LAM.4.3	Gimel Even the sea monsters draw out the breast; they give suck to their young ones; the daughter of my people is cruel like the ostriches in the wilderness.
LAM.4.4	Daleth The tongue of the sucking child cleaves to the roof of his mouth for thirst; the young children ask for bread, and there was no one to break it unto them.
LAM.4.5	He Those that did feed delicately are made desolate in the streets; those that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.
LAM.4.6	Vau For the iniquity of the daughter of my people has increased more than the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and companies did not camp upon her.

LAM.5.1	Remember, O 
LAM.5.2	Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
LAM.5.3	We are orphans without father; our mothers are as widows.
LAM.5.4	We have drunk our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
LAM.5.5	Our necks are under persecution; we are become tired and have no rest.
LAM.5.6	We have given the hand to the Egyptians and to the Assyrians to be satisfied with bread.
LAM.5.7	Our fathers have sinned and are dead; and we have borne their chastisements.
LAM.5.8	Slaves have ruled over us: there was no one to deliver us out of their hand.
LAM.5.9	We got our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
LAM.5.10	Our skin became black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
LAM.5.11	They ravished the women in Zion and the virgins in the cities of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes were hanged up by their hand; the countenance of the elders was not honoured.
LAM.5.13	They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
LAM.5.14	The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their music.
LAM.5.15	The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
LAM.5.16	The crown is fallen from our head; woe now unto us, for we have sinned!
LAM.5.17	For this our heart is saddened; for these things our eyes are become dim.
LAM.5.18	Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.
LAM.5.19	Thou, O 
LAM.5.20	Why should thou forget us for ever and forsake us for such a long time?
LAM.5.21	Turn us unto thee, O 
LAM.5.22	For in stepping back thou hast rejected us; thou hast become very angry against us.
EZK.1.1	Now it came to pass at thirty years, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
EZK.1.2	In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of King Jehoiachin’s captivity,
EZK.1.3	the word of the 
EZK.1.4	And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, and a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the colour of amber, out of the midst of the fire.
EZK.1.5	Also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of man.
EZK.1.6	And each one had four faces, and four wings.
EZK.1.7	And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot; and they sparkled like the colour of highly burnished brass.
EZK.1.8	And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and their faces and their wings on all four sides.
EZK.1.9	With their wings they joined one to another; they did not return when they went; they went each one straight in the direction they were facing.
EZK.1.10	And the likeness of their faces was human faces; and lion faces, on the right side; and they four had ox faces on the left side; likewise they four had eagle faces.
EZK.1.11	Thus were their faces; and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of each one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.
EZK.1.12	And they went each one straight forward in the direction they were facing: wherever the Spirit directed them to go, they went; and they did not return when they went.
EZK.1.13	As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lit torches; the fire went up and down among the living creatures and the brightness of the fire; and out of the fire went forth lightning.
EZK.1.14	And the living creatures ran and turned as the appearance of lightnings.
EZK.1.15	Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold a wheel upon the earth with its four rims by the living creatures.
EZK.1.16	The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a stone of Tarsis or beryl; and they four had one likeness; and their appearance and their workmanship was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.
EZK.1.17	When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they did not return when they went.
EZK.1.18	And their ribs were high and dreadful, and full of eyes round about them in all four.
EZK.1.19	And when the living creatures went, the wheels went with them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.
EZK.1.20	Wherever the spirit wished to go, they went; wherever the spirit directed them, the wheels also rose up after them: for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
EZK.1.21	When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up after them: for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	And over the heads of each living creature there appeared a heaven like a marvellous crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.
EZK.1.23	And under the heaven their wings were straight, one toward the other: each one had two, and another two which covered their bodies.
EZK.1.24	And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as the voice of the Almighty, when they went; the voice of the word, as the voice of an army. When they stood, they let down their wings.
EZK.1.25	And there was heard a voice from the heaven that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.
EZK.1.26	And above the heaven that was over their heads was the figure of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the figure of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man seated upon it.
EZK.1.27	And I saw something that looked like the colour of amber, that appeared to have fire round about within it, which could be seen from his loins upward; and from his loins downward, I saw what looked like fire, and it had brightness round about
EZK.1.28	that looked like the bow of heaven that is in the clouds in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the 
EZK.2.1	And he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.
EZK.2.2	And spirit entered into me when he spoke unto me and set me upon my feet, and I heard him that spoke unto me.
EZK.2.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to rebellious Gentiles that have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have rebelled against me, even unto this very day.
EZK.2.4	And to sons that have hard faces and strong hearts do I send thee; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said.
EZK.2.5	And they will not hear nor forbear (for they are a rebellious house), but they shall know that there has been a prophet among them.
EZK.2.6	And thou, son of man, do not be afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, for they are rebels; though thou find thyself among thorns and thy dwelling be with briers, do not be afraid of their words, nor fear before them, for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.2.7	And thou shalt speak my words unto them, but they will not hear nor forbear, for they are rebels.
EZK.2.8	But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Do not be rebellious like the rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat what I give thee.
EZK.2.9	And I looked, and behold, a hand was sent unto me; and in it was the roll of a book,
EZK.2.10	and he spread it before me; and it was written within and without; and there was written therein lamentations and mourning and woes.
EZK.3.1	And he said unto me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.
EZK.3.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. I ate it and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.
EZK.3.4	Then he said unto me, Son of man, go and enter into the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them.
EZK.3.5	For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech nor of a hard language, but to the house of Israel;
EZK.3.6	not to many peoples of profound speech nor of hard language, whose words thou can not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee.
EZK.3.7	But the house of Israel will not desire to hear; for they do not desire to hear me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.
EZK.3.8	Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.
EZK.3.9	As diamond harder than flint I have made thy forehead: do not fear them, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.
EZK.3.10	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak unto thee receive in thine heart, and hear with thine ears.
EZK.3.11	And go, and enter in among the captives, unto the sons of thy people, and thou shalt speak unto them, and tell them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said, They will not hear, nor forbear.
EZK.3.12	And the Spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of great thunder of the blessed glory of the 
EZK.3.13	and the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of great thunder.
EZK.3.14	And the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the 
EZK.3.15	And I came unto the captives at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there disheartened among them seven days.
EZK.3.16	And it came to pass at the end of the seven days, that the word of the 
EZK.3.17	Son of man, I have placed thee as a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me.
EZK.3.18	When I say unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die and thou dost not give him warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, that he might live, the same wicked man shall die for his iniquity; but his blood I will require at thine hand.
EZK.3.19	Yet if thou warn the wicked and he does not turn from his wickedness nor from his wicked way, he shall die for his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
EZK.3.20	Again, When the righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die because thou hast not given him warning; he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at thy hand.
EZK.3.21	Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous not sin and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.
EZK.3.22	And the hand of the 
EZK.3.23	Then I arose and went forth into the plain, and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.3.24	Then spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet, and he spoke with me and said unto me, Go, shut thyself within thine house.
EZK.3.25	And thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands upon thee and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them;
EZK.3.26	and I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth that thou shalt be dumb and shalt not be to them a reprover; for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.3.27	But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: He that hears, let him hear, and he that forbears; let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.4.1	Thou also, son of man, take a tile and lay it before thee and portray upon it the city of Jerusalem
EZK.4.2	and lay siege against it and build a fort against it and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.
EZK.4.3	And take an iron pan and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city; and set thy face against it and it shall be for an encompassment, and thou shalt lay siege against the city. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.
EZK.4.4	Thou shalt sleep upon thy left side and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it; according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it, thou shalt bear their iniquity.
EZK.4.5	For I have summed up for thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days; so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.
EZK.4.6	And when thou hast accomplished them, thou shalt sleep on thy right side this second time, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: a day for a year; I have appointed thee each day for a year.
EZK.4.7	Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thine arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against her.
EZK.4.8	And, behold, I laced bands upon thee, and thou shalt not turn from one side to another until thou hast ended the days appointed thee upon thy sides.
EZK.4.9	Take also unto thee wheat and barley and beans and lentils and millet and fitches and put them in one vessel and make thee bread thereof, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof.
EZK.4.10	And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; from time to time shalt thou eat it.
EZK.4.11	Thou shalt also drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin; from time to time shalt thou drink.
EZK.4.12	And thou shalt eat barley cakes baked under the ashes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that comes out of man, in their sight.
EZK.4.13	And the 
EZK.4.14	Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul is not defiled: for from my youth up even until now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither has abominable flesh come into my mouth.
EZK.4.15	Then he said unto me, Behold, I give thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread with it.
EZK.4.16	Moreover he said unto me, Son of man, behold, I break the sustenance of bread in Jerusalem; and they shall eat bread by weight, and with anguish; and they shall drink water by measure, and with terror.
EZK.4.17	For they shall lack bread and water, and terrorize one another, and faint because of their iniquity.
EZK.5.1	And thou, son of man, take a sharp knife, take a barber’s razor, and cause it to pass upon thine head and upon thy beard; then take balances to weigh, and divide the hair.
EZK.5.2	Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled; and thou shalt take a third part and smite about it with a knife; and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.
EZK.5.3	Thou shalt also take thereof a few in number and bind them in the skirt of thy garment.
EZK.5.4	Then take of them again and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.
EZK.5.5	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the midst of the Gentiles and of the lands that are round about her.
EZK.5.6	And she has changed my judgments and my statutes into wickedness more than the Gentiles and more than the lands that are round about her; for they have disregarded my judgments and my commandments and have not walked in them.
EZK.5.7	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because I multiplied you more than the Gentiles that are round about you, ye have not walked in my commandments, neither have ye kept my judgments. Ye have not even acted according to the judgments of the Gentiles that are round about you.
EZK.5.8	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I, even I, am against thee and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the Gentiles.
EZK.5.9	And I will do in thee that which I have not done and whereunto I will not do any more the like because of all thine abominations.
EZK.5.10	For the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee I will scatter into all the winds.
EZK.5.11	Therefore, as I live, said the Lord GOD, surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy contaminations and with all thine abominations, therefore I will also destroy thee; neither shall my eye forgive, neither will I have mercy.
EZK.5.12	A third part of thee shall die of pestilence, and shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee, and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee, and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.
EZK.5.13	Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to cease in them, and I will be comforted; and they shall know that I, the 
EZK.5.14	And I will make thee a desert and a reproach among the Gentiles that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by.
EZK.5.15	And thou shalt be a reproach and a dishonour, and a chastisement and a terror unto the Gentiles that are round about thee when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I, the 
EZK.5.16	When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction and which I will send to destroy you, then I will increase the famine upon you and will destroy your sustenance of bread.
EZK.5.17	So I will send upon you famine and evil beasts that will destroy thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I, the 
EZK.6.1	And the word of the 
EZK.6.2	Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them,
EZK.6.3	and thou shalt say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD. Thus hath the Lord GOD said to the mountains and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys: Behold, I, even I, bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.
EZK.6.4	And your altars shall be desolate, and your images of the sun shall be destroyed, and I will cause your dead to fall before your idols.
EZK.6.5	And I will lay the dead carcasses of the sons of Israel before their idols, and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.
EZK.6.6	In all your provinces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate that your altars may be laid waste and condemned, and your idols shall be destroyed and shall cease, and your images of the sun shall be cut down, and your works shall be abolished.
EZK.6.7	And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.6.8	Yet I will leave a remnant that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the Gentiles when ye shall be scattered through the countries.
EZK.6.9	And those that escape of you shall remember me among the Gentiles where they shall be carried captives because I am broken because of your whorish heart, which has departed from me and because of your eyes, which went a whoring after your idols: and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.
EZK.6.10	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.6.11	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Smite with thine hand and stamp with thy foot and say, Alas for all the abominations of the evils of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.
EZK.6.12	He that is far off shall die of the pestilence, and he that is near shall fall by the sword, and he that remains and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury in them.
EZK.6.13	Then shall ye know that I am the 
EZK.6.14	So will I stretch out my hand upon them and make the land desolate, even more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.7.1	And the word of the 
EZK.7.2	and thou son of man, thus hath the Lord GOD said unto the land of Israel: The end, the end comes upon the four corners of the land.
EZK.7.3	Now shall be the end upon thee, and I will send my anger upon thee and will judge thee according to thy ways and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.
EZK.7.4	And my eye shall not forgive thee, neither will I have mercy; but I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.7.5	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: An evil, behold, an evil is come.
EZK.7.6	An end is come, the end is come; it watches for thee; behold, it is come.
EZK.7.7	The morning comes for thee. O thou that dwellest in the land; the time comes, the day is near, the day of trouble, and it shall not be the echo of the mountains.
EZK.7.8	Now I will shortly pour out my fury upon thee and accomplish my anger in thee; and I will judge thee according to thy ways and place all thine abominations upon thee.
EZK.7.9	And my eye shall not forgive, neither will I have mercy; I will recompense thee according to thy ways, and thine abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.7.10	Behold the day, behold, it comes; the morning is gone forth; the rod has blossomed; pride has budded.
EZK.7.11	Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness; nothing shall remain of them, nor of their riches, nor of anything of theirs; neither shall there be lamentation for them.
EZK.7.12	The time is come, the day draws near; do not let the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
EZK.7.13	For the seller shall not return to that which is sold although they remain alive, for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof and shall not be cancelled; neither shall any in the iniquity of his life strengthen himself.
EZK.7.14	They shall blow the trumpet and make everything ready, but there shall be no one to go forth to the battle, for my wrath is upon all the multitude thereof.
EZK.7.15	The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within; he that is in the field shall die with the sword, and he that is in the city, famine and pestilence shall devour him.
EZK.7.16	And those that escape of them shall be upon the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, each one for his iniquity.
EZK.7.17	All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
EZK.7.18	They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and trembling shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
EZK.7.19	They shall cast their silver in the streets and their gold far from them their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the 
EZK.7.20	Because they turned the glory of his ornament into pride and made in her the images of their abominations of their statues; therefore I have set it far from them.
EZK.7.21	And I gave it into the hands of the strangers for a prey and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.
EZK.7.22	I will also turn my face from them, and they shall pollute my secret place, for the destroyers shall enter into it and defile it.
EZK.7.23	Make a chain, for the land is full of bloody judgments, and the city is full of violence.
EZK.7.24	Therefore I will bring the worst of all the Gentiles, and they shall possess their houses; I will also cause the arrogance of the strong to cease; and their sanctuaries shall be defiled.
EZK.7.25	A cutting off comes, and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
EZK.7.26	Destruction shall come upon destruction, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then they shall seek an answer from the prophet, but the law shall perish from the priest and counsel from the elders.
EZK.7.27	The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their judgments I will judge them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.8.1	And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.
EZK.8.2	And I saw, and behold a likeness as the appearance of fire; from the appearance of his loins downward was fire; and from his loins upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the colour of amber.
EZK.8.3	And that likeness put forth his hand and took me by the locks of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between the heaven and the earth and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north where the habitation of the image of jealousy was, which provokes to jealousy.
EZK.8.4	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there like the vision that I saw in the plain.
EZK.8.5	Then he said unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.
EZK.8.6	He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here to cause me to go far away from my sanctuary? but turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations.
EZK.8.7	And he brought me to the entrance of the court, and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.
EZK.8.8	Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall; and when I had dug in the wall, behold a door.
EZK.8.9	And he said unto me, Go in and see the wicked abominations that they do here.
EZK.8.10	So I went in and saw; and behold every form of serpent and beasts; the abomination and all the idols of the house of Israel portrayed upon the wall round about.
EZK.8.11	And there stood before them seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, each man with his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.
EZK.8.12	Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the elders of the house of Israel do in the dark, each man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, The 
EZK.8.13	He also said unto me: Turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations that they do.
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the entrance of the door of the 
EZK.8.15	Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these.
EZK.8.16	And he brought me into the inner court of the 
EZK.8.17	Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? For after they have filled the land with evil and have returned to provoke me to anger; behold, they put the stench to my nose.
EZK.8.18	Therefore I will also deal in fury: my eye shall not forgive, neither will I have mercy: and they shall cry in my ears with a loud voice; yet I will not hear them.
EZK.9.1	And he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, The visitors of the city have come, even each one with his destroying weapon in his hand.
EZK.9.2	And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and each man had a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen with a writer’s inkhorn by his side; and they went in and stood beside the brazen altar.
EZK.9.3	And the glory of the God of Israel went up from over the cherubim, upon which he had been, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, who had the writer’s inkhorn by his side;
EZK.9.4	and the 
EZK.9.5	And to the others he said in my hearing, Go after him through the city and smite; do not let your eye forgive, neither have mercy.
EZK.9.6	Slay the old, the young men, and the virgins, the children and the women, but do not come near anyone upon whom is the mark; and ye must begin from my sanctuary. Then they began with the men, the elders, which were in front of the temple.
EZK.9.7	And he said unto them, Defile the house and fill the courts with the slain; go forth. And they went forth and slew in the city.
EZK.9.8	And it came to pass, after they had slain them, I was left, and I fell upon my face and cried out and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all the remnant of Israel in thy pouring out of thy fury upon Jerusalem?
EZK.9.9	Then said he unto me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness, for they have said, The 
EZK.9.10	And as for me also, my eye shall not forgive, neither will I have mercy, but I will recompense their way upon their head.
EZK.9.11	And, behold, the man clothed with linen, who had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done according to all thou hast commanded me.
EZK.10.1	Then I looked, and, behold, above the heaven that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.
EZK.10.2	And he spoke to the man clothed with linen and said, Go in between the wheels under the cherubim and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in, in my sight.
EZK.10.3	Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house when this man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court.
EZK.10.4	And the glory of the 
EZK.10.5	And the thunder of the cherubim’s wings was heard even to the outer court as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.
EZK.10.6	And it came to pass that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in and stood among the wheels.
EZK.10.7	And one cherubim stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim and took thereof and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen, who took it and went out.
EZK.10.8	And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man’s hand under their wings.
EZK.10.9	And when I looked, behold, four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by each cherubim; and the colour of the wheels was as a stone of Tarsis or beryl.
EZK.10.10	And as for their appearance, the four were the same, as if one were in the midst of another.
EZK.10.11	When they went, they went upon their four sides; they did not turn as they went, but to the place where the first one went, they followed it; they did not turn as they went.
EZK.10.12	And all their flesh and their ribs and their hands and their wings and the wheels: they were full of eyes round about in their four wheels.
EZK.10.13	To the wheels, it was shouted unto them in my hearing, Roll!
EZK.10.14	And each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherubim; the second face was the face of a man; the third the face of a lion; the fourth the face of an eagle.
EZK.10.15	And the cherubim rose up. These are the living creatures that I saw by the river of Chebar.
EZK.10.16	And when the cherubim went, the wheels went with them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also did not turn from beside them.
EZK.10.17	When they stood still, these stood still; and when they lifted up themselves, these lifted up themselves also; for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.
EZK.10.18	And the glory of the 
EZK.10.19	And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight; when they went out, the wheels also were in front of them, and they stood at the entrance of the east gate of the 
EZK.10.20	These were the living creatures that I saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.
EZK.10.21	Each one had four faces, and each one four wings; and the likeness of the hands of a man was under their wings.
EZK.10.22	And the likeness of their faces was the same faces which I saw by the river of Chebar, their appearance and their being; each one went straight in the direction they were facing.
EZK.11.1	And the Spirit lifted me up and brought me through the east gate of the 
EZK.11.2	Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that devise mischief and give wicked counsel in this city:
EZK.11.3	who say, It is not near; let us build houses; these shall be the caldron, and we the flesh.
EZK.11.4	Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, O son of man.
EZK.11.5	And the Spirit of the 
EZK.11.6	Ye have multiplied your slain in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain.
EZK.11.7	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said; Your slain whom ye have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and it is the caldron; but I will bring you forth out of the midst of it.
EZK.11.8	Ye have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword upon you, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.11.9	And I will bring you out of the midst thereof and deliver you into the hands of strangers and will execute judgments in you.
EZK.11.10	Ye shall fall by the sword; I will judge you in the border of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.11.11	This city shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof; but I must judge you in the border of Israel:
EZK.11.12	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.11.13	And it came to pass, as I was prophesying that Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died. Then I fell down upon my face and cried with a loud voice and said, Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
EZK.11.14	And the word of the 
EZK.11.15	Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel together, are they unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from the 
EZK.11.16	Therefore say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Although I have cast them far off among the Gentiles and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet I will be to them as a little sanctuary in the countries where they shall come.
EZK.11.17	Therefore say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will even gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.
EZK.11.18	And they shall come there, and they shall remove all her contaminations and all her abominations from her.
EZK.11.19	And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh:
EZK.11.20	that they may walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and fulfil them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
EZK.11.21	But as for those whose heart walks after the desire of their contaminations and of their abominations, I will recompense their way upon their own heads, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.11.22	Then the cherubim lifted up their wings and the wheels after them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.
EZK.11.23	And the glory of the 
EZK.11.24	Afterwards the Spirit took me up and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into the land of the Chaldeans to the captives. So the vision that I had seen went up from me.
EZK.11.25	Then I spoke unto the captives all the words of the 
EZK.12.1	The word of the 
EZK.12.2	Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a rebellious house, which have eyes to see and do not see; they have ears to hear and do not hear; for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.12.3	Therefore, thou son of man, prepare thee stuff for moving and move by day in their sight and thou shalt move from thy place to another place in their sight: they will not see for they are a rebellious house.
EZK.12.4	And thou shalt bring forth thy stuff by day in their sight, as stuff for moving; and thou shalt go forth in the evening in their sight, as those that go forth to not return.
EZK.12.5	Dig through the wall in their sight, and leave thereby.
EZK.12.6	In their sight thou shalt bear it upon thy shoulders and carry it forth in the night; thou shalt cover thy face, and thou shalt not look at the land; for I have set thee for a sign unto the house of Israel.
EZK.12.7	And I did so as I was commanded: I brought forth my stuff by day, as stuff for a journey, and in the evening I dug through the wall with my hand; I brought it forth in the night, and I bore it upon my shoulder in their sight.
EZK.12.8	And in the morning the word of the 
EZK.12.9	Son of man, has not the house of Israel, the rebellious house, said unto thee, What doest thou?
EZK.12.10	Say thou unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: This burden concerns the prince in Jerusalem and all the house of Israel that are among them.
EZK.12.11	Say, I am your sign: like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them: when they go to another country they shall go in captivity.
EZK.12.12	And the prince that is among them shall be born upon their shoulders in the night, and they shall go forth; they shall dig through the wall to carry him out thereby; he shall cover his face that he not see the land with his eyes.
EZK.12.13	But I will spread my net upon him, and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will cause him to be taken to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet he shall not see it though he shall die there.
EZK.12.14	And I will scatter toward every wind all that were about him to help him and all his companies; and I will draw out the sword after them.
EZK.12.15	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.16	But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the Gentiles where they go; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.17	And the word of the 
EZK.12.18	Son of man, eat thy bread with quaking and drink thy water with trembling and with anxiety
EZK.12.19	and say unto the people of the land, Thus hath the Lord GOD said regarding the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the land of Israel. They shall eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with terror that her land may be desolate from all that is in it because of the violence of all those that dwell therein.
EZK.12.20	And the cities that are inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.12.21	And the word of the 
EZK.12.22	Son of man, what is that saying that ye have in the land of Israel that saith, The days shall be prolonged, and every vision shall fail?
EZK.12.23	Tell them therefore, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will make this saying to cease, and they shall not repeat this as a saying in Israel but say unto them, Those days have drawn nigh, and the fulfillment of every vision.
EZK.12.24	For there shall no longer be any vain vision or flattering divination within the house of Israel.
EZK.12.25	Because I, the 
EZK.12.26	Again the word of the 
EZK.12.27	Son of man, behold, those of the house of Israel say, The vision that he sees is for many days to come, and he prophesies of the times that are far off.
EZK.12.28	Therefore say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: All of my words shall not be prolonged any longer, but the word which I have spoken shall be done, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.13.1	And the word of the 
EZK.13.2	Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel that prophesy and say unto those that prophesy out of their own hearts, Hear ye the word of the 
EZK.13.3	thus hath the Lord GOD said: Woe unto the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit and have seen nothing!
EZK.13.4	O Israel, thy prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.
EZK.13.5	Ye have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the 
EZK.13.6	They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The 
EZK.13.7	Have ye not seen a vain vision and have ye not spoken a lying divination, whereas ye say, The 
EZK.13.8	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because ye have spoken vanity, and seen lies; therefore, behold, I am against you, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.13.9	And my hand shall be against the prophets that see vanity and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the book of the house of Israel, neither shall they return to the land of Israel; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
EZK.13.10	Therefore and because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up the wall, and, behold, others plastered it with loose mud:
EZK.13.11	say unto those who plaster it with loose mud, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing rain; and I shall send great hailstones that will cause it to fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.
EZK.13.12	And behold, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said unto you, Where is the mud with which ye have plastered it?
EZK.13.13	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will cause a stormy wind to rend it in my fury; and there shall come an overflowing rain in my anger and great hailstones in my wrath to consume it.
EZK.13.14	So I will break down the wall that ye have plastered with loose mud and bring it down to the ground, and its foundation shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and ye shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.13.15	Thus will I accomplish my wrath upon the wall and upon those that have plastered it with loose mud and will say unto you, The wall is no more, neither those that plastered it;
EZK.13.16	to wit, the prophets of Israel who prophesy concerning Jerusalem and who see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.13.17	Likewise, thou son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people, who prophesy out of their own heart; prophesy thou against them,
EZK.13.18	And say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes and make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature to hunt souls! Must ye hunt the souls of my people to maintain thus your own life?
EZK.13.19	And will ye profane me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, slaying the souls that should not die and giving life to the souls that should not live, by your lying to my people that listen to the lie?
EZK.13.20	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said; Behold, I am against your pillows, with which ye hunt there the loose souls, and I will tear them from your arms and will let the souls go, even the loose souls that ye hunt.
EZK.13.21	Your kerchiefs also I will tear and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall no longer be in your hand to be hunted; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.13.22	Because with lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and ye strengthen the hands of the wicked that he should not leave his wicked way, encouraging him:
EZK.13.23	therefore ye shall not see vanity, nor divine divinations any longer: for I will deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.14.1	Then certain of the elders of Israel came unto me and sat before me.
EZK.14.2	And the word of the 
EZK.14.3	Son of man, these men have caused their uncleanness to come up over their heart and have established the stumblingblock of their iniquity before their face: should I be enquired of at all by them?
EZK.14.4	Therefore speak unto them and say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Every man of the house of Israel that sets up his idols in his heart and has established the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and comes to the prophet, I, the 
EZK.14.5	that I may take the house of Israel in their own heart, because they are all estranged from me through their idols.
EZK.14.6	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Repent and cause them to repent from your idols and turn away your faces from all your abominations.
EZK.14.7	For any man of the house of Israel or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel who has separated himself from walking after me and has set up his idols in his heart and has established the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face and comes to the prophet to enquire of him concerning me, I, the 
EZK.14.8	and I will set my face against that man and will set him up for a sign and for sayings, and I will cut him off from among my people; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.14.9	And the prophet when he is deceived and speaks a word, I the 
EZK.14.10	And they shall bear the punishment of their iniquity; the iniquity of the prophet shall be even as the iniquity of him that seeks unto him
EZK.14.11	that the house of Israel may no longer go astray from me, neither be polluted any longer in all their rebellions but that they may be my people, and I may be their God, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.14.12	The word of the 
EZK.14.13	Son of man, when the land sins against me by rebelling blatantly and I stretch out my hand upon her and break the staff of the bread thereof and send famine upon her and cut off man and beast out of her
EZK.14.14	though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in the midst of her, they should deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.14.15	If I cause an evil beast to pass through the land and destroy her so that it be desolate that there be no one to pass through because of the beast
EZK.14.16	though these three men were in the midst of her, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither their sons nor their daughters; they only shall be delivered, and the land shall be destroyed.
EZK.14.17	Or if I bring a sword upon the land and say: Sword, go through the land; so that I cut off man and beast out of her;
EZK.14.18	though these three men were in the midst of her, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither their sons nor their daughters, but they only shall be delivered themselves.
EZK.14.19	Or if I send a pestilence into that land and pour out my fury upon her in blood to cut off out of her man and beast
EZK.14.20	though Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in the midst of her, as I live, said the Lord GOD, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter; they shall but deliver their own souls by their righteousness.
EZK.14.21	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: How much more if I send my four sore judgments against Jerusalem: the sword, the famine, the evil beast, the pestilence, to cut off out of her man and beast?
EZK.14.22	Yet, behold, there shall be left a remnant in her, of whom shall be taken captive your sons and daughters; they shall be taken away: behold, they shall come forth unto you, and ye shall see their way and their doings; and ye shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought upon her.
EZK.14.23	And they shall comfort you when ye see their ways and their doings and ye shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in her, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.15.1	And the word of the 
EZK.15.2	Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree? What is the branch among the trees of the forest?
EZK.15.3	Shall wood be taken from it to do a work? Will men take a peg from it to hang any vessel thereon?
EZK.15.4	Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devours both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?
EZK.15.5	Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work; how much less afterward shall it be meet for any work when the fire has devoured it, and it is burned?
EZK.15.6	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: As the vine tree among the trees of the forest which I have given to the fire for fuel, so I have given over the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
EZK.15.7	And I will set my face against them; they came out of one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.15.8	And I will make the land desolate because they have completely rebelled, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.16.1	Again the word of the 
EZK.16.2	Son of man, notify Jerusalem of her abominations
EZK.16.3	and say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said concerning Jerusalem: Thy habitation and thy race was of the land of Canaan; thy father was an Amorite and thy mother a Hittite.
EZK.16.4	And as for thy nativity, in the day thou wast born thy navel was not cut, neither wast thou washed in water to supple thee; thou wast not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.
EZK.16.5	No eye pitied thee, to do any of these unto thee, to have mercy upon thee; but thou wast cast out in the open field with little value given to thy life, in the day that thou wast born.
EZK.16.6	I passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, and I said unto thee, In thy blood thou shalt live; yea, I said unto thee, In thy blood thou shalt live.
EZK.16.7	In ten thousands, as the grass of the field, have I placed thee, and thou wast increased and made great, and thou art come to be adorned with excellent ornaments; thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair is grown; but thou wast naked and bare.
EZK.16.8	And I passed by thee and looked upon thee; behold, thy time was the time of love; and I spread my mantle over thee and covered thy shame; and I gave thee an oath and entered into a covenant with thee, said the Lord GOD, and thou becamest mine;
EZK.16.9	and I washed thee with water and washed away thy blood from upon thee, and I anointed thee with oil.
EZK.16.10	I clothed thee also with broidered work and shod thee with badgers’ skin, and I girded thee about with fine linen, and I clothed thee with silk.
EZK.16.11	I decked thee also with ornaments, and I put bracelets upon thy arms and a chain on thy neck.
EZK.16.12	And I put nose rings upon thy nostrils and earrings in thine ears and a diadem of beauty upon thine head.
EZK.16.13	Thus wast thou decked with gold and silver; and thy raiment was of fine linen and silk and broidered work; thou didst eat fine flour of wheat and honey and oil: and thou wast made exceeding beautiful, and thou hast prospered even until thou hast reigned.
EZK.16.14	And thy renown went forth among the Gentiles for thy beauty; for it was perfect because of my beauty which I placed upon thee, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.16.15	But thou didst trust in thine own beauty and didst play the harlot because of thy renown and didst pour out thy fornications on every one that passed by; thou wert his.
EZK.16.16	And of thy garments thou didst take and make altars of divers colours and play the harlot thereupon; the like shall not come again, neither shall it be so.
EZK.16.17	Thou hast taken likewise the vessels of thy beauty of my gold and of my silver, which I had given thee and made to thyself images of men and didst commit whoredom with them
EZK.16.18	And thou didst take thy garments of many colours and cover them; and thou hast set my oil and my incense before them.
EZK.16.19	My bread also which I had given thee; the fine flour and the oil and the honey with which I fed thee, thou hast even set it before them for a sweet savour; and thus it was, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.16.20	Moreover thou hast taken thy sons and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne unto me, and these thou hast sacrificed unto them to be devoured. Is this of thy whoredoms a small matter,
EZK.16.21	that thou hast sacrificed my children and given them over to them that they might cause them to pass through the fire unto them?
EZK.16.22	And in all thine abominations and thy whoredoms hast thou not remembered the days of thy youth when thou wast naked and bare? Thou wast polluted in thy blood.
EZK.16.23	And it came to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe unto thee! said the Lord GOD)
EZK.16.24	that thou hast also built unto thee a high place and hast made thee an altar in every street.
EZK.16.25	Thou hast built thy altar at every head of every way and hast made thy beauty abominable and hast opened thy thighs to every one that passed by and multiplied thy whoredoms.
EZK.16.26	Thou hast also committed fornication with the sons of Egypt, thy neighbours, great of flesh, and hast increased thy whoredoms, to provoke me to anger.
EZK.16.27	Behold, therefore I have stretched out my hand over thee and have diminished thy liberty and delivered thee unto the will of those that hate thee, the daughters of the Philistines, who are ashamed of thy lewd way.
EZK.16.28	Thou hast played the whore also with the sons of Assyria because thou wast insatiable; thou hast played the harlot with them and yet could not be satisfied.
EZK.16.29	Thou hast likewise multiplied thy fornication in the land of Canaan and of the Chaldeans, and yet thou wast not satisfied with this.
EZK.16.30	How inconsistent is thy heart, said the Lord GOD, having done all these things, the work of a powerful harlot:
EZK.16.31	building thine altars at the head of every way and making thine altars in every street! And thou hast not been as a harlot in that thou scornest hire,
EZK.16.32	but as a wife that commits adultery, who takes strangers instead of her husband!
EZK.16.33	They give gifts to all whores, but thou givest thy gifts to all thy lovers and givest them offerings that they may come unto thee on every side for thy whoredom.
EZK.16.34	And in thee it is to the contrary from other women in thy whoredoms; and after thee, there shall never be whoredom like unto thine because in giving thy gifts when gifts are not given unto thee, it has been backwards.
EZK.16.35	Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the 
EZK.16.36	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because thy nakedness has been uncovered, and thy confusion has been manifested to thy lovers in thy whoredoms and to the idols of thy abominations and in the blood of thy children which thou didst give unto them;
EZK.16.37	therefore, behold that I will gather all thy lovers, with whom thou hast taken pleasure and all those that thou hast loved, with all those that thou hast hated; I will even gather them round about against thee and will uncover thy nakedness unto them, that they may see all thy nakedness.
EZK.16.38	And I will judge thee by the laws regarding women who commit adultery and those that shed blood; and I will give thee away in blood of fury and of jealousy.
EZK.16.39	And I will deliver thee into their hand, and they shall destroy thy high place and shall break down thy altars; they shall strip thee also of thy clothes and shall take the vessels of thy glory and shall leave thee naked and bare.
EZK.16.40	They shall also bring up a company against thee, and they shall stone thee with stones and thrust thee through with their swords.
EZK.16.41	And they shall burn thine houses with fire and execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women; and I will cause thee to cease from playing the harlot, and thou also shalt give no hire any more.
EZK.16.42	So will I make my fury toward thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee, and I will be quiet and will no longer be angry.
EZK.16.43	Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth but hast provoked me to anger in all this; therefore, behold I also have recompensed thy way upon thine head, said the Lord GOD; for thou hast not even thought regarding all thine abominations.
EZK.16.44	Behold, every one that makes proverbs shall make this proverb regarding thee, saying: As is the mother so is her daughter.
EZK.16.45	Thou art thy mother’s daughter that discarded her husband and her children; and thou art the sister of thy sisters who discarded their husbands and their children: your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
EZK.16.46	And thine elder sister is Samaria with her daughters that dwell at thy left hand; and thy younger sister that dwells at thy right hand is Sodom with her daughters.
EZK.16.47	Yet thou hast not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations; but, as if that were a very little thing, thou wast corrupted more than they in all thy ways.
EZK.16.48	As I live, said the Lord GOD, Sodom thy sister has never done, she nor her daughters, as thou hast done, thou and thy daughters.
EZK.16.49	Behold, this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom: pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the afflicted and needy.
EZK.16.50	And they filled themselves with arrogance and committed abomination before me, and when I saw it, I took them away.
EZK.16.51	Neither has Samaria committed half of thy sins, but thou hast multiplied thy abominations more than they and hast justified thy sisters with all thy abominations which thou hast done.
EZK.16.52	Thou also, who hast judged thy sisters, bear thine own shame for thy sins that thou hast committed more abominable than they; they are more righteous than thou; be thou confounded also and bear thy shame in that thou hast justified thy sisters.
EZK.16.53	When I shall turn their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then I will release the captivity of thy captives in the midst of them:
EZK.16.54	that thou may bear thine own shame and may be confounded in all that thou hast done, in that thou art a comfort unto them.
EZK.16.55	When thy sisters, Sodom and her daughters shall return to their first state, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their first state, thou and thy daughters shall return to your first state.
EZK.16.56	Sodom, thy sister was not mentioned by thy mouth in the time of thy pride,
EZK.16.57	before thy wickedness discovered itself, as at the time of the reproach of the daughters of Syria and of all the daughters of the Philistines round about, who despise thee in everything.
EZK.16.58	Thou hast borne thy lewdness and thine abominations, said the 
EZK.16.59	For thus hath the Lord GOD said: Will I deal with thee even as thou hast done, despising the oath to invalidate the covenant?
EZK.16.60	Nevertheless I will remember my covenant that I made with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will confirm unto thee an everlasting covenant.
EZK.16.61	Then thou shalt remember thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger: and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant.
EZK.16.62	And I will confirm my covenant with thee; and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.16.63	that thou may remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified toward thee for all that thou hast done, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.17.1	And the word of the 
EZK.17.2	Son of man, propose a figure and compose an enigma unto the house of Israel
EZK.17.3	and say: Thus hath the Lord GOD said, A great eagle with great wings and long members, full of feathers of diverse colours, came unto Lebanon and took the highest branch of the cedar:
EZK.17.4	he cropped off the principal shoot and carried it into a land of markets; he set it in the city of the merchants.
EZK.17.5	He also took of the seed of the land and planted it in a fruitful field; he placed it by great waters and set it as a willow tree.
EZK.17.6	And it grew and became a vine of many branches, low of stature, whose branches looked at him, and its roots were under him: so it became a vine and brought forth branches and shot forth sprigs.
EZK.17.7	There was also another great eagle with great wings and many feathers; and, behold, this vine joined her roots toward him and extended her branches toward him that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation.
EZK.17.8	It was planted in a good soil by many waters that it might bring forth branches and that it might bear fruit, that it might be a goodly vine.
EZK.17.9	Say thou: Thus hath the Lord GOD said, Shall it be prospered? Shall he not pull it up its roots and destroy its fruit and let it wither? All of the leaves of her spring shall wither, even without great power or many people plucking it up by its roots.
EZK.17.10	Yea, behold, being planted, shall it be prospered? Shall it not utterly wither when the east wind touches it? It shall wither in the furrows where it grew.
EZK.17.11	And the word of the 
EZK.17.12	Say now to the rebellious house: Do ye not know what these things mean? Tell them, Behold, the king of Babylon is come to Jerusalem and has taken its king and its princes and led them with him to Babylon;
EZK.17.13	and has taken of the seed of the kingdom and made a covenant with him and has brought him to an oath: he has also taken the mighty of the land:
EZK.17.14	that the kingdom might be cast down, that it might not lift itself up, but that it might keep his covenant and stay in her.
EZK.17.15	But he rebelled against him in sending his ambassadors unto Egypt, that they might give him horses and much people. Shall he be prospered, shall he that does such things escape? And shall he who broke the covenant be able to flee?
EZK.17.16	As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely in the place where the king dwells that made him king, whose oath he despised and whose covenant he broke, even with him in the midst of Babylon, he shall die.
EZK.17.17	And not with a mighty army, nor with a great company shall Pharaoh do anything for him in the battle when they cast up mounts, and build forts to cut off many lives:
EZK.17.18	seeing he despised the oath to invalidate the covenant when, behold, he had given his hand and has done all these things, he shall not escape.
EZK.17.19	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: As I live, surely my oath that he has despised and my covenant that he has broken, even it will I turn upon his own head.
EZK.17.20	And I will spread my net upon him and he shall be taken in my snare, and I will bring him to Babylon and will enter into judgment with him there for his trespass with which he has rebelled against me.
EZK.17.21	And all his fugitives with all his armies shall fall by the sword, and those that remain shall be scattered toward all winds; and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.17.22	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will also take of the highest branch of that high cedar and will set it up; I will crop off from the principal branch a shoot and will plant it upon the high and sublime mountain:
EZK.17.23	in the high mountain of Israel I will plant it, and it shall bring forth boughs and bear fruit and become a magnificent cedar; and under it shall dwell every fowl; everything that flies shall dwell in the shadow of its branches.
EZK.17.24	And all the trees of the field shall know that I the 
EZK.18.1	The word of the 
EZK.18.2	What mean ye, that ye use this saying concerning the land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes and the children’s teeth are set on edge?
EZK.18.3	As I live, said the Lord GOD, ye shall never again have reason to use this saying in Israel.
EZK.18.4	Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine; the soul that sins, it shall die.
EZK.18.5	But if a man is just and does judgment and righteousness,
EZK.18.6	that he does not eat upon the mountains, neither lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither defile his neighbour’s wife, neither come near to the menstruous woman,
EZK.18.7	neither oppress any, but restores to the debtor his pledge, does not commit robbery, gives his bread to the hungry, and covers the naked with a garment,
EZK.18.8	neither lends at interest, neither takes any increase, withdraws his hand from iniquity, executes true judgment between man and man,
EZK.18.9	walks in my statutes, and keeps my rights, to do according to the truth: he is just; he shall surely live, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.18.10	If he begets a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that does the like of any one of these things,
EZK.18.11	and that does not do any of those duties, but, on the other hand, he does eat upon the mountains, or defiles his neighbour’s wife,
EZK.18.12	oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, or lifts up his eyes to the idols, or makes an abomination,
EZK.18.13	gives forth upon usury and takes increase, shall he then live? He shall not live; he has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
EZK.18.14	But if he begets a son that sees all his father’s sins which he has done and seeing them, does not do according to them,
EZK.18.15	that he does not eat upon the mountains, neither lifts up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, nor defiles his neighbour’s wife,
EZK.18.16	neither oppresses any, nor withholds the pledge, neither commits robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry, and covers the naked with a garment,
EZK.18.17	takes off his hand from oppressing the poor, does not receive usury nor increase, acts according to my rights, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father; he shall surely live.
EZK.18.18	As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, behold, even he shall die for his iniquity.
EZK.18.19	Yet if ye say, Why does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? Because the son has lived according to judgment and righteousness and has kept all my statutes and has done them, he shall surely live.
EZK.18.20	The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him who is righteous, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him who is wicked.
EZK.18.21	But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he has committed and keep all my statutes and live according to judgment and righteousness, he shall surely live, he shall not die.
EZK.18.22	All his rebellions that he has committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him; by his righteousness that he has done he shall live.
EZK.18.23	Do I desire perchance the death of the wicked? said the Lord GOD, Shall he not live if he should leave his ways?
EZK.18.24	But if the righteous should leave his righteousness and commit iniquity, and do according to all the abominations that the wicked man does, shall he live? All his righteousness that he has done shall not be mentioned; by his rebellion in which he has trespassed and by his sin which he has committed, because of them he shall die.
EZK.18.25	And if ye say, The way of the Lord is not straight. Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not straight? Are not your ways crooked?
EZK.18.26	When a righteous man leaves his righteousness, and commits iniquity, he shall die in it; for his iniquity that he has done he shall die.
EZK.18.27	Again, when the wicked man leaves his wickedness that he has committed and lives according to judgment and righteousness, he shall cause his soul to live.
EZK.18.28	Because he saw and left all his rebellions that he has committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die.
EZK.18.29	If even now the house of Israel should say, The way of the Lord is not straight. O house of Israel, are not my ways straight? Certainly your ways are not straight.
EZK.18.30	Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each one according to his ways, said the Lord GOD. Repent and turn yourselves from all your iniquities, so iniquity shall not be your ruin.
EZK.18.31	Cast away from you all your iniquities by which ye have rebelled, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
EZK.18.32	For I do not desire the death of him that dies, said the Lord GOD; therefore turn yourselves, and ye shall live.
EZK.19.1	And take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,
EZK.19.2	and thou shalt say, How hast thy mother, the lioness, lain down among the lions? She raised her whelps among the young lions.
EZK.19.3	And she brought up one of her whelps; it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey and to devour men.
EZK.19.4	The Gentiles also heard of him; he was taken in their trap, and they brought him with chains unto the land of Egypt.
EZK.19.5	Now when she saw that she had waited a long time and her hope was being lost, then she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion.
EZK.19.6	And he went up and down among the lions; he became a young lion and learned to catch the prey and devoured men.
EZK.19.7	And he knew their widows, and he laid waste their cities; and the land was desolate, and the fullness thereof, by the voice of his roaring.
EZK.19.8	Then the Gentiles set against him on every side from the provinces and spread their net over him: he was taken in their pit.
EZK.19.9	And they put him in prison in chains and brought him to the king of Babylon: they brought him into fortresses that his voice should no longer be heard upon the mountains of Israel.
EZK.19.10	Thy mother was like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters, bearing fruit and spreading forth branches by reason of the many waters.
EZK.19.11	And she had strong rods for the sceptres of those that bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height and with the multitude of her branches.
EZK.19.12	But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the east wind dried up her fruit; her branches were broken, and she withered; fire consumed the rod of her strength.
EZK.19.13	And now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty ground.
EZK.19.14	And fire is gone out of the rod from her branches, which has devoured her fruit, so that no strong rod to be a sceptre to rule has remained in her. This is a lamentation and shall be for a lamentation.
EZK.20.1	And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month, that certain of the elders of Israel came to enquire of the 
EZK.20.2	Then came the word of the 
EZK.20.3	Son of man, speak unto the elders of Israel and say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Are ye come to enquire of me? As I live, said the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
EZK.20.4	Dost thou desire to judge them? Dost thou desire to judge them, son of man? Notify them of the abominations of their fathers:
EZK.20.5	And say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said; In the day when I chose Israel and lifted up my hand for the seed of the house of Jacob and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt when I lifted up my hand unto them, saying, I am the 
EZK.20.6	in the day that I lifted up my hand unto them with an oath that I would bring them forth from the land of Egypt into a land that I had prepared for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the most beautiful of all lands,
EZK.20.7	then said I unto them, Cast away each one of you all worship of god fabricated by carnal appearance and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the 
EZK.20.8	But they rebelled against me and did not desire to hearken unto me; each one did not cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt; then I said, I will pour out my fury upon them, to accomplish my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.
EZK.20.9	With all this, I intervened for my name’s sake that it should not be polluted before the Gentiles, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known unto them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.
EZK.20.10	Therefore I took them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness;
EZK.20.11	and I gave them my statutes and declared unto them my rights, by which the man that does them shall live by them.
EZK.20.12	And I also gave them my sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the 
EZK.20.13	But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they did not walk in my statutes, and they despised my rights, by which the man that does them shall live by them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted; therefore I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them.
EZK.20.14	But I intervened for my name’s sake, that it should not be polluted before the Gentiles, in whose sight I brought them out.
EZK.20.15	Yet I also lifted up my hand unto them in the wilderness, with an oath that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the most beautiful of all lands,
EZK.20.16	because they despised my rights and did not walk in my statutes but polluted my Sabbaths, for their heart went after their idols.
EZK.20.17	With all this, my eye spared them from destroying them, neither did I make an end of them in the wilderness.
EZK.20.18	But I said unto their sons in the wilderness: Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, neither keep their laws, nor defile yourselves with their idols:
EZK.20.19	I am the 
EZK.20.20	and hallow my sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the 
EZK.20.21	Notwithstanding, the sons rebelled against me: they did not walk in my statutes, nor keep my rights to do them, by which the man that does them shall live by them; they polluted my Sabbaths; then I said: I would pour out my fury upon them to accomplish my anger against them in the wilderness.
EZK.20.22	Nevertheless, I withdrew my hand and intervened for my name’s sake that it should not be polluted in the sight of the Gentiles in whose sight I brought them forth.
EZK.20.23	I lifted up my hand unto them also in the wilderness with an oath that I would scatter them among the Gentiles and disperse them through the countries
EZK.20.24	because they had not executed my rights and had despised my statutes and had polluted my sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers’ idols.
EZK.20.25	For this reason I also gave them statutes that were not good and rights by which they could not live,
EZK.20.26	and I polluted them in their offerings when they caused to pass through the fire all that opens the womb that I might make them desolate, to the end that they might know that I am the 
EZK.20.27	Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel and say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Even in this your fathers have blasphemed me when they committed rebellion against me.
EZK.20.28	For when I had brought them into the land, for which I lifted up my hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented the provocation of their offerings; there also they made their sweet savour and poured out there their drink offerings.
EZK.20.29	Then I said unto them, What is the high place unto which ye go? And its name is called Bamah unto this day.
EZK.20.30	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Perchance are ye polluted after the manner of your fathers? and do ye commit whoredom after their abominations?
EZK.20.31	For when ye offer your gifts, when ye make your sons to pass through the fire, ye pollute yourselves with all your idols, even unto this day; and shall I be enquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, said the Lord GOD, I will not be enquired of by you.
EZK.20.32	And that which ye think shall not be at all, that ye say, We will be as the Gentiles, as the families of the nations to serve wood and stone.
EZK.20.33	As I live, said the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out, I must rule over you:
EZK.20.34	and I will bring you out from among the peoples and will gather you out of the countries in which ye are scattered with a mighty hand and with a stretched out arm and with fury poured out.
EZK.20.35	And I will bring you into the wilderness of peoples, and there I will litigate with you face to face.
EZK.20.36	Like as I litigated with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will litigate with you, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.20.37	And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and I will bring you into the bond of the covenant:
EZK.20.38	and I will purge out from among you the rebels and those that rebelled against me; I will take them out of the country where they have gone, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.39	As for you, O house of Israel, thus hath the Lord GOD said: Go, serve ye each one his idols, and hereafter also, if ye will not hearken unto me, but do not pollute my holy name any longer with your gifts and with your idols.
EZK.20.40	For in the mountain of my holiness, in the high mountain of Israel, said the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel serve me, all of them in the land; there will I be pleased with them, and there will I require your offerings and the firstfruits of your gifts with all your sacred things.
EZK.20.41	I will accept you with your sweet savour when I have brought you out from among the peoples and gathered you out of the countries in which ye have been scattered; and I will be sanctified in you in the eyes of the Gentiles.
EZK.20.42	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.43	And there ye shall remember your ways and all your doings, in which ye have been defiled; and ye shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that ye have committed.
EZK.20.44	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.20.45	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.20.46	Son of man, set thy face toward the south and drop thy word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;
EZK.20.47	and thou shalt say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the 
EZK.20.48	And all flesh shall see that I the 
EZK.20.49	Then I said, Ah Lord GOD! they say of me, Does he not speak parables?
EZK.21.1	And the word of the 
EZK.21.2	Son of man, set thy face against Jerusalem, and drop my word upon the sanctuaries, and prophesy over the land of Israel,
EZK.21.3	and thou shalt say to the land of Israel, Thus hath the 
EZK.21.4	Seeing then that I will cut off from thee the righteous and the wicked therefore shall my sword go forth out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:
EZK.21.5	that all flesh may know that I the 
EZK.21.6	Cry out therefore, thou son of man, with the breaking of thy loins; and with bitterness cry out before their eyes.
EZK.21.7	And it shall be, when they say unto thee, Why criest thou? that thou shalt answer, For the tidings that come; and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be feeble, and every spirit shall faint; and all knees shall be weak as water: behold, it comes and shall be brought to pass, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.21.8	Again the word of the 
EZK.21.9	Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus hath the 
EZK.21.10	it is sharpened to slay victims; it is furbished that it may glitter; should we then make mirth? it despises the rod of my son, as every tree.
EZK.21.11	And he has given it to be furbished, that it may be handled; this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, to give it into the hand of the slayer.
EZK.21.12	Cry and howl, son of man, for it shall be upon my people; it shall be upon all the princes of Israel; fear of the sword shall be upon my people; therefore smite the thigh
EZK.21.13	because it shall be a trial. What shall be if it does not despise the rod? said the Lord GOD.
EZK.21.14	Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy and smite thine hands together, and let the sword be doubled the third time, the sword of the slain; this is the sword of great slaughter that shall pierce them.
EZK.21.15	I have set the fear of the sword in all their gates, that their heart may faint and their ruins be multiplied; ah! it is made so that it might shine; it is prepared for the slaughter.
EZK.21.16	Go one way or other, either on the right hand or on the left, wherever thy face is set.
EZK.21.17	I will also smite my hands together, and I will cause my fury to rest; I the 
EZK.21.18	The word of the 
EZK.21.19	Also, thou son of man, show two ways from where the sword of the king of Babylon comes: both shall come forth out of the same land and draw an army; at the head of the way to the city thou shalt do this.
EZK.21.20	Show the way that the sword will come to Rabbath of the Ammonites and to Judah against Jerusalem, the defenced.
EZK.21.21	For the king of Babylon stood at the parting of the way at the head of the two ways to use divination; he made his arrows bright; he consulted with images; he looked in the liver.
EZK.21.22	The divination was to his right hand upon Jerusalem, to appoint captains, to open the mouth for the slaughter, to lift up the voice with shouting, to appoint battering rams against the gates, to cast a mount, and to build a fort.
EZK.21.23	And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight, to those that have sworn oaths; but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken.
EZK.21.24	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered, manifesting your betrayals and uncovering your sins in all your doings; for which ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand.
EZK.21.25	And thou, profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come in the time when the iniquity shall be brought to an end,
EZK.21.26	thus hath the Lord GOD said: Remove the diadem and take off the crown; it shall no longer be like this; I will exalt the one that is low and abase the one that is high.
EZK.21.27	I will overturn, overturn, overturn, it, and it shall be no more until he comes whose right it is; and I will give it unto him.
EZK.21.28	And thou, son of man, prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning the Ammonites and concerning their reproach; even say thou, The sword, the sword is drawn for the slaughter; it is furbished to consume with brightness:
EZK.21.29	They prophesy vanity unto thee; they divine a lie unto thee, to give thee over among the necks of the wicked who are sentenced to death, whose day is come in the time when the iniquity shall be brought to an end.
EZK.21.30	Shall I cause it to return into its sheath? I must judge thee in the place where thou wast raised, in the land of where thou hast lived.
EZK.21.31	And I will pour out my indignation upon thee; I will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath and deliver thee into the hand of fearful men who are skilful to destroy.
EZK.21.32	Thou shalt be for fuel to the fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of the land; thou shalt no longer be remembered: for I the 
EZK.22.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.22.2	Now, thou son of man, wilt thou not judge, wilt thou not judge the city that spills innocent blood and cause her to know all her abominations?
EZK.22.3	Then thou shalt say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said, City that sheds blood in the midst of thyself, that thy time may come, and that has made idols against thyself to defile thyself!
EZK.22.4	In thy blood that thou hast shed thou hast sinned and hast defiled thyself with thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near and art come even unto thy years; therefore I have given thee in reproach unto the Gentiles, and in shame unto all the countries.
EZK.22.5	Those that are near and those that are far from thee shall mock thee, who art infamous and much vexed.
EZK.22.6	Behold, the princes of Israel, each one according to their power, were in thee to shed blood.
EZK.22.7	In thee they have despised father and mother; in the midst of thee they have dealt by oppression with the stranger; in thee they have vexed the fatherless and the widow.
EZK.22.8	Thou hast despised my holy things and hast profaned my sabbaths.
EZK.22.9	In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood; and in thee they eat upon the mountains; in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.
EZK.22.10	In thee they have discovered their fathers’ nakedness; in thee they have forced the unclean menstruous woman.
EZK.22.11	And one has committed abomination with his neighbour’s wife; and another has lewdly defiled his daughter-in-law; and another in thee has forced his sister, his father’s daughter.
EZK.22.12	In thee they have taken bribes to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion and hast forgotten me, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.22.13	Behold, therefore I have smitten my hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made and at thy blood which has been in the midst of thee.
EZK.22.14	Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the 
EZK.22.15	And I will scatter thee among the Gentiles and disperse thee in the countries and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
EZK.22.16	And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the Gentiles, and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.22.17	And the word of the 
EZK.22.18	Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross; they are all brass and tin and iron and lead in the midst of the furnace; they are become the dross of silver.
EZK.22.19	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
EZK.22.20	As they gather silver and brass and iron and lead and tin into the midst of the furnace to blow the fire upon it to melt it, so will I gather you in my anger and in my fury, and I will cause you to rest, and melt you.
EZK.22.21	I will gather you and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
EZK.22.22	As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the 
EZK.22.23	And the word of the 
EZK.22.24	Son of man, say unto her, Thou art not clean land, nor art thou sprinkled with rain in the day of indignation.
EZK.22.25	There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken treasures and honour; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
EZK.22.26	Her priests have violated my law by force and have profaned my holy things; they have made no difference between the holy and the profane, neither have they showed the difference between the unclean and the clean and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
EZK.22.27	Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to follow their own greed.
EZK.22.28	And her prophets have plastered them over with loose mud, prophesying vanity and divining lies unto them, saying: Thus hath the Lord GOD said, when the 
EZK.22.29	The people of the land have used oppression and exercised robbery and have done violence unto the poor and needy; they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
EZK.22.30	And I sought for a man among them that should make up the hedge and stand in the gap before me for the land that I should not destroy it, but I found no one.
EZK.22.31	Therefore have I poured out my indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath; I have recompensed their own way upon their heads, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.23.1	The word of the 
EZK.23.2	Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:
EZK.23.3	And they committed whoredoms in Egypt; they committed whoredoms in their youth; there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.
EZK.23.4	And the names of them were Aholah the elder and Aholibah her sister; they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus were their names: Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.
EZK.23.5	And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she fell in love with her lovers, the Assyrians her neighbours,
EZK.23.6	which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.
EZK.23.7	Thus she committed her whoredoms with them, with all those that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all whom she fell in love; with all their idols she defiled herself.
EZK.23.8	Neither did she leave her whoredoms of Egypt; for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity and poured their whoredom upon her.
EZK.23.9	Therefore I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, of whom she fell in love.
EZK.23.10	These uncovered her nakedness; they took her sons and her daughters and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women, for they had executed judgments upon her.
EZK.23.11	And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her whoredoms more than her sister in her whoredoms.
EZK.23.12	She fell in love with the Assyrians her neighbours, captains and rulers clothed to perfection, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.
EZK.23.13	Then I saw that she was defiled, that they both took the same way
EZK.23.14	and that she increased her whoredoms, for when she saw men painted upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans painted in colour,
EZK.23.15	girded with girdles upon their loins, and mitres painted upon their heads, all of them looking like princes, after the manner of the men of Babylon, born in the land of the Chaldeans,
EZK.23.16	she fell in love with them as soon as she saw them with her eyes and sent messengers unto them into Chaldea.
EZK.23.17	And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their whoredom and she was polluted with them, and her soul was disjointed from them.
EZK.23.18	So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness; then my soul was alienated from her, like as my soul was alienated from her sister.
EZK.23.19	Yet she multiplied her whoredoms in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.
EZK.23.20	For she doted upon their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses and whose issue is like the issue of horses.
EZK.23.21	Thus thou didst call to remembrance the lewdness of thy youth, in bruising thy teats by the Egyptians for the breasts of thy youth.
EZK.23.22	Therefore, O Aholibah, thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I will raise up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy desire is alienated, and I will bring them against thee on every side:
EZK.23.23	the Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, rulers, and princes, and captains, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men; all of them captains and rulers, great lords and renowned; all of them riding upon horses.
EZK.23.24	And they shall come against thee with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with a multitude of peoples, which shall set against thee buckler and shield and helmet round about, and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee according to their laws.
EZK.23.25	And I will set my jealousy against thee, and they shall deal with thee in furor; they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and what is left shall fall by the sword; they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy remnant shall be devoured by the fire.
EZK.23.26	They shall also strip thee out of thy clothes and take away the vessels of thy glory.
EZK.23.27	Thus will I make thy lewdness to cease from thee and thy whoredom of the land of Egypt, so that thou shalt not lift up thine eyes unto them, nor remember Egypt any more.
EZK.23.28	For thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I deliver thee into the hand of those whom thou hatest, into the hand of those from whom thy soul is alienated:
EZK.23.29	And they shall deal with thee hatefully and shall take away all thy labour, and shall leave thee naked and bare: and the nakedness of thy whoredoms shall be uncovered, both thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
EZK.23.30	I will do these things unto thee because thou hast gone a whoring after the Gentiles and because thou art polluted with their idols.
EZK.23.31	Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister; therefore I will put her cup into thine hand.
EZK.23.32	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Thou shalt drink of thy sister’s cup deep and large; the Gentiles shall laugh thee to scorn and hold thee in derision; it contains much.
EZK.23.33	Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness and with pain because of the cup of astonishment and desolation, because of the cup of thy sister Samaria.
EZK.23.34	Thou shalt even drink it and finish it, and thou shalt break its shards and pluck off thine own breasts: for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.23.35	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because thou hast forgotten me and cast me behind thy back, therefore bear thou also thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.
EZK.23.36	And The 
EZK.23.37	For they have committed adultery, and blood is on their hands, and with their idols they have committed adultery and have even caused their sons, whom they bore unto me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.
EZK.23.38	Moreover this they have done unto me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day and have profaned my sabbaths.
EZK.23.39	For when they had slain their sons unto their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, behold, thus have they done in the midst of my house.
EZK.23.40	And furthermore, that ye have sent for men to come from far, unto whom a messenger was sent; and, behold, they came for the love of whom thou didst wash thyself, paint thy eyes, and deck thyself with ornaments,
EZK.23.41	and sit upon a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, upon which thou hast set my incense and my oil.
EZK.23.42	And in her was heard a voice of a multitude at a feast; and with the men of renown were brought the Sabeans from the wilderness to multiply the men, and they put bracelets upon their hands and crowns of glory upon their heads.
EZK.23.43	Then said I unto her that was old in adulteries, Now shalt thy whoredoms come to an end, and she with them;
EZK.23.44	for they have come to her, as those who come to a woman that plays the harlot, so they went in unto Aholah and unto Aholibah, the lewd women.
EZK.23.45	Therefore righteous men shall judge them by the law of adulteresses and after the law of women that shed blood because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.
EZK.23.46	For thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will bring up a company upon them and will give them to be removed and spoiled.
EZK.23.47	And the company shall stone them with stones and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters and burn up their houses with fire.
EZK.23.48	Thus will I cause the lust to cease out of the land that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.
EZK.23.49	And they shall recompense your lust upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols; and ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
EZK.24.1	Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.24.2	Son of man, write the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon laid siege against Jerusalem this same day.
EZK.24.3	And speak unto the house of rebellion by parable and say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:
EZK.24.4	gather her pieces of meat into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
EZK.24.5	Take the choice of the flock and burn also the bones under it and make it boil well and let them seethe the bones of it therein.
EZK.24.6	For thus hath the Lord GOD said: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein and whose scum is not gone out of it! For her pieces, because of her pieces let it be removed; let no lot fall upon it.
EZK.24.7	For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she did not poured it upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
EZK.24.8	that wrath might rise up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the high place of the rock that it should not be covered.
EZK.24.9	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Woe to the bloody city! I will also make a great fire,
EZK.24.10	multiplying the wood, kindling the fire, to consume the flesh and to make the broth, and the bones shall be burned;
EZK.24.11	setting afterward the empty pot upon the coals thereof that it may become red hot and may burn and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.
EZK.24.12	In fraud she has become weary, and her great scum did not go forth out of her; her scum shall be in the fire.
EZK.24.13	In thy perverse filthiness thou shalt die because I have cleansed thee, and thou didst not cleanse thyself from thy uncleanness; thou shalt never cleanse thyself again, until I have caused my fury to rest upon thee.
EZK.24.14	I, the 
EZK.24.15	And the word of the 
EZK.24.16	Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the desire of thine eyes by death; yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down.
EZK.24.17	Forbear to cry, make no mourning for the dead, bind thy turban upon thy head, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet and do not cover thy lips and do not eat the bread of comfort.
EZK.24.18	So I spoke unto the people in the morning; and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
EZK.24.19	And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are to us, that thou doest so?
EZK.24.20	Then I answered them, The word of the 
EZK.24.21	Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the glory of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and the gift of your soul; your sons and your daughters whom ye have left shall fall by the sword.
EZK.24.22	And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips nor eat the bread of men.
EZK.24.23	And your turbans shall be upon your heads and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep; but ye shall pine away for your iniquities and cry out one with another.
EZK.24.24	Thus Ezekiel shall be unto you for a sign: according to all that he has done ye shall do: and when this comes, ye shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
EZK.24.25	Also, thou son of man, in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and the care of their souls, their sons and their daughters,
EZK.24.26	that day one that escapes shall come unto thee, to bring the news.
EZK.24.27	In that day thy mouth shall be opened to speak unto him who is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and no longer be dumb: and thou shalt be a sign unto them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.25.1	The word of the 
EZK.25.2	Son of man, set thy face against the sons of Ammon and prophesy against them
EZK.25.3	and say unto the sons of Ammon, Hear the word of the Lord GOD, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because thou didst say, Aha, it is well! upon my sanctuary, which was profaned; and upon the land of Israel, which it was made desolate; and upon the house of Judah, because they went into captivity;
EZK.25.4	behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee and pitch their tents in thee; they shall eat thy plantings, and they shall drink thy milk.
EZK.25.5	And I will make Rabbah a habitation for camels and the sons of Ammon a resting place for sheep: and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.25.6	For thus hath the Lord GOD said; Because thou hast clapped thine hands and stamped with the feet and rejoiced in thy soul with all thy despite upon the land of Israel,
EZK.25.7	behold, therefore I will stretch out my hand upon thee and will deliver thee unto the Gentiles as a spoil, and I will cut thee off from among the peoples, and I will destroy thee from among the countries; I will pluck thee out; and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.25.8	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because Moab and Seir said, Behold, the house of the 
EZK.25.9	therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the desirable lands of Bethjeshimoth and Baalmeon and Kiriathaim,
EZK.25.10	unto the sons of the east against the sons of Ammon and will give them in possession that the sons of Ammon may not be remembered any more among the Gentiles.
EZK.25.11	I will also execute judgments in Moab; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.25.12	Thus hath the Lord GOD spoken; Because of what Edom did when he took vengeance against the house of Judah, (for they are condemned as guilty) and revenged themselves upon them;
EZK.25.13	therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will also stretch out my hand upon Edom and will cut off man and beast from her; and I will make her desolate from Teman; and those of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
EZK.25.14	And I will place my vengeance in Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to my anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.25.15	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because the Palestinians have dealt by revenge and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart to destroying because of perpetual enmity,
EZK.25.16	therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said; Behold, I stretch out my hand upon the Palestinians, and I will cut off the Cherethims and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
EZK.25.17	And I will execute great vengeance in them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.26.1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.26.2	Son of man, because Tyre has said concerning Jerusalem, Aha, it is well that she is broken who is the gate of the peoples; she is turned unto me; I shall be filled; and she shall be deserted:
EZK.26.3	therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said; Behold, I am against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against thee as the sea causes its waves to come up.
EZK.26.4	And they shall demolish the walls of Tyre and destroy her towers; I will also scrape her dust from her and make her like the top of a rock.
EZK.26.5	It shall be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea: for I have spoken, said the Lord GOD, and it shall be spoiled by the Gentiles.
EZK.26.6	And her daughters who are in the field shall be slain by the sword; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.26.7	For thus hath the Lord GOD said; Behold, I bring upon Tyre Nebuchadrezzar, king of Babylon, a king of kings, from the north, with horses and with chariots and with horsemen and companies and many people.
EZK.26.8	He shall slay with the sword thy daughters who are in the field; and he shall make a fort against thee and cast a mount against thee and lift up the buckler against thee.
EZK.26.9	And he shall set engines of war against thy walls, and with his hammers he shall break down thy towers.
EZK.26.10	By reason of the abundance of his horses their dust shall cover thee; thy walls shall shake at the noise of the horsemen and of the wheels, and of the chariots when he shall enter into thy gates as men enter through breaches into a destroyed city.
EZK.26.11	With the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy streets; he shall slay thy people by the sword, and the statues of thy strength shall fall to the ground.
EZK.26.12	And they shall steal thy riches and make a spoil of thy merchandise; and they shall ruin thy walls and destroy thy precious houses: and they shall lay thy stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters.
EZK.26.13	And I will cause the noise of thy songs to cease; and the sound of thy harps shall no longer be heard.
EZK.26.14	And I will make thee like the top of a rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou shalt never be built again; for I the 
EZK.26.15	Thus hath the Lord GOD said to Tyre: Certainly the isles shall shake at the sound of thy fall, when the wounded shall cry, when the slaughter shall be made in the midst of thee.
EZK.26.16	Then all the princes of the sea shall come down from their thrones and lay away their robes and put off their broidered garments: they shall clothe themselves with trembling; they shall sit upon the ground and shall tremble at every moment and be astonished at thee.
EZK.26.17	And they shall take up a lamentation for thee and say to thee, How didst thou perish, that wast inhabited in the seas? The renowned city, which wast strong in the sea, she and her inhabitants, who caused their terror to be on all those that dwell therein.
EZK.26.18	Now shall the isles tremble in the day of thy fall; yea, the isles that are in the sea shall be terrorized at thy end.
EZK.26.19	For thus hath the Lord GOD said: I shall make thee a desolate city, like the cities that are not inhabited; I shall cause the abyss to come up over thee and the many waters shall cover thee.
EZK.26.20	And I shall bring thee down with those that descend into the grave, with the people of the age, and shall set thee in the lowest part of the earth, as the deserts of old, with those that go down to the grave, that thou not be inhabited again; and I shall set glory in the land of the living;
EZK.26.21	I will turn thee into nothing, and thou shalt be no more; though thou be sought for, yet thou shalt never be found again, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.27.1	The word of the 
EZK.27.2	Now, thou son of man, raise up lamentations upon Tyre.
EZK.27.3	And say unto Tyre, O thou that dwelleth at the ports of the sea, who art a merchant of the people for many isles, Thus hath the Lord GOD said; O Tyre, thou hast said, I am of perfect beauty.
EZK.27.4	In the heart of the seas are thy border; thy builders have completed thy beauty.
EZK.27.5	They have made all thy ship boards of fir trees of Senir; they have taken cedars from Lebanon to make masts for thee.
EZK.27.6	Of the oaks of Bashan they have made thine oars; the company of the Ashurites have made thy benches of ivory, brought out of the isles of Chittim.
EZK.27.7	Of fine linen with broidered work from Egypt was thy curtain, that it might serve to be thy sail; {Heb. banner}; of blue and purple from the isles of Elishah was thy pavilion.
EZK.27.8	The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy wise men, O Tyre, were in thee; they were thy pilots.
EZK.27.9	The elders of Gebal and the wise men thereof were in thee to repair thy breaches: all the galleys of the sea with their rowers were in thee to negotiate thy business dealings.
EZK.27.10	Those of Persia and of Lud and of Africa were in thine army, thy men of war: they hung the shield and helmet in thee; they extolled thy beauty.
EZK.27.11	The sons of Arvad with thine army were upon thy walls round about, and the Gammadims were in thy towers: they hung their shields upon thy walls round about; they completed thy beauty.
EZK.27.12	Tarshish was thy market by reason of the multitude of all thy riches in silver, iron, tin, and lead; they traded in thy fairs.
EZK.27.13	Greece, Tubal, and Meshech, thy merchants, with the soul of men and with vessels of brass; they traded in thy fairs.
EZK.27.14	Those of the house of Togarmah traded in thy fairs with horses and horsemen and mules.
EZK.27.15	The sons of Dedan were thy merchants; many isles took merchandise from thy hand: they brought thee for a present horns of ivory and peacocks.
EZK.27.16	Syria was thy merchant by reason of the multitude of the wares of thy making: they traded in thy fairs with rubies and purple and broidered work and fine linen and coral and pearls.
EZK.27.17	Judah, and the land of Israel; they were thy merchants: they traded in thy market with wheat, Minnith and Pannag and honey and oil and balm.
EZK.27.18	Damascus was thy merchant in the multitude of the wares of thy making, for the abundance of all riches, with wine of Helbon and white wool.
EZK.27.19	Dan also and Greece and Mozel traded in thy fairs bright iron, cassia, and calamus.
EZK.27.20	Dedan was thy merchant in precious cloth for chariots.
EZK.27.21	Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, merchants of thy strength in lambs and rams and he goats: in these they were thy merchants.
EZK.27.22	The merchants of Sheba and Raamah; they were thy merchants: they traded in thy fairs with the chief of all spices and with all precious stones and gold.
EZK.27.23	Haran and Canneh and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad were in thy market.
EZK.27.24	These, thy merchants, negotiated with thee in all sorts of things: in blue robes and broidered work and in chests of rich apparel, bound with cords and made of cedar, among thy merchandise.
EZK.27.25	The ships of Tarshish, thy squadrons, went forth on thy behalf: and thou wast full, and wast multiplied greatly in the midst of the seas.
EZK.27.26	In many waters they overcame thy rowers; the east wind has broken thee in the midst of the seas.
EZK.27.27	Thy riches, and thy markets, thy business, thy rowers, and thy pilots, those that repair thy breaches, and the agents of thy business, and all thy men of war, that are in thee, with all thy company which is in the midst of thee, shall fall into the midst of the seas in the day of thy ruin.
EZK.27.28	The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.
EZK.27.29	And all that handle the oar, the rowers, and all the pilots of the sea, shall come down from their ships; they shall stand upon the land
EZK.27.30	and shall cause their voice to be heard upon thee and shall cry bitterly and shall cast up dust upon their heads; they shall wallow themselves in the ashes.
EZK.27.31	And they shall pull out their hair for thee and gird themselves with sackcloth, and they shall weep for thee with bitterness of soul and bitter wailings.
EZK.27.32	And in their wailing they shall take up a lamentation for thee and lament over thee, saying, Who is like Tyre, like the destroyed in the midst of the sea?
EZK.27.33	When thy wares went forth out of the seas, thou didst fill many peoples; thou didst enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of thy riches and of thy contracts.
EZK.27.34	In the time when thou shalt be broken by the seas in the depths of the waters thy commerce and all thy company in the midst of thee shall fall.
EZK.27.35	All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at thee, and their kings shall be sore afraid; they shall be troubled in their countenance.
EZK.27.36	The merchants among the peoples shall hiss at thee; thou shalt be a terror and never shalt be any more.
EZK.28.1	The word of the 
EZK.28.2	Son of man, say unto the prince of Tyre, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because thy heart has lifted thee up and thou hast said, I am God, I sit in the seat of God, in the midst of the seas (yet thou art man, and not God); and thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God:
EZK.28.3	behold, thou art wiser than Daniel; there is no secret that they can hide from thee:
EZK.28.4	with thy wisdom and with thine intelligence thou hast gotten thee riches and hast gotten gold and silver into thy treasures:
EZK.28.5	by the greatness of thy wisdom in thy trafficking thou hast multiplied thy riches, and thine heart is lifted up because of thy riches:
EZK.28.6	therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because thou hast set thine heart as the heart of God,
EZK.28.7	behold, therefore I will bring strangers upon thee, the strong ones of the Gentiles, and they shall draw their swords against the beauty of thy wisdom, and they shall defile thy brightness.
EZK.28.8	They shall bring thee down to the pit, and thou shalt die of the death of those that are slain in the midst of the seas.
EZK.28.9	Wilt thou yet say before him that slays thee, I am God? but thou shalt be a man, and not God, in the hand of him that slays thee.
EZK.28.10	Thou shalt die the death of the uncircumcised by the hand of strangers: for I have spoken, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.28.11	And the word of the 
EZK.28.12	Son of man, raise up lamentations upon the king of Tyre and say unto him, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Thou dost seal up the sum of perfection, full of wisdom, and completed in beauty.
EZK.28.13	Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering: the sardius, topaz, diamond, turquoise, onyx, and beryl, the sapphire, ruby, and emerald, and gold; the works of thy tambourines and of thy pipes were prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created.
EZK.28.14	Thou, great cherubim, wast covered, and I placed thee; thou wast in the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked among stones of fire.
EZK.28.15	Thou wast perfect in all thy ways from the day that thou wast created, until iniquity was found in thee.
EZK.28.16	Because of the multitude of thy trafficking thou wast filled with violence, and thou hast sinned; and I cast thee out of the mountain of God, and I cast thee unto evil from among the stones of fire, O cherubim that wast covered.
EZK.28.17	Thine heart lifted thee up because of thy beauty; thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness; I will cast thee to the earth; I will expose thee before the kings, that they may behold thee.
EZK.28.18	Thou hast defiled thy sanctuary by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy trafficking; therefore I brought forth fire from the midst of thee, which has consumed thee, and I brought thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all those that behold thee.
EZK.28.19	All those that knew thee from among the peoples shall marvel over thee; thou hast been greatly disturbed, and thou shalt not exist again forever.
EZK.28.20	And the word of the 
EZK.28.21	Son of man, set thy face against Zidon and prophesy against her
EZK.28.22	and say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I am against thee, O Zidon; and I will be glorified in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.28.23	For I will send into her pestilence and blood into her streets; and the dead shall fall in the midst of her, by the sword upon her on every side; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.28.24	And there shall no longer be a pricking brier unto the house of Israel, nor any thorn that causes him pain, round about them of those that despise them; and they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
EZK.28.25	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the peoples among whom they are scattered and shall be sanctified in them in the eyes of the Gentiles, then they shall dwell in their land that I have given to my slave Jacob.
EZK.28.26	And they shall dwell safely therein and shall build houses and plant vineyards; and they shall dwell with confidence, when I have executed judgments in all those that spoil them round about them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.29.1	In the tenth year, in the tenth month, in the twelfth day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.29.2	Son of man, set thy face against Pharaoh king of Egypt and prophesy against him, and against all Egypt.
EZK.29.3	Speak and say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I am against thee, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers, who has said, My river is my own, and I have made it for myself.
EZK.29.4	But I will put hooks in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy rivers to stick unto thy scales, and I will bring thee up out of the midst of thy rivers, and all the fish of thy rivers shall come out stuck onto thy scales.
EZK.29.5	And I will leave thee thrown into the wilderness, thee and all the fish of thy rivers; thou shalt fall upon the open fields; thou shalt not be brought together, nor gathered; I have given thee for food to the beasts of the field and to the fowls of the heaven.
EZK.29.6	And all the inhabitants of Egypt shall know that I am the 
EZK.29.7	When they took hold of thee by thy hand, thou didst break and rend all their shoulder: and when they leaned upon thee, thou didst brake and make all their loins to come to nothing.
EZK.29.8	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I bring a sword upon thee and will cut off man and beast out of thee.
EZK.29.9	And the land of Egypt shall be made desolate and waste; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.29.10	Behold, therefore I am against thee and against thy rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even unto the border of Ethiopia.
EZK.29.11	No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of beast shall pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
EZK.29.12	And I will make the land of Egypt desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities among the cities that are laid waste shall be desolate forty years: and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and will disperse them through the countries.
EZK.29.13	Yet thus hath the Lord GOD said: At the end of forty years I will gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered.
EZK.29.14	And I will turn to bring again the captives of Egypt and will cause them to return into the land of Pathros into the land of their habitation, and there they shall be a minor kingdom.
EZK.29.15	In comparison with the other kingdoms it shall be humble; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them that they shall no longer rule among the Gentiles.
EZK.29.16	And it shall no longer be the confidence of the house of Israel, which brings their iniquity to remembrance, when they shall look after them, but they shall know that I am the Lord GOD.
EZK.29.17	And it came to pass in the twenty-seventh year, in the first month, in the first day of the month, the word of the 
EZK.29.18	Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: and yet neither he nor his army had wages of Tyre, for the service that he had served against her.
EZK.29.19	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said; Behold, I give the land of Egypt unto Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude and gather her spoil and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
EZK.29.20	I have given him the land of Egypt for his labour with which he served against her because they wrought for me, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.29.21	In that time I will cause the horn of the house of Israel to bud forth, and I will give thee the opening of the mouth in the midst of them; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.1	And the word of the 
EZK.30.2	Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Howl ye, Woe of the day!
EZK.30.3	For the day is near, even the day of the 
EZK.30.4	And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great fear shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be destroyed.
EZK.30.5	Ethiopia, and Libya, and Lydia, and all the mingled people, and Chub, and the men of the land that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword.
EZK.30.6	Thus hath the 
EZK.30.7	And they shall be made desolate among the countries that are destroyed, and her cities shall be among the cities that are wasted.
EZK.30.8	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.9	In that time messengers shall go forth from me in ships to make the confident Ethiopians afraid, and great fear shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for, behold, it comes.
EZK.30.10	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon.
EZK.30.11	He and his people with him, the strongest of the Gentiles, shall be brought to destroy the land; and they shall draw their swords against Egypt and fill the land with the slain.
EZK.30.12	And I will make the rivers dry and deliver the land into the hand of the wicked: and I will destroy the land and all that is therein by the hand of strangers: I the 
EZK.30.13	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will also destroy the images, and I will cause the idols of Menfis to cease; and there shall no longer be a prince of the land of Egypt: and I will put fear in the land of Egypt.
EZK.30.14	And I will make Pathros desolate and will set fire in Tafnes and will execute judgments in No. {Alexandria}
EZK.30.15	And I will pour my fury upon Pelusio, {the people of the marsh}, the strength of Egypt; and I will cut off the multitude of No.
EZK.30.16	And I will set fire to Egypt; Pelusio shall have great pain, and No shall be rent asunder, and Menfis shall have distresses daily.
EZK.30.17	The young men of Heliopolis {city of the sun} and of Pubasti {the goddess Basht (cat)} shall fall by the sword; and these cities shall go into captivity.
EZK.30.18	At Tehaphnehes also the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the yokes of Egypt; and the pride of her strength shall cease in her; as for her, a cloud shall cover her, and the inhabitants of her villages shall go into captivity.
EZK.30.19	Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.20	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.30.21	Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not been bound up with medicine, to bind it that it might be made whole, to make it strong to hold the sword.
EZK.30.22	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I am against Pharaoh king of Egypt and will break his arms, the strong, and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand.
EZK.30.23	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the Gentiles and will disperse them through the countries.
EZK.30.24	And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon and put my sword in his hand, but I will break Pharaoh’s arms, and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a man wounded unto death.
EZK.30.25	But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.30.26	And I will scatter the Egyptians among the Gentiles and disperse them among the countries; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.31.1	And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the third month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.31.2	Son of man, speak unto Pharaoh king of Egypt and to his people. Whom art thou like in thy greatness?
EZK.31.3	Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches and with a shadowing shroud and of a high stature; and his top was highest among the thick boughs.
EZK.31.4	The waters made him grow; the deep set him up on high; her rivers ran round his feet and sent her flow to all the trees of the field.
EZK.31.5	Therefore his height was exalted above all the trees of the field, and his boughs were multiplied, and his branches became long because of his many waters, which he sent forth.
EZK.31.6	All the fowls of heaven made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches all the beasts of the field brought forth their young, and under his shadow dwelt many Gentiles.
EZK.31.7	He made himself beautiful in his greatness, with the extension of his branches: for his root was by many waters.
EZK.31.8	The cedars in the garden of God did not cover him: the fir trees were not like his boughs, and the chestnut trees were not like his branches; nor any tree in the garden of God was like unto him in his beauty.
EZK.31.9	I have made him beautiful with the multitude of his branches: and all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden of God, envied him.
EZK.31.10	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said; Because thou hast lifted up thyself in height, and he has shot up his top among the thick boughs, and his heart is lifted up in his height;
EZK.31.11	I have therefore delivered him into the hand of the strong one of the Gentiles; he shall surely deal with him; I have cut him down for his wickedness.
EZK.31.12	And strangers, the strong ones of the Gentiles, shall cut him down and shall leave him; his branches shall fall upon the mountains and by all the valleys, and his boughs shall be broken by all the rivers of the land; and all the peoples of the earth shall go forth from his shadow and shall leave him.
EZK.31.13	Upon his ruin shall all the fowls of the heaven remain, and all the beasts of the field shall be upon his branches:
EZK.31.14	to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves for their height, neither shoot up their tops among the thick boughs, neither in their branches shall all that drink waters stand up in their height: for they shall all be delivered unto death, to the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the sons of men, with those that go down to the grave.
EZK.31.15	Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to Sheol I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the many waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted.
EZK.31.16	I made the Gentiles to shake at the sound of his fall, when I cast him down to Sheol with those that descend into the pit: and all the choice trees of Eden, and the best of Lebanon, all that drink waters, shall be comforted in the lower parts of the earth.
EZK.31.17	They also went down into Sheol with him, with those that were slain with the sword; and those that were his arm, that dwelt under his shadow in the midst of the Gentiles.
EZK.31.18	To whom art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? Yet thou shalt be cut down with the trees of Eden unto the lower parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with those that are slain by the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his people, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.32.1	And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.32.2	Son of man, raise up lamentations upon Pharaoh king of Egypt and say unto him, Thou art like a young lion of the nations, and thou art as the whale in the seas, that dost dry up thy rivers, and trouble the waters with thy feet, and foul their streams.
EZK.32.3	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I will therefore spread out my net over thee with a company of many peoples, and they shall bring thee up in my net.
EZK.32.4	Then I will leave thee upon the land; I will cast thee forth upon the open field and will cause all the fowls of the heaven to remain upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of the whole earth with thee.
EZK.32.5	And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains and fill the valleys with thy height.
EZK.32.6	I will also water with thy blood the land in which thou dost swim, even to the mountains; and the rivers shall be full of thee.
EZK.32.7	And when thou art dead, I will cover the heavens and make the stars thereof dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.
EZK.32.8	All the bright lights of heaven I will make dark because of thee and set darkness upon thy land, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.32.9	I will also make the hearts of many peoples sad when I shall bring thy destruction upon the Gentiles, into the countries which thou hast not known.
EZK.32.10	And I will make many peoples amazed at thee and their kings shall be horribly afraid because of thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of thy fall.
EZK.32.11	For thus hath the Lord GOD said: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee.
EZK.32.12	By the swords of the mighty I will cause thy people to fall; they shall all be the strong of the Gentiles and they shall destroy the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude thereof shall be undone.
EZK.32.13	I will also destroy all the beasts thereof from upon the many waters; neither shall the foot of man, nor the hoofs of beasts foul them any more.
EZK.32.14	Then I will make their waters deepen and cause their channels to run like oil, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.32.15	When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and the fullness of the land shall be taken away when I shall smite all those that dwell therein, then they shall know that I am the 
EZK.32.16	This is the lamentation, and they shall sing it; the daughters of the Gentiles shall sing it: they shall lament over Egypt and over all her multitude, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.32.17	It also came to pass in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the 
EZK.32.18	Son of man, lament over the multitude of Egypt and cast him down and the habitations of the strong Gentiles into the lower parts of the earth with those that go down into the grave.
EZK.32.19	Because thou art so beautiful, go down, and be laid with the uncircumcised.
EZK.32.20	They shall fall in the midst of those that are slain by the sword; he is delivered to the sword; bring him and all his peoples.
EZK.32.21	The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst of Sheol with those that help him: they are gone down; they lie with the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
EZK.32.22	Asshur is there and all his company; his graves are about him; all of them slain, fallen by the sword:
EZK.32.23	whose graves are set in the sides of the pit, and his company is round about his grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which caused terror in the land of the living.
EZK.32.24	There is Elam and all his multitude round about his grave, all of them slain, fallen by the sword, which are gone down uncircumcised into the lowest parts of the earth because they spread their terror in the land of the living; yet they have borne their shame with those that go down to the grave.
EZK.32.25	They have set him a bed in the midst of the slain with all his multitude: his graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword because they spread their terror in the land of the living, yet they have borne their shame with those that go down to the pit; he was put in the midst of the dead.
EZK.32.26	There is Meshech, Tubal, and all his multitude; his graves are round about him, all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword because they had caused their terror in the land of the living.
EZK.32.27	And they shall not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, who are gone down to Sheol with their weapons of war: and they have laid their swords under their heads, but their sins shall be upon their bones because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
EZK.32.28	Yea, thou shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised and shalt lie with those that are slain with the sword.
EZK.32.29	There is Edom, his kings, and all his princes, which with their might are laid with those that were slain by the sword; they shall lie with the uncircumcised and with those that go down to the pit.
EZK.32.30	There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all the Zidonians, who are gone down with the slain with their terror, ashamed of their might; and they lie uncircumcised with those that are slain by the sword and bear their shame with those that go down to the pit.
EZK.32.31	Pharaoh shall see them and shall be comforted over all his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army slain by the sword, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.32.32	Because I have spread my terror in the land of the living, he shall also lay in the midst of the uncircumcised with those that are slain with the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.33.1	And the word of the 
EZK.33.2	Son of man, speak to the sons of thy people, and say unto them, When I bring a sword upon the land and the people of the land take a man from within their borders and set him up as a watchman;
EZK.33.3	and he should see the sword coming upon the land, if he should blow the shofar, and warn the people,
EZK.33.4	then whoever hears the sound of the shofar and does not take warning; and the coming of the sword should take him away, his blood shall be upon his own head.
EZK.33.5	He heard the sound of the shofar and did not take warning; his blood shall be upon himself. But he that takes warning shall deliver his soul.
EZK.33.6	But if the watchman should see the sword coming and not blow the shofar and the people not be warned, if the sword comes and takes any person from among them, he is taken away because of his iniquity; but his blood I will require at the watchman’s hand.
EZK.33.7	So thou, O son of man, I have set thee a watchman unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth and warn them from me.
EZK.33.8	When I say unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou shalt surely die; if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man shall die for his sin; but I will require his blood at thine hand.
EZK.33.9	Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it, if he does not turn from his way, he shall die for his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.
EZK.33.10	Therefore, O thou son of man, speak unto the house of Israel: Ye speak thus, saying, Our transgressions and our sins are upon us, and we are consumed because of them. How should we then live?
EZK.33.11	Say unto them, As I live, said the Lord GOD, I do not desire the death of the wicked but that the wicked turn from his way and that he live; turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O house of Israel?
EZK.33.12	And thou, son of man, say unto the sons of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him the day that he rebels; and the wickedness of the wicked shall not impede him in the day that he turns from his wickedness; and the righteous shall not be able to live by his righteousness in the day that he sins.
EZK.33.13	When I am saying to the righteous, Thou shalt shall surely live and he trusting in his own righteousness commits iniquity, all his righteousnesses shall not be remembered; but for his iniquity that he has committed, he shall die for it.
EZK.33.14	And, when I am saying unto the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; if he turns from his sin, and does judgment and righteousness
EZK.33.15	if the wicked restores the pledge, returns that which he had robbed, walks in the statutes of life, without committing iniquity he shall surely live; he shall not die.
EZK.33.16	None of his sins that he has committed shall be mentioned unto him. Has he lived according to judgment and righteousness? He shall surely live.
EZK.33.17	Then the sons of thy people shall say, The way of the Lord is not straight: but their way is the one that is not straight.
EZK.33.18	When the righteous turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die thereby.
EZK.33.19	And when the wicked turns from his wickedness and does judgment and righteousness, he shall live thereby.
EZK.33.20	Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not straight. O ye house of Israel, I will judge you each one after his ways.
EZK.33.21	And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that one that had escaped out of Jerusalem came unto me, saying, The city is smitten.
EZK.33.22	Now the hand of the 
EZK.33.23	And the word of the 
EZK.33.24	Son of man, those that inhabit these wastes in the land of Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he possessed the land; but we are many; the land is given us for a possession.
EZK.33.25	Therefore say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said; Ye eat with the blood and lift up your eyes toward your idols and shed blood, and shall ye possess this land?
EZK.33.26	Ye stand upon your sword, ye work abomination, and ye defile each one his neighbour’s wife, and shall ye possess the land?
EZK.33.27	Thou shalt speak unto them like this, Thus hath the Lord GOD said; As I live, surely those that are in those wastes shall fall by the sword, and he that is in the open field I will give to the beasts to be devoured, and those that are in the forts and in the caves shall die of the pestilence.
EZK.33.28	For I will make the land into desert and solitude, and the pride of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that no one shall pass through.
EZK.33.29	Then they shall know that I am the 
EZK.33.30	And thou, son of man, the sons of thy people are still talking against thee by the walls and in the doors of the houses and speak one to another, each one to his brother, saying, Come, I pray you, and hear what is the word that comes forth from the 
EZK.33.31	And they shall come unto thee as the people come, and they shall be before thee, my people, and they shall hear thy words, but they shall not do them; for with their mouth they flatter, but their heart goes after their covetousness.
EZK.33.32	And, behold, thou art unto them as a singer of love songs, one that has a good voice and can sing well: and they shall hear thy words, but they will not do them.
EZK.33.33	But when this comes to pass (behold, it comes), then they shall know that a prophet has been among them.
EZK.34.1	And the word of the 
EZK.34.2	Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy and say unto the pastors, Thus hath the Lord GOD said; Woe unto the shepherds of Israel that feed themselves! should not the shepherds feed the flocks?
EZK.34.3	Ye eat the milk, and ye clothe yourselves with the wool, ye kill those that are fat; but ye do not feed the flock.
EZK.34.4	Ye have not strengthened the weak, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with force and with cruelty ye have ruled them;
EZK.34.5	and they are dispersed because there is no shepherd; and they became food to all the beasts of the field, and they were scattered.
EZK.34.6	My sheep were lost and wandered through all the mountains and upon every high hill; my flock was dispersed upon all the face of the earth, and there was no one to search for them or to require anything of them.
EZK.34.7	Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.8	as I live, said the Lord GOD, surely because my flock became a prey, and my flock became food to every beast of the field, without a pastor, neither did my shepherds search for my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves and did not feed my flock;
EZK.34.9	therefore, O ye pastors, hear the word of the 
EZK.34.10	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my flock at their hand and cause them to cease from feeding the flock; neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any longer; for I will deliver my flock from their mouth, and they shall no longer be food for them.
EZK.34.11	For thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I, even I, will both search and recognize my sheep.
EZK.34.12	As the shepherd recognizes his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered, so will I recognize my sheep, and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
EZK.34.13	And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them upon the mountains of Israel by the rivers and in all the habitations of the country.
EZK.34.14	I will feed them in good pastures and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be; there they shall sleep in a good fold, and in fat pastures they shall be fed upon the mountains of Israel.
EZK.34.15	I will feed my flock, and I will cause them to have a fold, saith the Lord GOD.
EZK.34.16	I will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them in judgment.
EZK.34.17	And as for you, O my flock, thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I judge between sheep and sheep, between the rams and the he goats.
EZK.34.18	Does it seem a small thing unto you that ye eat of the good pastures, but ye also tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and that in drinking of the deep waters, ye must also foul the residue with your feet?
EZK.34.19	And my sheep eat that which ye have trodden with your feet, and they drink that which ye have fouled with your feet.
EZK.34.20	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said unto them; Behold, I, even I, will judge between the fat sheep and between the lean sheep,
EZK.34.21	because ye have thrust with side and with shoulder and pushed all the weak with your horns until ye have scattered them outside.
EZK.34.22	I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be a prey; and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
EZK.34.23	And I will raise up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them, even my slave David; he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd.
EZK.34.24	And I the 
EZK.34.25	And I will establish with them a covenant of peace and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness and sleep in the woods.
EZK.34.26	And I will give unto them and to the places round about my hill blessing, and I will cause the rain to come down in its season; they shall be rains of blessing.
EZK.34.27	And the tree of the field shall yield her fruit, and the earth shall yield her fruit, and they shall be safe in their land and shall know that I am the 
EZK.34.28	And they shall no longer be a prey to the Gentiles, neither shall the beast of the land devour them; but they shall dwell safely, and no one shall make them afraid.
EZK.34.29	And I will raise up for them a plant by name, and they shall no longer be consumed with hunger in the land, neither bear the shame of the Gentiles any longer.
EZK.34.30	Thus shall they know that I the 
EZK.34.31	And ye my flock, the flock of my pasture, are men, and I am your God, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.35.1	Moreover the word of the 
EZK.35.2	Son of man, set thy face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against him,
EZK.35.3	and say unto him, Thus saith the Lord GOD: Behold, O Mount Seir, I am against thee, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee waste and solitary.
EZK.35.4	I will lay thy cities waste, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou shalt know that I am the 
EZK.35.5	Because thou hast had perpetual enmities and hast scattered the sons of Israel to the force of the sword in the time of their calamity, in the extremely evil time:
EZK.35.6	therefore, as I live, said the Lord GOD, I will prepare thee unto blood, and blood shall pursue thee: and if thou dost not hate blood, blood shall pursue thee.
EZK.35.7	And I will make Mount Seir waste and solitary and cut off from him, he that passes out and him that returns.
EZK.35.8	And I will fill his mountains with his dead; and in thy hills and in thy valleys, and in all thy rivers, they shall fall that are slain with the sword.
EZK.35.9	I will make thee perpetual desolations, and thy cities shall never be restored; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.35.10	Because thou hast said, These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess them, whereas the 
EZK.35.11	Therefore, as I live, said the Lord GOD, I will even do according to thine anger and according to thine envy which thou hast used out of thy enmity against them; and I shall be known in them when I judge thee.
EZK.35.12	And thou shalt know that I, the 
EZK.35.13	Thus with your mouth ye have boasted against me and have multiplied your words against me; I have heard them.
EZK.35.14	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Thus shall the whole earth rejoice when I shall make thee desolate.
EZK.35.15	As thou didst rejoice upon the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do unto thee; thou shalt be desolate, O Mount Seir, and all Idumea, even all of it: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.36.1	Also, thou son of man, prophesy upon the mountains of Israel and say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the 
EZK.36.2	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because the enemy hath said regarding you, Aha, even the ancient high places are ours in possession;
EZK.36.3	therefore prophesy and say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because they have made you desolate and swallowed you up on every side that ye might be a possession unto the residue of the Gentiles, and ye are taken up in the lips of talkers and are an infamy of the people;
EZK.36.4	Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD: Thus hath the Lord GOD said to the mountains and to the hills, to the rivers and to the valleys, to the ruins and the desolate wastes, and to the cities that are forsaken which became a prey and derision to the residue of the Gentiles that are round about,
EZK.36.5	therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Surely in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the other Gentiles and against all Idumea, who have disputed my land into their possession with the joy of all their heart, with despiteful desires, to cast it out for a prey.
EZK.36.6	Prophesy therefore upon the land of Israel and say unto the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my fury because ye have borne the shame of the Gentiles,
EZK.36.7	therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: I have lifted up my hand, Surely the Gentiles that are about you: they shall bear their shame.
EZK.36.8	But ye, O mountains of Israel, ye shall shoot forth your branches and yield your fruit to my people of Israel, for they are at hand to come.
EZK.36.9	For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn unto you, and ye shall be tilled and sown;
EZK.36.10	and I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel, even all of it: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the ruins shall be built.
EZK.36.11	And I will multiply upon you man and beast; and they shall multiply and grow; and I will cause thee to dwell as was thy desire of old and will do better unto you than at your beginnings; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.36.12	And I will cause men to walk upon you, even my people Israel; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be their inheritance, and from now on thou shalt no longer bereave them of sons.
EZK.36.13	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Because they say of you, Thou land that devours up men and hast bereaved thy nations of sons,
EZK.36.14	therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy nations of sons any more, saith the Lord GOD.
EZK.36.15	Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the Gentiles any longer, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the peoples any more, neither shalt thou cause the sons of thy inhabitants to die any longer, saith the Lord GOD.
EZK.36.16	And the word of the 
EZK.36.17	Son of man, the house of Israel which dwells in their land has defiled it with their own ways and with their works; their way was before me as the uncleanness of a menstruous woman.
EZK.36.18	And I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols with which they had polluted it:
EZK.36.19	And I scattered them among the Gentiles, and they were dispersed through the countries; according to their ways and according to their doings I judged them.
EZK.36.20	And when they entered unto the Gentiles, where they went, they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are the people of the 
EZK.36.21	And it has pained me to see my holy name profaned by the house of Israel among the Gentiles where they went.
EZK.36.22	Therefore say unto the house of Israel, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: I do not do this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for my holy name’s sake, which ye have profaned among the Gentiles, where ye went.
EZK.36.23	And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the Gentiles, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the Gentiles shall know that I am the 
EZK.36.24	And I will take you from among the Gentiles and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land.
EZK.36.25	And I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and from all your idols I will cleanse you.
EZK.36.26	And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh.
EZK.36.27	And I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my commandments, and ye shall keep my rights, and do them.
EZK.36.28	And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.
EZK.36.29	I will also keep you from all your uncleanness: and I will call to the wheat and will multiply it and lay no famine upon you.
EZK.36.30	I will multiply likewise the fruit of the trees, and the fruit of the fields, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine among the Gentiles.
EZK.36.31	Then ye shall remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
EZK.36.32	Not for your sakes do I do this, said the Lord GOD, be it known unto you; be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.
EZK.36.33	Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities. I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be built.
EZK.36.34	And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that passed by;
EZK.36.35	who said, This desolate land used to be like the garden of Eden; and these waste and desolate and ruined cities used to be fortified.
EZK.36.36	And the Gentiles that are left round about you shall know that I the 
EZK.36.37	Thus hath the Lord GOD said; I will yet be enquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will multiply men like flocks.
EZK.36.38	As the holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of men; and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.37.1	And the hand of the 
EZK.37.2	and caused me to pass by them round about; and, behold, there were very many upon the face of the field; and they were very dry.
EZK.37.3	And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.
EZK.37.4	Then he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto them, O ye dry bones hear the word of the 
EZK.37.5	Thus hath the Lord GOD said unto these bones: Behold, I will cause spirit to enter into you, and ye shall live:
EZK.37.6	And I will lay nerves upon you and will bring up flesh upon you and cover you with skin and put spirit in you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.37.7	So I prophesied as I was commanded, and as I prophesied, there was a thunder, and behold a shaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone.
EZK.37.8	And I beheld, and behold nerves upon them and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no spirit in them.
EZK.37.9	Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the spirit, prophesy, son of man, and say to the spirit, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Come from the four winds, O spirit, and breathe upon these slain, and they shall live.
EZK.37.10	And I prophesied as he commanded me, and the spirit entered into them, and they lived and stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army.
EZK.37.11	Then he said unto me, Son of man, all these bones are the house of Israel; behold, they say, Our bones have dried, and our hope is lost, and in ourselves we are totally cut off.
EZK.37.12	Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, O my people, I open your graves and will cause you to come up out of your graves and bring you into the land of Israel.
EZK.37.13	And ye shall know that I am the 
EZK.37.14	and shall put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall cause you to rest upon your own land; then shall ye know that I the 
EZK.37.15	And the word of the 
EZK.37.16	Thou, son of man, take one stick and write upon it: To Judah, and to the sons of Israel his companions; then take another stick and write upon it: To Joseph, the stick of Ephraim and to all the house of Israel his companions:
EZK.37.17	and join them one to another that they might become one; and they shall be one in thy hand.
EZK.37.18	And when the sons of thy people shall speak unto thee, saying, Wilt thou not show us what thou meanest by these?
EZK.37.19	Say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel his fellows and will put them with him, even with the stick of Judah and make them one stick, and they shall be one in my hand.
EZK.37.20	And the sticks upon which thou dost write shall be in thine hand before their eyes.
EZK.37.21	And thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the Lord GOD said; Behold, I take the sons of Israel from among the Gentiles, where they be gone and will gather them on every side and bring them into their own land;
EZK.37.22	and I will make them one nation in the land in the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they shall no longer be two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all:
EZK.37.23	neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with all their rebellions, but I will save them out of all their dwellingplaces, in which they have sinned and will cleanse them, so they shall be my people, and I will be their God.
EZK.37.24	And David my slave shall be king over them; and they all shall have one shepherd; they shall also walk within my rights and keep my statutes and do them.
EZK.37.25	And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my slave, in which your fathers have dwelt; and they shall dwell therein, even they and their sons and their son’s sons for ever; and my slave David shall be their prince for ever.
EZK.37.26	Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will plant them and multiply them and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for evermore.
EZK.37.27	And my tabernacle shall be in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
EZK.37.28	And the Gentiles shall know that I the 
EZK.38.1	And the word of the 
EZK.38.2	Son of man, set thy face against Gog in the land of Magog, prince of the capital of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy over him,
EZK.38.3	and say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I come unto thee, O Gog, prince of the capital of Meshech and Tubal;
EZK.38.4	and I will break thee and put hooks into thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth and all thine army, horses and horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling swords:
EZK.38.5	Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them, all of them with shield and helmet:
EZK.38.6	Gomer and all his companies; the house of Togarmah that dwells to the sides of the north and all his companies and many peoples with thee.
EZK.38.7	Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto them.
EZK.38.8	After many days thou shalt be visited; at the end of years thou shalt come to the land broken by the sword, gathered out of many peoples, to the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste; but she is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them.
EZK.38.9	Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm; thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy companies and many peoples with thee.
EZK.38.10	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: It shall also come to pass in that day, that words shall rise up in thy heart, and thou shalt conceive an evil thought:
EZK.38.11	and thou shalt say, I will go up against the land of unwalled villages; I will go against those that are at rest, that dwell safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither bars nor gates,
EZK.38.12	to take a spoil and to take a prey, to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are now inhabited and upon the people that are gathered out of the Gentiles, who have gotten cattle and goods, that dwell in the navel of the land.
EZK.38.13	Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?
EZK.38.14	Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog: Thus hath the Lord GOD said: In that time when my people of Israel shall dwell securely, shalt thou not know it?
EZK.38.15	And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts, thou, and many peoples with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company, and a mighty army:
EZK.38.16	and thou shalt come up against my people of Israel as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be at the end of the days, and I will bring thee upon my land, that the Gentiles may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.
EZK.38.17	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Art thou not he of whom I have spoken in days past by my slaves the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in those times that I would have to bring thee upon them?
EZK.38.18	And it shall come to pass in that time when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, said the Lord GOD, that my fury shall rise up in my anger.
EZK.38.19	For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath I have spoken, Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking upon the land of Israel,
EZK.38.20	so that the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the heaven and the beasts of the field and every serpent that walks by dragging itself upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face of the earth, shall shake before my presence, and the mountains shall be ruined, and the stairs shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.
EZK.38.21	And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, said the Lord GOD: each man’s sword shall be against his brother.
EZK.38.22	And I will litigate against him with pestilence and with blood; and I will rain upon him and upon his companies and upon the many peoples that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailstones, fire, and brimstone.
EZK.38.23	And I will be magnified and sanctified, and I will be known in the eyes of many Gentiles, and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.1	Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, prince of the capital of Meshech and Tubal;
EZK.39.2	and I will break thee, and leave but the sixth part of thee and will cause thee to come up from the north parts and will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:
EZK.39.3	and I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand and will cause thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.
EZK.39.4	Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all thy companies and the peoples that go with thee; I have given thee unto every bird and unto everything that flies and to the beasts of the field as food.
EZK.39.5	Thou shalt fall upon the open field for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.39.6	And I will send a fire on Magog, and among those that dwell securely in the isles: and they shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.7	So I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more; and the Gentiles shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.8	Behold, it is come, and it is over, said the Lord GOD; this is the day of which I have spoken.
EZK.39.9	And those that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth and shall set on fire and burn weapons, and shields and bucklers, bows and arrows, and handstaves, and spears, and they shall burn them in the fire for seven years:
EZK.39.10	so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons in the fire; and they shall spoil those that spoiled them and rob those that robbed them, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.39.11	And it shall come to pass in that day that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers; and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude; and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.
EZK.39.12	And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them that they may cleanse the land.
EZK.39.13	All the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall be to them a renown, the day that I shall be glorified, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.39.14	And they shall take men out of continual employment, who shall go through the land with the passengers to bury those that remain upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it; after the end of seven months they shall search.
EZK.39.15	And the passengers that pass through the land, when any sees a man’s bone, then he shall set up a sign by it, until the buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.
EZK.39.16	And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall they cleanse the land.
EZK.39.17	And, thou son of man, thus hath the Lord GOD said: Speak unto every bird, unto everything that flies, and to every beast of the field, Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side to my sacrifice that I sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh, and drink blood.
EZK.39.18	Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of he goats, of oxen, and of bulls, all of them fattened in Bashan.
EZK.39.19	And ye shall eat fat until ye are full, and drink blood until ye are drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
EZK.39.20	Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and strong chariots, and with all the men of war, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.39.21	And I will set my glory among the Gentiles, and all the Gentiles shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I have laid upon them.
EZK.39.22	So the house of Israel shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.23	And the Gentiles shall know that the house of Israel went into captivity for their iniquity because they rebelled against me, and I hid my face from them and gave them into the hand of their enemies; so they all fell by the sword.
EZK.39.24	According to their uncleanness and according to their rebellions have I done unto them and hid my face from them.
EZK.39.25	Therefore thus hath the Lord GOD said: Now I will turn the captivity of Jacob and have mercy upon the whole house of Israel and will be jealous for my holy name.
EZK.39.26	After they shall feel their shame and all their rebellion by which they have rebelled against me when they dwelt safely in their land, and no one made them afraid.
EZK.39.27	When I bring them again from the peoples and gather them out of their enemies’ lands, and am sanctified in them in the sight of many Gentiles.
EZK.39.28	And they shall know that I am the 
EZK.39.29	Neither will I hide my face any longer from them, for I will pour out my Spirit upon the house of Israel, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.40.1	In the twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the fourteenth year after the city was smitten, in that same day the hand of the 
EZK.40.2	In the visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel and set me upon a very high mountain, upon which was as the frame of a city to the south.
EZK.40.3	And he brought me there, and, behold, there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the gate.
EZK.40.4	And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes and hear with thine ears and set thine heart upon all that I show thee for to the intent that I might show them unto thee art thou brought here: declare all that thou dost see to the house of Israel.
EZK.40.5	And behold a wall on the outside of the house, and the measuring reed which that man had in his hand, was six cubits long, of a cubit and a hand breadth; so he measured the breadth of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
EZK.40.6	Then he came unto the gate which looks toward the east and went up the stairs thereof and measured the post of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other post of the gate, which was one reed broad.
EZK.40.7	And each chamber was one reed long and one reed broad; and between the chambers were five cubits; and each post of the gate by the porch of the gate within was one reed.
EZK.40.8	He also measured the porch of the gate within, one reed.
EZK.40.9	Then he measured the entrance of the portal, eight cubits; and its posts, two cubits; and the entrance of the portal within.
EZK.40.10	And the gate eastward had three chambers on each side, they three were of one measure; and the portals were also of one measure on each side.
EZK.40.11	And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten cubits; and the length of the portal, thirteen cubits.
EZK.40.12	The space also before the chambers was one cubit on this side, and the space was one cubit on that side; and the chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
EZK.40.13	He measured then the gate from the roof of one chamber to the roof of another; the breadth was twenty-five cubits, door against door.
EZK.40.14	He also made the portals of sixty cubits, each portal of the court and of the portal all around.
EZK.40.15	And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.
EZK.40.16	And there were narrow windows in the chambers, and in their portals within the gate round about, and likewise in the arches; and the windows were round about inward; and upon each post were palm trees.
EZK.40.17	Then he brought me into the outer court, and, behold, there were chambers and a pavement made for the court round about; thirty chambers were in that court.
EZK.40.18	And the lower pavement was paved to the side of the gates, in proportion to the length of the portals.
EZK.40.19	Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, one hundred cubits eastward and north ward.
EZK.40.20	And the gate of the outer court that looked toward the north, he measured the length thereof and the breadth thereof.
EZK.40.21	And its chambers were three on this side and three on that side; and its posts and its arches were after the measure of the first gate; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth twenty-five cubits.
EZK.40.22	And their windows and their arches and their palm trees were after the measure of the gate that looks toward the east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and its arches were before them.
EZK.40.23	And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate toward the north and toward the east; and he measured from gate to gate one hundred cubits.
EZK.40.24	After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate toward the south; and he measured its portals and its arches according to these measures.
EZK.40.25	And there were windows in it and in its arches round about, like those windows; the length was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
EZK.40.26	And there were seven steps to go up to it, and its arches were before them; and it had palm trees, one on this side and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.
EZK.40.27	And thus was the gate in the inner court toward the south; and he measured from gate to gate toward the south one hundred cubits.
EZK.40.28	And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate; and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
EZK.40.29	and its chambers, and its posts and its arches according to these measures; and there were windows in it and in its arches round about; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad.
EZK.40.30	And the arches round about were twenty-five cubits long and five cubits broad.
EZK.40.31	And its arches went into the court outside, with palm trees upon each of its posts; and the going up to it had eight steps.
EZK.40.32	And he brought me into the inner court toward the east; and he measured the gate according to these measures.
EZK.40.33	And its chambers and its posts and its arches were according to these measures; and there were windows therein and in its arches round about; it was fifty cubits long and twenty-five cubits broad.
EZK.40.34	And its arches went into the court outside, with palm trees upon each of its posts, on this side and on that side; and the going up to it had eight steps.
EZK.40.35	Then he brought me to the north gate and measured it according to these measures;
EZK.40.36	its chambers, its posts and its arches and the windows to it round about: the length was fifty cubits and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
EZK.40.37	And its posts were toward the outer court; with palm trees upon each of its posts, on this side and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.
EZK.40.38	And there was a chamber and its gate with posts of portals, there they shall wash the burnt offering.
EZK.40.39	And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side and two tables on that side, to slay the burnt offering upon and the sin and the guilt.
EZK.40.40	And to the outside of the steps at the entry of the north gate were two tables; and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate, were two tables.
EZK.40.41	Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side, by the side of this gate; eight tables, upon which they slew their sacrifices.
EZK.40.42	And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad, and one cubit high; upon which they also laid the instruments with which they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
EZK.40.43	And within were hooks, a hand broad, fastened round about; and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.
EZK.40.44	And outside the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and they faced toward the south, one at the side of the east gate facing toward the north.
EZK.40.45	And he said unto me, This chamber facing toward the south shall be for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house.
EZK.40.46	And the chamber facing toward the north shall be for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar; these are the sons of Zadok who are called from the sons of Levi to minister to the 
EZK.40.47	So he measured the court, one hundred cubits long and one hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was before the house.
EZK.40.48	And he brought me to the porch of the house and measured each post of the porch five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side.
EZK.40.49	The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, into which they went in by steps; and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side and another on that side.
EZK.41.1	Afterward he brought me to the temple and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, which was the breadth of the arch.
EZK.41.2	And the breadth of each door was ten cubits, and the sides of the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on the other side; and he measured its length, forty cubits; and its breadth, twenty cubits.
EZK.41.3	Then he went inward and measured each post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door, seven cubits.
EZK.41.4	So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple; and he said unto me, This is the most holy place.
EZK.41.5	After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the breadth of the chambers, four cubits, round about the house on every side.
EZK.41.6	And the chambers were one over another, and thirty-three by order; and they entered supports into the wall of the house round about, upon which the chambers might have hold, but they did not have hold upon the wall of the house.
EZK.41.7	And there was an enlarging and a winding about in the chambers to the highest part; for the winding about of the house went very high round about inside the house; therefore the house had greater breadth upward, and from the lowest chamber it rose to the highest by the one in the middle.
EZK.41.8	I saw also the height of the house round about; the foundations of the chambers were a full reed of six great cubits.
EZK.41.9	The thickness of the outside wall of the chambers was five cubits; and the space that was left of the chambers that were within.
EZK.41.10	And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the house on every side.
EZK.41.11	And the door of each chamber was toward the space that was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward the south; and the breadth of the space that was left was five cubits round about.
EZK.41.12	Now the building that was before the separate place to the side toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and its length ninety cubits.
EZK.41.13	So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long; and the separate place, and the building, with its walls, one hundred cubits long;
EZK.41.14	also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate place toward the south, one hundred cubits.
EZK.41.15	And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place which was behind it, and its chambers on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits, with the inner temple, and the portals of the court.
EZK.41.16	The thresholds, and the narrow windows, and the chambers, three around about to the front, all covered with wood round about from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were also covered.
EZK.41.17	Above over the door, and unto the inner house, and without, and by all the wall round about within and without, he took measurements.
EZK.41.18	And the wall was decorated with cherubim and palm trees, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and each cherub had two faces;
EZK.41.19	so that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other side, through all the house round about.
EZK.41.20	From the ground unto above the door, cherubim and palm trees were made, and upon the entire wall of the temple.
EZK.41.21	Each post of the temple was squared, and the front of the sanctuary was as the other front.
EZK.41.22	The altar of wood was three cubits high, and its length two cubits; and its corners, and the surface thereof, and its walls, were of wood; and he said unto me, This is the table that is before the 
EZK.41.23	And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
EZK.41.24	And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.
EZK.41.25	And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple, cherubim and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls; and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch without.
EZK.41.26	And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and of the house, and upon the beams.
EZK.42.1	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward the north; and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the space which was in front of the building toward the north.
EZK.42.2	In front of the north door the length was one hundred cubits, and the breadth was fifty cubits.
EZK.42.3	Over against the twenty cubits which were in the inner court, and over against the pavement which was in the outer court, were the chambers in three stories.
EZK.42.4	And in front of the chambers was a walk of ten cubits breadth inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.
EZK.42.5	Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took away from the others, from the lower ones and from the middle ones.
EZK.42.6	For they were in three stories, but did not have pillars as the pillars of the courts; therefore they were narrower than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.
EZK.42.7	And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the outer court in front of the chambers, was fifty cubits long.
EZK.42.8	For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court was fifty cubits; and before the front of the temple were one hundred cubits.
EZK.42.9	And under these chambers was the entry to the temple on the east side, to enter in to it from the outer court.
EZK.42.10	All along the wall of the court toward the east, over against the separate place, and in front of the building were chambers.
EZK.42.11	And the way before them was like the appearance of the chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as broad as they; and all their goings out were both according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
EZK.42.12	And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way directly in front of the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.
EZK.42.13	Then he said unto me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they are holy chambers, where the priests that approach unto the 
EZK.42.14	When the priests enter therein, then they shall not go out of the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay their garments in which they minister; for they are holy; and shall put on other garments, and in this manner shall approach unto that which is of the people.
EZK.42.15	Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth by the way of the gate facing toward the east and measured it round about.
EZK.42.16	He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.
EZK.42.17	He measured the north side, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about.
EZK.42.18	He measured the south side, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
EZK.42.19	He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed.
EZK.42.20	He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.
EZK.43.1	Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks toward the east:
EZK.43.2	And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel that was coming from the east; and his noise was like the noise of many waters: and the earth shined with his glory.
EZK.43.3	And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.
EZK.43.4	And the glory of the 
EZK.43.5	So the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner court; and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.43.6	And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man stood by me.
EZK.43.7	And he said unto me, Son of man, this is the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, in which I will dwell in the midst of the sons of Israel for ever, and my holy name, the house of Israel shall no longer defile, neither they, nor their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcasses of their kings in their altars.
EZK.43.8	In their setting of their threshold by my threshold, and their post by my post, and a wall between me and them, they have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they have committed; therefore I have consumed them in my anger.
EZK.43.9	Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcasses of their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever.
EZK.43.10	Thou son of man, show this house to the house of Israel that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them understand the pattern.
EZK.43.11	And if they are ashamed of all that they have done, show them the form of the house, and its pattern, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all its figures, and all its descriptions, and all its paintings, and all its laws; and write it in their sight that they may keep the whole form thereof and all the ordinances thereof and do them.
EZK.43.12	This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain it shall be built; the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold, this is the law of the house.
EZK.43.13	And these are the measures of the altar in cubits: The cubit is a cubit and a hand breadth; the middle rim, one cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by the edge thereof round about of a span. This shall be the high bottom of the altar.
EZK.43.14	And from the middle rim of the ground even to the lower settle, two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the lesser settle to the greater settle, four cubits, and the breadth a cubit.
EZK.43.15	So the altar, of four cubits; and above the altar, four horns.
EZK.43.16	And the altar was twelve cubits long, twelve broad, square on its four sides.
EZK.43.17	And the patio was fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad on all four sides; and the border about it was half a cubit; and the middle which had a rim of a cubit on all sides; and its stairs were toward the east.
EZK.43.18	And he said unto me, Son of man, thus hath the Lord GOD said: These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
EZK.43.19	And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me, said the Lord GOD, a young bullock as sin.
EZK.43.20	And thou shalt take of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar and on the four corners of the patio and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou remove the sin and reconcile it.
EZK.43.21	Then thou shalt take the bullock of the sin and burn it according to the law of the house, outside the sanctuary.
EZK.43.22	And on the second day thou shalt offer a he goat without blemish as sin; and they shall remove the sin from the altar, as they removed it with the bullock.
EZK.43.23	When thou hast finished removing the sin, thou shalt offer a young bullock without blemish and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
EZK.43.24	And thou shalt offer them before the 
EZK.43.25	Seven days shalt thou prepare each day a he goat as sin; and a young bullock and a ram out of the flock, without blemish, shall they sacrifice.
EZK.43.26	Seven days shall they atone the altar, and they shall cleanse it; and they shall extend their hands.
EZK.43.27	And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall sacrifice your burnt offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will accept you, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.44.1	Then he brought me back toward the outer gate of the sanctuary which looks toward the east; and it was shut.
EZK.44.2	Then the 
EZK.44.3	It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the 
EZK.44.4	Then he brought me toward the north gate in front of the house: and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the 
EZK.44.5	And the 
EZK.44.6	And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus hath the Lord GOD said: O ye house of Israel, let all your abominations cease.
EZK.44.7	In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh to be in my sanctuary to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.
EZK.44.8	And ye have not kept the charge of my holy things; but ye have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
EZK.44.9	Thus hath the Lord GOD said; No son of a stranger, uncircumcised in heart nor uncircumcised in flesh shall enter into my sanctuary, of any sons of strangers that are among the sons of Israel.
EZK.44.10	And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols; they shall bear their iniquity.
EZK.44.11	Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, gatekeepers at the gates of the house, and servants in the house; they shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people, and they shall stand before them to serve them.
EZK.44.12	Because they served them before their idols and caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore I have lifted up my hand regarding them, said the Lord GOD, that they shall bear their iniquity.
EZK.44.13	And they shall not come near unto me, to serve me as priests, nor to come near to any of my holy things, to my most holy things: but they shall bear their shame and their abominations which they have committed.
EZK.44.14	But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house for all the service thereof and for all that shall be done therein.
EZK.44.15	But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the charge of my sanctuary when the sons of Israel went astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the blood, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.44.16	They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my charge.
EZK.44.17	And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments; and no wool shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court and within.
EZK.44.18	They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads and shall have linen underwear upon their loins; they shall not gird themselves with any thing that causes sweat.
EZK.44.19	And when they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they ministered and lay them in the chambers of the sanctuary, and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not sanctify the people with their garments.
EZK.44.20	Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks to grow long; they shall only cut their hair.
EZK.44.21	Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the inner court.
EZK.44.22	Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that is put away: but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.
EZK.44.23	And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy and profane and teach them to discern between the clean and the unclean.
EZK.44.24	And in controversy they shall stand to judge; and they shall judge it according to my rights; and they shall keep my laws and my statutes in all my solemn assemblies; and they shall hallow my sabbaths.
EZK.44.25	And they shall come near no dead person to defile themselves; but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter, for brother, or for sister that has had no husband, they may defile themselves.
EZK.44.26	And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven days.
EZK.44.27	And in the day that he goes into the sanctuary, unto the inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.44.28	And this shall be unto them for an inheritance: I shall be their inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I am their possession.
EZK.44.29	They shall eat the present, and that which was offered as sin, and that which was offered as guilt they shall eat; and every dedicated thing unto God in Israel shall be theirs.
EZK.44.30	And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every offering of all, of every sort of your offerings, shall be the priest’s; ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.
EZK.44.31	The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself, or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.
EZK.45.1	Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for inheritance, ye shall separate a lot for the 
EZK.45.2	Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for its suburbs.
EZK.45.3	And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of twenty-five thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand; and in it shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.
EZK.45.4	The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which are chosen to minister unto the 
EZK.45.5	And another twenty-five thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth, shall also the Levites, the ministers of the house, have for themselves, for a possession, with twenty chambers.
EZK.45.6	And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad, and twenty-five thousand long, in front of that which was separated for the sanctuary; it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
EZK.45.7	And the portion of the prince shall be on the one side and on the other side of that which was separated for the sanctuary, and next to the possession of the city, in front of that which was separated for the sanctuary, and in front of the possession of the city, from the west corner westward, unto the east corner eastward: and the length shall be from one side to the other, from the west corner unto the east corner.
EZK.45.8	He shall have this land for possession in Israel: and my princes shall no longer oppress my people; but they shall give the land unto the house of Israel according to their tribes.
EZK.45.9	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel, remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and righteousness, take away your exactions from my people, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.45.10	Ye shall have just balances and a just ephah and a just bath.
EZK.45.11	The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the homer.
EZK.45.12	And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs; twenty shekels, with twenty-five shekels, and fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.
EZK.45.13	This is the offering that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part of an ephah of an homer of barley.
EZK.45.14	The ordinance concerning the oil shall be that ye shall offer a bath of oil, which is the tenth part of the cor, which is an homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:
EZK.45.15	and one female lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the fat pastures of Israel; for a sacrifice, and for a burnt offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for you, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.45.16	All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the prince in Israel.
EZK.45.17	And it shall be the prince’s part to give the burnt offering and the sacrifice and the drink offering in the solemnities and in the new moons and in the sabbaths in all the feasts of the house of Israel: he shall offer the sin, and the present and the burnt offering and the peace offerings to reconcile the house of Israel.
EZK.45.18	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: In the first month, in the first day of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock, without blemish, and remove the sin from the sanctuary.
EZK.45.19	And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin and put it upon the posts of the house and upon the four corners of the patio of the altar and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court.
EZK.45.20	And so thou shalt do until the seventh day of the month for each one that errs, and for him that is deceived; so shall ye reconcile the house.
EZK.45.21	In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened bread shall be eaten.
EZK.45.22	And upon that day the prince shall prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a calf as sin.
EZK.45.23	And in all seven days of the solemnity he shall prepare a burnt offering to the 
EZK.45.24	And he shall prepare a present of an ephah of fine flour for a calf, and an ephah with every ram, and for every ephah a hin of oil.
EZK.45.25	In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, he shall offer again in the feast of the seven days, the sin, the burnt offering, the present, and the oil.
EZK.46.1	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; and the day of the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the same manner it shall be opened the day of the new moon.
EZK.46.2	And the prince shall enter from outside by the way of the porch of that gate and shall stand by the threshold of the gate (while the priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings), and he shall worship at the entrance of the gate: then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until the evening.
EZK.46.3	Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of this gate before the 
EZK.46.4	And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the 
EZK.46.5	And the present shall be an ephah of fine flour for each ram and the present for each lamb as he shall be able to give, and a hin of oil for each ephah.
EZK.46.6	But in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish.
EZK.46.7	And he shall prepare a present of an ephah of fine flour with the calf, and another ephah with each ram, and for the lambs according as his hand shall attain unto, and a hin of oil with each ephah.
EZK.46.8	And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the same way thereof.
EZK.46.9	But when the people of the land shall come before the 
EZK.46.10	And the prince, when they go in, he shall go in, in the midst of them; and when they go forth, he shall go forth.
EZK.46.11	And in the feasts and in the solemnities the present shall be an ephah of fine flour with each calf, and another ephah with each ram, and with the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil with each ephah.
EZK.46.12	Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering or peace offerings voluntarily unto the 
EZK.46.13	Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the 
EZK.46.14	And thou shalt prepare a present with it each morning, the sixth part of an ephah of fine flour, and the third part of a hin of oil, to temper with the fine flour; this shall be a present for the 
EZK.46.15	Thus shall they prepare the lamb and the present and the oil each morning for a continual burnt offering.
EZK.46.16	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: If the prince gives a gift of his inheritance unto any of his sons, it shall be theirs; the possession thereof shall be by inheritance.
EZK.46.17	But if he gives a gift of his inheritance to one of his slaves, then it shall be his until the year of liberty; when it shall return to the prince; but his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them.
EZK.46.18	And the prince shall take nothing from the people’s inheritance, that he not defraud them of their possession; but he shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession that my people not be scattered each one from his possession.
EZK.46.19	After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which looked toward the north; and, behold, there was a place on the two sides westward.
EZK.46.20	Then he said unto me, This is the place where the priests shall boil that which was offered as guilt and that which was offered as sin, where they shall bake the present; that they not bear them out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
EZK.46.21	Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused me to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in each corner of the court there was a patio.
EZK.46.22	In the four corners of the court there were patios joined of forty cubits long and thirty broad; these four corners were of one measure.
EZK.46.23	And there was a wall round about in them, round about those four, and it was made with fire places all around the palaces.
EZK.46.24	Then said he unto me, These are the quarters of the cooks, where the servers of the house shall cook the sacrifice of the people.
EZK.47.1	Afterward he made me return to the entrance of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under towards the right side of the house, to the south side of the altar.
EZK.47.2	Then he brought me out by the way of the north gate and led me by the way outside the gate, outside to the way that looks eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
EZK.47.3	And when the man went forth eastward, he had a line in his hand, and he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.
EZK.47.4	Again he measured a thousand and brought me through the waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a thousand and brought me through; the waters were to the loins.
EZK.47.5	Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I could not pass over; for the waters were risen; a river that could not be passed over without swimming.
EZK.47.6	And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he brought me and caused me to return to the brink of the river.
EZK.47.7	And as I turned, behold, at the bank of the river were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
EZK.47.8	Then he said unto me, These waters issue out toward the east country and shall go down into the desert and go into the sea: which being brought forth into the sea, the waters of the sea shall be healed.
EZK.47.9	And it shall come to pass, that every living soul, which swims wherever these two rivers shall come, shall live; and there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because of these waters going there: for they shall be healed; and every thing shall live that shall enter into this river.
EZK.47.10	And it shall come to pass, that the fishermen shall stand next to it; and from Engedi even unto Eneglaim there shall be a place to spread forth nets; according to their kinds, their fish shall be as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
EZK.47.11	But the miry places thereof and the marshes thereof shall not be healed; they shall be given to salt.
EZK.47.12	And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on that side, shall grow every fruitful tree for food, whose leaf shall not fall, neither shall its fruit be lacking; it shall bring forth mature fruit in its months, because their waters come forth out of the sanctuary; and its fruit shall be for food, and its leaf for medicine.
EZK.47.13	Thus hath the Lord GOD said: This is the border, by which ye shall divide the land in inheritance among to the twelve tribes of Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.
EZK.47.14	And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another, concerning that which I lifted up my hand that I must give it unto your fathers: therefore, this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.
EZK.47.15	And this shall be the border of the land toward the north side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to Zedad;
EZK.47.16	Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by the coast of Hauran.
EZK.47.17	And the border of the north shall be from the sea of Hazarenan to the border of Damascus to the north, and to the border of Hamath to the side of the north.
EZK.47.18	And to the east side through Hauran, and Damascus, and Gilead, and through the land of Israel to the Jordan, ye shall measure this from the border unto the east sea.
EZK.47.19	And to the south side southward from Tamar even to the waters of strife; from Kadesh and the river to the great sea. And this shall be the south side southward.
EZK.47.20	And to the west side the great sea shall be the border straight unto Hamath. This shall be the west side.
EZK.47.21	So shall ye divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.
EZK.47.22	And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn among you, who have begotten sons among you; and they shall be unto you as native born among the sons of Israel; they shall have cast lots with you to inherit among the tribes of Israel.
EZK.47.23	And it shall come to pass, that in the tribe in which the stranger sojourns, there shall ye give him his inheritance, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.48.1	Now these are the names of the tribes. From the side of the north by the way of Hethlon, as one goes to Hamath, Hazarenan, to the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of Hamath; Dan shall have a portion, his sides being to the east and to the west.
EZK.48.2	And next to the border of Dan, from the east side unto the side of the sea, Asher shall have a portion.
EZK.48.3	And next to the border of Asher, from the east side unto the side of the sea, a portion for Naphtali.
EZK.48.4	And next to the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the side of the sea, a portion for Manasseh.
EZK.48.5	And next to the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the side of the sea, a portion for Ephraim.
EZK.48.6	And next to the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the side of the sea, a portion for Reuben.
EZK.48.7	And next to the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the side of the sea, a portion for Judah.
EZK.48.8	And next to the border of Judah, from the east side unto the side of the sea, shall be the lot which ye shall set apart of twenty-five thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the other portions; that is, from the east side unto the side of the sea: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.
EZK.48.9	The lot that ye shall separate unto the 
EZK.48.10	And from there shall be the holy lot of the priests; toward the north twenty-five thousand reeds in length, and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south twenty-five thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the 
EZK.48.11	The priests that are sanctified of the sons of Zadok, which have kept my charge, which did not go astray when the sons of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
EZK.48.12	They shall receive by lot, separated in the dividing of the land, the most holy part, next to the border of the Levites.
EZK.48.13	And the portion of the Levites, shall be in front the border of the priests, of twenty-five thousand reeds in length, and of ten thousand in breadth; all the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the breadth ten thousand.
EZK.48.14	They shall not sell of it, neither exchange nor transpose the firstfruits of the land; for it is consecrated unto the 
EZK.48.15	And the five thousand reeds, that are left in the breadth over against the twenty-five thousand, shall be profane, for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city shall be in the midst thereof.
EZK.48.16	And these shall be the measures thereof: the north side four thousand five hundred reeds, and the south side four thousand five hundred, and on the east side four thousand five hundred, and the west side four thousand five hundred.
EZK.48.17	And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two hundred and fifty reeds, and toward the west two hundred and fifty.
EZK.48.18	And the residue in length over against the lot of the holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward: which shall be what is left of the lot of the holy portion; it shall be for food unto those that serve the city.
EZK.48.19	And those that serve the city shall be from all the tribes of Israel.
EZK.48.20	All the lot of twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand square: ye shall separate by lot for the sanctuary and for the possession of the city.
EZK.48.21	And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on the other of the holy lot, and of the possession of the city, over against the twenty-five thousand reeds of the holy lot unto the east border, and westward over against the twenty-five thousand unto the west border, over against the said portions shall be of the prince; and it shall be a holy lot; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst thereof.
EZK.48.22	Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession of the city, in the midst shall be that which belongs to the prince, between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin, shall be the lot of the prince.
EZK.48.23	As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the side of the sea, Benjamin shall have a portion.
EZK.48.24	And next to the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the side of the sea, Simeon shall have a portion.
EZK.48.25	And next to the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the side of the sea, Issachar a portion.
EZK.48.26	And next to the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the side of the sea, Zebulun a portion.
EZK.48.27	And next to the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the side of the sea, Gad a portion.
EZK.48.28	And next to the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border shall be from Tamar unto the waters of strife, and from Kadesh, and the river unto the great sea.
EZK.48.29	This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, said the Lord GOD.
EZK.48.30	And these are the goings out of the city on the north side, four thousand five hundred reeds by measure.
EZK.48.31	And the gates of the city shall be according to the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; the gate of Reuben, one; the gate of Judah, another; the gate of Levi, another.
EZK.48.32	And at the east side four thousand five hundred reeds: and three gates; the gate of Joseph, one; the gate of Benjamin, another; the gate of Dan, another.
EZK.48.33	And at the south side four thousand five hundred reeds by measure: and three gates; the gate of Simeon, one; the gate of Issachar, another; the gate of Zebulun, another.
EZK.48.34	At the west side four thousand five hundred reeds, and their three gates; the gate of Gad, one; the gate of Asher, another; the gate of Naphtali, another.
EZK.48.35	It was round about eighteen thousand reeds: and the name of the city from that day shall be, THE 
DAN.1.1	In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came unto Jerusalem and besieged it.
DAN.1.2	And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand with part of the vessels of the house of God which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god, and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.
DAN.1.3	And the king spoke unto Ashpenaz the prince of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the sons of Israel of the royal lineage of the princes,
DAN.1.4	young men in whom there was no blemish whatsoever but who were good looking and taught in all wisdom and wise in knowledge and of good understanding, and that had strength in them to stand in the king’s palace, that they might be taught the letters and speech of the Chaldeans.
DAN.1.5	And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king’s food and of the wine which he drank, so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.
DAN.1.6	Now among these of the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:
DAN.1.7	unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.
DAN.1.8	And Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king’s food, nor with the wine which he drank; therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.
DAN.1.9	(And God brought Daniel into grace and mercy with the prince of the eunuchs.)
DAN.1.10	And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your food and your drink; for when he shall see your faces more downcast than the other young men who are like unto you, then ye shall condemn my head before the king.
DAN.1.11	Then Daniel said to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
DAN.1.12	Prove, now, with thy slaves ten days, and let them give us vegetables to eat and water to drink.
DAN.1.13	Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenances of the young men that eat of the portion of the king’s food; and as thou seest, deal with thy slaves.
DAN.1.14	So he consented to them in this matter and proved them ten days.
DAN.1.15	And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than the young men who ate the portion of the king’s food.
DAN.1.16	Thus Melzar took the portion of their food and the wine that they should drink and gave them vegetables.
DAN.1.17	And unto these four young men, God gave them knowledge and intelligence in all letters and science; furthermore Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.
DAN.1.18	Now at the end of the days after which the king had said he should bring them in, the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
DAN.1.19	And the king communed with them, and none among them all was found like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah; and therefore they stood before the king.
DAN.1.20	And in all matters of wisdom and intelligence, that the king enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.
DAN.1.21	And Daniel continued even unto the first year of King Cyrus.
DAN.2.1	And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep fled from him.
DAN.2.2	Then the king commanded to call magicians, astrologers, enchanters, and Chaldeans, that they might show the king his dreams. So they came and presented themselves before the king.
DAN.2.3	And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.
DAN.2.4	Then the Chaldeans spoke to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever; tell thy servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.
DAN.2.5	The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from my memory; if ye will not make known unto me the dream with its interpretation, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.
DAN.2.6	But if ye show the dream and its interpretation, ye shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour: therefore show me the dream, and its interpretation.
DAN.2.7	They answered the second time and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.
DAN.2.8	The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would gain time because ye see the thing is gone from my memory.
DAN.2.9	But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but one decree for you for ye certainly prepare lying and corrupt words to speak before me, until the time is changed; therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can show me its interpretation.
DAN.2.10	The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the king’s matter; furthermore there is no king, prince, nor lord that asked such a thing of any magician or astrologer or Chaldean.
DAN.2.11	Finally, the thing that the king requires is singular, and there is no one that can show it before the king except the angels of God, whose dwelling is not with flesh.
DAN.2.12	For this cause the king was angry and very furious and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.13	And the decree went forth, and the wise men were taken to be slain, and they sought Daniel and his fellows to kill them.
DAN.2.14	Then Daniel spoke with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king’s guard, who was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.15	He spoke and said to Arioch the king’s captain, What is the reason for which this decree has gone forth from the king with such haste? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.
DAN.2.16	And Daniel went in, and asked the king that he give him time and that he would show the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions,
DAN.2.18	to petition mercies of the God of heaven concerning this mystery and that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.19	Then the mystery was revealed unto Daniel in a night vision for which Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
DAN.2.20	And Daniel spoke and said, Blessed be the name of God from age to age for wisdom and might are his;
DAN.2.21	and it is he that changes the times and the opportunities; he removes kings and sets up kings; he gives wisdom unto the wise and knowledge unto those that know understanding:
DAN.2.22	He reveals that which is deep and hidden; he knows what is in darkness, and the light dwells with him.
DAN.2.23	Unto thee, O God of my fathers, do I confess and give thee praise that thou hast given me wisdom and might and now hast shown me what we asked of thee, for thou hast shown us the king’s matter.
DAN.2.24	After this Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon; he went and said thus unto him, Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon; bring me in before the king, and I will show unto the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.25	Then Arioch brought Daniel in before the king in haste and said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah that will make known unto the king the interpretation.
DAN.2.26	The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make me understand the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered in the presence of the king and said, The mystery which the king demands cannot be shown unto the king by wise men, astrologers, magicians, nor fortune-tellers.
DAN.2.28	But there is a God in the heavens who reveals the mysteries, and he has made known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall happen at the end of days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, is this:
DAN.2.29	Thou, O king, in thy bed, thy thoughts rose up to know what should come to pass in the future; and he that reveals the mysteries showed thee what shall come to pass.
DAN.2.30	And unto me this mystery has been revealed, not for any wisdom that is in me more than in all those living but that I notify the interpretation to the king and that thou might understand the thoughts of thy heart.
DAN.2.31	Thou, O king, didst see and behold a great image. This image, which was very large and whose glory was very sublime, stood before thee, and its form was terrible.
DAN.2.32	The head of this image was of fine gold, its breasts and its arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass,
DAN.2.33	its legs of iron, its feet part of iron and part of baked clay.
DAN.2.34	Thou didst see until a stone was cut out, not with hands, which smote the image upon its feet that were of iron and baked clay and broke them to pieces.
DAN.2.35	Then was the iron, the baked clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the chaff of the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them again; and the stone that smote the image was made into a great mountain that filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	This is the dream, and we will tell its interpretation before the king.
DAN.2.37	Thou, O king, art king of kings, for the God of heaven has given thee the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the majesty.
DAN.2.38	And everything that is inhabited by children of men, beasts of the field, and fowls of the heaven, he has given into thine hand, and has made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this head of gold.
DAN.2.39	And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the land.
DAN.2.40	And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron; and as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things, and as iron that breaks all these things, it shall break in pieces and bruise.
DAN.2.41	And whereas thou didst see the feet and toes, part of baked potters’ clay and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divisive; but there shall be in it some of the strength of the iron, such as thou didst see the iron mixed with baked clay.
DAN.2.42	And as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of baked clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly fragile.
DAN.2.43	Concerning that which thou didst see, the iron mixed with baked clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men, but they shall not cleave one to another, even as iron does not mix with clay.
DAN.2.44	And in the days of those kings the God of heaven shall raise up a kingdom which eternally shall never become corrupted, and this kingdom shall not be left to another people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.
DAN.2.45	In the manner which thou didst see that out of the mountain was cut one stone, not with hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has shown the king what shall come to pass hereafter; and the dream is true, and its interpretation sure.
DAN.2.46	Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and humbled himself before Daniel and commanded that they should sacrifice presents and sweet odours unto him.
DAN.2.47	The king answered unto Daniel and said, Certainly the God that is your God is God of gods and the Lord of the kings and the revealer of the mysteries, seeing thou could reveal this mystery.
DAN.2.48	Then the king magnified Daniel and gave him many and great gifts and made him governor over the whole province of Babylon and prince of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.49	And Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon; but Daniel was at the gate of the king.
DAN.3.1	Nebuchadnezzar the king made a statue of gold, whose height was sixty cubits and its breadth six cubits; he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
DAN.3.2	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the great ones, the assistants and captains, the judges, the treasurers, those of the council, presidents, and all the governors of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the statue which Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up.
DAN.3.3	Then the great ones, the assistants and captains, the judges, the treasurers, those of the council, presidents, and all the governors of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up; and they stood before the statue that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up.
DAN.3.4	Then a herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,
DAN.3.5	that when ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and of every musical instrument, ye are to fall down and worship the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king has raised up:
DAN.3.6	and whoever does not fall down and worship shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.7	Therefore, when all the peoples heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and every musical instrument, all the peoples, nations, and languages, fell down and worshipped the statue of gold that Nebuchadnezzar the king had raised up.
DAN.3.8	Therefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.
DAN.3.9	They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.
DAN.3.10	Thou, O king, hast made a law that every man upon hearing the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and every musical instrument, shall fall down and worship the statue of gold;
DAN.3.11	and whoever does not fall down and worship that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.12	There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee; they do not worship thy gods, nor do they worship the statue of gold which thou hast raised up.
DAN.3.13	Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said unto them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that ye do not honour my gods, nor worship the statue of gold which I have set up?
DAN.3.15	Now, are ye ready when ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and of every musical instrument to fall down and worship the statue which I made? For if ye do not worship, ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that god that shall deliver you out of my hands?
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to King Nebuchadnezzar, We are not careful to answer thee in this matter.
DAN.3.17	Behold, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.
DAN.3.18	But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not worship thy god, nor honour the statue which thou hast raised up.
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace seven times more than it was customary to be heated.
DAN.3.20	And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.21	Then these men were bound in their coats, their undergarments, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.22	Therefore because the king’s commandment was urgent and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
DAN.3.23	And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.
DAN.3.24	Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste and spoke and said unto his counsellors, Did we not cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered and said unto the king, True, O king.
DAN.3.25	He answered and said, Behold, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spoke and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the midst of the fire.
DAN.3.27	And the great ones, the governors and the captains and the king’s counsellors gathered together to see these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was a hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.
DAN.3.28	Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said, Blessed be the God of these, of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted in him and have changed the king’s word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God
DAN.3.29	Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, or language which speak blasphemy against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill because there is no other god that can deliver after this sort.
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	King Nebuchadnezzar, to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you.
DAN.4.2	The signs and wonders that the high God has wrought with me are such that I must publish them.
DAN.4.3	How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.
DAN.4.4	I Nebuchadnezzar was quiet in my house and flourishing in my palace;
DAN.4.5	I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the imaginations and visions of my head troubled me in my bed.
DAN.4.6	Therefore I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me that they might show me the interpretation of the dream.
DAN.4.7	Then the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the fortune-tellers came in and I told the dream before them; but they never showed me its interpretation.
DAN.4.8	But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name is Belteshazzar, who when I name him it seems to me that I name my god, and in whom is the spirit of the holy God; and before him I told the dream, saying,
DAN.4.9	Belteshazzar, prince of the wise men, now that I have understood that the spirit of the holy God is in thee, and that no mystery is hidden from thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen and its interpretation.
DAN.4.10	Thus were the visions of my head in my bed: It seemed that I saw a tree in the midst of the earth, and its height was great.
DAN.4.11	The tree grew and made itself strong, and its height reached unto heaven, and its sight to the end of all the earth:
DAN.4.12	His leaves were fair, and his fruit abundant, and in him was food for all; underneath him the beasts of the field lay down in his shadow, and in his branches dwelt the fowls of the heaven, and all flesh was fed of him.
DAN.4.13	I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, one who was a watchman and holy descended from heaven;
DAN.4.14	he cried aloud and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit; let the beasts get away from under him and the fowls from his branches:
DAN.4.15	nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and of brass shall he be bound in the green grass of the field; and let him be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:
DAN.4.16	let his heart be changed from a man’s heart, and let a beast’s heart be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.
DAN.4.17	By sentence of the watchmen is the matter resolved, and the case by the word of the holy ones to the intent that the living may know that the most High takes rule over the kingdom of men and gives it to whoever he will and sets up over it the man who is the lowest.
DAN.4.18	I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw this dream. Now thou, O Belteshazzar, shall declare its interpretation, forasmuch as all the wise men of my kingdom could never show me its interpretation; but thou art able, for the spirit of the holy God in thee.
DAN.4.19	Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was silent for almost one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. Then the king spoke and said, Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its interpretation trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, let the dream be to thine enemies, and its interpretation to those that wish thee evil.
DAN.4.20	The tree that thou didst see, which grew and made himself strong, whose height reached unto the heaven and the sight thereof to all the earth;
DAN.4.21	whose leaves were fair and his fruit abundant and in him was food for all, under whom the beasts of the field dwelt, and in whose branches the fowls of the heaven dwelt:
DAN.4.22	it is thou, O king, that grew and made thyself strong; for thy greatness has grown and has reached unto heaven, and thy dominion to the end of the earth.
DAN.4.23	And regarding that which the king saw, one who was a watchman and holy who came down from heaven and said, Hew the tree down and destroy it; yet leave the stump of its roots in the earth, and with a band of iron and of brass let it remain bound in the green grass of the field, and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field until seven times pass over him:
DAN.4.24	this is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:
DAN.4.25	that they shall drive thee from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall feed thee with grass of the field as the oxen, and with the dew of heaven shalt thou be bathed, and seven times shall pass over thee, until thou shalt understand that the most High takes rule over the kingdom of men and that he shall give it to whoever he will.
DAN.4.26	And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots in the earth; thy kingdom shall remain sure unto thee, that thou shalt understand that the rule is in the heavens.
DAN.4.27	Therefore, O king, approve my counsel and redeem thy sins with righteousness and thine iniquities with mercies unto the poor: behold the medicine for thy sin.
DAN.4.28	All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.
DAN.4.29	At the end of twelve months as he was walking upon the palace of the kingdom of Babylon,
DAN.4.30	the king spoke and said, Is this not the great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the glory of my greatness?
DAN.4.31	The word was yet in the king’s mouth when there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O King Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee;
DAN.4.32	and they drive thee from among men, and thy dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field; and they shall feed thee as the oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the most High takes rule in the kingdom of men and gives it to whomever he will.
DAN.4.33	The same hour the word was fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from among men and ate grass as the oxen, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like eagles’ feathers and his nails like birds’ claws.
DAN.4.34	But at the end of the time I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes unto heaven, and my understanding was returned unto me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and glorified him that lives for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is through all ages:
DAN.4.35	and all the inhabitants of the earth are counted as nothing; and in the army of heaven and in the inhabitants of the earth, he does according to his will; nor is there anyone who can interfere with his hand and say unto him, What doest thou?
DAN.4.36	In the same time my reason was returned unto me, and I turned to the majesty of my kingdom; my dignity and greatness returned unto me; and my governors and my great ones sought me; and I was restored in my kingdom, and more excellent greatness was added unto me.
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and build up and glorify the King of heaven because all his works are truth, and his ways judgment: and he is able to humble those that walk with arrogance.
DAN.5.1	Belshazzar the king made a great banquet to a thousand of his lords, and against the thousand he drank wine.
DAN.5.2	Belshazzar, under the influence of the wine, commanded that they bring the vessels of gold and of silver which Nebuchadnezzar his father had brought from the temple of Jerusalem; that the king and his princes, his wives and his concubines, might drink with them.
DAN.5.3	Then they brought the vessels of gold that they had brought from the temple of the house of God which was in Jerusalem; and the king and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank with them.
DAN.5.4	They drank wine and praised the gods of gold and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.
DAN.5.5	In that same hour some fingers of a man’s hand came forth and wrote in front of the candlestick upon the plaster of the wall of the king’s palace: and the king saw the palm of the hand that wrote.
DAN.5.6	Then the king became pale, and his thoughts troubled him, and the girdings of his loins were unloosed, and his knees smote one against another.
DAN.5.7	The king cried in a loud voice that they bring in the magicians, the Chaldeans, and the fortune-tellers. The king spoke and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing and show me its interpretation, shall be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold about his neck and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.8	Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king its interpretation.
DAN.5.9	Then king Belshazzar was greatly troubled, and his colour was changed, and his princes were upset.
DAN.5.10	Now the queen, by reason of the words of the king and of his princes, came into the banquet room. The queen spoke and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be pale.
DAN.5.11	There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom lives the spirit of the holy God; and in the days of thy father light and intelligence and wisdom, like the knowledge of God, was found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar, thy father, made prince over all the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and fortune-tellers; thus did thy father, the king,
DAN.5.12	because Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, was found to have a more excellent spirit and greater knowledge and understanding interpreting dreams, unraveling questions, and dissolving doubts. Now let Daniel be called, and he will show thee the interpretation.
DAN.5.13	Then Daniel was brought in before the king. And the king spoke and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, who art of the sons of the captivity of Judah, whom my father brought out of Judea?
DAN.5.14	I have heard of thee, that the spirit of the holy God is in thee and that light and understanding and greater wisdom was found in thee.
DAN.5.15	And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me that they should read this writing and make known unto me its interpretation, but they could not show the interpretation of the thing:
DAN.5.16	And I have heard of thee, that thou canst declare that which is in doubt and unravel difficulties: now if thou canst read this writing and show me its interpretation, thou shalt be clothed with purple and have a chain of gold about thy neck and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be for thyself and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king and show him the interpretation.
DAN.5.18	O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father the kingdom and the greatness and the glory and the magnificence:
DAN.5.19	and by the greatness that he gave him, all the peoples, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him; whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he humbled.
DAN.5.20	But when his heart made itself arrogant, and his spirit hardened itself in pride, he was deposed from the throne of his kingdom, and they took his glory from him:
DAN.5.21	and he was driven from among the sons of men; and his heart was put with the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they made him eat grass like an ox, and his body was bathed with the dew of heaven until he understood that the most high God takes rule of the kingdom of men and that he appoints over it whomever he will.
DAN.5.22	And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this;
DAN.5.23	but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou and thy princes, thy wives and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; furthermore, thou hast praised gods of silver and of gold, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone, which do not see, nor hear, nor know; and the God in whose hand is thy soul and whose are all thy ways, thou hast never honoured.
DAN.5.24	Then from his presence was sent the palm of the hand that sculpted this writing.
DAN.5.25	And the writing that he sculpted is, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN.
DAN.5.26	This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God has audited thy kingdom and finished it.
DAN.5.27	TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting.
DAN.5.28	PERES; Thy kingdom has been broken and is given to the Medes and Persians.
DAN.5.29	Then Belshazzar commanded, and they clothed Daniel with purple and put a chain of gold about his neck and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom.
DAN.5.30	That same night Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans was slain.
DAN.5.31	And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being sixty-two years old.
DAN.6.1	It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom one hundred and twenty governors who should be in all the kingdom;
DAN.6.2	and over these three presidents, of whom Daniel was first, that the governors might give accounts unto them, and the king should not be bothered.
DAN.6.3	Then this Daniel was preferred above these governors and presidents because an overabundance of the Spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole kingdom.
DAN.6.4	Then the presidents and governors looked for occasions against Daniel on behalf of the kingdom, but they could find no occasion or fault because he was faithful, and no vice nor fault was found in him.
DAN.6.5	Then these men said, We shall never find any occasion against this Daniel except we find it against him in the law of his God.
DAN.6.6	Then these governors and presidents assembled together before the king and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.
DAN.6.7	All the presidents of the kingdom, magistrates, governors, great ones, and captains have agreed in common accord to promote a royal decree and to confirm it that whoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, except of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions.
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, confirm the decree and sign the writing that it not be moved, according to the law of Media and of Persia, which does not change.
DAN.6.9	Therefore King Darius signed the writing and the decree.
DAN.6.10	Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he entered into his house; and with the windows open toward Jerusalem in his dining chamber, he knelt three times a day and prayed and gave thanks before his God as he was used to doing before.
DAN.6.11	Then these men assembled and found Daniel praying and making supplication before his God.
DAN.6.12	Then they went and spoke before the king concerning the royal decree; Hast thou not confirmed a decree that whoever shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Media and Persia, which does not change.
DAN.6.13	Then they answered and said before the king, That Daniel, which is of the sons of the captivity of the Jews, has not regarded thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast confirmed, but makes his petition three times a day.
DAN.6.14	When the king, heard the matter, it weighed very heavy upon him, and he set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and he laboured until the going down of the sun to deliver him.
DAN.6.15	Then those men assembled near the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that this is the law of Media and of Persia: No decree nor statute which the king has confirmed may be moved.
DAN.6.16	Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king, speaking unto Daniel, said, Thy God whom thou servest continually, may he deliver thee.
DAN.6.17	And a stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet ring of his princes that the agreement concerning Daniel might not be changed.
DAN.6.18	Then the king went to his palace and lay down without eating; neither were instruments of music brought before him, and his sleep fled from him.
DAN.6.19	Therefore, the king arose very early in the morning at dawn and went in haste unto the den of lions.
DAN.6.20	And when he came to the den, he cried loudly with a sad voice unto Daniel; and the king, in speaking to Daniel said, Daniel, servant of the living God, has thy God, whom thou servest continually, been able to deliver thee from the lions?
DAN.6.21	Then Daniel said unto the king, O king, live for ever.
DAN.6.22	My God has sent his angel, who shut the lions’ mouths, that they do me no evil because before him righteousness was found in me; and even before thee, O king, I have done no corruption.
DAN.6.23	Then the king was exceeding glad because of him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den, and no injury was found upon him because he believed in his God.
DAN.6.24	And the king commanded, and they brought those men who had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and even before they reached the bottom of the den, the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces.
DAN.6.25	Then king Darius wrote unto all the peoples, nations, and tongues, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied unto you.
DAN.6.26	On my behalf a statute is put into effect, That in all the dominion of my kingdom everyone tremble at the presence of the God of Daniel for he is the living God and endures for all ages, and his kingdom is such that it shall never come apart, and his dominion shall be even unto the end:
DAN.6.27	that saves and frees, and makes signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who delivered Daniel from the power of the lions.
DAN.6.28	So this Daniel was prospered during the reign of Darius and during the reign of Cyrus, the Persian.
DAN.7.1	In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon, Daniel saw a dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the dream and penned the sum of the matters.
DAN.7.2	Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven fought the great sea.
DAN.7.3	And four great beasts came up from the sea, different one from another.
DAN.7.4	The first was like a lion, and had eagle’s wings; I beheld until the its wings were plucked off, and it was removed from the earth, and it stood up on its feet as a man, and a man’s heart was given to it.
DAN.7.5	And behold the second beast, like unto a bear, which went off to one side, and it had three ribs between its teeth; and thus was said unto it, Arise, devour much flesh.
DAN.7.6	After this I beheld, and behold another, like a tiger, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; this beast also had four heads; and power was given to it.
DAN.7.7	After this I saw in the night visions, and behold the fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and exceedingly strong; and it had great iron teeth; it devoured and broke in pieces and trod down that which was left with its feet; and it was very different from all the beasts that had been before her; and it had ten horns.
DAN.7.8	As I was considering the horns, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom three of the first horns were plucked up by the roots; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking grand things.
DAN.7.9	I beheld until thrones were placed, and an Elder of great age did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like pure wool: his throne a flame of fire, his wheels burning fire.
DAN.7.10	A river of fire issued and came forth from before him; thousands of thousands served him, and ten thousands of ten thousands stood before him; the Judge sat down, and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke; I beheld even until the beast was slain and its body was undone and given over to be burned in the fire.
DAN.7.12	They had also taken from the other beasts their rule because their lives had been prolonged until a certain time.
DAN.7.13	I saw in the vision of the night, and, behold, in the clouds of heaven like a Son of man that came and drew near unto the Elder of great age, and they brought him near before him.
DAN.7.14	And he gave him dominion and glory and kingdom; and all the peoples, nations, and tongues served him: his dominion is an eternal dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom such that it shall never be corrupted.
DAN.7.15	My spirit was troubled, I Daniel, in the midst of my body, and the visions of my head astonished me.
DAN.7.16	I came near unto one of those that stood by and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me and made me know the interpretation of the things.
DAN.7.17	These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise in the earth.
DAN.7.18	And they shall take the kingdom of the Holy One who is most High and possess the kingdom until the age and until the age of the ages.
DAN.7.19	Then I had the desire to know the truth regarding the fourth beast, which was so different from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and its nails of brass; which devoured and broke in pieces and trod down that which was left with its feet;
DAN.7.20	also regarding the ten horns that were in its head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; and that same horn had eyes and a mouth that spoke very grand things, whose appearance was greater than his fellows.
DAN.7.21	I saw that this horn made war against the saints and overcame them;
DAN.7.22	until such time as the Elder of great age came, and the judgment was given unto the saints of the most High; and the time came, and the saints possessed the kingdom.
DAN.7.23	Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be a fourth king in earth, which shall be greater than all the other kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.
DAN.7.24	And the ten horns signify that of this kingdom ten kings shall arise; and another shall rise after them; and he shall be greater than the first kings, and he shall bring down three kings.
DAN.7.25	And he shall speak great words against the most High and shall break down the saints of the most High and think to move the times and the law; and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the half or dividing of a time.
DAN.7.26	And the Judge shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion to destroy and to cast out unto the end;
DAN.7.27	and that the kingdom and the dominion, and the majesty of the kingdoms under the whole heaven, be given to the holy people of the most High, His kingdom shall be an eternal kingdom, and all the dominions shall serve him and hear him.
DAN.7.28	Up unto here was the end of the word. I, Daniel, was very troubled in my thoughts, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the word in my heart.
DAN.8.1	In the third year of the reign of King Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, Daniel, after that vision which had appeared unto me before.
DAN.8.2	And I saw in the vision; (and it came to pass, when I saw it, that I was at Shushan, which is the head of the kingdom in the province of Persia); so that I saw in that vision, being by the river of Ulai,
DAN.8.3	and I lifted up my eyes and saw, and, behold, a ram was standing before the river, which had two horns; and even though they were high, the one was higher than the other, and the higher one came up last.
DAN.8.4	I saw that the ram smote with the horns to the west, to the north, and to the south and that no beast could stand before him, nor could anyone escape from his hand; but he did according to his will and made himself great.
DAN.8.5	And as I was considering, behold, a he goat came from the west upon the face of the whole earth and did not touch the earth: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.
DAN.8.6	And he came to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing before the river and ran against him in the fury of his power.
DAN.8.7	And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he rose up against him and smote him, and broke his two horns: because the ram did not have the strength to stand before him; therefore he cast him down to the ground and trod him under; and there was no one to deliver the ram out of his hand.
DAN.8.8	And the he goat made himself very great, and when he was at his greatest strength, that great horn was broken; and in its place came up another four marvellous ones toward the four winds of heaven.
DAN.8.9	And out of the first of them came forth a little horn, which grew much toward the south and toward the east and toward the desirable land.
DAN.8.10	And it magnified itself unto the host of heaven, and it cast down part of the host and of the stars to the ground and trod them under.
DAN.8.11	Even against the prince of the host did he magnify himself, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of his sanctuary was cast to the earth.
DAN.8.12	And the host was given over by reason of the prevarication upon the daily sacrifice; and he cast the truth to the ground; and he did whatever he would and prospered.
DAN.8.13	Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto the one which spoke, How long shall the vision of the daily sacrifice last and the prevarication of desolation that places both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?
DAN.8.14	And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days of evening and morning; then shall the sanctuary be justified.
DAN.8.15	And it came to pass, as I, Daniel, was considering the vision and seeking to understand it, behold, there stood before me the likeness of a man.
DAN.8.16	And I heard a man’s voice between the banks of the Ulai, which called and said, Gabriel, teach this man the vision.
DAN.8.17	So he came near where I stood, and with his coming, I was afraid and fell upon my face; and he said unto me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time appointed by God the vision shall be fulfilled.
DAN.8.18	Now as he was speaking with me, I fell into a deep sleep on the ground upon my face; and he touched me and changed my state.
DAN.8.19	And he said, Behold, I will show thee that which is to come in the last end of the wrath; for at the time appointed this shall be fulfilled.
DAN.8.20	The ram which thou didst see having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
DAN.8.21	And the he goat is the king of Grecia, and the great horn that he had between his eyes is the first king.
DAN.8.22	Now that being broken, whereas four stood up in its place, means that four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his strength.
DAN.8.23	And at the end of their empire, when the prevaricators are come to the full, a king of arrogant countenance and expert in enigmas shall raise himself up.
DAN.8.24	And his power shall be strengthened, but not by his own power; and he shall destroy marvellously and shall prosper and do according to his will and shall destroy the mighty and the people of the saints.
DAN.8.25	And with his understanding he shall cause the deceit in his hand to prosper, and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace he shall destroy many; he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes, and without hand he shall be broken.
DAN.8.26	And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true; therefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be for many days.
DAN.8.27	And I Daniel was broken and was sick certain days; and after I rose up, I did the king’s business; but I was astonished at the vision, and there was no one who could understand it.
DAN.9.1	In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;
DAN.9.2	in the first year of his reign, I Daniel saw diligently in the books the number of the years, of which the 
DAN.9.3	And I turned my face unto the Lord God, seeking him in prayer and supplication, in fasting and sackcloth, and ashes:
DAN.9.4	and I prayed unto the 
DAN.9.5	we have sinned, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly, and we have been rebels, and we have departed from thy commandments and from thy judgments.
DAN.9.6	We have not hearkened unto thy slaves the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings and to our princes, to our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
DAN.9.7	O Lord, the righteousness belongs unto thee, but unto us the confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are near and that are far off through all the lands where thou hast driven them because of their rebellion with which they have rebelled against thee.
DAN.9.8	O Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.
DAN.9.9	Of the Lord our God is the ability to have mercy and to forgive, even though we have rebelled against him
DAN.9.10	and have not listened to the voice of the 
DAN.9.11	And all Israel transposed thy law, departing by not hearing thy voice; by which the curse has fallen upon us and the oath that is written in the law of Moses, the slave of God, because we have sinned against him.
DAN.9.12	And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke over us and over our judges that governed us, by bringing upon us such a great evil: that such has never been done under the whole heaven as has been done upon Jerusalem.
DAN.9.13	As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come upon us, and we never sought the face of the 
DAN.9.14	And the 
DAN.9.15	And now, O Lord our God, who hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and hast won for thyself a very clear name as appears unto this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.
DAN.9.16	O Lord, according to all thy righteousness, let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and all thy people is given in reproach to all that are about us.
DAN.9.17	Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy slave and his supplications and cause thy face to shine upon thy sanctuary that is made desolate, by the Lord.
DAN.9.18	O my God, incline thine ear and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not present our supplications before thee confiding in our righteousnesses, but in thy many mercies.
DAN.9.19	O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people are called by thy name.
DAN.9.20	And whiles I was speaking and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and presenting my supplication before the 
DAN.9.21	I was even yet speaking in prayer, and that man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, flying swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening sacrifice.
DAN.9.22	And he caused me to understand and spoke with me and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to cause thee to understand the interpretation.
DAN.9.23	At the beginning of thy supplications, the word went forth, and I have come to teach it unto thee; for thou art a man greatly beloved: therefore understand the word, and understand the vision.
DAN.9.24	Seventy weeks are determined {Heb. Cut} upon thy people and upon thy holy city to finish the prevarication and to conclude the sin and to make reconciliation for iniquity and to bring in everlasting righteousness and seal the vision and the prophecy, and to anoint the Holy of Holies.
DAN.9.25	Know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the word to cause the people to return and to build Jerusalem unto the Anointed {Heb. Messiah} Prince, there shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks, while the street shall be built again and the wall, even in troublous times.
DAN.9.26	And after the sixty-two weeks the Anointed One {Heb. Messiah} shall be killed and shall have nothing: (and the ruling people that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; whose end shall be as a flood, until at the end of the war it shall be cut off with desolation).
DAN.9.27	In one week (they are now seventy) he shall confirm the covenant by many: and at the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and because of the many abominations, desolation shall come, even until complete destruction shall be poured out upon the abominable people.
DAN.10.1	In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia the Word was revealed unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the Word was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the Word, and had intelligence in the vision.
DAN.10.2	In those days I, Daniel, was mourning three weeks of days.
DAN.10.3	I ate no pleasant bread, neither did flesh nor wine come into my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all until the three weeks of days were fulfilled.
DAN.10.4	And in the twenty-fourth day of the first month as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;
DAN.10.5	and lifting up my eyes, I saw, and behold a man clothed in linens, whose loins were girded with very pure gold:
DAN.10.6	his body was like the stone of Tarsis turquoise, and his face as a bolt of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in colour to brilliant brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of an army.
DAN.10.7	And only I, Daniel, saw that vision: for the men that were with me did not see the vision; but a great fear fell upon them, and they fled and hid themselves.
DAN.10.8	Therefore I was left alone and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me, for my strength was turned into dismay, and I retained no strength.
DAN.10.9	Yet I heard the voice of his words, and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I placed into a deep sleep on my face, and my face was toward the ground.
DAN.10.10	And, behold, a hand touched me and caused me to move upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands.
DAN.10.11	And he said unto me, Daniel, O man greatly beloved, pay attention to the words that I shall speak unto thee, and stand up upon thy feet: for I am sent now unto thee. And as he was speaking this with me, I was trembling.
DAN.10.12	And he said unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst give thy heart to understand and to afflict thy soul before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come because of thy words.
DAN.10.13	But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me twenty-one days: and behold, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.
DAN.10.14	Now I am come to make thee know what shall befall thy people in the latter days, for there shall still be vision for several days.
DAN.10.15	And as he was speaking such words unto me, I looked toward the ground and became dumb.
DAN.10.16	And, behold, one like the similitude of the son of man touched my lips; then I opened my mouth and spoke and said unto him that stood before me, O my Lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.
DAN.10.17	For how can the slave of my Lord talk with my Lord? for as for me, for in that instant I had no more strength in me, neither was there any breath left in me.
DAN.10.18	Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he comforted me,
DAN.10.19	and said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be of good cheer, and be well. And as he spoke unto me, I was strengthened and said, Let my Lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.
DAN.10.20	Then said he, Knowest thou why I have come unto thee? Because now I must return to fight with the prince of the Persians; and when I am gone forth, next the prince of Grecia shall come.
DAN.10.21	But I will interpret unto thee that which is written in the scripture of truth: and there is no one that holds with me in these things, but Michael your prince.
DAN.11.1	And in the first year of Darius the Mede, I stood to encourage and to strengthen him.
DAN.11.2	And now will I show thee the truth. Behold, there shall yet be three kings in Persia, and the fourth shall obtain far greater riches than they all; and by his strengthening himself with his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.
DAN.11.3	And a valiant king shall stand up, that shall rule over a great dominion and do according to his will.
DAN.11.4	But when he is reigning, his kingdom shall be broken and shall be divided by the four winds of heaven, and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion by which he ruled; for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.
DAN.11.5	And the king of the south, {this Hebrew word is identified with the people of God}, and of his principalities, shall make himself strong; and he shall exceed him and make himself powerful; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
DAN.11.6	But at the end of some years they shall join themselves together; for the king’s daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement, but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm; for she shall be given up and those that brought her and he that begat her, and those that were for her in this time.
DAN.11.7	But of the new shoot from her roots shall one stand up upon his throne and shall come unto the army and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north and do in them according to his will and shall prevail:
DAN.11.8	and even their gods, with their princes, with their precious vessels of silver and of gold, shall be taken captive in Egypt; and for some years he shall maintain himself against the king of the north.
DAN.11.9	Thus shall the king of the south enter into the kingdom and return to his own land.
DAN.11.10	But the sons of that one shall be stirred up and shall assemble a multitude of great armies and shall come in great haste, and overflow and pass through and turn and come with wrath unto his fortress.
DAN.11.11	Therefore the king of the south shall become furious and shall come forth and fight with him even with the king of the north; and he shall put a great multitude into the field, but all that multitude shall be given into his hand.
DAN.11.12	Therefore the multitude shall be filled with pride, his heart shall be lifted up, and he shall cast down many thousands, but he shall not prevail.
DAN.11.13	And the king of the north shall put another multitude greater than the former in the field and at the end of a time of some years shall come in great haste with a great army and with much riches.
DAN.11.14	But in those times many shall stand up against the king of the south, and sons of robbers of thy people shall raise themselves up to establish the vision, but they shall fall.
DAN.11.15	So the king of the north shall come and cast up a mount and shall take the strong cities, and the arms of the south shall not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there be any fortress that can withstand.
DAN.11.16	And he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and there shall be no one that can stand before him, and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.
DAN.11.17	He shall then set his face to come with the strength of his whole kingdom and shall do upright things with him, and he shall give him a daughter of his women to persuade her, but she shall not stand, neither be for him.
DAN.11.18	After this he shall turn his face unto the isles and shall take many, but a prince shall cause him to cease his affront and shall even turn his reproach upon him.
DAN.11.19	Then he shall turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he shall stumble and fall and not appear again.
DAN.11.20	Then shall succeed in his throne a taker of taxes who shall be the glory of the kingdom, but within few days he shall be broken, neither in anger, nor in battle.
DAN.11.21	And a vile person shall succeed in his place, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom: nevertheless he shall come in with peace and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.
DAN.11.22	And with the arms they shall be overflown of a flood before him and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
DAN.11.23	And after the union made with him he shall work deceit and shall rise and shall overcome with few people.
DAN.11.24	With the province in peace and in abundance, he shall enter and do that which his fathers have never done, nor his fathers’ fathers; he shall distribute prey and spoil and riches to his soldiers; and against the fortresses he shall forecast his devices, even for a time.
DAN.11.25	And he shall stir up his forces and his heart against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall move to the war with a great and mighty army, but he shall not prevail, for they shall betray him.
DAN.11.26	Even those that ate his bread shall break him, and his army shall be destroyed; and many shall fall down slain.
DAN.11.27	And the heart of both these kings shall be to do evil, and at the same table they shall speak lies; but it shall not prosper, for the time appointed is not yet come.
DAN.11.28	Then he shall return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits and return to his own land.
DAN.11.29	At the time appointed he shall turn toward the south, but the latter coming shall not be as the former.
DAN.11.30	For the ships of Chittim shall come against him; therefore he shall be grieved and return and have indignation against the holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return and have an understanding with those that have forsaken the holy covenant.
DAN.11.31	And arms shall be placed on his behalf, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that makes desolate.
DAN.11.32	And with flatteries he shall cause to sin those that violate the covenant, but the people that do know their God shall be strong, and do exploits.
DAN.11.33	And the wise among the people shall give wisdom to many, yet they shall fall by the sword, and by fire, by captivity, and by spoil, for some days.
DAN.11.34	And in their fall, they shall be helped with a little help, but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.
DAN.11.35	And some of the wise shall fall to be purged and cleaned and made white, even to the time of the end because even for this there is time appointed.
DAN.11.36	And the king shall do according to his will, and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every god and shall speak marvels against the God of gods and shall prosper until the indignation is accomplished, for the determination has been made.
DAN.11.37	Neither shall he care for the God of his fathers, nor the love of women, nor care for any god, for he shall magnify himself above all.
DAN.11.38	But in his place shall he honour the god of fortresses, {Ala Mahozim}, a god whom his fathers did not know; he shall honour it with gold and silver and precious stones and with things of great price.
DAN.11.39	And with the people of the strange god that he shall know, he shall make strong fortresses, increase their glory; and cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land for gain.
DAN.11.40	But at the end of the time the king of the south shall lock horns with him, and the king of the north shall raise up a storm against him with chariots and with horsemen and with many ships, and he shall enter into the lands and shall overflow and pass over.
DAN.11.41	He shall come to the glorious land, and many provinces shall fall, but these shall escape out of his hand, even Edom and Moab and the first of the sons of Ammon.
DAN.11.42	He shall stretch forth his hand to the lands, and the land of Egypt shall not escape.
DAN.11.43	And he shall take over the treasures of gold and of silver and of all the precious things of Egypt, of Libya, and Ethiopia where he passes.
DAN.11.44	But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him; therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy and to kill many.
DAN.11.45	And he shall plant the tents of his palace between the seas, in the desirable mountain of the sanctuary; and he shall come to his end, and shall have no one to help him.
DAN.12.1	And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince who is for the sons of thy people, and it shall be a time of trouble, such as never was since there were people until now, but in that time thy people shall escape, all those that are found written in the book.
DAN.12.2	And many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth shall be awakened, some for eternal life, and some for shame and everlasting confusion.
DAN.12.3	And those that understand shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and those that teach righteousness to the multitude as the stars in perpetual eternity.
DAN.12.4	But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book until the time of the end: many shall pass by, and knowledge shall be multiplied.
DAN.12.5	Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, another two who stood, one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on that side of the bank of the river.
DAN.12.6	And one said to the Man clothed in linens, who was upon the waters of the river, When shall be the end of these wonders?
DAN.12.7	And I heard the Man clothed in linens, who was upon the waters of the river, who raised his right hand and his left hand unto heaven, and swore by the living one in the ages that it shall be for a time, times, and a half; and when the scattering of the power of the holy people shall be finished, all these things shall be fulfilled.
DAN.12.8	And I heard, but I did not understand; then I said, O my Lord, what is the fulfillment of these things?
DAN.12.9	And he said, Go thy way, Daniel, for these words are closed up and sealed until the time of the fulfillment.
DAN.12.10	Many shall be purified and made white and purged, but the wicked shall get worse; and none of the wicked shall understand, but the wise shall understand.
DAN.12.11	And from the time that the daily sacrifice is taken away until the abomination of desolation, there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.
DAN.12.12	Blessed is he that waits and comes unto one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.
DAN.12.13	And thou shall go to the end and shalt rest, and thou shalt raise up in thy lot {or in thine inheritance} at the end of the days.
HOS.1.1	The word of the 
HOS.1.2	The beginning of the word of the 
HOS.1.3	So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim, who conceived and bore him a son.
HOS.1.4	And the 
HOS.1.5	And it shall come to pass in that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel.
HOS.1.6	And she conceived again and bore a daughter. And God said unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will never again have mercy upon the house of Israel, but I will utterly forget them.
HOS.1.7	But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah and will save them in the 
HOS.1.8	And after she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived and bore a son.
HOS.1.9	Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.
HOS.1.10	With all this, the number of the sons of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, Ye are the sons of the living God.
HOS.1.11	And the sons of Judah and the sons of Israel shall be congregated together, and they shall raise up for themselves one head, and they shall rise up from the land: for the day of Jezreel is great.
HOS.2.1	Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.
HOS.2.2	Contend with your mother, contend: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband: let her therefore remove her whoredoms from her face and her adulteries from between her breasts;
HOS.2.3	lest I strip her naked and set her as in the day that she was born and make her as a wilderness and set her like a dry land and slay her with thirst.
HOS.2.4	Neither will I have mercy upon her sons, for they are the sons of whoredoms.
HOS.2.5	For their mother has played the harlot; she that conceived them has been shamed; for she said, I will go after my lovers that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.
HOS.2.6	Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns and make a wall that she shall not find her paths.
HOS.2.7	And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find them; then shall she say, I will go and return to my first husband, for then it was better with me than now.
HOS.2.8	For she did not recognize that I gave her the wheat and the wine and the oil and multiplied unto them the silver and the gold, with which they made Baal.
HOS.2.9	Therefore I will return and take away my wheat in the time thereof and my wine in the season thereof and will recover my wool and my flax that I had given to cover her nakedness.
HOS.2.10	And now I will uncover her folly in the sight of her lovers, and no one shall deliver her out of my hand.
HOS.2.11	I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast, her new moon, and her sabbath, and all her festivities.
HOS.2.12	And I will cause her vine and her fig tree to be cut down, of which she has said, These are my wages that my lovers have given me; and I will reduce them to a thicket, and the beasts of the field shall eat them.
HOS.2.13	And I will visit upon her the times of the Baals, unto whom she burned incense, and she adorned herself with her earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, oblivious of me, saith the 
HOS.2.14	Therefore, behold, I will induce her and bring her into the wilderness and speak unto her heart.
HOS.2.15	And I will give her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope; and she shall sing there as in the days of her youth and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.
HOS.2.16	And it shall be in that time, saith the 
HOS.2.17	For I will take away the names of Baals out of her mouth, and they shall no longer be remembered by their name.
HOS.2.18	And in that time I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and with the fowls of the heaven and with the serpents of the earth; and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle of the earth and will cause them to sleep safely.
HOS.2.19	And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness and in judgment and in mercy.
HOS.2.20	I will even betroth thee unto me in faith: and thou shalt know the 
HOS.2.21	And it shall come to pass in that day, I will respond, saith the 
HOS.2.22	and the earth shall respond to the wheat and the wine and the oil; and they shall respond to Jezreel.
HOS.2.23	And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy upon Loruhamah, {her that had not obtained mercy}, and I will say to Loammi, {those who were not my people}, Thou art my people; and he shall say, Thou art my God.
HOS.3.1	Then the 
HOS.3.2	So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and an homer and a half of barley:
HOS.3.3	and I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another man: so will I also be for thee.
HOS.3.4	For the sons of Israel shall abide many days without king and without Lord and without sacrifice and without image, and without ephod and without teraphim;
HOS.3.5	afterward the sons of Israel shall return, and they shall seek the 
HOS.4.1	Hear the word of the 
HOS.4.2	By swearing and lying and murdering and stealing and committing adultery, they prevailed, and blood touches blood.
HOS.4.3	Therefore the earth shall mourn, and every one that dwells therein shall be cut off, with the beasts of the field and the fowls of heaven; and even the fishes of the sea shall be caught.
HOS.4.4	Certainly man does not contend with nor reprehend man; for thy people are as those that resist the priest.
HOS.4.5	Therefore thou shalt fall in the day, and the prophet shall also fall with thee by night, and I will cut off thy mother.
HOS.4.6	My people were cut off because they lacked wisdom; because thou hast rejected wisdom, I will cast thee out of the priesthood; seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy sons.
HOS.4.7	According to their greatness, so did they sin against me; therefore I will change their honour into shame.
HOS.4.8	They eat up the sin of my people, and in their iniquity they raise up their soul.
HOS.4.9	The people shall become like the priest; and I will visit his ways upon him, and they shall reward him according to his doings.
HOS.4.10	For they shall eat and not be satisfied; they shall commit whoredom and shall not increase because they have quit showing hospitality unto the 
HOS.4.11	Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
HOS.4.12	My people ask counsel of their wooden idol, and their stick declares unto them; for the spirit of whoredoms has caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring under their gods.
HOS.4.13	They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, that had good shade; therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your daughters-in-law shall commit adultery.
HOS.4.14	I will not visit upon your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor upon your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery: for they offer with whores, and they sacrifice with cult prostitutes; therefore the people without understanding shall fall.
HOS.4.15	Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah be guilty; and do not come unto Gilgal, neither go up to Bethaven, nor swear, The 
HOS.4.16	for Israel has turned away as a wild heifer; shall the 
HOS.4.17	Ephraim is given over to idols; leave him.
HOS.4.18	Their drink has become corrupted; they have committed whoredom continually; her princes love gifts, shamefully.
HOS.4.19	The wind has bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
HOS.5.1	Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ear, O house of the king because the judgment is for you, for ye have been a snare in Mizpah and a net spread over Tabor.
HOS.5.2	And in killing sacrifices ye have descended into the depths; therefore, I shall be the correction of them all.
HOS.5.3	I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me; for now, O Ephraim, thou dost commit whoredom, and Israel is defiled.
HOS.5.4	They will not think about returning unto their God; for the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they do not know the 
HOS.5.5	And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity; Judah shall also fall with them.
HOS.5.6	They shall go with their flocks and with their herds seeking the 
HOS.5.7	They have rebelled against the 
HOS.5.8	Blow ye the shofar in Gibeah and the trumpet in Ramah; sound the drum in Bethaven; after thee, O Benjamin.
HOS.5.9	Ephraim shall be made desolate in the day of chastisement; in the tribes of Israel I made known my truth.
HOS.5.10	The princes of Judah were like those that move the boundaries; therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.
HOS.5.11	Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment because he wanted to walk after commandments.
HOS.5.12	Therefore I will be unto Ephraim as a moth and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
HOS.5.13	And Ephraim shall see his sickness and Judah his wound; then Ephraim shall go to the Assyrian and shall send to King Jareb; yet he shall not be able to heal you, nor cure you of your wound.
HOS.5.14	For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion and as a young lion to the house of Judah; I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and there shall be no one left to escape.
HOS.5.15	I will go and return to my place until they acknowledge their guilt and seek my face; in their affliction they will seek me early.
HOS.6.1	Come, and let us return unto the 
HOS.6.2	After two days he shall give us life: in the third day he will resurrect us, and we shall live in his sight.
HOS.6.3	And we shall know and follow on in knowing the 
HOS.6.4	O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? Your mercy is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goes away.
HOS.6.5	Therefore I have hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: that thy righteousness be as the light that goes forth.
HOS.6.6	For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
HOS.6.7	But they have transposed the covenant as of men: there they have rebelled against me.
HOS.6.8	Gilead is a city of those that work iniquity and is polluted with blood.
HOS.6.9	And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the council of priests murder in the way by common accord; for they put the abomination into effect.
HOS.6.10	I saw uncleanness in the house of Israel: there Ephraim played the harlot, Israel defiled herself.
HOS.6.11	Also, Judah placed a plant in thee when I had turned the captivity of my people.
HOS.7.1	When I was healing Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was uncovered, and the wickedness of Samaria; for they worked deceit; and the thief comes in, and the troop of robbers spoils without.
HOS.7.2	And they do not consider in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness; now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.
HOS.7.3	They make the king glad with their wickedness and the princes with their lies.
HOS.7.4	They are all adulterers as an oven heated by the baker who shall cease from waking after he has kneaded the dough until it is leavened.
HOS.7.5	In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with a wineskin; he stretched out his hand with the scorners.
HOS.7.6	For they have made ready their heart like an oven while they lie in wait; their baker sleeps all night; in the morning it burns as a flaming fire.
HOS.7.7	They are all hot as an oven and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen; there is no one among them that calls unto me.
HOS.7.8	Ephraim, he has mixed himself among the peoples; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
HOS.7.9	Strangers have devoured his strength, and he does not know it; yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he does not understand.
HOS.7.10	And the pride of Israel shall testify to his face, and they have not returned to the 
HOS.7.11	Ephraim also was like a deceived dove, without understanding; they shall call to Egypt, they shall go to Assyria.
HOS.7.12	When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them according to what has been heard in their congregations.
HOS.7.13	Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction upon them! because they have rebelled against me; though I have ransomed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.
HOS.7.14	And they have not cried unto me with their heart when they howled upon their beds; they congregated themselves for the wheat and the wine, and they rebelled against me.
HOS.7.15	Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet they imagine evil against me.
HOS.7.16	They returned, but not to the most High; they were like a deceitful bow; their princes fell by the sword for the arrogance of their tongue; this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
HOS.8.1	Set the shofar to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the 
HOS.8.2	Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we have known thee.
HOS.8.3	Israel has cast off the good; the enemy shall pursue him.
HOS.8.4	They have reigned, but not by me; they have made dominion, and I knew it not; of their silver and their gold they have made themselves idols that they may be cut off.
HOS.8.5	Thy calf, O Samaria, has cast thee off; my anger has been kindled against them until they could no longer be absolved.
HOS.8.6	For it is of Israel; and a workman made it who is not God: because the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
HOS.8.7	For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind; they shall have no harvest; the fruit shall yield no meal: if so be it yields, the strangers shall swallow it up.
HOS.8.8	Israel shall be swallowed up; soon they shall be among the Gentiles as a vessel in which there is no pleasure.
HOS.8.9	For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass thinking only of himself; Ephraim has hired lovers.
HOS.8.10	Even though they hire the Gentiles, now I will gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king and of the princes.
HOS.8.11	Because Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, the altars shall be a sin unto him.
HOS.8.12	I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as strange things.
HOS.8.13	In the sacrifices of my gifts they sacrificed flesh and ate; but the 
HOS.8.14	For Israel has forgotten his Maker and has built temples; and Judah has multiplied fenced cities; but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
HOS.9.1	Do not rejoice, O Israel, for joy, as the peoples; for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved the salary of a harlot upon every threshing floor.
HOS.9.2	The threshing floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
HOS.9.3	They shall not remain in the land of the 
HOS.9.4	They shall not pour out wine unto the 
HOS.9.5	What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the 
HOS.9.6	For, behold, they have left because of the destruction; Egypt shall gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: nettles shall possess in inheritance that which is desirable of their silver; thorns shall grow up in their dwellings.
HOS.9.7	The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it; the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is a fool, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and the great hatred.
HOS.9.8	The watchman of Ephraim regarding my God, the prophet, is a snare of a fowler in all his ways, hatred in the house of his God.
HOS.9.9	They have arrived at the depths, they have corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah; therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sin.
HOS.9.10	I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the early fruit of the fig tree in her beginning; but they went in unto Baalpeor and separated themselves unto shame and made themselves as abominable as that which they loved.
HOS.9.11	As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth even from the womb and from the conception.
HOS.9.12	Though they bring up their sons, yet I will bereave them, that there shall not be a man left; yea, woe also to them when I depart from them!
HOS.9.13	Ephraim, as I saw Tyre, is planted in a pleasant place; but Ephraim shall bring forth his sons to the murderer.
HOS.9.14	Give them, O 
HOS.9.15	All their wickedness was in Gilgal, for there I took a dislike to them; for the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of my house, I will never love them again: all their princes are disloyal.
HOS.9.16	Ephraim was smitten, their root is dried up; they shall bear no more fruit; even though they bring forth, yet I will slay even the desirable fruit of their womb.
HOS.10.1	Israel is an empty vine. Shall he bring forth fruit unto himself? According to the multiplication of his fruit he has multiplied altars; according to the goodness of his land they have bettered their statues.
HOS.10.2	Their heart has wandered; now they shall be found guilty: he shall break down their altars, he shall destroy their statues.
HOS.10.3	For now they shall say, We have no king, because we did not fear the 
HOS.10.4	They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment shall spring up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.
HOS.10.5	The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn because of the calf, and the religious persons thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, which shall be made to vanish away.
HOS.10.6	It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to King Jareb: Ephraim shall be ashamed, and Israel shall be confused at his own counsel.
HOS.10.7	As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the surface of the waters.
HOS.10.8	And the altars of Aven shall be destroyed, the sin of Israel: the thorn and the thistle shall grow upon their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.
HOS.10.9	O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah; there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the sons of iniquity did not overtake them.
HOS.10.10	And I shall chastise them as I desire; and the peoples shall gather themselves over them, when they shall be bound in their two furrows.
HOS.10.11	Ephraim is a heifer that is taught and loves to tread out the wheat; but I shall pass over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to draw; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.
HOS.10.12	Sow yourselves unto righteousness, reap yourselves unto mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is the time to seek the 
HOS.10.13	Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye shall eat the fruit of lies because thou didst trust in thy way and in the multitude of thy mighty men.
HOS.10.14	Therefore, in thy peoples a tumult shall arise, and all thy fortresses shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Betharbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her sons.
HOS.10.15	So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness; in the morning the king of Israel shall utterly be cut off.
HOS.11.1	When Israel was a boy, I loved him and called my son out of Egypt.
HOS.11.2	As they called them, so they went from them; they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.
HOS.11.3	Even with all this I guided the feet of this same Ephraim, taking them by their arms; but they did not know that I cared for them.
HOS.11.4	I drew them with human cords, with bands of love, and I was to them as those that raise the yoke from upon their cheeks, and I fed them.
HOS.11.5	He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king because they refused to be converted.
HOS.11.6	And the sword shall fall upon his cities and shall consume his villages and devour them because of their own counsels.
HOS.11.7	Meanwhile, my people adhere to the rebellion against me though they call unto me upon High; absolutely none at all wish to exalt me.
HOS.11.8	How must I leave thee, Ephraim? how shall I give thee up, Israel? how could I make thee as Admah? nor set thee as Zeboim? my heart churns within me; all my compassion is inflamed.
HOS.11.9	I will not execute the fierceness of my anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee; and I will not enter into the city.
HOS.11.10	They shall walk after the 
HOS.11.11	As a bird they shall move speedily out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria; and I will place them in their houses, saith the 
HOS.11.12	Ephraim compasses me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit; but Judah yet rules with God and is faithful with the saints.
HOS.12.1	Ephraim feeds on wind and follows after the east wind; he daily increases lies and desolation because they made a covenant with the Assyrians, and the oil is carried into Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The 
HOS.12.3	He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and with his strength he overcame the angel;
HOS.12.4	yea, he dominated the angel and prevailed; he wept and made supplication unto him; he found him in Bethel, and there he spoke with us;
HOS.12.5	but the 
HOS.12.6	Therefore be thou converted unto thy God; keep mercy and judgment, and in thy God wait continually.
HOS.12.7	He is a merchant who has the balances of deceit in his hand; he loves to oppress.
HOS.12.8	And Ephraim said, Surely I have become rich, I have found riches for myself; no one shall find iniquity in me, nor sin in all my labours.
HOS.12.9	But I am the 
HOS.12.10	I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the hand of the prophets.
HOS.12.11	Is Gilead iniquity? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.
HOS.12.12	But Jacob fled into the land of Aram, and Israel served for his wife, and for his wife he was a pastor.
HOS.12.13	And by a prophet the 
HOS.12.14	Ephraim provoked God to anger with bitterness: therefore his blood shall be spilled upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord repay unto him.
HOS.13.1	When Ephraim spoke everyone feared, he was exalted in Israel; but he was found guilty in Baal and died.
HOS.13.2	And now they sin more and more, and of their silver they have made molten images according to their own intelligence, idols, all of it the work of the craftsmen; they say of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.
HOS.13.3	Therefore they shall be as the morning mist and as the early dew that passes away, as the chaff that is driven with the whirlwind out of the threshing floor and as the smoke out of the chimney.
HOS.13.4	Yet I am the 
HOS.13.5	I knew thee in the wilderness, in the dry land.
HOS.13.6	In their pastures, they filled themselves; they were satisfied, and their heart was exalted; for this reason they have forgotten me.
HOS.13.7	Therefore I will be unto them as a lion; as a tiger in the way I will observe them:
HOS.13.8	I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps and will rend the veil of their heart, and there I will devour them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them apart.
HOS.13.9	O Israel, thou hast caused thyself to become lost, but in me is thine help.
HOS.13.10	Where is thy king, that may save thee with all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou didst say, Give me a king and princes?
HOS.13.11	I gave thee a king in my anger and took him away in my wrath.
HOS.13.12	The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.
HOS.13.13	The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him; he is an unwise son; for a long time now he should not have stopped short at the very breaking forth of birth.
HOS.13.14	I will ransom them from the power of Sheol; I will redeem them from death; O death, I will be thy end; O Sheol, I will be thy destruction. Repentance shall be hid from my eyes.
HOS.13.15	Though he be fruitful among his brethren, the east wind shall come; the wind of the 
HOS.13.16	Samaria shall be condemned; for she has rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword; their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped open.
HOS.14.1	O Israel, become converted unto the 
HOS.14.2	Take with you words, and be converted unto the 
HOS.14.3	Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses, neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods, for in thee the fatherless finds mercy.
HOS.14.4	I will heal their rebellion; I will love them freely; for my anger is turned away from them.
HOS.14.5	I will be as the dew unto Israel; he shall flourish as the lily and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.
HOS.14.6	His branches shall spread, and his glory shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
HOS.14.7	Those that shall sit under his shadow shall return; they shall be given life as the wheat, and they shall flourish as the vine; the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.
HOS.14.8	Ephraim shall then say, What have I to do any more with idols? I will hear him and gaze upon him; I will be unto him like a green fir tree; of me shall thy fruit be found.
HOS.14.9	Who is wise that he might understand this? and prudent that he might know this? for the ways of the 
JOL.1.1	The word of the 
JOL.1.2	Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the earth. Has this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?
JOL.1.3	Tell your sons of it, and let your sons tell their sons, and their sons another generation.
JOL.1.4	That which the palmerworm has left the locust has eaten; and that which the locust has left the cankerworm has eaten; and that which the cankerworm has left the caterpillar has eaten.
JOL.1.5	Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.
JOL.1.6	For a people has come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the molars of a great lion.
JOL.1.7	He has laid my vine waste and barked my fig tree: he has made it clean bare and cast it away; its branches are made white.
JOL.1.8	Lament like a young woman girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.
JOL.1.9	The grain offering and the drink offering of the house of the 
JOL.1.10	The field was destroyed, the land mourns; for the wheat was destroyed; the new wine was dried up, the oil perished.
JOL.1.11	Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is lost.
JOL.1.12	The vine has dried up, and the fig tree has perished; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, have withered: therefore joy has withered away from the sons of men.
JOL.1.13	Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the present and the drink offering is taken away from the house of your God.
JOL.1.14	Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the earth into the house of the 
JOL.1.15	Alas for the day! for the day of the 
JOL.1.16	Is not the food cut off before our eyes, the joy and the gladness from the house of our God?
JOL.1.17	The seed has rotted under their clods, the storehouses were laid desolate, the barns were destroyed for the wheat is withered.
JOL.1.18	How the beasts groan! The herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture; the flocks of sheep are condemned.
JOL.1.19	O 
JOL.1.20	The beasts of the field also cry unto thee for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire has devoured the meadows of the wilderness.
JOL.2.1	Blow the shofar in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain; let all the inhabitants of the earth tremble for the day of the 
JOL.2.2	a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of shadow that spreads itself upon the mountains as the dawn: a people great and strong; there has not ever been the like, neither shall there be any more after him, even to the years of many generations.
JOL.2.3	A fire devours before him and behind him a flame burns: the earth is as the garden of Eden before him, and behind him a desolate wilderness; neither shall anyone escape him.
JOL.2.4	His appearance is as the appearance of horses; and as horsemen, so shall they run.
JOL.2.5	Like the thunder of chariots they shall leap over the tops of mountains, like the noise of a flame of fire that devours the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.
JOL.2.6	Before him the peoples shall fear: all faces shall go pale.
JOL.2.7	They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men of war, and they shall march each one in his ways, and they shall not break his ranks.
JOL.2.8	No one shall crowd his companion; they shall walk each one in his path: and even falling upon the sword, they shall not be wounded.
JOL.2.9	They shall go through the city; they shall run upon the wall; they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the windows like a thief.
JOL.2.10	The earth shall quake before him; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall go dark; and the stars shall withdraw their shining:
JOL.2.11	and the 
JOL.2.12	Therefore also now, saith the 
JOL.2.13	and rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the 
JOL.2.14	Who knows if he will return and repent and leave a blessing behind him even a present and a drink offering unto the 
JOL.2.15	Blow the shofar in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly:
JOL.2.16	gather the people, sanctify the meeting, assemble the elders, gather the children and those that suck the breasts; let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber and the bride out of her closet.
JOL.2.17	Let the priests, the ministers of the 
JOL.2.18	Then the 
JOL.2.19	Yea, the 
JOL.2.20	But I will remove far off from you he of the north wind and will drive him into a land barren and desolate; his face shall be toward the east sea, and his end unto the western sea, and he shall exhale his foul odour, and he shall decompose, because he has lifted himself up.
JOL.2.21	Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the 
JOL.2.22	Be not afraid, ye animals of the field; for the pastures of the wilderness shall become green again, for the trees shall bear their fruit, the fig tree and the vine shall give their fruits.
JOL.2.23	Ye also, sons of Zion, be glad and rejoice in the 
JOL.2.24	And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with wine and oil.
JOL.2.25	And I will restore to you the years that the caterpillar has eaten, the locust, and the cankerworm, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.
JOL.2.26	And ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied, and praise the name of the 
JOL.2.27	And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel and that I am the 
JOL.2.28	And it shall come to pass after this that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:
JOL.2.29	and even upon the slaves and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit.
JOL.2.30	And I will show wonders in the heaven and in the earth, blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.
JOL.2.31	The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood before the great and the terrible day of the 
JOL.2.32	And it shall come to pass that whoever shall call on the name of the 
JOL.3.1	For, behold, in those days and in that time when I shall cause the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem to end,
JOL.3.2	I will gather together all the Gentiles, and will cause them to descend into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and there I will enter into judgment with them because of my people and of my heritage Israel, whom they scattered among the nations, and parted my land.
JOL.3.3	And they have cast lots for my people and have given a boy for a harlot and sold a girl for wine that they might drink.
JOL.3.4	Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the coasts of Philistia? will ye render me a recompense? and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily I will return your recompense upon your own head;
JOL.3.5	because ye have taken my silver and my gold and have carried into your temples my precious and beautiful things
JOL.3.6	and ye have sold the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem unto the Grecians that ye might remove them far from their border.
JOL.3.7	Behold, I will raise them out of the place where ye have sold them and will return your recompense upon your own head:
JOL.3.8	and I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the 
JOL.3.9	Proclaim this among the Gentiles: Prepare war; wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:
JOL.3.10	beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears; let the weak say, I am strong.
JOL.3.11	Assemble yourselves and come, all ye Gentiles, and gather yourselves together round about; there cause thy mighty ones to come down, O 
JOL.3.12	Let the Gentiles be wakened and come up to the valley of Jehoshaphat for there I will sit to judge all the Gentiles round about.
JOL.3.13	Put in the sickle for the harvest is ripe; come, go down for the press is full, the vats overflow; for their wickedness is great.
JOL.3.14	Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the 
JOL.3.15	The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.
JOL.3.16	The 
JOL.3.17	So shall ye know that I am the 
JOL.3.18	And it shall come to pass in that day that the mountains shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come forth of the house of the 
JOL.3.19	Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate wilderness, for the violence against the sons of Judah because they have shed innocent blood in their land.
JOL.3.20	But Judah shall dwell for ever; and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
JOL.3.21	For I will cleanse the blood of those whom I have not cleansed; for the 
AMO.1.1	The words of Amos, who was among the pastors of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
AMO.1.2	And he said, The 
AMO.1.3	Thus hath the 
AMO.1.4	But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.
AMO.1.5	I will also break the bar of Damascus and cut off the inhabitants of the plain of Aven and him that holds the sceptre from the house of Eden; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir.
AMO.1.6	Thus hath the 
AMO.1.7	but I will send a fire in the wall of Gaza, which shall devour the palaces thereof.
AMO.1.8	And I will cut off the inhabitants of Ashdod and him that holds the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Palestinians shall perish, said the Lord GOD.
AMO.1.9	Thus hath the 
AMO.1.10	but I will send fire in the wall of Tyre, which shall devour its palaces.
AMO.1.11	Thus hath the 
AMO.1.12	but I will send fire in Teman, which shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.
AMO.1.13	Thus saith the 
AMO.1.14	but I will kindle fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces thereof as with shouting in the day of battle, as with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;
AMO.1.15	and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, said the 
AMO.2.1	Thus hath the 
AMO.2.2	but I will send fire in Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die in tumult, with shouting and with the sound of the shofar:
AMO.2.3	and I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof and will slay all the princes thereof with him, said the 
AMO.2.4	Thus hath the 
AMO.2.5	but I will send fire in Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.
AMO.2.6	Thus hath the 
AMO.2.7	desiring that there be dust of the earth upon the head of the poor, and to twist the way of the humble: and the man and his father have gone in unto the same maid, profaning my holy name:
AMO.2.8	and they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by any altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the house of their god.
AMO.2.9	Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as an oak; yet I destroyed his fruit above and his roots beneath.
AMO.2.10	Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt and led you forty years through the wilderness that you might possess the land of the Amorite.
AMO.2.11	And I raised up of your sons for prophets and of your young men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye sons of Israel? said the 
AMO.2.12	But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Do not prophesy.
AMO.2.13	Behold, I will press you in your place, as a cart is pressed that is full of sheaves.
AMO.2.14	Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the mighty deliver his soul:
AMO.2.15	neither shall he that handles the bow stand; and he that is swift of foot shall not escape: neither shall he that rides the horse save his life.
AMO.2.16	And he that is strong among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, said the 
AMO.3.1	Hear this word that the 
AMO.3.2	You only have I known of all the families of the earth; therefore, I will visit all your iniquities against you.
AMO.3.3	Can two walk together except they be agreed?
AMO.3.4	Will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Will a young lion cry out of his den if he has taken nothing?
AMO.3.5	Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth without a fowler? Shall the snare rise up from the earth and have taken nothing at all?
AMO.3.6	Shall the shofar be blown in the city and the people not be afraid? Shall there be any evil in the city which the 
AMO.3.7	Because the Lord GOD will do nothing unless he reveals his secret to his slaves the prophets.
AMO.3.8	The lion has roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD has spoken, who can but prophesy?
AMO.3.9	Publish upon the palaces of Ashdod and upon the palaces of the land of Egypt and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria and behold the great oppression in the midst thereof and the great violence in the midst thereof.
AMO.3.10	For they do not know to do right, said the 
AMO.3.11	Therefore thus said the Lord GOD: An adversary there shall be even round about the land, and he shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.
AMO.3.12	Thus hath the 
AMO.3.13	Hear ye, and protest in the house of Jacob, said the Lord GOD, the God of the hosts,
AMO.3.14	that in the day that I shall visit the rebellions of Israel upon him, I will also visit upon the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar shall be cut off and fall to the ground.
AMO.3.15	And I will smite the winter house with the summer house, and the houses of ivory shall perish, and many houses shall be cut off, said the 
AMO.4.1	Hear this word, ye cows of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, who oppress the poor, who crush the needy, who say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.
AMO.4.2	The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness that, behold, the days shall come upon you that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity in fishing boats.
AMO.4.3	And ye shall go forth by the breaches one after another, and ye shall be cast out of the palace, saith the 
AMO.4.4	Go to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal increase the rebellion; and bring your sacrifices early in the morning and your tithes every three years:
AMO.4.5	and offer a sacrifice of praise with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free will offerings for this is the way you like it, O ye sons of Israel, said the Lord GOD.
AMO.4.6	I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities and want of bread in all your places: yet ye have not returned unto me, said the 
AMO.4.7	And also I have withheld the rain from you when there were yet three months to the harvest, and I caused it to rain upon one city and caused it not to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece upon which it did not rain withered.
AMO.4.8	So two or three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, but they were not satisfied, yet ye have not returned unto me, said the 
AMO.4.9	I have smitten you with the east wind and with the caterpillar; your many gardens and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees were devoured by the locust; yet ye have never returned unto me, said the 
AMO.4.10	I have sent among you the pestilence in the way to Egypt; your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your camps to come up unto your nostrils; and ye never returned unto me, said the 
AMO.4.11	I have overthrown some of you as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the fire; and ye never returned unto me, said the 
AMO.4.12	Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel; and because I must do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
AMO.4.13	For, behold, he that forms the mountains and creates the wind and declares unto man what is his thought, that makes the darkness into morning and treads above the high places of the earth, The 
AMO.5.1	Hear ye this word, because I raise up a lamentation upon you, O house of Israel.
AMO.5.2	The virgin of Israel has fallen; she shall not be able to rise again: she was forsaken upon her land; there is no one to raise her up.
AMO.5.3	For thus hath the Lord GOD said: The city that sent out a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which sent forth a hundred shall have ten, in the house of Israel.
AMO.5.4	But thus hath the 
AMO.5.5	but do not seek Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and do not pass to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought.
AMO.5.6	Seek the 
AMO.5.7	Ye who turn judgment to wormwood and leave off doing righteousness in the earth,
AMO.5.8	look unto him that makes the seven stars and Orion and turns the shadow of death into the morning and makes the day dark with night, that calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the face of the earth: The 
AMO.5.9	that strengthens the spoiler against the strong, so that the spoiler shall come against the fortress.
AMO.5.10	They hate him that rebukes in the gate, and they abhor him that speaks uprightly.
AMO.5.11	Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat, ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
AMO.5.12	For I have known of your many rebellions and your great sins that afflict the just and take a ransom and turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.
AMO.5.13	Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time, for it is an evil time.
AMO.5.14	Seek that which is good, and not that which is evil that ye may live; and so the 
AMO.5.15	Hate the evil and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate; it may be that the 
AMO.5.16	Therefore the 
AMO.5.17	And in all vineyards shall be wailing, for I will pass through the midst of thee, said the 
AMO.5.18	Woe unto you that desire the day of the 
AMO.5.19	As if a man fled from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall and a serpent bit him.
AMO.5.20	Shall not the day of the 
AMO.5.21	I hate, I despise your solemnities, and I will not savour your assemblies.
AMO.5.22	Though ye offer me your burnt offerings and your presents, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
AMO.5.23	Take away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy instruments.
AMO.5.24	But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
AMO.5.25	Did you perchance offer me any sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness in forty years, O house of Israel?
AMO.5.26	But ye have offered unto Sicut your king, and unto Chiun your idols, the star of your gods which ye made.
AMO.5.27	Therefore I will cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, said the 
AMO.6.1	Woe unto those that are at ease in Zion and to those that trust in the mountain of Samaria, who are named principals among the same nations which shall come upon them, O house of Israel!
AMO.6.2	Pass unto Calneh and see, and from there go to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Palestinians. Are they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?
AMO.6.3	Ye that put far away the evil day and cause the seat of violence to come near;
AMO.6.4	that lie upon beds of ivory and stretch themselves upon their couches and eat the lambs out of the flock and the calves out of the midst of the stall;
AMO.6.5	that chant to the sound of the flute and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;
AMO.6.6	that drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments, but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.
AMO.6.7	Therefore now they shall go captive with the first that go captive, and the banquet of those that stretched themselves upon their couches shall be removed.
AMO.6.8	The Lord GOD has sworn by himself, the 
AMO.6.9	And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.
AMO.6.10	And their uncle shall take each one and burn them to bring out the bones out of the house and shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? and he shall say, No. Then he shall say, Hold thy tongue, for we may not make mention of the name of the 
AMO.6.11	For, behold, the 
AMO.6.12	Shall horses run upon the rocks? will one plow there with oxen? why have ye turned judgment into hemlock, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood?
AMO.6.13	Ye who rejoice in a thing of nought, who say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?
AMO.6.14	But, behold, I will raise up against you Gentiles, O house of Israel, said the 
AMO.7.1	Thus hath the Lord GOD showed unto me, and, behold, he formed grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter hay; and, behold that the latter hay grew after the king’s reapings.
AMO.7.2	And it came to pass that when they had come to an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I beseech thee; who shall lift up Jacob? for he is small.
AMO.7.3	The 
AMO.7.4	Afterward the Lord GOD showed me this: And, behold, the Lord GOD called to judge by fire, and it devoured the great deep and ate up the inheritance.
AMO.7.5	Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee; who shall raise up Jacob? for he is small.
AMO.7.6	The 
AMO.7.7	Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood upon a wall made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.
AMO.7.8	And the 
AMO.7.9	And the altars of Isaac shall be destroyed, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise upon the house of Jeroboam with the sword.
AMO.7.10	Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against thee in the midst of the house of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words.
AMO.7.11	For thus hath Amos said, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.
AMO.7.12	And Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away into the land of Judah, and eat thy bread there, and prophesy there:
AMO.7.13	but do not prophesy any more in Bethel: for it is the king’s sanctuary, and the head of the kingdom.
AMO.7.14	Then Amos answered and said to Amaziah, I am not a prophet, neither am I a prophet’s son, but I am a herdsman and a gatherer of sycamore fruit:
AMO.7.15	and the 
AMO.7.16	Now therefore hear thou the word of the 
AMO.7.17	Therefore thus hath the 
AMO.8.1	Thus hath the Lord GOD showed unto me: and behold a basket of summer fruit.
AMO.8.2	And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said the 
AMO.8.3	And the cantors of the temple shall howl in that day, said the Lord GOD; there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.
AMO.8.4	Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, and cut off the poor of the land,
AMO.8.5	saying, When the month is over, we will sell the wheat; and after the sabbath day we will open the storehouse of bread, making the ephah small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by deceit;
AMO.8.6	that we may buy the poor for money and the needy for a pair of shoes and sell the refuse of the wheat.
AMO.8.7	The 
AMO.8.8	Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwells therein? and it shall all rise up as a flood, and it shall be cast out and sunk, as the river of Egypt.
AMO.8.9	And it shall come to pass in that day, said the Lord GOD, that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will cover the earth with darkness in the clear day;
AMO.8.10	and I will turn your feasts into mourning and all your songs into lamentation; and I will cause sackcloth to be brought up upon all loins and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the mourning of an only son and the end thereof as a bitter day.
AMO.8.11	Behold, the days come, said the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine to the earth, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the 
AMO.8.12	and they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the 
AMO.8.13	In that day the fair virgins and young men shall faint for thirst.
AMO.8.14	Those that swear by the guiltiness of Samaria and say, As thy God of Dan lives; and, As the way of Beersheba lives, even they shall fall, and never rise up again.
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing upon the altar, and he said, Smite the threshold and shake the doors and cut the head of them all into pieces; and I will slay the last of them with the sword; there shall be none of them left to flee away or to escape.
AMO.9.2	Though they dig unto Sheol, from there shall my hand take them; though they climb up to heaven, from there I will bring them down;
AMO.9.3	and though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out of there; and though they hide from my sight in the bottom of the sea, from there will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:
AMO.9.4	and though they go into captivity before their enemies, from there I will command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will set my eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.
AMO.9.5	The Lord GOD of the hosts is he that touches the earth, and it shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall all rise up like a river and shall be sunk, as the river of Egypt.
AMO.9.6	He that built his degrees in the heaven and has founded his gathering upon the earth; he that calls the waters of the sea and pours them out upon the face of the earth: The 
AMO.9.7	O sons of Israel, Are ye not as sons of the Ethiopians unto me, said the 
AMO.9.8	Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are against the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, said the 
AMO.9.9	For, behold, I will command, and I will cause the house of Israel to be sifted among all the Gentiles like as the grain is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall to the earth.
AMO.9.10	All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, who say, For our sake the evil shall not come near nor overtake us.
AMO.9.11	In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen and close up its breaches; and I will raise up its ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:
AMO.9.12	that those who are called by my name may possess the remnant of Edom and all the Gentiles, said the 
AMO.9.13	Behold, the days come, saith the 
AMO.9.14	And I will turn the captivity of my people of Israel, and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards and drink the wine thereof; they shall also make gardens and eat the fruit of them.
AMO.9.15	For I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, said the 
OBA.1.1	The vision of Obadiah. Thus hath the Lord GOD said concerning Edom: We have heard the message from the 
OBA.1.2	Behold, I have made thee small among the Gentiles: thou shalt be greatly humbled.
OBA.1.3	The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high; that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the ground?
OBA.1.4	Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle and though thou set thy nest among the stars, from there I will bring thee down, said the 
OBA.1.5	Did thieves come to thee, or robbers by night? (how art thou destroyed!) would they not have stolen until they had enough? if the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some grapes?
OBA.1.6	How were the things of Esau searched out! His hidden things were sought after!
OBA.1.7	All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the border; the men that were at peace with thee have deceived thee and prevailed against thee; those that eat thy bread have laid a wound under thee; there is no intelligence in this.
OBA.1.8	Shall I not in that day, said the 
OBA.1.9	And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed because every man shall be cut off from mount of Esau by the slaughter.
OBA.1.10	For thy violence against thy brother Jacob, shame shall cover thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.
OBA.1.11	In the day that thou didst stand on the other side, in the day that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entered into his gates and cast lots upon Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.
OBA.1.12	But thou should not have looked on the day of thy brother in the day that he became a stranger; neither should thou have rejoiced over the sons of Judah in the day they were lost; neither should thou have spoken proudly in the day of distress.
OBA.1.13	Thou should not have entered into the gate of my people in the day of their calamity; thou should not have looked on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;
OBA.1.14	neither should thou have stood in the crossway, to kill those of his that did escape; neither should thou have delivered up those of his that remained in the day of distress.
OBA.1.15	For the day of the 
OBA.1.16	For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the Gentiles drink continually; they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.
OBA.1.17	But in Mount Zion shall be deliverance, and it shall be holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their possessions.
OBA.1.18	And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they shall kindle in them and devour them; and there shall not be any remaining of the house of Esau; for the 
OBA.1.19	And those of the south shall possess the mount of Esau and the plains of the Palestinians, and they shall also possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria; and Benjamin shall possess Gilead.
OBA.1.20	And the captives of this host of the sons of Israel shall possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the captives of Jerusalem, who shall be in Sepharad, shall possess the cities of the south.
OBA.1.21	And saviours shall come up unto Mount Zion to judge the mount of Esau; and the kingdom shall be the 
JON.1.1	Now the word of the 
JON.1.2	Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for their wickedness is come up before me.
JON.1.3	But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of the 
JON.1.4	But the 
JON.1.5	And the mariners were afraid, and everyone called unto his god, and they cast forth the vessels that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; he lay and was fast asleep.
JON.1.6	So the shipmaster came to him and said unto him, What meanest thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that he will have compassion upon us that we not perish.
JON.1.7	And each one said to his fellow, Come, and let us cast lots that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.
JON.1.8	Then they said unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, why this evil is come upon us; What is thine occupation? and from where dost thou come? what is thy country? and of what people art thou?
JON.1.9	And he said unto them, I am a Hebrew; and I fear the 
JON.1.10	Then the men were exceedingly afraid and said unto him, Why hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the presence of the 
JON.1.11	Then they said unto him, What shall we do unto thee that the sea may be calm unto us? for the sea rose higher and was wroth.
JON.1.12	And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you; for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
JON.1.13	Nevertheless the men rowed hard to turn the ship to land, but they could not; for the sea rose higher and was wroth against them.
JON.1.14	And they cried unto the 
JON.1.15	So they took up Jonah and cast him forth into the sea; and the sea ceased from her raging.
JON.1.16	Then the men feared the 
JON.1.17	Now the 
JON.2.1	Then Jonah prayed unto the 
JON.2.2	and said, I cried by reason of my tribulation unto the 
JON.2.3	For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about; all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
JON.2.4	Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will see thy holy temple again.
JON.2.5	The waters compassed me about, even to the soul, the depth closed me round about; the weeds were wrapped about my head.
JON.2.6	I descended to the roots of the mountains; the earth put her bars about me for ever; yet thou hast brought up my life out of the grave, O 
JON.2.7	When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the 
JON.2.8	Those that observe lying vanities forsake his mercy.
JON.2.9	But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that which I have vowed; that saving comes of the 
JON.2.10	And the 
JON.3.1	And the word of the 
JON.3.2	Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it the preaching that I bid thee.
JON.3.3	So Jonah arose and went unto Nineveh, according to the word of the 
JON.3.4	And Jonah began to enter into the city a day’s journey, and he cried and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be destroyed.
JON.3.5	So the people of Nineveh believed God and proclaimed a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the least of them.
JON.3.6	For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his throne, and he threw his robe from him and covered himself with sackcloth and sat in ashes.
JON.3.7	And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing; let them not feed, nor drink water:
JON.3.8	but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth and cry mightily unto God; and let each one turn from his evil way and from the violence that is in his hands.
JON.3.9	Who can tell if God will turn and repent and turn away from his fierce anger, that we not perish?
JON.3.10	And God saw their works, because they turned from their evil way, and he repented of the evil that he had said that he would do unto them, and he did not do it.
JON.4.1	But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.
JON.4.2	And he prayed unto the 
JON.4.3	Therefore now, O 
JON.4.4	Then the 
JON.4.5	And Jonah went out of the city and sat towards the east side of the city, and there made him a booth and sat under it in the shade until he might see what would become of the city.
JON.4.6	And the 
JON.4.7	But God also prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day, and it smote the gourd so that it withered.
JON.4.8	And it came to pass, when the sun arose, that God prepared a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah that he fainted and wished in his soul to die and said, It is better for me to die than to live.
JON.4.9	And God said to Jonah, Art thou so angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.
JON.4.10	Then the 
JON.4.11	And shall I not spare Nineveh, that great city, in which are more than one hundred twenty thousand persons, that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand, and many animals?
MIC.1.1	The word of the 
MIC.1.2	Hear, all ye peoples; hearken, O earth, and all that is therein: and the Lord GOD, the Lord from his holy temple shall be a witness against you.
MIC.1.3	For, behold, the 
MIC.1.4	And the mountains shall melt under him, and the valleys shall be split, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that run down a steep place.
MIC.1.5	All this for the rebellion of Jacob and for the sins of the house of Israel. What is the rebellion of Jacob? is it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are they not Jerusalem?
MIC.1.6	Therefore I will make Samaria into heaps in the field, into a land of vineyards: and I will scatter her stones throughout the valley, and I will uncover her foundations.
MIC.1.7	And all her graven images shall be broken to pieces, and all her gifts shall be burned in the fire, and I will destroy all her idols, for she gathered it of the gifts of harlots, and they shall return unto gifts of harlots.
MIC.1.8	Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked: I will make a wailing like the dragons and mourning as the owls.
MIC.1.9	For her wound is painful, for it is come unto Judah; it is come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.
MIC.1.10	Do not declare it in Gath, weep little; roll thyself in the dust for the house of Aphrah.
MIC.1.11	Pass away naked with shame, thou inhabitant of Saphir: the inhabitant of Zaanan did not come forth in the mourning of Bethezel; he shall receive of you for his lateness.
MIC.1.12	For the inhabitant of Maroth was pained because of good; therefore evil came down from the 
MIC.1.13	O thou inhabitant of Lachish, hitch the chariot to dromedaries: for thou wert the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion, for in thee the rebellions of Israel were invented.
MIC.1.14	Therefore shalt thou give gifts to Moreshethgath; the houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.
MIC.1.15	Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah; the glory of Israel shall come unto Adullam.
MIC.1.16	Make thee bald, and shave thee for the sons of thy delight; enlarge thy baldness as the eagle, for they are gone into captivity from thee.
MIC.2.1	Woe unto those that devise iniquity and fabricate evil upon their beds! when the morning is light, they put it into effect because they have power in their hands.
MIC.2.2	And they coveted fields and stole them, and houses and took them away; so they oppressed the man and his house, even the man and his heritage.
MIC.2.3	Therefore thus hath the 
MIC.2.4	In that time shall one take up a saying against you and lament with a doleful lamentation and say, We have been utterly destroyed; he has changed the portion of my people; how has he taken our fields! He has given and divided our fields unto others.
MIC.2.5	Therefore thou shalt have no one to cast a cord by lot in the congregation of the 
MIC.2.6	Do not prophesy, they say to those that prophesy: Do not prophesy unto them that they are to understand shame.
MIC.2.7	O thou that calls thyself the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the 
MIC.2.8	He who yesterday was my people is risen up as an enemy; ye pull off the robe with the garment from those that pass by as those who return from war.
MIC.2.9	Ye have cast the women of my people out from their pleasant houses; from their children ye have taken away my continual praise.
MIC.2.10	Arise and depart, for this is not your rest because it is polluted; it has become corrupted and with a great corruption.
MIC.2.11	If there is one walking in the spirit of falsehood, he shall lie, saying, I will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall even be the prophet of this people.
MIC.2.12	I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the sheep of Bozrah as the flock in the midst of their fold; they shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.
MIC.2.13	The breaker shall go up before them; they shall break through and pass through the gate and go out by it; and their king shall pass before them, the 
MIC.3.1	And I said, Hear, I pray you, O princes of Jacob, and ye heads of the house of Israel. Did it not pertain to you to know that which is right?
MIC.3.2	Who hate the good, and love the evil, who steal their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
MIC.3.3	and eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones and chop them in pieces as for the pot and as flesh within the caldron.
MIC.3.4	Then they shall cry unto the 
MIC.3.5	Thus hath the 
MIC.3.6	Therefore the vision shall be made night unto you, and darkness unto those that divine, and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
MIC.3.7	Then the prophets shall be ashamed, and the diviners confounded; and they shall all cover their lips because they shall have no answer from God.
MIC.3.8	But truly I am full of power by the Spirit of the 
MIC.3.9	Now hear this, ye heads of the house of Jacob and captains of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment and pervert all equity;
MIC.3.10	that build up Zion with blood and Jerusalem with iniquity;
MIC.3.11	the heads thereof judge for bribes, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet they come near unto the 
MIC.3.12	Therefore for your sake Zion shall be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps of ruins and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
MIC.4.1	But it shall come to pass in the last of the times that the mountain of the house of the 
MIC.4.2	And many Gentiles shall come and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the 
MIC.4.3	And he shall judge among many peoples and correct strong nations even afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruninghooks; nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they train for war any more.
MIC.4.4	But each one shall sit under their vine and under their fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid, for the mouth of the 
MIC.4.5	Even if all the peoples should walk each one in the name of their gods; with all this we will walk in the name of the 
MIC.4.6	In that day, saith the 
MIC.4.7	and I will make her that is lame to be heirs, and her that was cast off a strong nation, and the 
MIC.4.8	And thou, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion shall come unto thee; and the dominion shall come first, the kingdom, to the daughter of Jerusalem.
MIC.4.9	Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman in travail.
MIC.4.10	Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a woman in travail; for now thou shalt go forth out of the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the 
MIC.4.11	But now many nations are gathered against thee that say, Let her be defiled, and let our eyes see our desire carried out upon Zion.
MIC.4.12	But they did not know the thoughts of the 
MIC.4.13	Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion; for I will make thine horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs bronze; and thou shalt break in pieces many peoples; and thou shalt consecrate their spoil unto the 
MIC.5.1	Now thou shalt be besieged by armies, O daughter of the army: he shall lay siege against us; they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.
MIC.5.2	But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto me that is to be Lord in Israel; and his goings forth are from the beginning, from the days of the ages.
MIC.5.3	Therefore he will give them up until the time that she who travails has brought forth; then the remnant of his brethren shall return with the sons of Israel.
MIC.5.4	And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the 
MIC.5.5	And he shall be our peace when the Assyrian shall come into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then we shall raise against him seven shepherds and eight principal men.
MIC.5.6	And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the blade, and the land of Nimrod with their swords; and he shall deliver us from the Assyrian when he comes against our land and when he treads within our borders.
MIC.5.7	And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as the dew of the 
MIC.5.8	And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many peoples as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he goes through and treads down and tears in pieces, there are none that can escape.
MIC.5.9	Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine enemies, and all thine adversaries shall be cut off.
MIC.5.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, said the 
MIC.5.11	and I will cause all the cities of thy land to be destroyed, and I will cause all thy fortresses to be destroyed:
MIC.5.12	and I will cause the witchcrafts to be destroyed by thy hand; and no more soothsayers shall be found in thee:
MIC.5.13	and I will cause thy graven images and thy images to be destroyed out of the midst of thee; and never again shalt thou worship the work of thine hands.
MIC.5.14	And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; so will I destroy thy cities.
MIC.5.15	And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury in the Gentiles who have not heard.
MIC.6.1	Hear ye now what the 
MIC.6.2	Hear ye, O mountains, the 
MIC.6.3	O my people, what have I done unto thee? and in what have I wearied thee? testify against me.
MIC.6.4	For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt and ransomed thee out of the house of slaves; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.
MIC.6.5	O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal: that ye may know the righteousness of the 
MIC.6.6	With what shall I present myself before the 
MIC.6.7	Will the 
MIC.6.8	He has declared unto thee, O man, what is good and what the 
MIC.6.9	The 
MIC.6.10	Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked and the scant measure that is abominable?
MIC.6.11	Can I be pure with false balances and with a bag of deceitful weights?
MIC.6.12	With which their rich men are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.
MIC.6.13	Therefore I have also made thee weak in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins.
MIC.6.14	Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take, but shalt not be saved; and that which thou dost save, I will give it up to the sword.
MIC.6.15	Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with the oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink the wine.
MIC.6.16	For the statutes of Omri have been kept and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye have walked in their counsels that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof a hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
MIC.7.1	Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.
MIC.7.2	The merciful man of the earth is missing: and there is no one upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt each man his brother with a net.
MIC.7.3	To complete the evil with their hands, the prince demands, and the judge judges for a reward; and the great man speaks the desires of his heart: and they confirm it.
MIC.7.4	The best of them is as a brier; the most upright as a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen, thy visitation, comes; now shall be their confusion.
MIC.7.5	Do not believe in a friend, do not trust in a prince; from her that lies at thy side, take care, open not thy mouth.
MIC.7.6	For the son dishonours the father, the daughter rises up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man’s enemies are those of his own house.
MIC.7.7	Therefore I will wait for the 
MIC.7.8	Do not rejoice against me, O my enemy; for if I have fallen, I shall arise; if I sit in darkness, the 
MIC.7.9	I will bear the indignation of the 
MIC.7.10	Then she that is my enemy shall see it, and shame shall cover her who said unto me, Where is the 
MIC.7.11	In the day that thy walls shall be built unto thee, in that day shall the decree of thy slavery be far removed.
MIC.7.12	In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria and from the fortified cities and from the fortress even to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.
MIC.7.13	And the land with those that dwell therein shall be made desolate, for the fruit of their doings.
MIC.7.14	Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell only in the mountain, in the midst of Carmel; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the time of old.
MIC.7.15	I will show you marvellous things as in the day when thou came out of Egypt.
MIC.7.16	The Gentiles shall see and be ashamed at all thy mighty acts: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall become deaf.
MIC.7.17	They shall lick the dust like a serpent; as the serpents of the earth, they shall tremble in their holes; they shall be filled with fear of the 
MIC.7.18	Who is a God like unto thee that pardons iniquity, and passes over the rebellion with the remnant of his heritage? He did not retain his anger for ever because he delights in mercy.
MIC.7.19	He will turn again, he will have mercy on us; he will subdue our iniquities; and will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea.
MIC.7.20	Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob and the mercy to Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the times of old.
NAM.1.1	The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite.
NAM.1.2	God is jealous, and the 
NAM.1.3	The 
NAM.1.4	He reprehends the sea and makes it dry and dries up all the rivers; Bashan was destroyed, and Carmel; and the flower of Lebanon was destroyed.
NAM.1.5	The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burned at his presence, and the world and all that dwell therein.
NAM.1.6	Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.
NAM.1.7	The 
NAM.1.8	But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of his place, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.
NAM.1.9	What do ye imagine against the 
NAM.1.10	For while they are entwined together as thorns, and while the drunkards shall be drinking, they shall be devoured as stubble full of dryness.
NAM.1.11	He has come out of thee that has imagined evil against the 
NAM.1.12	Thus hath the 
NAM.1.13	For now I will break his yoke from off thee and will burst thy bonds in sunder.
NAM.1.14	And the 
NAM.1.15	Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that brings good tidings, of him that publishes peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows; for Belial shall no longer pass through thee; he is utterly cut off.
NAM.2.1	The destroyer is risen up against thee: keep the fortress, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy power mightily.
NAM.2.2	For the 
NAM.2.3	The shield of his valiant ones shall be red, the men of his army are in scarlet, the chariot as fire of torches in the day which shall be made ready; the fir trees shall be terribly shaken.
NAM.2.4	The chariots shall rage in the streets; they shall flow through the streets, their faces like torches; they shall run like the lightnings.
NAM.2.5	He shall remember his valiant ones; they shall stumble in their walk when they make haste to their wall, and the covering shall be prepared.
NAM.2.6	The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be destroyed.
NAM.2.7	And the queen shall be taken captive; they shall order her to go up, and her maids shall take her, mourning as with the voice of doves, beating upon their breasts.
NAM.2.8	And Nineveh was of old like a pool of water; but now they flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but no one looks back.
NAM.2.9	Take the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold, for there is no end of the riches; honour, more than all the desirable furniture.
NAM.2.10	She is empty and worn out and is in pieces, and the heart melted, the knees smite together, and much pain is in the kidneys, and the faces of them all gather blackness.
NAM.2.11	What of the dwelling of the lions and of the feeding place of the young lions where the lion and the lioness walked and the lion’s whelps, and no one made them afraid?
NAM.2.12	The lion tore in pieces enough for his whelps and strangled for his lionesses and filled his holes with prey and his dens with robbery.
NAM.2.13	Behold, I speak unto thee, saith the 
NAM.3.1	Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery; stealing does not depart from her!
NAM.3.2	The noise of the whip and the noise of the rattling of the wheels and of the prancing horses and of the jumping chariots shall be heard in thee.
NAM.3.3	The horseman lifts up both the bright sword and the glittering spear, and there is a multitude of slain and a great number of carcasses; and there shall be no end of their corpses; they stumble upon their corpses,
NAM.3.4	because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot of beautiful grace, the mistress of witchcrafts that sells the Gentiles into slavery through her whoredoms and peoples through her witchcrafts.
NAM.3.5	Here I am against thee, saith the 
NAM.3.6	And I will cast abominable filth upon thee and make thee vile and will set thee as dung.
NAM.3.7	And it shall come to pass, that all those that look upon thee shall flee from thee and say, Nineveh is laid waste; who will bemoan her? from where shall I seek comforters for thee?
NAM.3.8	Art thou better than populous No that was situated among the rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was the sea, and her wall was from the sea?
NAM.3.9	Ethiopia was thy strength and Egypt with no limit; Put and Libia went to thy aid.
NAM.3.10	Yet she was carried away, she went into captivity; her young children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all her nobles were bound in chains.
NAM.3.11	Thou also shalt be drunken; thou shalt be encompassed; thou also shalt seek strength because of the enemy.
NAM.3.12	All thy strongholds are like fig trees with the firstripe figs; if they are shaken, they even fall into the mouth of the eater.
NAM.3.13	Behold, thy people in the midst of thee shall be like women; the gates of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies; the fire shall devour thy bars.
NAM.3.14	Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go into clay, and tread the mortar, make strong the brickkiln.
NAM.3.15	There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee off; it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.
NAM.3.16	Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven; the cankerworm spoils and flies away.
NAM.3.17	Thy princes shall be as the locusts and thy captains as the great grasshoppers which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but when the sun arises, they flee away, and it is not known where they were.
NAM.3.18	Thy shepherds have slumbered, O king of Assyria; thy valiant ones are at rest; thy people scattered themselves upon the mountains, and there is no one to unite them.
NAM.3.19	There is no cure for thy destruction; thy wound is grievous; all that hear thy story shall clap their hands over thee; for upon whom has not thy wickedness passed continually?
HAB.1.1	The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.
HAB.1.2	O 
HAB.1.3	Why dost thou cause me to see iniquity and cause me to behold grievance and destruction and violence before me, in addition to those that raise up strife and contention?
HAB.1.4	Therefore the law is weakened, and the judgment does not go forth true: for the wicked compasses about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceeds.
HAB.1.5	Behold among the Gentiles and regard and wonder marvelously, for a work shall be done in your days which ye will not believe, though it be told you.
HAB.1.6	For, behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which march through the breadth of the earth to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.
HAB.1.7	She is terrible and dreadful: from her herself shall go forth their rights and their grandeur.
HAB.1.8	Their horses shall be swifter than tigers and are sharper than the evening wolves, and their horsemen shall multiply themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as eagles that hasten to eat.
HAB.1.9	All of her shall come for the prey, before their faces an east wind, and they shall gather the captives as the sand.
HAB.1.10	And he shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto him, he shall deride every fortress and shall heap dust and take it.
HAB.1.11	Then he shall become arrogant against God, and he shall pass ahead and shall be found guilty, imputing this his power unto his god.
HAB.1.12	Art thou not from the beginning, O 
HAB.1.13	Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil and canst not look on iniquity: why dost thou look upon those that deal treacherously and hold thy tongue when the wicked devour the man that is more righteous than he?
HAB.1.14	And dost make men as the fishes of the sea, as reptiles that have no lord?
HAB.1.15	He shall take up all of them with his hook; he shall catch them in his net and gather them in his drag: therefore, he shall rejoice and be glad.
HAB.1.16	Therefore, he shall sacrifice unto his net and burn incense unto his drag because by them his portion is fat, and his food plenteous.
HAB.1.17	Shall he therefore empty his net, or have pity to stop slaying Gentiles continually?
HAB.2.1	I will stand upon my watch and affirm my foot upon the fortress and will watch to see what he will say in me and what I shall answer to my question.
HAB.2.2	And the 
HAB.2.3	For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie; though it tarry, wait for it because it will surely come; wait for it.
HAB.2.4	Behold, he whose soul is not upright in him will become filled with pride, but the just in his faith shall live.
HAB.2.5	Even more than he who is given over to wine, the transposer, the proud man, shall not remain, who enlarges his desire as Sheol and is as death and cannot be satisfied, but gathered unto him all the Gentiles and heaps unto him all the peoples;
HAB.2.6	Shall not all these take up a parable against him and a taunting enigma against him and say, Woe to him that multiplied that which was not his! And for how long would he pile thick clay upon himself?
HAB.2.7	Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee and awake those that shall take thy place, and thou shalt be for a prey unto them?
HAB.2.8	Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the other peoples shall spoil thee because of human blood and for the robberies of the land, of the cities, and of all that dwell therein.
HAB.2.9	Woe to him that covets ill-gotten gain by violence for his house that he may set his nest on high, that he may escape from the power of evil!
HAB.2.10	Thou hast taken shameful counsel for thy house by cutting off many peoples and hast committed a sin against thy life.
HAB.2.11	For the stone shall cry out from the wall, and the beam out of the timber shall answer it.
HAB.2.12	Woe to him that builds the city with blood and founds the village with iniquity!
HAB.2.13	Is this not of the 
HAB.2.14	For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the 
HAB.2.15	Woe unto him that gives his neighbours drink, that puts thy bottle to them, and makes them drunken also, that thou may look on their nakedness!
HAB.2.16	Thou hast filled thyself with dishonour instead of honour; drink thou also, and thy foreskin shall be uncovered; the cup of the 
HAB.2.17	For the violence of Lebanon shall fall upon thee and the destruction of the wild beasts shall break thee, because of the human blood, and of the robbery of the land, of the cities, and of all that dwell therein.
HAB.2.18	Of what profit is the graven image that its maker has sculpted; the molten image, that teaches lies, so that in making dumb images the maker trusts in his work?
HAB.2.19	Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise! Can it ever teach? Behold, it is laid over with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all within it.
HAB.2.20	But the 
HAB.3.1	A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, because of all the ignorance.
HAB.3.2	O 
HAB.3.3	God shall come from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was filled with his praise.
HAB.3.4	And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out of his hand; and there was hidden his strength.
HAB.3.5	Before his face went mortality, and burning coals went forth from his feet.
HAB.3.6	He stood and measured the earth; he beheld and drove out the Gentiles; and the ancient mountains crumbled, the ancient hills; the ways of the world bowed unto him.
HAB.3.7	I saw the tents of Cushan as nothing, and the curtains of the land of Midian trembled.
HAB.3.8	Oh 
HAB.3.9	Thy bow was entirely uncovered, and the oaths unto the tribes, eternal word, when thou didst divide the earth with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of the waters passed by; the abyss uttered its voice; the deep lifted up its hands.
HAB.3.11	The sun and the moon stood still in their habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went and at the shining of thy glittering spear.
HAB.3.12	Thou didst tread upon the land in wrath; thou didst thresh the Gentiles in anger.
HAB.3.13	Thou didst go forth to save thy people, to save with thine anointed; thou didst shatter the head of the house of the wicked by uncovering the foundation unto the neck. Selah.
HAB.3.14	Thou didst strike through with his staffs the heads of his villages, who as a whirlwind attempted to scatter me; their pride was as to devour the poor secretly.
HAB.3.15	Thou didst make a way through the sea for thine horses through the heap of great waters.
HAB.3.16	When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice; rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my seat, that I might rest in the day of trouble when he comes up unto the people to destroy them.
HAB.3.17	Because the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit be on the vines; the labour of the olive shall lie, and the cultivated fields shall yield no food; the sheep shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:
HAB.3.18	yet I will rejoice in the 
HAB.3.19	The 
ZEP.1.1	The word of the 
ZEP.1.2	I will utterly destroy all things from off the face of the earth, saith the 
ZEP.1.3	I will destroy the men and the beasts; I will destroy the fowls of the heaven and the fishes of the sea, and the wicked shall stumble; and I will cut off men from upon the face of the earth, saith the 
ZEP.1.4	And I will extend my hand over Judah and over all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and I will cut off the remnant of Baal from this place and the name of their religious persons with their priests
ZEP.1.5	and those that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops and those that worship swearing by the 
ZEP.1.6	and those that have turned back from following the 
ZEP.1.7	Be silent before the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the 
ZEP.1.8	And it shall come to pass in the day of the 
ZEP.1.9	In the same day I will also make a visitation upon all those that leap over the door, who fill their masters’ houses with robbery and deceit.
ZEP.1.10	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
ZEP.1.11	Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people are cut down; all those that brought ye silver are cut off.
ZEP.1.12	And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with lamps and make a visitation upon the men that are settled on their lees, that say in their heart, The 
ZEP.1.13	Therefore their goods shall become a spoil, and their houses a desolation: they shall build houses, but not inhabit them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine thereof.
ZEP.1.14	The great day of the 
ZEP.1.15	That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,
ZEP.1.16	A day of the shofar and alarm upon the strong cities, and upon the high towers.
ZEP.1.17	And I will bring distress upon men that they shall walk like blind men because they have sinned against the 
ZEP.1.18	Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver them in the day of the 
ZEP.2.1	Search yourselves and one another, O unfriendly people;
ZEP.2.2	before the decree is executed, before the day passes as the chaff, before the fierce anger of the 
ZEP.2.3	Seek ye the 
ZEP.2.4	For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall spoil Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.
ZEP.2.5	Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the people of the Cherethites! the word of the 
ZEP.2.6	And the sea coast shall be for dwellings and cottages for pastors, and sheepfolds.
ZEP.2.7	And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah; they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon they shall sleep for the night; for the 
ZEP.2.8	I have heard the reproaches of Moab, and the revilings of the sons of Ammon, by which they have dishonoured my people and magnified themselves over their border.
ZEP.2.9	Therefore as I live, said the 
ZEP.2.10	This shall come upon them for their pride because they have reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the 
ZEP.2.11	The 
ZEP.2.12	Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.
ZEP.2.13	And he will stretch out his hand over the north wind and destroy Assyria and will make Nineveh a desolation and dry like a wilderness.
ZEP.2.14	And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts of the Gentiles; both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge in her thresholds; their voice shall sing in the windows; desolation shall be in the gates: for her cedar work shall be uncovered.
ZEP.2.15	This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! anyone that passes by her shall hiss and wag his hand.
ZEP.3.1	Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing city!
ZEP.3.2	She did not obey the voice; she did not receive correction; she did not trust in the 
ZEP.3.3	Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are evening wolves; they do not leave a bone for tomorrow.
ZEP.3.4	Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests have polluted the sanctuary; they have falsified the law.
ZEP.3.5	The just 
ZEP.3.6	I have caused the Gentiles to be cut off: their castles are desolate; I made their streets waste until no one passes by; their cities are destroyed, so that there is no man left, there is no inhabitant.
ZEP.3.7	Saying, Surely now thou wilt fear me; thou wilt receive chastisement; so thy dwelling shall not be thrown down, all of which I visited upon her; but they rose early, and corrupted all their doings.
ZEP.3.8	Therefore wait for me, said the 
ZEP.3.9	For then I will restore to the peoples the pure language that they may all call upon the name of the 
ZEP.3.10	From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the daughter of my dispersed, shall bring me an offering.
ZEP.3.11	In that day thou shalt not be ashamed for any of thy doings, in which thou hast rebelled against me, for then I will take away out of the midst of thee those that rejoice in thy pride, and thou shalt no longer be haughty because of the mountain of my holiness.
ZEP.3.12	I will also leave in the midst of thee a poor and humble people, and they shall wait in the name of the 
ZEP.3.13	The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity nor speak lies; neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth, for they shall be fed and lie down, and no one shall make them afraid.
ZEP.3.14	Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout with joy O Israel; be glad and rejoice with all thy heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.
ZEP.3.15	The 
ZEP.3.16	In that time it shall be said to Jerusalem, Do not fear; and to Zion, Do not let thine hands be slack.
ZEP.3.17	The 
ZEP.3.18	I will gather those that are weary because of the long time, who are thine, unto whom her confusion was a burden.
ZEP.3.19	Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee; and I will save her that is lame and gather her that was driven out; and I will make them a praise and of good reputation in every land where they have been put to shame.
ZEP.3.20	At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I gather you; for I will give you as fame and as praise among all peoples of the earth, when I shall return your captives before your eyes, saith the 
HAG.1.1	In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the 
HAG.1.2	Thus speaketh the 
HAG.1.3	Then came the word of the 
HAG.1.4	Do you have time, all of you, to dwell in your panelled houses, and this house is deserted?
HAG.1.5	Now therefore thus hath the 
HAG.1.6	Ye have sown much and bring in little; ye eat, but ye are not filled; ye drink, but ye are not satisfied; ye clothe yourselves, but you are not warm; and he that is a hireling receives his wages in a bag with holes.
HAG.1.7	Thus hath the 
HAG.1.8	Go up to the mountain and bring wood and build the house; and I will place my will in her, and I will be glorified, said the 
HAG.1.9	Ye look for much and find little; and when ye lock it up at home, I shall blow upon it. Why? said the 
HAG.1.10	Therefore the rain of the heavens over you is held back, and the earth has held back her fruits.
HAG.1.11	And I called for a drought upon this land and upon the mountains and upon the wheat and upon the wine and upon the oil and upon that which the earth brings forth and upon the men, and upon the beasts and upon every labour of hands.
HAG.1.12	Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, heard the voice of the 
HAG.1.13	Then spoke Haggai the ambassador of the 
HAG.1.14	And the 
HAG.1.15	in the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.
HAG.2.1	In the seventh month, in the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the 
HAG.2.2	Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,
HAG.2.3	Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory? and how do ye see her now? Is she not as nothing before your eyes?
HAG.2.4	Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, said the 
HAG.2.5	The word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt and my Spirit is in the midst of you: do not fear.
HAG.2.6	For thus hath the 
HAG.2.7	and I will shake all the Gentiles; and the desire of all the Gentiles shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, said the 
HAG.2.8	The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, said the 
HAG.2.9	The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, said the 
HAG.2.10	In the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
HAG.2.11	Thus hath the 
HAG.2.12	If one bears holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touches bread or pottage or wine, or oil or any food, shall it be made holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
HAG.2.13	Then Haggai said, If one that is unclean by a dead body touches any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.
HAG.2.14	Then Haggai answered, and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, said the 
HAG.2.15	And now, I pray you, consider in your heart from this day forth, from before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the 
HAG.2.16	since these things were: when one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the pressfat to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.
HAG.2.17	I smote you with the east wind and with mildew and with hail in all the labours of your hands, yet ye did not turn to me, said the 
HAG.2.18	Consider now in your heart from this day forth, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the foundation of the 
HAG.2.19	Is not the seed yet in the barn? Not even the vine, nor the fig tree, nor the pomegranate, nor the olive tree, has blossomed yet, but from this day will I bless you.
HAG.2.20	And the word of the 
HAG.2.21	Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I cause the heavens and the earth to shake,
HAG.2.22	and I will overthrow the throne of the kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdom of the Gentiles, and I will overthrow the chariot and those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come down, each one by the sword of his brother.
HAG.2.23	In that day, said the 
ZEC.1.1	In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
ZEC.1.2	The 
ZEC.1.3	Therefore thou shalt say unto them, Thus hath the 
ZEC.1.4	Do not be as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have cried, saying, Thus hath the 
ZEC.1.5	Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live for ever?
ZEC.1.6	But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my slaves the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? Therefore they returned from captivity and said, Like as the 
ZEC.1.7	Upon the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the 
ZEC.1.8	I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and behind him there were red horses, speckled, and white.
ZEC.1.9	Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that talked with me said unto me, I will show thee who these are.
ZEC.1.10	And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and said, These are those whom the 
ZEC.1.11	And they answered the angel of the 
ZEC.1.12	Then the angel of the 
ZEC.1.13	And the 
ZEC.1.14	So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.15	And I am very sore displeased with the Gentiles that are at ease; for I was but a little displeased, and they helped forward the affliction.
ZEC.1.16	Therefore thus hath the 
ZEC.1.17	Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the 
ZEC.1.18	Then I lifted up my eyes and saw and behold four horns.
ZEC.1.19	And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are these? And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.
ZEC.1.20	And the 
ZEC.1.21	Then I said, What do these come to do? And he spoke, saying, These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no one lifted up his head, but these are come to cause them to tremble, to cut down the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over the land of Judah to scatter it.
ZEC.2.1	I lifted up my eyes again and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.
ZEC.2.2	Then I said, Where goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its breadth and what is its length.
ZEC.2.3	And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him
ZEC.2.4	and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and beasts in the midst of her:
ZEC.2.5	For I, saith the 
ZEC.2.6	Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the 
ZEC.2.7	O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon, thou must escape.
ZEC.2.8	For thus hath the 
ZEC.2.9	For, behold, I raise my hand regarding them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants; and ye shall know that the 
ZEC.2.10	Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for, behold, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, said the 
ZEC.2.11	And many Gentiles shall join themselves unto the 
ZEC.2.12	And the 
ZEC.2.13	Be silent, O all flesh, before the 
ZEC.3.1	And he showed me Joshua the high priest, standing before the angel of the 
ZEC.3.2	And the 
ZEC.3.3	Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and stood before the angel.
ZEC.3.4	And the angel answered and spoke unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I have caused thee to be clothed with new raiment.
ZEC.3.5	And I said, Let them set a clean mitre upon his head. So they set a clean mitre upon his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the 
ZEC.3.6	And the angel of the 
ZEC.3.7	Thus saith the 
ZEC.3.8	Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee, for they are men of wonder. Behold, I bring forth my slave the BRANCH.
ZEC.3.9	For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone there are seven eyes; behold, I will engrave his labour, saith the 
ZEC.3.10	In that day, saith the 
ZEC.4.1	And the angel that talked with me came again and waked me, as a man that is wakened out of his sleep,
ZEC.4.2	and said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked and behold a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and its seven lamps upon the lampstand, and seven pipes for the lamps, which are upon the top thereof:
ZEC.4.3	and two olive trees over it, one upon the right hand side of the bowl and the other upon the left hand side thereof.
ZEC.4.4	So I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me, saying, What is this, my lord?
ZEC.4.5	Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Dost thou not know what this is? And I said, No, my lord.
ZEC.4.6	Then he answered and spoke unto me, saying, This is the word of the 
ZEC.4.7	Who art thou, O great mountain before Zerubbabel? Thou shalt be reduced to a plain; and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.
ZEC.4.8	And the word of the 
ZEC.4.9	The hands of Zerubbabel shall lay the foundation of this house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know that the 
ZEC.4.10	For who has despised the day of small beginnings? for they shall rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. Those seven are the eyes of the 
ZEC.4.11	Then I spoke and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right hand side of the lampstand and upon the left hand side thereof?
ZEC.4.12	And I spoke the second time and said unto him, What are these two olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves?
ZEC.4.13	And he answered me and said, Dost thou not know what these are? And I said, No, my lord.
ZEC.4.14	Then he said, These two sons of oil are those that stand by the Lord of the whole earth.
ZEC.5.1	Then I turned and lifted up my eyes and looked, and behold a flying roll.
ZEC.5.2	And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits.
ZEC.5.3	Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole earth; for every one that steals (as it is written on one side of the roll) shall be destroyed; and every one that swears (as it is written on the other side of the roll) shall be destroyed.
ZEC.5.4	I brought it forth, said the 
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel that talked with me went forth and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes and see what is this that goes forth.
ZEC.5.6	And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah to measure wheat that goes forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance in all the earth.
ZEC.5.7	And, behold, they lifted up a talent of lead, and a woman was sitting in the midst of that ephah.
ZEC.5.8	And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast her into the midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof.
ZEC.5.9	Then I lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, there came out two women, and the wind was in their wings for they had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heavens.
ZEC.5.10	Then I said to the angel that talked with me, Where do these bear the ephah?
ZEC.5.11	And he said unto me, To build it a house in the land of Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her own base.
ZEC.6.1	And I turned and lifted up my eyes and looked, and, behold, there came four chariots out from between two mountains, and those mountains were of brass.
ZEC.6.2	In the first chariot were red horses and in the second chariot black horses;
ZEC.6.3	in the third chariot white horses and in the fourth chariot grisled and bay horses.
ZEC.6.4	Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me, What is this, my lord?
ZEC.6.5	And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.
ZEC.6.6	The one with the black horses went forth towards the north country, and the white went forth after them, and the grisled went forth toward the south country.
ZEC.6.7	And the bay went forth and sought to go that they might walk to and fro through the earth, and he said, Go from here; walk to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro through the earth.
ZEC.6.8	Then he called me and spoke unto me, saying, Behold, those that went toward the north country have quieted my spirit in the north country.
ZEC.6.9	And the word of the 
ZEC.6.10	Take of those of that returned from the captivity, of the lineage of Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, and come thou the same day and go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whom are come from Babylon.
ZEC.6.11	Thou shalt take silver and gold and make crowns and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest,
ZEC.6.12	and speak unto him, saying, Thus spoke the 
ZEC.6.13	He shall build the temple of the 
ZEC.6.14	And Helem and Tobijah and Jedaiah and Hen the son of Zephaniah shall have crowns for a memorial in the temple of the 
ZEC.6.15	And those that are far off shall come and build in the temple of the 
ZEC.7.1	And it came to pass in the fourth year of King Darius that the word of the 
ZEC.7.2	when they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and Regemmelech and their men, to pray before the 
ZEC.7.3	and to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the 
ZEC.7.4	Then the word of the 
ZEC.7.5	Speak unto all the people of the land and to the priests, saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me, even to me?
ZEC.7.6	And when ye ate, and when ye drank, did ye not eat for yourselves, and drink for yourselves?
ZEC.7.7	Are these not the words which the 
ZEC.7.8	And the word of the 
ZEC.7.9	Thus hath the 
ZEC.7.10	and do not oppress the widow nor the fatherless, the stranger, nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his brother in your heart.
ZEC.7.11	But they refused to hearken and pulled away the shoulder and stopped their ears that they should not hear.
ZEC.7.12	Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone lest they should hear the law and the words which the 
ZEC.7.13	Therefore it is come to pass that as he cried and they would not hear, so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the 
ZEC.7.14	but I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the Gentiles whom they did not know. Thus the land was desolate after them that no man passed through nor returned; for they laid the desirable land desolate.
ZEC.8.1	Again the word of the 
ZEC.8.2	Thus hath the 
ZEC.8.3	Thus hath the 
ZEC.8.4	Thus hath the 
ZEC.8.5	And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls who shall play in them.
ZEC.8.6	Thus saith the 
ZEC.8.7	Thus hath the 
ZEC.8.8	and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness.
ZEC.8.9	Thus hath the 
ZEC.8.10	For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or came in because of the affliction: for I set all men each one against his neighbour.
ZEC.8.11	But now I will not do unto the residue of this people as in the former days, said the 
ZEC.8.12	For the seed of peace shall remain; the vine shall give her fruit, and the ground shall give her fruit, and the heavens shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all this.
ZEC.8.13	And it shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the Gentiles, O house of Judah and house of Israel; so will I save you that ye might be a blessing; fear not, but let your hands be strong.
ZEC.8.14	For thus hath the 
ZEC.8.15	so again have I thought in these days to do well unto Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; do not fear.
ZEC.8.16	These are the things that ye shall do: Speak each one the truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates;
ZEC.8.17	and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things that I hate, said the 
ZEC.8.18	And the word of the 
ZEC.8.19	Thus hath the 
ZEC.8.20	Thus hath the 
ZEC.8.21	and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go to pray before the 
ZEC.8.22	And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the 
ZEC.8.23	Thus hath the 
ZEC.9.1	The burden of the word of the 
ZEC.9.2	And Hamath also shall come to an end in her; Tyre, and Zidon, though it be very wise.
ZEC.9.3	And Tyre built herself a stronghold and heaped up silver as the dust and fine gold as the mire of the streets.
ZEC.9.4	Behold, the Lord will impoverish her, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.
ZEC.9.5	Ashkelon shall see it and fear; Gaza also shall see it and be very sorrowful, and Ekron for her hope shall be confounded; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.
ZEC.9.6	And a stranger shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.
ZEC.9.7	And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth, but some of them shall remain for our God, and they shall be as captains in Judah, and Ekron as the Jebusite.
ZEC.9.8	And I will be the defence and firm support to my house from him that comes and goes; and no oppressor shall pass through them any more, for now I have seen with my eyes.
ZEC.9.9	Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout with joy, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, thy King shall come unto thee: just, and a saviour; humble, and riding upon an ass, even upon a colt the foal of an ass.
ZEC.9.10	And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be broken and he shall speak peace unto the Gentiles; and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.
ZEC.9.11	As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have taken thy prisoners out of the pit in which there is no water.
ZEC.9.12	Return to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope; even today I declare that I will render double unto thee;
ZEC.9.13	for I have bent Judah for me as a bow, and I made Ephraim his arrow, and I will raise up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and make thee as the sword of a mighty man.
ZEC.9.14	And the 
ZEC.9.15	The 
ZEC.9.16	And the 
ZEC.9.17	For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! The wheat shall make the young men cheerful, and the wine the maids.
ZEC.10.1	Ask ye of the 
ZEC.10.2	For the idols have spoken vanity and the diviners have seen a lie and have told vain dreams; they comfort in vain; therefore they went their way like sheep; they were humbled because there was no shepherd.
ZEC.10.3	My anger is kindled against the pastors, and I will visit the he goats, for the 
ZEC.10.4	Out of him shall come the corner, out of him the stake, out of him the battle bow, out of him also every oppressor.
ZEC.10.5	And they shall be as mighty men, who tread down their enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle; and they shall fight because the 
ZEC.10.6	For I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will keep the house of Joseph, and I will cause them to return; for I shall have compassion upon them, and they shall be as though I had not cast them off, for I am the 
ZEC.10.7	And those of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their heart shall rejoice as through wine, their sons shall also see it and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the 
ZEC.10.8	I will hiss for them and gather them; for I have ransomed them; and they shall be multiplied as they were multiplied.
ZEC.10.9	It was good that I planted them among the peoples; even in far countries there shall be mention made of me; and they shall live with their sons and turn again.
ZEC.10.10	I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt and gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for them.
ZEC.10.11	And the tribulation shall pass through the sea and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down, and the sceptre of Egypt shall be lost.
ZEC.10.12	And I will strengthen them in the 
ZEC.11.1	Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars.
ZEC.11.2	Howl, fir tree, for the cedar is fallen because the magnificent are cut down; howl, O ye oaks of Bashan, for the strong mountain is brought down.
ZEC.11.3	There is a voice of the howling of the pastors; for their magnificence is destroyed; a voice of the roaring of young lions, for the pride of the Jordan is destroyed.
ZEC.11.4	Thus hath the 
ZEC.11.5	whose buyers slayed them and held themselves not guilty; and he that sold them said, Blessed be the 
ZEC.11.6	Therefore I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the 
ZEC.11.7	And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of the flock. For I took unto me two staves: the one I named Beauty, and the other Bands; and I fed the flock.
ZEC.11.8	I also cut off three shepherds in one month; and my soul was in anguish for them, and their soul also abhorred me.
ZEC.11.9	Then I said, I will not feed you any longer; the one that dies, let it die; and the one that is to be lost, let it be lost; and let the rest eat each one the flesh of another.
ZEC.11.10	And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.
ZEC.11.11	And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the flock that look unto me knew that it was the word of the 
ZEC.11.12	And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my wages; and if not, forbear. So they weighed for my wages thirty pieces of silver.
ZEC.11.13	And the 
ZEC.11.14	Then I cut asunder my other staff, even Bands, that I might break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.
ZEC.11.15	And the 
ZEC.11.16	For, behold, I raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall not visit those that are lost, neither shall seek the young one nor heal the one that is broken nor carry the one that is tired, but he shall eat the flesh of the fat and tear their hoofs in pieces.
ZEC.11.17	Woe to the useless pastor that leaves the flock! the sword shall be upon his arm and upon his right eye; his arm shall be completely dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly darkened.
ZEC.12.1	The burden of the word of the 
ZEC.12.2	Behold, I place Jerusalem as a cup of poison unto all the peoples round about and also unto those of Judah who shall be in the siege against Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.3	And it shall be that in that day I will make Jerusalem a burdensome stone unto all peoples; all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in pieces, and all the Gentiles of the earth shall gather themselves together against her.
ZEC.12.4	In that day, said the 
ZEC.12.5	And the captains of Judah shall say in their heart, My strength is the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the 
ZEC.12.6	In that day I will make the captains of Judah like a hearth of fire among the wood and like a torch of fire among the sheaves; and they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right hand and on the left; and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, even in Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.7	And the 
ZEC.12.8	In that day the 
ZEC.12.9	And it shall come to pass in that day that I will seek to destroy all the Gentiles that come against Jerusalem.
ZEC.12.10	And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and of prayer, and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn over him as one mourns for his only son, afflicting themselves over him as one afflicts himself over his firstborn.
ZEC.12.11	In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.
ZEC.12.12	And the land shall mourn, each family apart; the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;
ZEC.12.13	the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;
ZEC.12.14	all the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.
ZEC.13.1	In that time there shall be an open fountain for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem against sin and against uncleanness.
ZEC.13.2	And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the 
ZEC.13.3	And it shall come to pass, that when anyone else shall prophesy, then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of the 
ZEC.13.4	And it shall come to pass in that time, that the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he has prophesied; neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:
ZEC.13.5	but he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a husbandman of the land; for I learned this from man from my youth.
ZEC.13.6	And they shall ask him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.
ZEC.13.7	Awake, O sword, upon the pastor and upon the man that is my fellow, said the 
ZEC.13.8	And it shall come to pass that in all the land, said the 
ZEC.13.9	And I will put the third part into the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold is tried; He shall call on my name, and I will hear him; I will say, My people, and he shall say, The 
ZEC.14.1	Behold, the day of the 
ZEC.14.2	For I will gather all the Gentiles against Jerusalem in battle, and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity, but the remnant of the people shall not be cut off from the city.
ZEC.14.3	Then the 
ZEC.14.4	And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward the west, making a very great valley; and half of the mountain shall remove toward the north and half of it toward the south.
ZEC.14.5	And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal; and ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; and the 
ZEC.14.6	And it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear, nor dark;
ZEC.14.7	but it shall be one day which is known to the 
ZEC.14.8	And it shall be in that day that living waters shall go out from Jerusalem: half of them toward the eastern sea and half of them toward the western sea; in summer and in winter it shall be.
ZEC.14.9	And the 
ZEC.14.10	All the land shall become a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem; and she shall be lifted up and inhabited in her place from Benjamin’s gate unto the place of the first gate unto the gate of the corners, and from the tower of Hananeel unto the king’s winepresses.
ZEC.14.11	And men shall dwell in it, and it shall never be anathema again; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.
ZEC.14.12	And this shall be the plague with which the 
ZEC.14.13	And it shall come to pass in that day that a great destruction from the 
ZEC.14.14	And Judah also shall fight against Jerusalem; and the wealth of all the Gentiles round about shall be gathered together: gold and silver and apparel in great abundance.
ZEC.14.15	And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that were in the armies.
ZEC.14.16	And every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from year to year to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.17	And it shall be that whoever will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the 
ZEC.14.18	And if the family of Egypt does not go up and does not come, there shall be no rain upon them; instead there shall be the plague, with which the 
ZEC.14.19	This shall be the punishment of the sin of Egypt and of the sin of all the Gentiles that do not come up to celebrate the feast of the tabernacles.
ZEC.14.20	In that day there shall be written upon the bells of the horses, HOLINESS UNTO THE 
ZEC.14.21	And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness unto the 
MAL.1.1	The burden of the word of the 
MAL.1.2	I have loved you, said the 
MAL.1.3	and I rejected Esau and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
MAL.1.4	When Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus hath the 
MAL.1.5	And your eyes shall see and ye shall say, The 
MAL.1.6	The son honours his father and the slave his master; if then I am a father, where is my honour? and if I am a master, where is my fear? said the 
MAL.1.7	Ye offer polluted bread upon my altar; and ye say, In what have we polluted thee? In that ye say, We die of hunger in the service of the 
MAL.1.8	And when ye offer the blind animal for sacrifice, is it not evil? Likewise when ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy prince; will he be pleased with thee or accept thy person? said the 
MAL.1.9	And now, therefore, beseech the face of God, and he will have compassion on us; this has come by your hand: will he regard your persons? said the 
MAL.1.10	Who is there even among you that would shut the doors or tend the fire on my altar for free? I have no pleasure in you, said the 
MAL.1.11	For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same, my name is great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense is offered unto my name, and a clean offering; for my name is great among the Gentiles, said the 
MAL.1.12	And ye have profaned it when ye say, We die of hunger at the service of the 
MAL.1.13	And ye say, Behold, what a weariness it is! and ye have rejected it, said the 
MAL.1.14	But cursed be the deceiver, who has in his flock a male and vows and sacrifices unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the 
MAL.2.1	And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.
MAL.2.2	If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to give glory unto my name, said the 
MAL.2.3	Behold, I reprehend your seed and spread the dung upon your faces, even the dung of your solemnities; and ye shall be removed with it.
MAL.2.4	And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you, that my covenant might be with Levi, said the 
MAL.2.5	My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to him for the fear with which he feared me and was broken before my name.
MAL.2.6	The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: he walked with me in peace and righteousness and turned many away from iniquity.
MAL.2.7	For the priest’s lips keep wisdom, and they seek the law at his mouth; for he is an angel of the 
MAL.2.8	But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to stumble in the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi, said the 
MAL.2.9	Therefore I have also made you contemptible and base before all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but have been partial in the law.
MAL.2.10	Have we not all one father? has not one God created us? why do we despise each man his brother by breaking the covenant of our fathers?
MAL.2.11	Judah has dealt treacherously, and an abomination has been committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah has profaned the holiness of the 
MAL.2.12	The 
MAL.2.13	And once again ye shall cover the altar of the 
MAL.2.14	Yet ye say, Why? Because the 
MAL.2.15	And did he not make one, having in himself abundance of the Spirit? And why one? That he might seek offspring of God. Therefore take heed to your spirit and let no one deal treacherously against the wife of his youth.
MAL.2.16	He that rejects her, sending her away, said the 
MAL.2.17	Ye have wearied the 
MAL.3.1	Behold, I send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me; and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, and the angel of the covenant, whom ye desire: behold, he comes, said the 
MAL.3.2	But who may abide the time of his coming? and who shall stand when he appears? for he shall be like a refiner’s fire and like fullers’ soap:
MAL.3.3	And he shall sit to refine and to purify the silver: for he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver that they may offer unto the 
MAL.3.4	Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasant unto the 
MAL.3.5	And I will come near unto you for judgment; and I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers and against the adulterers and against false swearers and against those that oppress the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger from his right, and do not fear me, said the 
MAL.3.6	For I am the 
MAL.3.7	Even from the days of your fathers, ye had departed from my ordinances and had never kept them. Return unto me, and I will return unto you, said the 
MAL.3.8	Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, In what have we robbed thee? In the tithes and the offerings.
MAL.3.9	Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye, even this whole nation, have robbed me.
MAL.3.10	Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, and there shall be food in my house, and prove me now in this, said the 
MAL.3.11	And I will reprehend the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of the ground; neither shall the vine in the field abort, said the 
MAL.3.12	And all the Gentiles shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a delightsome land, said the 
MAL.3.13	Your words have prevailed against me, saith the 
MAL.3.14	Ye have said, It is vain to serve God, and what profit is it that we have kept his law and that we walk mournfully before the 
MAL.3.15	We say, therefore, now, that blessed are the proud and even that those that work wickedness are prospered; those that tempted God have escaped.
MAL.3.16	Then those that feared the 
MAL.3.17	And they shall be mine, said the 
MAL.3.18	Therefore become ye converted, and ye shall make a difference between the just and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that did not serve him.
MAL.4.1	For, behold, the day comes that shall burn as an oven; and all the proud, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble; and the day that comes shall burn them up, said the 
MAL.4.2	But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness be born, and in his wings he shall bring saving health; and ye shall go forth and jump like calves of the herd.
MAL.4.3	And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet in the day that I make, said the 
MAL.4.4	Remember ye the law of Moses my slave, which I commanded unto him in Horeb statutes and my rights over all Israel.
MAL.4.5	Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and terrible day of the 
MAL.4.6	and he shall convert the heart of the fathers to the sons, and the heart of the sons to the fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with destruction.
MAT.1.1	The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.
MAT.1.2	Abraham begat Isaac; Isaac begat Jacob; Jacob begat Judas and his brothers;
MAT.1.3	Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; Phares begat Esrom; Esrom begat Aram;
MAT.1.4	Aram begat Aminadab; Aminadab begat Naasson; Naasson begat Salmon;
MAT.1.5	Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; Booz begat Obed of Ruth; Obed begat Jesse;
MAT.1.6	Jesse begat David the king; David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
MAT.1.7	Solomon begat Roboam; Roboam begat Abia; Abia begat Asa;
MAT.1.8	Asa begat Josaphat; Josaphat begat Joram; Joram begat Ozias;
MAT.1.9	Ozias begat Joatham; Joatham begat Achaz; Achaz begat Ezekias;
MAT.1.10	Ezekias begat Manasses; Manasses begat Amon; Amon begat Josias;
MAT.1.11	Josias begat Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon;
MAT.1.12	after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
MAT.1.13	Zorobabel begat Abiud; Abiud begat Eliakim; Eliakim begat Azor;
MAT.1.14	Azor begat Sadoc; Sadoc begat Achim; Achim begat Eliud;
MAT.1.15	Eliud begat Eleazar; Eleazar begat Matthan; Matthan begat Jacob;
MAT.1.16	Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
MAT.1.17	So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; from the carrying away into Babylon unto the Christ are fourteen generations.
MAT.1.18	Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: That being, his mother Mary espoused to Joseph (before they came together) she was found with child of the Holy Spirit.
MAT.1.19	Then Joseph her husband, being just and not willing to expose her publicly, desired to leave her secretly.
MAT.1.20	But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in dreams, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.
MAT.1.21	And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.
MAT.1.22	Now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
MAT.1.23	Behold, a virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is God With Us.
MAT.1.24	Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife
MAT.1.25	and knew her not until she had brought forth her firstborn son, and he called his name Jesus.
MAT.2.1	Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
MAT.2.2	saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? We have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him.
MAT.2.3	When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.
MAT.2.4	And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he asked them where the Christ should be born.
MAT.2.5	And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea, for thus it is written by the prophet,
MAT.2.6	And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least among the princes of Juda, for out of thee shall come a Leader that shall shepherd my people Israel.
MAT.2.7	Then Herod, calling the wise men unto him secretly, understood of them with diligence the time of the appearing of the star;
MAT.2.8	and sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go there and search diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again that I may come and worship him also.
MAT.2.9	When they had heard the king, they departed; and, behold, the star, which they had seen in the east, went before them until it arrived and stood over where the young child was.
MAT.2.10	Seeing the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.
MAT.2.11	And entering into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother; and falling down, they worshipped him; and opening their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold and frankincense and myrrh.
MAT.2.12	And being warned by divine revelation in dreams that they should not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.
MAT.2.13	And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in dreams, saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt and remain there until I bring thee word, for Herod will seek the young child to kill him.
MAT.2.14	And awaking, he took the young child and his mother by night and departed into Egypt
MAT.2.15	and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
MAT.2.16	Then Herod, seeing that he was mocked of the wise men, was exceeding wroth and sent forth and killed all the children that were in Bethlehem, and in all the borders thereof, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had understood of the wise men.
MAT.2.17	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the Lord through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
MAT.2.18	In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation and weeping and great mourning, Rachel was weeping for her children and would not be comforted because they perished.
MAT.2.19	But when Herod was dead, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared in dreams to Joseph in Egypt,
MAT.2.20	saying, Arise and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel, for they are dead who sought the death of the young child.
MAT.2.21	And he arose and took the young child and his mother and came into the land of Israel.
MAT.2.22	But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judaea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there; notwithstanding, being warned by divine revelation in dreams, he withdrew into the parts of Galilee,
MAT.2.23	and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the prophets, that he shall be called a Nazarene.
MAT.3.1	In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea
MAT.3.2	and saying, Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
MAT.3.3	For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, who said, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.
MAT.3.4	And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair and a leathern girdle about his loins, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
MAT.3.5	Then Jerusalem and all Judaea and all the region round about Jordan went out to him
MAT.3.6	and were baptized of him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.
MAT.3.7	But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who taught you to flee from the wrath to come?
MAT.3.8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance
MAT.3.9	and think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham as our father, for I say unto you that God is able to raise up children unto Abraham of these stones.
MAT.3.10	And now the axe is also laid unto the root of the trees; therefore, every tree which does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
MAT.3.11	I indeed baptize you in water unto repentance, but he that comes after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear; he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire,
MAT.3.12	whose fan is in his hand; and he will thoroughly purge his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with fire that shall never be quenched.
MAT.3.13	Then Jesus came from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him.
MAT.3.14	But John resisted him much, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?
MAT.3.15	And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now, for thus it is expedient for us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.
MAT.3.16	And Jesus, after he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water; and, behold, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him;
MAT.3.17	and, behold, a voice from the heavens, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
MAT.4.1	Then Jesus was led up of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
MAT.4.2	And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he was hungry.
MAT.4.3	And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made into bread.
MAT.4.4	But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.
MAT.4.5	Then the devil took him up into the holy city and set him on a pinnacle of the temple
MAT.4.6	and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down, for it is written, He shall give his angels charge concerning thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
MAT.4.7	Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
MAT.4.8	Again, the devil took him up into an exceeding high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them
MAT.4.9	and said unto him, All these things I will give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me.
MAT.4.10	Then Jesus said unto him, Get thee hence, Satan, for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
MAT.4.11	Then the devil left him, and, behold, angels came and ministered unto him.
MAT.4.12	Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he returned to Galilee;
MAT.4.13	and leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtali,
MAT.4.14	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying,
MAT.4.15	The land of Zebulun, and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;
MAT.4.16	the people who sat in darkness saw great light, and to those who sat in the region and shadow of death, light is sprung up.
MAT.4.17	From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is at hand.
MAT.4.18	And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.
MAT.4.19	And he said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
MAT.4.20	And they straightway left their nets and followed him.
MAT.4.21	And going on from there, he saw another two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.
MAT.4.22	And they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him.
MAT.4.23	And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every bodily weakness among the people.
MAT.4.24	And his fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases and torments and those who were possessed with devils and those who were lunatic and those that were paralyzed; and he healed them.
MAT.4.25	And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, from Decapolis, from Jerusalem, from Judaea and from beyond Jordan.
MAT.5.1	And seeing the multitudes, he went up into the mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples came unto him;
MAT.5.2	and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying,
MAT.5.3	Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
MAT.5.4	Blessed are those that mourn, for they shall be comforted.
MAT.5.5	Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.
MAT.5.6	Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.
MAT.5.7	Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.
MAT.5.8	Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
MAT.5.9	Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.
MAT.5.10	Blessed are those who suffer persecution for righteousness’ sake, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
MAT.5.11	Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake.
MAT.5.12	Rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
MAT.5.13	Ye are the salt of the earth, but if the salt has lost its savour, with what shall it be salted? From then on it is good for nothing, but to be cast out and to be trodden under foot of men.
MAT.5.14	Ye are the light of the world. A city set upon a mountain cannot be hid.
MAT.5.15	Neither do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on the lampstand, and it gives light unto all that are in the house.
MAT.5.16	Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens.
MAT.5.17	Think not that I am come to undo the law or the prophets; I am not come to undo, but to fulfil.
MAT.5.18	For verily I say unto you, Until heaven and earth pass away, not one jot or one tittle shall pass from the law until all is fulfilled.
MAT.5.19	Whosoever therefore shall undo one of these least commandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
MAT.5.20	For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
MAT.5.21	Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit murder, and whosoever shall commit murder shall be guilty of the judgment;
MAT.5.22	but I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother out of control shall be in danger of the judgment, and whosoever shall insult his brother shall be in danger of the council, but whosoever shall say, Thou art impious, shall be in danger of hell.
MAT.5.23	Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remember that thy brother has something against thee;
MAT.5.24	leave thy gift there before the altar, and go; first restore friendship with thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.
MAT.5.25	Conciliate with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison.
MAT.5.26	Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out of there, until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
MAT.5.27	Ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not commit adultery;
MAT.5.28	but I say unto you, That whosoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.
MAT.5.29	Therefore if thy right eye should bring thee occasion to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from thee; for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
MAT.5.30	And if thy right hand should bring thee occasion to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee: for it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.
MAT.5.31	It was also said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a bill of divorce;
MAT.5.32	but I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.
MAT.5.33	Again, ye have heard that it was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not perjure thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths;
MAT.5.34	but I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by the heaven, for it is God’s throne,
MAT.5.35	nor by the earth, for it is his footstool, neither by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.
MAT.5.36	Neither shalt thou swear by thy head because thou canst not make one hair white or black.
MAT.5.37	But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no; for whatsoever is more than this comes of evil.
MAT.5.38	Ye have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth;
MAT.5.39	but I say unto you, That ye resist not with evil, but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.
MAT.5.40	And if anyone desires to sue thee at the law, and take away thy clothing, let him have thy cloak also.
MAT.5.41	And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him two.
MAT.5.42	Give to him that asks of thee, and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away.
MAT.5.43	Ye have heard that it was said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.
MAT.5.44	But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless those that curse you, do good to those that hate you, and pray for those who speak evil about you, and persecute you;
MAT.5.45	that ye may be sons of your Father who is in the heavens, for he makes his sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.
MAT.5.46	For if ye love those who love you, what reward shall ye have? Do not even the publicans the same?
MAT.5.47	And if ye embrace your brethren only, what do ye more than others? Do not even the publicans so?
MAT.5.48	Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in the heavens is perfect.
MAT.6.1	Take heed not to do your alms {lit. acts of mercy} before men, to be seen of them; otherwise, ye have no reward of your Father who is in the heavens.
MAT.6.2	Therefore, when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They already have their reward.
MAT.6.3	But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth
MAT.6.4	that thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father who sees in secret, he shall reward thee openly.
MAT.6.5	And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They already have their reward.
MAT.6.6	But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy chamber, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who sees in secret shall reward thee openly.
MAT.6.7	But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions as the worldly do, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
MAT.6.8	Be not ye therefore like unto them, for your Father knows what things ye have need of before ye ask him.
MAT.6.9	Ye, therefore, are to pray like this: Our Father who art in the heavens, Hallowed be thy name.
MAT.6.10	Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
MAT.6.11	Give us this day our daily bread.
MAT.6.12	And set us free from our debts, as we set free our debtors.
MAT.6.13	And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.
MAT.6.14	For if ye set men free from their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also set you free;
MAT.6.15	but if ye do not set men free from their trespasses, neither will your Father set you free from your trespasses.
MAT.6.16	Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They already have their reward.
MAT.6.17	But thou, when thou dost fast, anoint thine head, and wash thy face
MAT.6.18	that thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who sees in secret, shall reward thee openly.
MAT.6.19	Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon the earth, where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal;
MAT.6.20	but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust corrupt and where thieves do not break through nor steal;
MAT.6.21	for where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
MAT.6.22	The lamp of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye is sincere, thy whole body shall be full of light.
MAT.6.23	But if thine eye is evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If, therefore, the light that is in thee is darkness, how great is that darkness!
MAT.6.24	No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and riches.
MAT.6.25	Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than food, and the body than raiment?
MAT.6.26	Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are ye not much better than they?
MAT.6.27	Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
MAT.6.28	And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they toil not, neither do they spin;
MAT.6.29	and yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
MAT.6.30	Therefore, if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
MAT.6.31	Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed?
MAT.6.32	(For the Gentiles seek after all these things.) For your heavenly Father knows that ye have need of all these things.
MAT.6.33	But seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.
MAT.6.34	Take therefore no thought for the morrow, for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the affliction thereof.
MAT.7.1	Judge not, that ye be not judged.
MAT.7.2	For with the judgment with which ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with the measure with which ye measure, ye shall be measured again.
MAT.7.3	And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother’s eye but dost not consider the beam that is in thine own eye?
MAT.7.4	Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
MAT.7.5	Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou be able to see to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.
MAT.7.6	Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet and turn again and rend you.
MAT.7.7	Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you;
MAT.7.8	for every one that asks receives, and he that seeks finds, and to him that knocks it shall be opened.
MAT.7.9	Or what man is there of you, whom, if his son asks for bread, will he give him a stone?
MAT.7.10	Or if he asks for fish, will he give him a serpent?
MAT.7.11	If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in the heavens give good things to those that ask him?
MAT.7.12	Therefore, all things whatsoever ye desire that men should do unto you, so also shall ye do unto them, for this is the law and the prophets.
MAT.7.13	Enter ye in at the narrow gate, for the way that leads to destruction is wide and spacious, and those who follow it are many;
MAT.7.14	because narrow is the gate, and confined is the way which leads unto life, and there are few that find it.
MAT.7.15	Keep yourselves also from the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
MAT.7.16	Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
MAT.7.17	Even so every good tree brings forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit.
MAT.7.18	A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
MAT.7.19	Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
MAT.7.20	So that by their fruits ye shall know them.
MAT.7.21	Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in the heavens.
MAT.7.22	Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?
MAT.7.23	And then I will profess unto them, I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
MAT.7.24	Therefore, whosoever hears these words of mine and does them, I will liken him unto a prudent man, who built his house upon the rock;
MAT.7.25	and the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it did not fall, for it was founded upon a rock.
MAT.7.26	And every one that hears these words of mine and does not do them shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand;
MAT.7.27	and the rain descended, and the rivers came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, and it fell; and great was the fall of it.
MAT.7.28	And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these words, the multitude marvelled at his doctrine;
MAT.7.29	for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes.
MAT.8.1	When he was come down from the mountain, many people followed him.
MAT.8.2	And, behold, a leper came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, if thou art willing, thou art able to cleanse me.
MAT.8.3	And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
MAT.8.4	Then Jesus said unto him, See thou tell no one; but go, show thyself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
MAT.8.5	And when Jesus was entering into Capernaum, a centurion came unto him, beseeching him,
MAT.8.6	and saying, Lord, my servant lies at home paralyzed, grievously tormented.
MAT.8.7	And Jesus said unto him, I will come and heal him.
MAT.8.8	The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof; but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed.
MAT.8.9	For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me; and I say to this man, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.
MAT.8.10	When Jesus heard it, he marvelled and said to those that followed, Verily I say unto you that not even in Israel have I found such faith.
MAT.8.11	But I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west and shall sit down at the table with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.
MAT.8.12	But the sons of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.8.13	Then Jesus said unto the centurion, Go, and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in that same hour.
MAT.8.14	And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s mother lying in bed and with fever.
MAT.8.15	And he touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and ministered unto them.
MAT.8.16	When evening was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils, and he cast out the spirits with the word and healed all that were sick
MAT.8.17	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, He took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses.
MAT.8.18	Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he commanded that they depart unto the other side.
MAT.8.19	And a certain scribe came and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.
MAT.8.20	And Jesus said unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.
MAT.8.21	And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
MAT.8.22	But Jesus said unto him, Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.
MAT.8.23	And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.
MAT.8.24	And, behold, there arose a great moving in the sea, insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves; but he was asleep.
MAT.8.25	And his disciples came to him and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us; we perish.
MAT.8.26	And he said unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then, awake, he rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.
MAT.8.27	But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this that even the winds and the sea obey him!
MAT.8.28	And when he was come to the other side, into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.
MAT.8.29	And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? Art thou come here to torment us before the time?
MAT.8.30	And there was a good way off from them a herd of many swine feeding.
MAT.8.31	So the demons besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
MAT.8.32	And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went into the herd of swine; and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea and perished in the waters.
MAT.8.33	And those that fed them fled and went into the city and told everything and what was befallen to the ones possessed of the demons.
MAT.8.34	And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their borders.
MAT.9.1	And he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own city.
MAT.9.2	And, behold, they brought him a paralyzed man, lying on a bed; and Jesus, seeing their faith, said unto the paralyzed man, Trust, son; thy sins are forgiven thee.
MAT.9.3	And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.
MAT.9.4	And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Why think ye evil in your hearts?
MAT.9.5	For what is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise, and walk?
MAT.9.6	But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins (then said he to the paralyzed man), Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.
MAT.9.7	Then he arose and departed to his house.
MAT.9.8	And the multitude, seeing it, marvelled and glorified God, who had given such power unto men.
MAT.9.9	And as Jesus passed forth from there, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom; and he said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
MAT.9.10	And it came to pass, as he sat at food in his house, behold, many publicans and sinners that had come sat down at the table with Jesus and his disciples.
MAT.9.11	And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why does your Master eat with publicans and sinners?
MAT.9.12	But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, Those that are whole need not a physician, but those that are sick.
MAT.9.13	Therefore go ye and learn what this is, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, for I am not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.
MAT.9.14	Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples do not fast?
MAT.9.15	And Jesus said unto them, Can the sons of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they shall fast.
MAT.9.16	No one mends an old garment with a piece of new cloth, for that patch takes from the garment, and the rent is made worse.
MAT.9.17	Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins, otherwise the wineskins break, and the wine runs out, and the wineskins perish; but they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.
MAT.9.18	While he spoke these things unto them, behold, a certain ruler came and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead; but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.
MAT.9.19	And Jesus arose and followed him, and so did his disciples.
MAT.9.20	And, behold, a woman who was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind him and touched the hem of his garment;
MAT.9.21	for she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be free.
MAT.9.22	But Jesus turned around, and when he saw her, he said, Trust, daughter; thy faith has made thee free. And the woman was free from that hour.
MAT.9.23	And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,
MAT.9.24	he said unto them, Give place, for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.
MAT.9.25	But when the people were put forth, he went in and took her by the hand, and the maid arose.
MAT.9.26	And the fame of this went abroad into all that land.
MAT.9.27	And when Jesus departed from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, Thou Son of David, have mercy on us.
MAT.9.28	And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They said unto him, Yes, Lord.
MAT.9.29	Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.
MAT.9.30	And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them, saying, See that no one knows it.
MAT.9.31	But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.
MAT.9.32	And as they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a demon.
MAT.9.33	And when the demon was cast out, the dumb man spoke; and the multitude marvelled, saying, Such a thing has never been seen in Israel.
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, He casts out demons through the prince of the demons.
MAT.9.35	And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every weakness among the people.
MAT.9.36	And when he saw the multitude, he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
MAT.9.37	Then he said unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few;
MAT.9.38	pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.
MAT.10.1	Then calling his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of weakness.
MAT.10.2	Now the names of the twelve apostles are these: the first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee and John his brother;
MAT.10.3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;
MAT.10.4	Simon the Canaanite and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.
MAT.10.5	These twelve Jesus sent forth and commanded them, saying, Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into any city of the Samaritans,
MAT.10.6	but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
MAT.10.7	And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of the heavens has come.
MAT.10.8	Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons; freely ye have received, freely give.
MAT.10.9	Provide neither gold nor silver nor money in your girdles,
MAT.10.10	nor bag for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes nor a staff, for the workman is worthy of his food.
MAT.10.11	And into whatever city or town ye shall enter, search out with diligence who in it is worthy; and there abide until ye go from there.
MAT.10.12	And entering into the house, salute it.
MAT.10.13	And if the house is worthy, your peace shall come upon it; but if it is not worthy, your peace shall return to you.
MAT.10.14	And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear your words, depart out of that house or city and shake off the dust of your feet.
MAT.10.15	Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of those of Sodom and those of Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.
MAT.10.16	Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves; be ye therefore prudent as serpents and innocent as doves.
MAT.10.17	But keep yourselves from men, for they will deliver you up in councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;
MAT.10.18	and ye shall even be brought before princes and kings for my sake, for testimony unto them and to the Gentiles.
MAT.10.19	But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak, for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak.
MAT.10.20	For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father who speaks in you.
MAT.10.21	And brother shall deliver up brother unto death, and the father the child, and children shall rise up against their parents and cause them to be put to death.
MAT.10.22	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name, but he that endures to the end shall be saved.
MAT.10.23	But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another, for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of Israel until the Son of man be come.
MAT.10.24	The disciple is not above his master, nor the slave above his lord.
MAT.10.25	It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the slave as his lord. If they have called the husband of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call those of his household?
MAT.10.26	Fear them not therefore, for there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, nor hid that shall not be known.
MAT.10.27	What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light, and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye from the housetops.
MAT.10.28	And fear not those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul, but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
MAT.10.29	Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? And one of them shall not fall on the ground without your Father.
MAT.10.30	But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
MAT.10.31	Fear ye not, therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.
MAT.10.32	Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in the heavens.
MAT.10.33	But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father who is in the heavens.
MAT.10.34	Think not that I have come to introduce peace into the land; I came not to introduce peace, but a sword.
MAT.10.35	For I have come to set a man at variance against his father, and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
MAT.10.36	And a man’s foes shall be those of his own household.
MAT.10.37	He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
MAT.10.38	And he that does not take his cross {Gr. Stauros – stake} and follow after me is not worthy of me.
MAT.10.39	He that finds his life shall lose it, and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it.
MAT.10.40	He that receives you receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.
MAT.10.41	He that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward, and he that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.
MAT.10.42	And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
MAT.11.1	And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished giving commandments to his twelve disciples, he departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.
MAT.11.2	Now when John had heard in the prison the works of the Christ, he sent two of his disciples,
MAT.11.3	and said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look for another?
MAT.11.4	Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and tell John those things which you hear and see:
MAT.11.5	The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
MAT.11.6	And blessed is he who is not offended in me.
MAT.11.7	And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John, What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken with the wind?
MAT.11.8	But what did you go out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those that wear soft clothing are in kings’ houses.
MAT.11.9	But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say unto you, and more than a prophet.
MAT.11.10	For this is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
MAT.11.11	Verily I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist; notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.
MAT.11.12	From the days of John the Baptist until now, life is given unto the kingdom of the heavens, and the valiant take hold of it.
MAT.11.13	For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
MAT.11.14	And if ye will receive it, this is that Elijah who was to come.
MAT.11.15	He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
MAT.11.16	But unto whom shall I liken this generation? It is like unto children sitting in the markets and shouting unto their fellows
MAT.11.17	and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.
MAT.11.18	For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil.
MAT.11.19	The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.
MAT.11.20	Then he began to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty works were done because they repented not:
MAT.11.21	Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
MAT.11.22	But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you.
MAT.11.23	And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to Hades, for if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in those of Sodom, it would have remained until this day.
MAT.11.24	Therefore I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee.
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus answered and said, I praise thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and understanding and hast revealed them unto children.
MAT.11.26	Even so, Father, for thus it was pleasing in thy sight.
MAT.11.27	All things are delivered unto me of my Father, and no one has known the Son but the Father, neither has anyone known the Father except the Son and he unto whom the Son will reveal him.
MAT.11.28	Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
MAT.11.29	Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and humble of heart, and ye shall find rest for your souls.
MAT.11.30	For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.
MAT.12.1	At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the planted fields, and his disciples were hungry and began to pluck the ears of grain and to eat.
MAT.12.2	But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.
MAT.12.3	But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, and those that were with him, when he was hungry,
MAT.12.4	how he entered into the house of God and ate the showbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for those who were with him, but only for the priests?
MAT.12.5	Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath and are blameless?
MAT.12.6	But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple.
MAT.12.7	But if ye knew what this means, I will have mercy and not sacrifice, ye would not condemn the innocent.
MAT.12.8	For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.
MAT.12.9	And when he was departed from there, he went into their synagogue;
MAT.12.10	and, behold, there was a man who had his hand withered. And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that they might accuse him.
MAT.12.11	And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you that shall have one sheep, and if it falls into a pit on the sabbath day, will he not lay hold on it and lift it out?
MAT.12.12	Therefore, how much more is a man worth than a sheep? So that it is lawful to do good on the sabbath days.
MAT.12.13	Then he said to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like the other.
MAT.12.14	Then the Pharisees went out and took council against him that they might destroy him.
MAT.12.15	But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from there; and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;
MAT.12.16	and strictly charged them that they should not make him known;
MAT.12.17	so that it which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, who said,
MAT.12.18	Behold my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased; I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall declare judgment unto the Gentiles.
MAT.12.19	He shall not strive nor cry, neither shall anyone hear his voice in the streets.
MAT.12.20	A bruised reed he shall not break, and a smoking flax he shall not quench until he sends forth judgment unto victory.
MAT.12.21	And in his name shall the Gentiles wait.
MAT.12.22	Then was brought unto him one possessed with a demon, blind, and dumb, and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.
MAT.12.23	And all the people were amazed and said, Is not this the son of David?
MAT.12.24	But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out demons but by Beelzebub the prince of the demons.
MAT.12.25	And Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, and every city or house divided against itself shall not remain;
MAT.12.26	and if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom remain?
MAT.12.27	And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges.
MAT.12.28	But if I cast out the demons by the Spirit of God, then certainly the kingdom of God is come unto you.
MAT.12.29	Or else how can one enter into the strong man’s house and spoil his goods except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.
MAT.12.30	He that is not with me is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters abroad.
MAT.12.31	Therefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven unto men.
MAT.12.32	And whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him, but whosoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this age, neither in the age to come.
MAT.12.33	Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for the tree is known by its fruit.
MAT.12.34	O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
MAT.12.35	The good man out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things, and the evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things.
MAT.12.36	But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.
MAT.12.37	For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.
MAT.12.38	Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we desire to see a sign from thee.
MAT.12.39	But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there no sign shall be given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah;
MAT.12.40	for as Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale’s belly, so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.
MAT.12.41	The men of Nineveh shall rise in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
MAT.12.42	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation and shall condemn it, for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
MAT.12.43	When the unclean spirit is gone out of the man, it walks through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none.
MAT.12.44	Then it says, I will return into my house from which I came out; and when it is come, it finds it empty, swept, and garnished.
MAT.12.45	Then it goes and takes with itself seven other spirits worse than itself, and they enter in and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it also be unto this wicked generation.
MAT.12.46	While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him.
MAT.12.47	Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brothers stand without, desiring to speak with thee.
MAT.12.48	But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my mother? and who are my brothers?
MAT.12.49	And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brothers!
MAT.12.50	For whosoever shall do the will of my Father who is in the heavens, the same is my brother and sister and mother.
MAT.13.1	The same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the sea side.
MAT.13.2	And a great multitude was gathered together unto him, so that he went into a ship and sat, and the whole multitude stood on the shore.
MAT.13.3	And he spoke many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, the sower went forth to sow;
MAT.13.4	and when he sowed, some of the seed fell beside the way, and the fowls came and devoured them up.
MAT.13.5	Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth; and forthwith they sprang up because they had no deepness of earth;
MAT.13.6	and when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they withered away.
MAT.13.7	And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up and choked them.
MAT.13.8	But some fell into good ground and brought forth fruit: one a hundredfold and another sixtyfold and another thirtyfold.
MAT.13.9	He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
MAT.13.10	Then the disciples came and said unto him, Why dost thou speak unto them in parables?
MAT.13.11	He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to them it is not given.
MAT.13.12	For whosoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have in abundance; but whosoever has not, from him shall be taken away even that which he has.
MAT.13.13	Therefore, I speak to them in parables because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.
MAT.13.14	And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which says, By hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive;
MAT.13.15	for this people’s heart is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted, and I should heal them.
MAT.13.16	But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear.
MAT.13.17	For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which ye see and have not seen them and to hear those things which ye hear and have not heard them.
MAT.13.18	Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
MAT.13.19	When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, then the wicked one comes and catches away that which was sown in his heart. This is he who was planted beside the way.
MAT.13.20	But he that was planted in stony places, the same is he that hears the word and receives it immediately with joy;
MAT.13.21	yet he has no root in himself but is temporal, for when affliction or persecution arises because of the word, by and by he is offended.
MAT.13.22	And he that was planted among the thorns is he that hears the word, and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.
MAT.13.23	But he that was planted in good ground is he that hears the word and understands it and who also bears the fruit and brings forth: one a hundredfold and another sixty and another thirty.
MAT.13.24	He put forth another parable unto them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is likened unto a man who sows good seed in his field
MAT.13.25	But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went away.
MAT.13.26	But when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then the tares appeared also.
MAT.13.27	So the slaves of the husband of the house came and said unto him, Lord, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? From where then does it have tares?
MAT.13.28	He said unto them, The enemy, a man, has done this. The slaves said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?
MAT.13.29	But he said, No, lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them.
MAT.13.30	Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn.
MAT.13.31	He put forth another parable unto them, saying, The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field;
MAT.13.32	which indeed is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the heaven come and make their nests in its branches.
MAT.13.33	He spoke another parable unto them: The kingdom of the heavens is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.
MAT.13.34	Jesus spoke all these things unto the multitude in parables and said nothing unto them without parables
MAT.13.35	that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.
MAT.13.36	Then Jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house, and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field.
MAT.13.37	He answered and said unto them, He that sows the good seed is the Son of man;
MAT.13.38	the field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked;
MAT.13.39	and the enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.
MAT.13.40	As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the end of this age.
MAT.13.41	The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend and those who do iniquity
MAT.13.42	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.13.43	Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear.
MAT.13.44	Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto treasure hid in the field, which when found, a man hides it and, for the joy thereof, goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
MAT.13.45	Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a merchant man, seeking goodly pearls,
MAT.13.46	who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold all that he had and bought it.
MAT.13.47	Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a net that was cast into the sea and gathered of every kind of fish,
MAT.13.48	which, when it was full, they drew to shore and sat down and gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.
MAT.13.49	So shall it be at the end of the age; the angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from among the just
MAT.13.50	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.13.51	Jesus said unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They answered unto him, Yes, Lord.
MAT.13.52	And he said unto them, Therefore every scribe who is instructed in the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man, a husband of a house, who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old.
MAT.13.53	And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these parables, he departed from there.
MAT.13.54	And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished and said, From where does this man have this wisdom and these mighty works?
MAT.13.55	Is not this the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
MAT.13.56	And his sisters, are they not all with us? From where then does this man have all these things?
MAT.13.57	And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not without honour except in his own country and in his own house.
MAT.13.58	And he did not do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus
MAT.14.2	and said unto his slaves, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do show forth themselves in him.
MAT.14.3	For Herod had laid hold on John and bound him and put him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.
MAT.14.4	For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.
MAT.14.5	And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude because they counted him as a prophet.
MAT.14.6	But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod.
MAT.14.7	Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatever she would ask.
MAT.14.8	And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me here John the Baptist’s head in a platter.
MAT.14.9	And the king was sorry; nevertheless because of the oath and of those who sat with him at the table, he commanded it to be given her.
MAT.14.10	And he sent and beheaded John in the prison.
MAT.14.11	And his head was brought in a platter and given to the damsel, and she brought it to her mother.
MAT.14.12	And his disciples came and took up the body and buried it and went and told Jesus.
MAT.14.13	When Jesus heard of it, he departed from there by ship into a desert place apart; and when the people had heard of it, they followed him on foot out of the cities.
MAT.14.14	And Jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.
MAT.14.15	And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away that they may go into the villages and buy themselves food.
MAT.14.16	But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to eat.
MAT.14.17	And they said unto him, We have here but five loaves and two fishes.
MAT.14.18	He said, Bring them here to me.
MAT.14.19	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass and took the five loaves and the two fishes; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
MAT.14.20	And they all ate and were filled, and they took up of the fragments that remained, twelve baskets full.
MAT.14.21	And those that had eaten were about five thousand men besides women and children.
MAT.14.22	And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude away.
MAT.14.23	And when he had sent the multitude away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray; and when the evening was come, he was there alone.
MAT.14.24	But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves, for the wind was contrary.
MAT.14.25	And in the fourth watch of the night, Jesus went unto them, walking upon the sea.
MAT.14.26	And when the disciples saw him walking upon the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a ghost; and they cried out for fear.
MAT.14.27	But straightway Jesus spoke unto them, saying, Trust that I AM; be not afraid.
MAT.14.28	Then Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me to come unto thee upon the water.
MAT.14.29	And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked upon the water to go to Jesus.
MAT.14.30	But seeing that the wind was strong, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, Lord, save me.
MAT.14.31	And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him, O thou of little faith, why didst thou doubt?
MAT.14.32	And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.
MAT.14.33	Then those that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Truly thou art the Son of God.
MAT.14.34	And when they were gone over, they came into the land of Gennesaret.
MAT.14.35	And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent out into all that country round about and brought unto him all that were sick
MAT.14.36	and besought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment, and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.
MAT.15.1	Then certain scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem came unto Jesus, saying,
MAT.15.2	Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.
MAT.15.3	But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?
MAT.15.4	For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother, and, He that curses father or mother, let him die without recourse.
MAT.15.5	But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, Whatever I might have helped thee with is already my offering unto God,
MAT.15.6	and now has no need to honour his father or his mother with succour. Thus ye have made the commandment of God of no effect by your tradition.
MAT.15.7	Ye hypocrites, well did Isaiah prophesy of you, saying,
MAT.15.8	This people draws nigh unto me with their mouth and honours me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
MAT.15.9	But in vain do they worship me, teaching doctrines and commandments of men.
MAT.15.10	And calling the multitude unto him, he said unto them, Hear and understand:
MAT.15.11	not that which goes into the mouth defiles the man; but that which comes out of the mouth, this defiles the man.
MAT.15.12	Then his disciples came and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this word?
MAT.15.13	But he answered and said, Every plant which my heavenly Father has not planted shall be rooted up.
MAT.15.14	Let them alone; they are blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into a pit.
MAT.15.15	Then Peter answered and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.
MAT.15.16	And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
MAT.15.17	Do not ye yet understand that whatever enters in at the mouth goes into the belly and is cast out into the draught?
MAT.15.18	But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart, and they defile the man.
MAT.15.19	For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
MAT.15.20	these are the things which defile the man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.
MAT.15.21	Then Jesus left there and departed into the parts of Tyre and Sidon.
MAT.15.22	And, behold, a woman of Canaan having come out of the same borders cried unto him, saying, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me; my daughter is sick, possessed by a demon.
MAT.15.23	But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away, for she cries out after us.
MAT.15.24	But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
MAT.15.25	Then she came and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.
MAT.15.26	But he answered and said, It is not good to take the children’s bread and to cast it to the little dogs.
MAT.15.27	And she said, Yes, Lord, yet the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table.
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith; be it unto thee even as thou desire. And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.
MAT.15.29	And Jesus left there and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee and went up into the mountain and sat down there.
MAT.15.30	And many people came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many other sick and cast them down at Jesus’ feet; and he healed them,
MAT.15.31	insomuch that the multitude wondered when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see, and they glorified the God of Israel.
MAT.15.32	Then Jesus called his disciples unto him and said, I have mercy on the multitude because they persevere with me now three days and have nothing to eat, and I desire not to send them away fasting lest they faint in the way.
MAT.15.33	Then his disciples say unto him, From where do we have so much bread in the wilderness as to satisfy so great a multitude?
MAT.15.34	And Jesus said unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven and a few little fishes.
MAT.15.35	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.
MAT.15.36	And he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and broke them and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
MAT.15.37	And they all ate and were filled, and they took up of the broken food that was left seven baskets full.
MAT.15.38	And those that ate were four thousand men besides women and children.
MAT.15.39	And he sent away the multitude and took ship and came into the borders of Magdala.
MAT.16.1	The Pharisees and the Sadducees came to tempt him; they asked him to show them a sign from the heaven.
MAT.16.2	But he answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather, for the heaven is glowing with an aurora.
MAT.16.3	And in the morning, It will be foul weather today, for the heaven has an aurora and is cloudy. O ye hypocrites, ye know how to make decisions based on the face of the heaven, and regarding the signs of the times are ye unable?
MAT.16.4	A wicked and adulterous generation seeks after a sign; and no sign shall be given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonah. And he left them and departed.
MAT.16.5	And when his disciples were coming from the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.
MAT.16.6	Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
MAT.16.7	And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have taken no bread.
MAT.16.8	Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little faith, why reason ye among yourselves that ye have brought no bread?
MAT.16.9	Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
MAT.16.10	Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
MAT.16.11	How is it that ye do not understand that I did not speak to you concerning bread that ye should keep yourselves from the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
MAT.16.12	Then they understood that he bade them not to keep themselves from the leaven of bread, but from the doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	When Jesus came into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of man am?
MAT.16.14	And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets.
MAT.16.15	He said unto them, But who say ye that I am?
MAT.16.16	And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
MAT.16.17	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon son of Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my Father who is in the heavens.
MAT.16.18	And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, a small rock and upon the large rock I will build my congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against her.
MAT.16.19	And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever thou shalt bind on the earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatever thou shalt loose on the earth shall be loosed in the heaven.
MAT.16.20	Then he charged his disciples that they should tell no one that he was Jesus the Christ.
MAT.16.21	From that time forth Jesus began to declare unto his disciples, how it was expedient for him to go unto Jerusalem and to suffer many things of the elders and the princes of the priests and of the scribes and to be killed and to be raised again the third day.
MAT.16.22	Then Peter, taking him aside, began to rebuke him, saying, Lord, be it far from thee; in no wise shall this happen unto thee.
MAT.16.23	But he turned and said unto Peter, Remove thyself from before me, Satan; thou art an offence unto me, for thou dost not understand that which is of God, but that which is of men.
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said unto his disciples, If anyone will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross {Gr. stauros – stake} and follow me.
MAT.16.25	For whosoever desires to save his life shall lose it, and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.
MAT.16.26	For what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
MAT.16.27	For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels, and then he shall reward everyone according to their works.
MAT.16.28	Verily I say unto you, There are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they have seen the Son of man coming in his kingdom.
MAT.17.1	And after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, his brother, and brought them apart up into a high mountain
MAT.17.2	and [he] was transfigured before them, and his face shined as the sun, and his raiment was as white as the light.
MAT.17.3	And, behold, Moses and Elijah appeared unto them talking with him.
MAT.17.4	Then Peter answered and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to remain here; if thou desire, let us make three tabernacles here: one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elijah.
MAT.17.5	While he yet spoke, behold, a cloud of light overshadowed them, and, behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.
MAT.17.6	And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their faces and feared greatly.
MAT.17.7	Then Jesus came and touched them and said, Arise and be not afraid.
MAT.17.8	And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except Jesus only.
MAT.17.9	And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them, saying, Tell the vision to no one until the Son of man is risen from the dead.
MAT.17.10	Then his disciples asked him, saying, Why then do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?
MAT.17.11	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elijah truly shall come first and restore all things.
MAT.17.12	But I say unto you, That Elijah is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatever they pleased. Likewise the Son of man shall also suffer of them.
MAT.17.13	Then the disciples understood that he spoke unto them of John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,
MAT.17.15	Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic and suffers miserably; for many times he has fallen into the fire and often into the water.
MAT.17.16	And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.
MAT.17.17	Then Jesus answered and said, O unfaithful and crooked generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I suffer you? Bring him here to me.
MAT.17.18	And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour.
MAT.17.19	Then the disciples came to Jesus apart and said, Why could not we cast him out?
MAT.17.20	And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unfaithfulness; for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove from here to yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.
MAT.17.21	Howbeit this lineage of demons does not go out but by prayer and fasting.
MAT.17.22	And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men;
MAT.17.23	and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again. And they were exceeding sorry.
MAT.17.24	And when they were come to Capernaum, those that received the two drachmas came to Peter and said, Does not your master pay the two drachmas?
MAT.17.25	He said, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus spoke unto him first, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own sons or of strangers?
MAT.17.26	Peter said unto him, Of strangers. Jesus said unto him, Then the sons are free.
MAT.17.27	Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea and cast a hook and take up the first fish that comes up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a stater, a coin worth four drachmas; take that, and give it unto them for me and thee.
MAT.18.1	At the same time the disciples came unto Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?
MAT.18.2	And Jesus called a little child unto him and set him in the midst of them
MAT.18.3	and said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
MAT.18.4	Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
MAT.18.5	And whosoever shall receive one such little child in my name receives me.
MAT.18.6	But whosoever shall cause one of these little ones who believe in me to fall, it would be better for him that a millstone such as is turned by an ass be hanged about his neck and that he be sunk in the depth of the sea.
MAT.18.7	Woe unto the world because of offenses! For it must needs be that offenses come, but woe to that man by whom the offense comes!
MAT.18.8	Therefore if thy hand or thy foot cause thee to fall, cut them off and cast them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into eternal fire.
MAT.18.9	And if thine eye causes thee to fall, pluck it out and cast it from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into the hell of fire.
MAT.18.10	Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in the heavens their angels always behold the face of my Father who is in the heavens.
MAT.18.11	For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
MAT.18.12	What do you think? If a man had a hundred sheep and one of them went astray, would he not leave the ninety-nine and go into the mountains and seek that which is gone astray?
MAT.18.13	And if so be that he finds it, verily I say unto you, he rejoices more of that one than of the ninety-nine who did not go astray.
MAT.18.14	Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in the heavens that one of these little ones should perish.
MAT.18.15	Therefore if thy brother shall sin against thee, go and reprove him between thee and him alone; if he shall hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
MAT.18.16	But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two more that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
MAT.18.17	And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}; but if he neglects to hear the congregation, let him be unto thee as a worldly man and a publican.
MAT.18.18	Verily I say unto you, Whatever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in the heaven; and whatever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in the heaven.
MAT.18.19	Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father who is in the heavens.
MAT.18.20	For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came to him and said, Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him? until seven times?
MAT.18.22	Jesus said unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times, but, Until seventy times seven.
MAT.18.23	Therefore is the kingdom of the heavens likened unto a man who is king who would take account of his slaves.
MAT.18.24	And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him who owed him ten thousand talents.
MAT.18.25	But he not having wherewith to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children and all that he had, to make payment.
MAT.18.26	The slave therefore fell down and worshipped him, saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
MAT.18.27	Then the lord of that slave was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt.
MAT.18.28	But as the same slave was leaving, he found one of his fellowslaves who owed him a hundred denarius, and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me what thou owest.
MAT.18.29	And his fellowslave fell down at his feet and besought him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
MAT.18.30	And he would not, but went and cast him into prison until he should pay the debt.
MAT.18.31	So when his fellowslaves saw what was done, they were very grieved and came and declared unto their lord all that was done.
MAT.18.32	Then his lord, after he had called him, said unto him, O thou wicked slave, I forgave thee all that debt because thou didst beseech me;
MAT.18.33	was it not also expedient unto thee to have mercy on thy fellowslave even as I had mercy on thee?
MAT.18.34	And his lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors until he should pay all that was due unto him.
MAT.18.35	So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you unless from your hearts ye forgive every one his brother their trespasses.
MAT.19.1	And it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judaea beyond the Jordan;
MAT.19.2	and a great multitude followed him, and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	Then the Pharisees came unto him, tempting him and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any cause?
MAT.19.4	And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he who made them at the beginning made them male and female?
MAT.19.5	And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.
MAT.19.6	Therefore they are no longer two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate.
MAT.19.7	They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a bill of divorce and to put her away?
MAT.19.8	He said unto them, Moses, because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives, but from the beginning it was not so.
MAT.19.9	And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication and shall marry another, commits adultery, and whosoever marries her that is put away commits adultery.
MAT.19.10	His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not expedient to marry.
MAT.19.11	But he said unto them, Everyone cannot receive this word, except those unto whom it is given.
MAT.19.12	For there are some eunuchs who were so born from their mother’s womb; and there are some eunuchs who were made eunuchs of men; and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.
MAT.19.13	Then were there brought unto him little children that he should put his hands on them and pray, and the disciples rebuked them.
MAT.19.14	But Jesus said, Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of the heavens.
MAT.19.15	And he laid his hands on them and departed from there.
MAT.19.16	And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?
MAT.19.17	And he said unto him, Why dost thou call me good? There is none good but one, that is, God, but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.
MAT.19.18	He said unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness,
MAT.19.19	Honour thy father and thy mother, and, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
MAT.19.20	The young man said unto him, All these things I have kept from my youth up; what do I lack?
MAT.19.21	Jesus said unto him, If thou desire to be perfect, go and sell what thou hast and give it to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come and follow me.
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard that word, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.
MAT.19.23	Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, It is difficult that a rich man shall enter into the kingdom of the heavens.
MAT.19.24	And again I say unto you, It is easier to put a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
MAT.19.25	But his disciples hearing these things were exceedingly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
MAT.19.26	But Jesus beheld them and said unto them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
MAT.19.27	Then Peter answered and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken all and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?
MAT.19.28	And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye who have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, to judge the twelve tribes of Israel.
MAT.19.29	And every one that has forsaken houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name’s sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit eternal life.
MAT.19.30	But many that are first shall be last, and many of the last shall be first.
MAT.20.1	For the kingdom of the heavens is like unto a man, the husband of a house, who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his vineyard.
MAT.20.2	And when he had agreed with the labourers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
MAT.20.3	And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the marketplace
MAT.20.4	and said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you. And they went.
MAT.20.5	Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour and did likewise.
MAT.20.6	And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing idle and said unto them, Why stand ye here all the day idle?
MAT.20.7	They say unto him, Because no one has hired us. He said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and whatever is right, that shall ye receive.
MAT.20.8	So when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard said unto his steward, Call the labourers and give them their hire, beginning from the last unto the first.
MAT.20.9	And when those came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they received every man a denarius.
MAT.20.10	But when the first came, they supposed that they should have received more but they likewise received each one a denarius.
MAT.20.11	And when they had received it, they murmured against the husband of the house,
MAT.20.12	saying, These last have worked but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us who have borne the burden and heat of the day.
MAT.20.13	But he answered one of them and said, Friend, I do thee no wrong; didst not thou agree with me for a denarius?
MAT.20.14	Take that which is thine and go, for I desire to give unto this last one, even as unto thee.
MAT.20.15	Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good?
MAT.20.16	So the first shall be last, and the last first; for many are called, but few are chosen.
MAT.20.17	And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way and said unto them,
MAT.20.18	Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the princes of the priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death
MAT.20.19	and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify; {Gr. stauroo – Hang on a stake}; and the third day he shall rise again.
MAT.20.20	Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to him with her sons, worshipping him and desiring a certain thing of him.
MAT.20.21	And he said unto her, What dost thou desire? She said unto him, Grant that these my two sons may sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom.
MAT.20.22	But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are able.
MAT.20.23	And he said unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with; but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give, but it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared of my Father.
MAT.20.24	And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation against the two brothers.
MAT.20.25	But Jesus called them unto him and said, Ye know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and those that are great wield power over them.
MAT.20.26	But it shall not be so among you, but whosoever will be great among you, let him be your minister;
MAT.20.27	and whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your slave,
MAT.20.28	even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many.
MAT.20.29	And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him.
MAT.20.30	And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us.
MAT.20.31	And the multitude rebuked them, that they should be silent; but they cried the more, saying, Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us.
MAT.20.32	And Jesus stood still and called them and said, What desire ye that I shall do unto you?
MAT.20.33	They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
MAT.20.34	Then Jesus, having mercy on them, touched their eyes; and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.
MAT.21.1	And when they drew near unto Jerusalem and were come to Bethphage unto the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
MAT.21.2	saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and straightway ye shall find an ass tied and a colt with her; loose them and bring them unto me.
MAT.21.3	And if anyone says anything unto you, ye shall say, The Lord has need of them; and straightway he will send them.
MAT.21.4	All this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,
MAT.21.5	Say unto the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King comes unto thee, meek and sitting upon an ass and a colt the foal of a beast under yoke.
MAT.21.6	And the disciples went and did as Jesus commanded them
MAT.21.7	and brought the ass and the colt and put on them their clothes, and he sat upon them.
MAT.21.8	And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way; others cut down branches from the trees and spread them in the way.
MAT.21.9	And the people that went before and that followed, cried out, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
MAT.21.10	And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved, saying, Who is this?
MAT.21.11	And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.
MAT.21.12	And Jesus went into the temple of God and cast out all those that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those that sold doves
MAT.21.13	and said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.
MAT.21.14	And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
MAT.21.15	But when the princes of the priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did and the children crying out in the temple and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David, they were sore displeased
MAT.21.16	and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus said unto them, Yes; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of children and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
MAT.21.17	And he left them and went out of the city into Bethany, and he lodged there.
MAT.21.18	Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.
MAT.21.19	And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it and found nothing upon it, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow on thee from now on for ever. And then the fig tree withered away.
MAT.21.20	And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!
MAT.21.21	Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith and doubt not, ye shall not only do this to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea, it shall be done.
MAT.21.22	And all things, whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.
MAT.21.23	And when he was come into the temple, the princes of the priests and the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching and said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this authority?
MAT.21.24	And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you a word, which if ye tell me, I will also tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAT.21.25	The baptism of John, where was it from? from heaven or of men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven, he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?
MAT.21.26	But if we shall say, Of men, we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.
MAT.21.27	And they answered Jesus and said, We cannot tell. And he said unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
MAT.21.28	But what do you think? A certain man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard.
MAT.21.29	He answered and said, I will not, but afterward he repented and went.
MAT.21.30	And he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, I will go, Lord, and went not.
MAT.21.31	Which of the two did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go ahead of you into the kingdom of God.
MAT.21.32	For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye believed him not, but the publicans and the harlots believed him, and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward that ye might believe him.
MAT.21.33	Hear another parable: There was a certain husband of a house who planted a vineyard and hedged it round about and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country,
MAT.21.34	and when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the husbandmen that they might receive the fruits of it.
MAT.21.35	And the husbandmen took his slaves and beat one and killed another and stoned another.
MAT.21.36	Again, he sent other slaves more than the first, and they did unto them likewise.
MAT.21.37	But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will reverence my son.
MAT.21.38	But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us take his inheritance.
MAT.21.39	And they took hold of him and cast him out of the vineyard and slew him.
MAT.21.40	Therefore, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do unto those husbandmen?
MAT.21.41	They say unto him, He will destroy those wicked men without mercy and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen who shall render him the fruits in their seasons.
MAT.21.42	Jesus said unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
MAT.21.43	Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and given to a people bringing forth the fruits thereof.
MAT.21.44	And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
MAT.21.45	And as the princes of the priests and Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.
MAT.21.46	But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the multitude because they held him as a prophet.
MAT.22.1	And Jesus answered and spoke unto them again by parables and said,
MAT.22.2	The kingdom of the heavens is like unto a certain man, a king, who made a marriage feast for his son
MAT.22.3	and sent forth his slaves to call those that were invited to the wedding, and they would not come.
MAT.22.4	Again, he sent forth other slaves, saying, Tell those who are invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my bulls and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready; come unto the marriage.
MAT.22.5	But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise,
MAT.22.6	and the others took his slaves and entreated them spitefully and slew them.
MAT.22.7	But when the king heard of this, he became angry and sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city.
MAT.22.8	Then he said to his slaves, The wedding is ready, but those who were called were not worthy.
MAT.22.9	Go ye therefore into the entrances of the highways and call as many as ye shall find to the marriage.
MAT.22.10	So those slaves went out into the highways and gathered together everyone that they found, both bad and good; and the wedding was filled with guests.
MAT.22.11	And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who did not have on a wedding garment,
MAT.22.12	and he said unto him, Friend, how didst thou come in here not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.
MAT.22.13	Then the king said to the slaves, Bind him hand and foot and take him away and cast him into the darkness outside; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.22.14	For many are called, but few are chosen.
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees left and took counsel how they might entangle him in his word.
MAT.22.16	And they sent out unto him their disciples with those of Herod, saying, Master, we know that thou art a lover of truth and teachest the way of God with truth and that thou takest care for no man, for thou art no respecter of persons of men.
MAT.22.17	Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto Caesar or not?
MAT.22.18	But Jesus perceived their wickedness and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?
MAT.22.19	Show me the coin of the tribute. And they presented unto him a denarius.
MAT.22.20	And he said unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?
MAT.22.21	They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then said he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s.
MAT.22.22	When they had heard these words, they marvelled and left him and went away.
MAT.22.23	The same day the Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,
MAT.22.24	saying, Master, Moses said, If a man dies, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.
MAT.22.25	Now there were with us seven brothers, and the first, when he had married a wife, deceased, and, having no seed, left his wife unto his brother;
MAT.22.26	likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.
MAT.22.27	And last of all the woman died also.
MAT.22.28	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.
MAT.22.29	Then Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God.
MAT.22.30	For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
MAT.22.31	But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which is spoken unto you by God, who saith,
MAT.22.32	I AM the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
MAT.22.33	And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine.
MAT.22.34	Then the Pharisees, hearing that he had put the Sadducees to silence, gathered together.
MAT.22.35	And one of them, who was an interpreter of the law, asked him a question, tempting him and saying,
MAT.22.36	Master, which is the great commandment in the law?
MAT.22.37	Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind.
MAT.22.38	This is the first and great commandment.
MAT.22.39	And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
MAT.22.40	On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.
MAT.22.41	While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,
MAT.22.42	saying, What think ye of the Christ? Whose son is he? They say unto him, The Son of David.
MAT.22.43	He said unto them, How then does David in Spirit call him Lord, saying,
MAT.22.44	The 
MAT.22.45	If David then calls him Lord, how is he his son?
MAT.22.46	And no one was able to answer him a word, neither dared anyone from that day forth ask him any more questions.
MAT.23.1	Then Jesus spoke to the multitude and to his disciples,
MAT.23.2	saying, The scribes and the Pharisees have sat down in Moses’ seat;
MAT.23.3	therefore, whatever they bid you to observe, observe it and do it, but do not act according to their works, for they say and do not do it.
MAT.23.4	For they bind burdens that are heavy and grievous to bear and lay them on men’s shoulders, but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers.
MAT.23.5	But they do all their works that they may be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries and enlarge the borders of their garments
MAT.23.6	and love the first place at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues
MAT.23.7	and greetings in the markets and to be called of men, Rabbi, Rabbi.
MAT.23.8	But, as for you, desire not to be called Rabbi, for one is your Master, the Christ; and you are all brothers.
MAT.23.9	And call no one your father upon the earth, for one is your Father, who is in the heavens.
MAT.23.10	Neither be ye called masters, for one is your Master, the Christ.
MAT.23.11	But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.
MAT.23.12	And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be humbled, and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.
MAT.23.13	But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut up the kingdom of the heavens in front of men, for ye neither go in yourselves, neither suffer ye those that are entering to go in.
MAT.23.14	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour widows’ houses and for a pretence make long prayer; therefore, ye shall receive the greater judgment.
MAT.23.15	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him twofold more a son of hell than yourselves.
MAT.23.16	Woe unto you, ye blind guides, who say, Whosoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!
MAT.23.17	Ye fools and blind, for which is greater, the gold or the temple that sanctifies the gold?
MAT.23.18	And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever swears by the gift that is upon it, he is a debtor.
MAT.23.19	Ye fools and blind, for which one is greater, the gift or the altar that sanctifies the gift?
MAT.23.20	Whosoever therefore shall swear by the altar, swears by it and by all things thereon.
MAT.23.21	And whosoever shall swear by the temple, swears by it and by Him that dwells therein.
MAT.23.22	And he that shall swear by the heaven, swears by the throne of God and by Him that sits thereon.
MAT.23.23	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin and have omitted that which is more important of the law: judgment, mercy, and faith; these were expedient for ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
MAT.23.24	Ye blind guides, who strain at a gnat and swallow a camel.
MAT.23.25	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup or of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and incontinence.
MAT.23.26	Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also.
MAT.23.27	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like unto whitewashed sepulchres, who indeed appear beautiful outside, but inside are full of dead men’s bones and of all uncleanness.
MAT.23.28	Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
MAT.23.29	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the sepulchres of the righteous
MAT.23.30	and say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.
MAT.23.31	Therefore ye are witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.
MAT.23.32	Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
MAT.23.33	Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the judgment of hell?
MAT.23.34	Therefore, behold, I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes, and some of them ye shall kill and crucify, and some of them ye shall scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from city to city,
MAT.23.35	that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye murdered between the temple and the altar.
MAT.23.36	Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this generation.
MAT.23.37	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that didst kill the prophets and stone those who are sent unto thee, how often I desired to gather thy children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!
MAT.23.38	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.
MAT.23.39	For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me from now on until ye shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.
MAT.24.1	And Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and his disciples came to him to show him the buildings of the temple.
MAT.24.2	And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.
MAT.24.3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the age?
MAT.24.4	And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no one deceive you.
MAT.24.5	For many shall come in my name, saying, I am the Christ, and shall deceive many.
MAT.24.6	And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars; see that ye be not troubled, for it is necessary that all these things must take place; but the end is not yet.
MAT.24.7	For nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in different places.
MAT.24.8	All these are the beginning of sorrows.
MAT.24.9	Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.
MAT.24.10	And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
MAT.24.11	And many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many.
MAT.24.12	And because lawlessness shall abound, the charity of many shall wax cold.
MAT.24.13	But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.
MAT.24.14	And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations, and then shall the end come.
MAT.24.15	Therefore, when ye see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, which shall stand in the holy place (whosoever reads, let him understand),
MAT.24.16	then let those who are in Judaea flee into the mountains;
MAT.24.17	let him who is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house,
MAT.24.18	neither let him who is in the field return back to take his clothes.
MAT.24.19	And woe unto those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days!
MAT.24.20	But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the sabbath day,
MAT.24.21	for then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.
MAT.24.22	And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.
MAT.24.23	Then if any man shall say unto you, Behold, here is the Christ, or there, believe it not.
MAT.24.24	For there shall arise false Christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in such a manner that they shall deceive, if possible, the very elect.
MAT.24.25	Behold, I have told you before.
MAT.24.26	Therefore if they say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert, go not forth; Behold, he is in the secret chambers, believe it not.
MAT.24.27	For as the lightning that comes out of the east and shines even unto the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
MAT.24.28	For wherever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
MAT.24.29	Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken,
MAT.24.30	and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with great power and glory.
MAT.24.31	And he shall send his angels with a trumpet and a great voice, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.
MAT.24.32	Now learn a parable of the fig tree: When his branch is yet tender and puts forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh;
MAT.24.33	so likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.
MAT.24.34	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass until all these things are fulfilled.
MAT.24.35	The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
MAT.24.36	But of that day and hour no one knows, no, not even the angels of the heavens, but my Father only.
MAT.24.37	But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
MAT.24.38	For as they were in the days before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark,
MAT.24.39	and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.
MAT.24.40	Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken and the other left.
MAT.24.41	Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken and the other left.
MAT.24.42	Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.
MAT.24.43	But know this that if the husband of the house knew in what watch the thief would come, he would watch and would not suffer his house to be broken into.
MAT.24.44	Therefore be ye also ready; the Son of man is to come in the hour that ye think not.
MAT.24.45	Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom his lord has made ruler over his household to give them food in due season?
MAT.24.46	Blessed is that slave whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.
MAT.24.47	Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his goods.
MAT.24.48	But and if that evil slave shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming,
MAT.24.49	and shall begin to smite his fellowslaves and even to eat and drink with the drunken,
MAT.24.50	the lord of that slave shall come in a day when he does not look for him and in an hour that he is not aware of
MAT.24.51	and shall cut him off and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.25.1	Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened unto ten virgins who, taking their lamps, went forth to meet the bridegroom.
MAT.25.2	And five of them were prudent, and five were foolish.
MAT.25.3	Those that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them;
MAT.25.4	but the prudent took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
MAT.25.5	While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
MAT.25.6	And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom comes; go ye out to meet him.
MAT.25.7	Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their lamps.
MAT.25.8	And the foolish said unto the prudent, Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.
MAT.25.9	But the prudent answered, saying, Lest there be not enough for us and you, but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves.
MAT.25.10	And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and those that were ready went in with him to the marriage, and the door was shut.
MAT.25.11	Afterward the other virgins also came, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
MAT.25.12	But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
MAT.25.13	Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man comes.
MAT.25.14	For it is like a man travelling into a far country, who called his own slaves and delivered unto them his goods.
MAT.25.15	And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to each one according to his faculty, and straightway took his journey.
MAT.25.16	And after he was gone, he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same and made another five talents.
MAT.25.17	And likewise he that had received two, he also gained another two.
MAT.25.18	But he that had received one went and dug in the earth and hid his lord’s money.
MAT.25.19	And after a long time the lord of those slaves came and reckoned accounts with them.
MAT.25.20	And so he that had received five talents came and brought another five talents, saying, Lord, thou didst deliver unto me five talents; behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
MAT.25.21	His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful slave; thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
MAT.25.22	He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou didst deliver unto me two talents; behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
MAT.25.23	His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful slave; thou hast been faithful over a few things; I will set thee over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
MAT.25.24	Then he who had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not scattered;
MAT.25.25	therefore, I was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth; behold, thou hast what is thine.
MAT.25.26	His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful slave, thou knewest that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I have not scattered;
MAT.25.27	therefore, it was expedient for thee to have put my money to the bankers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with interest.
MAT.25.28	Take, therefore, the talent from him and give it unto him who has ten talents.
MAT.25.29	For unto every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance, but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.
MAT.25.30	And cast ye the unprofitable slave into the outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
MAT.25.31	When the Son of man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him, then he shall sit upon the throne of his glory,
MAT.25.32	and before him shall be gathered all nations; and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats,
MAT.25.33	and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
MAT.25.34	Then shall the King say unto those on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world;
MAT.25.35	for I was hungry, and ye gave me food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;
MAT.25.36	naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick, and ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
MAT.25.37	Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungry and feed thee? or thirsty and give thee drink?
MAT.25.38	When did we see thee a stranger and take thee in? or naked and clothe thee?
MAT.25.39	Or when did we see thee sick or in prison and come unto thee?
MAT.25.40	And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brothers, ye have done it unto me.
MAT.25.41	Then he shall also say unto those who shall be on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into eternal fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;
MAT.25.42	for I was hungry, and ye gave me no food; I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink;
MAT.25.43	I was a stranger, and ye took me not in; naked, and ye clothed me not; sick and in prison, and ye visited me not.
MAT.25.44	Then they shall also answer him, saying, Lord, when did we see thee hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee?
MAT.25.45	Then he shall answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of my brothers, ye did it not to me.
MAT.25.46	And they shall go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.
MAT.26.1	And it came to pass when Jesus had finished all these words, he said unto his disciples,
MAT.26.2	Ye know that after two days is the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
MAT.26.3	Then the princes of the priests and the scribes and the elders of the people assembled together in the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
MAT.26.4	and took counsel that they might take Jesus by guile and kill him.
MAT.26.5	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.
MAT.26.6	Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
MAT.26.7	a woman came unto him having an alabaster box of very precious ointment and poured it on his head as he sat at the table.
MAT.26.8	But when his disciples saw it, they became indignant, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
MAT.26.9	For this ointment might have been sold for much and given to the poor.
MAT.26.10	But Jesus, understanding this, said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she has wrought a good work upon me.
MAT.26.11	For ye have the poor always with you, but me ye have not always.
MAT.26.12	For in that she has poured this ointment on my body, she did it to prepare for my burial.
MAT.26.13	Verily I say unto you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman has done, be told for a memorial of her.
MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the princes of the priests
MAT.26.15	and said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
MAT.26.16	And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
MAT.26.17	Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
MAT.26.18	And he said, Go into the city to a certain man and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
MAT.26.19	And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them, and they made ready the passover.
MAT.26.20	Now when the evening was come, he sat down at the table with the twelve.
MAT.26.21	And as they ate, he said, Verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray me.
MAT.26.22	And they were exceeding sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
MAT.26.23	And he answered and said, He that dips his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
MAT.26.24	The Son of man goes as it is written of him, but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! It had been good for that man if he had not been born.
MAT.26.25	Then Judas, who was betraying him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
MAT.26.26	And as they were eating, Jesus took the bread, and, having blessed it, broke it and gave it to the disciples and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
MAT.26.27	And taking the cup and having given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
MAT.26.28	for this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
MAT.26.29	But I say unto you, I will not drink from now on of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.
MAT.26.30	And when they had sung a hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Then Jesus said unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night; for it is written, I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
MAT.26.32	But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
MAT.26.33	Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended in thee, yet I will never be offended.
MAT.26.34	Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night before the cock crows, thou shalt deny me three times.
MAT.26.35	Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus came with them unto a place called Gethsemane and said unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
MAT.26.37	And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
MAT.26.38	Then he said unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death; tarry ye here and watch with me.
MAT.26.39	And he went a little further and fell on his face, praying and saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.
MAT.26.40	And he came unto the disciples and found them asleep and said unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
MAT.26.41	Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
MAT.26.42	He went away again the second time and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it, thy will be done.
MAT.26.43	And he came and found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy.
MAT.26.44	And leaving them, he went away again and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
MAT.26.45	Then he came unto his disciples and said unto them, Sleep on now and take your rest; behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
MAT.26.46	Rise, let us be going; behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
MAT.26.47	And while he yet spoke, behold, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the princes of the priests and elders of the people.
MAT.26.48	Now he that betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; hold him fast.
MAT.26.49	And forthwith he came to Jesus and said, Receive joy, master; and kissed him.
MAT.26.50	And Jesus said unto him, Friend, why art thou come? Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and took him.
MAT.26.51	And, behold, one of those who was with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck a slave of the high priest and smote off his ear.
MAT.26.52	Then Jesus said unto him, Put up again thy sword into its place, for all those that take the sword shall perish by the sword.
MAT.26.53	Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
MAT.26.54	But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be?
MAT.26.55	In that same hour Jesus said to the multitude, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
MAT.26.56	But all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.
MAT.26.57	And those that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
MAT.26.58	But Peter followed him afar off unto the patio of the high priest and went in and sat with the servants to see the end.
MAT.26.59	Now the princes of the priests and the elders and all the council sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
MAT.26.60	but found none; though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses
MAT.26.61	who said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days.
MAT.26.62	And the high priest arose and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing to what these witness against thee?
MAT.26.63	But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou art the Christ, the Son of God.
MAT.26.64	Jesus said unto him, Thou hast said it; nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven.
MAT.26.65	Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He has spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
MAT.26.66	What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
MAT.26.67	Then they spit in his face and buffeted him, and others smote him with the staves,
MAT.26.68	saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ; who is he that smote thee?
MAT.26.69	Now Peter sat outside in the patio; and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
MAT.26.70	But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
MAT.26.71	And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him and said unto those that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
MAT.26.72	And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
MAT.26.73	And after a while those that stood by came unto him and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech makes thee manifest.
MAT.26.74	Then he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately a cock crew.
MAT.26.75	And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said unto him, Before the cock crows, thou shalt deny me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly.
MAT.27.1	When the morning was come, all the princes of the priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death,
MAT.27.2	and when they had bound him, they led him away and delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
MAT.27.3	Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the princes of the priests and the elders,
MAT.27.4	saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that to us? Thou shalt see to it.
MAT.27.5	And casting down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed and went and hanged himself.
MAT.27.6	And the princes of the priests taking the silver pieces, said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury because it is the price of blood.
MAT.27.7	And they took counsel and bought with them the potter’s field to bury strangers in.
MAT.27.8	Therefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this day.
MAT.27.9	Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the sons of Israel did value,
MAT.27.10	and gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.
MAT.27.11	And Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou sayest.
MAT.27.12	And being accused by the princes of the priests and the elders, he answered nothing.
MAT.27.13	Then Pilate said unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they witness against thee?
MAT.27.14	And he did not answer him even a word; insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.
MAT.27.15	Now at that feast the governor was accustomed to release unto the people a prisoner, whoever they desired.
MAT.27.16	And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
MAT.27.17	Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto them, Whom desire ye that I release unto you? Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?
MAT.27.18	For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.
MAT.27.19	When he was seated upon the judgment seat, his wife sent unto him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man, for I have suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.
MAT.27.20	But the princes of the priests and the elders persuaded the multitude that they should ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.
MAT.27.21	The governor answered and said unto them, Which of the two desire ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.
MAT.27.22	Pilate said unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus who is called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.
MAT.27.23	And the governor said, Why, what evil has he done? But they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
MAT.27.24	When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water and washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person; see ye to it.
MAT.27.25	Then all the people answered and said, His blood be on us and on our children.
MAT.27.26	Then he released Barabbas unto them; and when he had scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.
MAT.27.27	Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.
MAT.27.28	And they stripped him and put on him a scarlet robe.
MAT.27.29	And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon his head and a reed in his right hand; and they bowed the knee before him and mocked him, saying, Receive joy, King of the Jews!
MAT.27.30	And they spit upon him and took the reed and smote him on the head.
MAT.27.31	And after they had mocked him, they took the robe off from him and put his own raiment on him and led him away to crucify him.
MAT.27.32	And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; him they compelled to bear his cross {Gr. stauros – stake}.
MAT.27.33	And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to say, the place of a skull,
MAT.27.34	they gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall; and when he had tasted of it, he would not drink.
MAT.27.35	And they crucified him and parted his garments, casting lots, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They parted my garments among them, and upon my raiment did they cast lots.
MAT.27.36	And sitting down they watched him there
MAT.27.37	and set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
MAT.27.38	Then there were two thieves crucified with him, one on the right hand and another on the left.
MAT.27.39	And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads
MAT.27.40	and saying, Thou that wouldst destroy the temple and build it in three days, save thyself. If thou art the Son of God, come down from the cross {Gr. stauros – stake}.
MAT.27.41	Likewise also the princes of the priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said,
MAT.27.42	He saved others; he cannot save himself. If he is the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross {Gr. stauros – stake}, and we will believe him.
MAT.27.43	He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him, for he said, I am the Son of God.
MAT.27.44	The thieves also, who were crucified with him, reproached him with the same.
MAT.27.45	Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.
MAT.27.46	And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? That is to say, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
MAT.27.47	Some of those that stood there, when they heard that, said, This man calls for Elijah.
MAT.27.48	And straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink.
MAT.27.49	The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.
MAT.27.50	But Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, gave up the spirit.
MAT.27.51	And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent;
MAT.27.52	and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who slept arose
MAT.27.53	and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many.
MAT.27.54	Now when the centurion and those that were with him, guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and those things that were done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was God’s Son.
MAT.27.55	And many women were there beholding afar off, who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him;
MAT.27.56	among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joses and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
MAT.27.57	When the evening was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also had been a disciple of Jesus;
MAT.27.58	he went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
MAT.27.59	And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth
MAT.27.60	and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock, and he rolled a great stone to the door of the sepulchre and departed.
MAT.27.61	And there was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre.
MAT.27.62	Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the princes of the priests and the Pharisees came together unto Pilate,
MAT.27.63	saying, Lord, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
MAT.27.64	Command therefore that the sepulchre be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come by night and steal him away and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead; so the last error shall be worse than the first.
MAT.27.65	Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch; go your way; make it as secure as ye can.
MAT.27.66	So they went and made the sepulchre secure, sealing the stone and setting a watch.
MAT.28.1	Now well along on the sabbath, as it began to dawn on the first of the sabbaths, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the sepulchre.
MAT.28.2	And, behold, there was a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it.
MAT.28.3	His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow;
MAT.28.4	and for fear of him the guards shook and became as dead men.
MAT.28.5	And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus, who was crucified.
MAT.28.6	He is not here, for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place where the Lord lay.
MAT.28.7	And go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead; and, behold, he goes before you into Galilee; there ye shall see him; behold, I have told you.
MAT.28.8	And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and ran to bring his disciples word.
MAT.28.9	And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them, saying, Receive joy. And they came and held him by the feet and worshipped him.
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said unto them, Be not afraid; go tell my brothers that they may go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.
MAT.28.11	Now when they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported unto the chief priests all the things that were done.
MAT.28.12	And when they were assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a large amount of money to the soldiers,
MAT.28.13	saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night and stole him away while we slept.
MAT.28.14	And if this comes to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him and make you secure.
MAT.28.15	So they took the money and did as they were taught, and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.
MAT.28.16	Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into the mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
MAT.28.17	And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.
MAT.28.18	And Jesus came and spoke unto them, saying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth.
MAT.28.19	Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
MAT.28.20	teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you; and, behold, I am with you always even unto the end of the age. Amen.
MRK.1.1	The beginning of the gospel of Jesus, the Christ, Son of God,
MRK.1.2	as it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
MRK.1.3	The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.
MRK.1.4	John baptized in the wilderness and preached the baptism of repentance for remission of sins.
MRK.1.5	And there went out unto him all the land of Judaea and those of Jerusalem and were all baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins.
MRK.1.6	John was clothed with camel’s hair and with a girdle of a skin about his loins; and he ate locusts and wild honey
MRK.1.7	and preached, saying, There comes one mightier than I after me, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to stoop down and unloose.
MRK.1.8	I indeed have baptized you with water, but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.
MRK.1.9	And it came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth a city of Galilee and was baptized of John in the Jordan.
MRK.1.10	And as soon as he was come out of the water, John saw the heavens opened and the Spirit like a dove descending and resting upon him;
MRK.1.11	and there came a voice from heaven, saying, Thou art my dear Son, in whom I delight.
MRK.1.12	And immediately the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.
MRK.1.13	And he was there in the wilderness forty days and forty nights and was tempted of Satan and was with the wild beasts, and the angels ministered unto him.
MRK.1.14	Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God
MRK.1.15	and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent ye and believe the gospel.
MRK.1.16	Now as he walked by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea, for they were fishers.
MRK.1.17	And Jesus said unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.
MRK.1.18	And straightway they forsook their nets and followed him.
MRK.1.19	And when he had gone a little further from there, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who also were in the ship mending their nets.
MRK.1.20	And straightway he called them; and leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with the hired servants, they went after him.
MRK.1.21	And they entered into Capernaum, and straightway on the sabbath days he entered into the synagogue and taught.
MRK.1.22	And they marvelled at his learning, for he taught them as one that had power with him, and not as the scribes.
MRK.1.23	And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,
MRK.1.24	saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God.
MRK.1.25	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him.
MRK.1.26	And the unclean spirit tore him and cried with a loud voice and came out of him.
MRK.1.27	And they were all amazed, insomuch that they questioned among themselves, saying, What thing is this? What new doctrine is this? for he commands the unclean spirits with power, and they obey him.
MRK.1.28	And immediately his fame spread abroad throughout all the region round about Galilee.
MRK.1.29	And forthwith, when they were come out of the synagogue, they entered into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.
MRK.1.30	But Simon’s mother-in-law lay sick of a fever, and soon they told him of her.
MRK.1.31	And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up; and the fever left her by and by, and she ministered unto them.
MRK.1.32	In the evening, when the sun was down, they brought unto him all that were diseased and those that were possessed with devils.
MRK.1.33	And all the city was gathered together at the door.
MRK.1.34	And he healed many that were sick of diverse diseases and cast out many devils and suffered not the devils to speak because they knew him.
MRK.1.35	And in the morning, rising up a great while before day, he went out and departed into a solitary place and prayed there.
MRK.1.36	And Simon and those that were with him followed after him.
MRK.1.37	And when they had found him, they said unto him, All men seek for thee.
MRK.1.38	And he said unto them, Let us go into the next towns that I may preach there also, for truly I came forth for that purpose.
MRK.1.39	And he preached in their synagogues throughout all Galilee and cast out devils.
MRK.1.40	And a leper came to him, beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him, If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
MRK.1.41	And Jesus, having mercy on him, put forth his hand and touched him and said unto him, I will; be thou clean.
MRK.1.42	And as soon as he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was clean.
MRK.1.43	And he straitly charged him and forthwith sent him away
MRK.1.44	and said unto him, See thou say nothing to any man, but go, show thyself to the priest, and offer for thy cleansing those things which Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
MRK.1.45	But he went out and began to publish it much and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places; and they came to him from every quarter.
MRK.2.1	And again he entered into Capernaum after some days, and it was heard that he was in the house.
MRK.2.2	And soon many were gathered together, insomuch that there was no room to receive them, no, not so much as about the door; and he preached the word unto them.
MRK.2.3	And they came unto him, bringing a paralytic, carried by four men.
MRK.2.4	And when they could not come near unto him for the crowd, they uncovered the roof of the house where he was; and when they had broken it open, they let down the bed in which the paralytic lay.
MRK.2.5	When Jesus saw their faith, he said unto the paralytic, Son, thy sins are forgiven thee.
MRK.2.6	But there were certain of the scribes sitting there and thinking in their hearts,
MRK.2.7	Why does this fellow so blaspheme? Who can forgive sins but God only?
MRK.2.8	And Jesus, knowing afterward in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said unto them, Why think ye these things in your hearts?
MRK.2.9	What is easier to say to the paralytic, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Arise and take up thy bed and walk?
MRK.2.10	But that ye may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins (he spoke to the sick of the palsy),
MRK.2.11	I say unto thee, Arise and take up thy bed and go to thy house.
MRK.2.12	And by and by he arose, took up the bed, and went forth before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like unto this.
MRK.2.13	And he went again unto the sea; and all the multitude resorted unto him, and he taught them.
MRK.2.14	And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the receipt of custom and said unto him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.
MRK.2.15	And it came to pass, that as Jesus sat at the table in his house, many publicans and sinners sat also at the table together with Jesus and his disciples: for there were many and they had followed him.
MRK.2.16	And the scribes and Pharisees, seeing him eat with publicans and sinners, said unto his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?
MRK.2.17	When Jesus heard it, he said unto them, They that are whole have no need of the physician, but they that are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but the sinners to repentance.
MRK.2.18	And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees did fast and therefore came and said unto him, Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but thy disciples fast not?
MRK.2.19	And Jesus said unto them, Can those who are in a wedding fast while the bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.
MRK.2.20	But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.
MRK.2.21	No one mends an old garment with a new piece of cloth, or else the new piece that filled it up tears away from the old, and the rent is made worse.
MRK.2.22	And no one pours new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine bursts the wineskins, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are lost; but new wine must be poured into new wineskins.
MRK.2.23	And it came to pass that as he went through the planted fields again on the sabbath day, his disciples began, as they walked, to pluck the ears of grain.
MRK.2.24	And the Pharisees said unto him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful?
MRK.2.25	And he said unto them, Have ye never read what David did when he had need and was hungry, he and those that were with him?
MRK.2.26	How he went into the house of God in the days of Abiathar the high priest and ate the showbread, which is not lawful to eat but for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?
MRK.2.27	And he said unto them, The sabbath was made for man, and not man for the sabbath;
MRK.2.28	therefore the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.
MRK.3.1	And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had a withered hand.
MRK.3.2	And they watched him, whether he would heal him on the sabbath day, that they might accuse him.
MRK.3.3	So he said unto the man who had the withered hand, Stand forth.
MRK.3.4	And he said unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days or to do evil? to save the person or to kill them? But they were silent.
MRK.3.5	And looking round about on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their hearts, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other.
MRK.3.6	And as the Pharisees went forth, they took counsel with the Herodians against him, to kill him.
MRK.3.7	But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea
MRK.3.8	and from Jerusalem and from Idumaea and from beyond Jordan. And those who dwell around Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came unto him.
MRK.3.9	And he spoke to his disciples that a small ship should wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him.
MRK.3.10	For he had healed many, insomuch that as many as had plagues pressed upon him to touch him.
MRK.3.11	And the unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him and cried out, saying, Thou art the Son of God.
MRK.3.12	And he straitly charged them that they should not make him known.
MRK.3.13	And he went up to the mountain and called unto himself whom he would, and they came unto him.
MRK.3.14	And he established twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach
MRK.3.15	and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out devils:
MRK.3.16	Simon, whom he gave the name Peter;
MRK.3.17	and James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed them Boanerges, which is The sons of thunder;
MRK.3.18	and Andrew and Philip and Bartholomew and Matthew and Thomas and James the son of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus and Simon the Canaanite
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him; and they came home.
MRK.3.20	And the multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.
MRK.3.21	And when his friends and family heard of it, they went out to lay hold on him; for they said, He is beside himself.
MRK.3.22	But the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem said that he had Beelzebub and that by the prince of the devils he cast out devils.
MRK.3.23	And he called them unto him and said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?
MRK.3.24	If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot remain.
MRK.3.25	And if a house is divided against itself, that house cannot remain.
MRK.3.26	And if Satan rises up against himself and is divided, he cannot remain, but has an end.
MRK.3.27	No man can enter into a strong man’s house and spoil his goods except he will first bind the strong man, and then he will spoil his house.
MRK.3.28	Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men and whatever blasphemies with which they shall blaspheme,
MRK.3.29	but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Holy Spirit shall never have forgiveness but is obligated to eternal judgment,
MRK.3.30	because they said, He has an unclean spirit.
MRK.3.31	There came then his brethren and his mother, and, standing without, sent unto him, calling him.
MRK.3.32	The multitude was sitting all around him, and they said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brothers and sisters seek thee without.
MRK.3.33	And he answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brethren?
MRK.3.34	And looking round about on those who sat about him, he said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
MRK.3.35	For whosoever doeth the will of God, the same is my brother and my sister and my mother.
MRK.4.1	And he began again to teach by the sea side, and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he entered into a ship and sat in the sea, and the whole multitude was by the sea on the land.
MRK.4.2	And he taught them many things by parables and said unto them in his doctrine,
MRK.4.3	Hearken; Behold, the sower went out to sow;
MRK.4.4	and it came to pass as he sowed some fell by the way side, and the fowls of the air came and devoured it up.
MRK.4.5	And some fell on stony ground where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth;
MRK.4.6	but when the sun was up, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered away.
MRK.4.7	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.
MRK.4.8	And other fell on good ground and did yield fruit that sprang up and increased and brought forth: some thirty and some sixty and some a hundred.
MRK.4.9	And he said unto them, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
MRK.4.10	And when he was alone, those that were close to him with the twelve asked of him the parable.
MRK.4.11	And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but unto those that are without, all these things are done in parables,
MRK.4.12	that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest at any time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven them.
MRK.4.13	And he said unto them, Know ye not this parable? How then will ye understand all the parables?
MRK.4.14	The sower is he who sows the word.
MRK.4.15	And these are those by the way side, in whom the word is sown, but when they have heard, Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.
MRK.4.16	And likewise these are those who are sown on stony ground, who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness
MRK.4.17	but have no root in themselves and are temporal; afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises for the word’s sake, immediately they are offended.
MRK.4.18	And these are those who are sown among thorns, such as hear the word,
MRK.4.19	and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
MRK.4.20	And these are those who are sown in good ground, such as hear the word and receive it and bring forth fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.
MRK.4.21	And he also said unto them, Is the lamp brought to be put under the bushel or under the bed? and not to be set in the lampstand?
MRK.4.22	For there is nothing hid which shall not be manifested; nor secret which shall not be exposed.
MRK.4.23	If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.
MRK.4.24	And he also said unto them, Take heed what ye hear; with the measure ye measure by, ye shall be measured by others, and unto you that hear shall more be added.
MRK.4.25	For he that has, to him shall be given; and he that has not, from him shall be taken even that which he has.
MRK.4.26	He also said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground
MRK.4.27	and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring forth and grow up, he knows not how.
MRK.4.28	For the earth brings forth fruit of herself: first the blade, then the ear, after that the full grain in the ear.
MRK.4.29	But when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he puts in the sickle because the harvest is come.
MRK.4.30	He also said, Whereunto shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we compare it?
MRK.4.31	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is less than all the seeds that are in the earth;
MRK.4.32	but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs and shoots out great branches, so that the fowls of the air may lodge under the shadow of it.
MRK.4.33	And with many such parables he spoke the word unto them as they were able to hear it.
MRK.4.34	But without a parable he did not speak unto them; and when they were alone, he expounded all things to his disciples.
MRK.4.35	And that same day, when evening was come, he said unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side.
MRK.4.36	And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships.
MRK.4.37	And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full.
MRK.4.38	And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow; and they awoke him and said unto him, Master, dost thou not care that we perish?
MRK.4.39	And as he arose, he rebuked the wind and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.
MRK.4.40	And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? How is it that ye have no faith?
MRK.4.41	And they feared exceedingly and said one to another, Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?
MRK.5.1	And they came over unto the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.
MRK.5.2	And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him a man of the tombs, with an unclean spirit,
MRK.5.3	who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him, no, not with chains,
MRK.5.4	because many times he had been bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been broken in pieces by him, and the fetters shattered; neither could anyone tame him.
MRK.5.5	And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and hurting himself with stones.
MRK.5.6	But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him.
MRK.5.7	Crying out with a loud voice, he said, What hast thou with me, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not.
MRK.5.8	For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit.
MRK.5.9	And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion, for we are many.
MRK.5.10	And he besought him much that he would not send him away out of that country.
MRK.5.11	Now near unto the mountains there was a great herd of swine feeding,
MRK.5.12	and all those devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them.
MRK.5.13	And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine, and the herd fell over a cliff into the sea (they were about two thousand) and were choked in the sea.
MRK.5.14	And those that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people went out to see what it was that had happened.
MRK.5.15	And they come to Jesus and see him that was tormented by the demon and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
MRK.5.16	And those that saw it told them what happened to him that had the demon and also concerning the swine.
MRK.5.17	And they began to plead with him to depart out of their borders.
MRK.5.18	And as he was entering into the ship, he that had been troubled by the demon besought him that he might be with him.
MRK.5.19	But Jesus suffered him not but said unto him, Go home to thy friends and family and tell them what great things the Lord has done with thee and how he has had mercy on thee.
MRK.5.20	And he went and began to publish in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done with him, and everyone marveled.
MRK.5.21	And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, a great multitude gathered unto him, and he was near the sea.
MRK.5.22	And one of the princes of the synagogue came, Jairus by name; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet
MRK.5.23	and besought him greatly, saying, My little daughter lies at the point of death; come and lay thy hands on her that she may be saved, and she shall live.
MRK.5.24	And Jesus went with him; and a great multitude followed him and thronged him.
MRK.5.25	And a certain woman, who had an issue of blood twelve years
MRK.5.26	and had suffered many things of many physicians and had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse;
MRK.5.27	when she had heard of Jesus, came from behind among the multitude and touched his garment.
MRK.5.28	For she said, If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be saved.
MRK.5.29	And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up; and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.
MRK.5.30	And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned to the crowd and said, Who touched my clothes?
MRK.5.31	And his disciples said unto him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee and sayest thou, Who touched me?
MRK.5.32	And he looked round about to see her that had done this thing.
MRK.5.33	But the woman fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, came and fell down before him and told him all the truth.
MRK.5.34	And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith has made thee saved; go in peace and remain whole of thy plague.
MRK.5.35	While he yet spoke, there came from the ruler of the synagogue’s house certain who said, Thy daughter is dead: why troublest thou the Master any further?
MRK.5.36	As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, he said unto the prince of the synagogue, Be not afraid, only believe.
MRK.5.37	And he suffered no one to follow him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James.
MRK.5.38	And they came to the house of the prince of the synagogue and saw the tumult and those that wept and wailed greatly.
MRK.5.39	And when he was come in, he said unto them, Why make ye this ado and weep? The damsel is not dead, but sleeps.
MRK.5.40	And they laughed him to scorn. But when he had put them all out, he took the father and the mother of the damsel and those that were with him and entered in where the damsel was lying.
MRK.5.41	And taking the damsel by the hand, he said unto her, Talitha cumi, which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, arise.
MRK.5.42	And straightway the damsel arose and walked, for she was twelve years old. And they were astonished with a great astonishment.
MRK.5.43	And he charged them straitly that no one should know it and commanded that something should be given her to eat.
MRK.6.1	And he went out from there and came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.
MRK.6.2	And when the sabbath day was come, he began to teach in the synagogue; and many hearing him were astonished, saying, From where has this man these things? and what wisdom is this which is given unto him and such mighty works that are wrought by his hands?
MRK.6.3	Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses and of Juda and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended at him.
MRK.6.4	But Jesus said unto them, A prophet is not dishonoured except in his own country and among his own kin and in his own house.
MRK.6.5	And he could do no mighty work there except that he laid his hands upon a few sick folk and healed them.
MRK.6.6	And he marvelled because of their unbelief. And he went through the villages round about, teaching.
MRK.6.7	And he called unto him the twelve and began to send them forth by two and two and gave them power over the unclean spirits
MRK.6.8	and commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey except a staff only: no provision bag, no bread, no money in their purse;
MRK.6.9	but be shod with sandals and not put on two coats.
MRK.6.10	And he said unto them, In whatever place ye enter into a house, there abide until ye depart from that place.
MRK.6.11	And whosoever shall not receive you nor hear you, when ye depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet in testimony against them. Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that city.
MRK.6.12	And they went out and preached that men should repent.
MRK.6.13	And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many that were sick, and they were healed.
MRK.6.14	And king Herod heard of him (for his name was spread abroad), and he said, John the Baptist has risen from the dead, and therefore virtues operate in him.
MRK.6.15	Others said, It is Elijah. And others said, It is the prophet or one of the prophets.
MRK.6.16	But when Herod heard of it, he said, This is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.
MRK.6.17	For Herod himself had sent forth and laid hold upon John and bound him in prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife, for he had married her.
MRK.6.18	For John had said unto Herod, It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother’s wife.
MRK.6.19	Therefore Herodias had a quarrel against him and would have killed him, but she could not;
MRK.6.20	for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and respected him; and when he heard him, he did many things and heard him gladly.
MRK.6.21	And when a convenient day was come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper to his princes and tribunes and to the principal people of Galilee;
MRK.6.22	and when the daughter of Herodias came in and danced and pleased Herod and those that sat with him, the king said unto the damsel, Ask of me whatsoever thou wilt, and I will give it unto thee.
MRK.6.23	And he swore unto her, Whatsoever thou shalt ask of me, I will give it unto thee, unto the half of my kingdom.
MRK.6.24	And she went forth, and said unto her mother, What shall I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist.
MRK.6.25	And she came in with haste unto the king and asked, saying, I will that thou give me immediately in a platter the head of John the Baptist.
MRK.6.26	And the king was exceeding sorry, yet for his oath’s sake and for the sakes of those who sat with him, he would not reject her.
MRK.6.27	And straightway the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought, and he went and beheaded him in the prison
MRK.6.28	and brought his head in a platter and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother.
MRK.6.29	And when his disciples heard of it, they came and took up his corpse and laid it in a tomb.
MRK.6.30	And the apostles gathered themselves together unto Jesus and told him everything they had done and what they had taught.
MRK.6.31	And he said unto them, Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place and rest a while; for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.
MRK.6.32	And they departed into a desert place by ship privately.
MRK.6.33	And many saw them departing and knew him and ran there afoot out of the cities and arrived before them and came together unto him.
MRK.6.34	And Jesus, when he came out, saw a great multitude and had mercy on them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.
MRK.6.35	And when the day was now far spent, his disciples came unto him and said, This is a desert place, and now the time is far passed;
MRK.6.36	send them away that they may go into the country round about and into the villages and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.
MRK.6.37	He answered and said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said unto him, Shall we go and buy bread for two hundred denarius and give them to eat?
MRK.6.38	He said unto them, How many loaves have ye? go and see. And when they knew, they said, Five, and two fishes.
MRK.6.39	And he commanded them to make all sit down by companies upon the green grass.
MRK.6.40	And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.
MRK.6.41	And when he had taken the five loaves and the two fishes, looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples to set before them, and the two fishes he divided among them all.
MRK.6.42	And they all ate and were filled.
MRK.6.43	And they took up twelve baskets full of the fragments and of the fishes.
MRK.6.44	And those that ate were five thousand men.
MRK.6.45	And straightway he told his disciples to get quickly into the ship and to go to the other side before him unto Bethsaida while he dispatched the people.
MRK.6.46	And when he had dispatched them, he departed into the mountain to pray.
MRK.6.47	And when night was come, the ship was in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land.
MRK.6.48	And he saw them toiling in rowing, for the wind was contrary unto them; and about the fourth watch of the night he came unto them, walking upon the sea, and would have passed by them.
MRK.6.49	But when they saw him walking upon the sea, they supposed it had been a ghost and cried out,
MRK.6.50	For they all saw him and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them and said unto them, Be of good cheer; I AM; be not afraid.
MRK.6.51	And he went up unto them into the ship, and the wind ceased; and they were sore amazed in themselves beyond measure and wondered.
MRK.6.52	For they had not yet derived understanding in the loaves, for their hearts were blind.
MRK.6.53	And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Gennesaret and drew to the shore.
MRK.6.54	And when they were come out of the ship, straightway they knew him
MRK.6.55	and ran through that whole region round about and began to carry about in beds those that were sick, where they heard he was.
MRK.6.56	And wherever he entered, into villages or cities or fields, they laid the sick in the streets and besought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment, and as many as touched him were saved.
MRK.7.1	Then came together unto him the Pharisees and some of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,
MRK.7.2	who upon seeing some of his disciples eat bread with common, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they condemned them.
MRK.7.3	(For the Pharisees and all the Jews, unless they wash their hands often, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.
MRK.7.4	And when they come from the market, unless they wash, they eat not. And there are many other things which they took upon themselves to hold such as the washing of cups and pots, brasen vessels and of tables.)
MRK.7.5	Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why do thy disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders but eat bread with unwashed hands?
MRK.7.6	He answered and said unto them, Well has Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honours me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.
MRK.7.7	Howbeit in vain do they honor me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
MRK.7.8	For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups, and many other such like things ye do.
MRK.7.9	And he also said unto them, Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.
MRK.7.10	For Moses said, Honour thy father and thy mother, and, Whosoever curses father or mother shall most definitely die.
MRK.7.11	But ye say, It is enough if a man shall say to his father or mother, It is all Corban, (that is to say, my gift to God) whatever with which thou mightest be profited by me.
MRK.7.12	And ye suffer him to do no more for his father or for his mother,
MRK.7.13	invalidating the word of God with your tradition, which ye have given; and many such like things do ye.
MRK.7.14	And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, Hearken unto me every one of you and understand;
MRK.7.15	there is nothing from outside the man that entering into him can defile him, but the things which come out of him, those are what defile the man.
MRK.7.16	If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.
MRK.7.17	And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable.
MRK.7.18	And he said unto them, Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not understand that anything from outside that enters into the man cannot defile him?
MRK.7.19	Because it enters not into his heart, but into the belly, and the man goes out to the privy and purges all foods.
MRK.7.20	For he had said that it is what comes out of the man that defiles the man.
MRK.7.21	For from within, out of the heart of men, come forth the evil thoughts, the adulteries, the fornications, the murders,
MRK.7.22	the thefts, the covetousness, the wickedness, the deceit, the lasciviousness, the evil eye, the slander, the pride, the unwiseness:
MRK.7.23	all these evil things come out from within and defile the man.
MRK.7.24	And from there he arose and went into the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and entering into a house, desired that no man know of it; but he could not be hid.
MRK.7.25	For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him and came and fell at his feet;
MRK.7.26	the woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation, and she besought him that he would cast forth the demon out of her daughter.
MRK.7.27	But Jesus said unto her, Let the children first be filled, for it is not good to take the children’s bread and to cast it unto the dogs.
MRK.7.28	And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table eat of the children’s crumbs.
MRK.7.29	And he said unto her, For this word go; the demon has gone out of thy daughter.
MRK.7.30	And when she came to her house, she found that the demon had gone out, and the daughter lay upon the bed.
MRK.7.31	And again, departing from the coasts of Tyre, he came by Sidon unto the sea of Galilee through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.
MRK.7.32	And they bring unto him one that was deaf and had an impediment in his speech, and they beseech him to put his hand upon him.
MRK.7.33	And taking him aside from the multitude, he put his fingers into the man’s ears; and spitting, he touched the man’s tongue with the saliva;
MRK.7.34	and looking up to heaven, he cried out, and said, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.
MRK.7.35	And straightway his ears were opened, and that which bound his tongue was loosed, and he spoke plainly.
MRK.7.36	And he charged them that they should tell no one; but the more he commanded them, so much more and more they published it
MRK.7.37	and were beyond measure astonished, saying, He has done all things well: he makes both the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak.
MRK.8.1	In those days, as before, there was a great multitude, and they had nothing to eat; Jesus called his disciples unto him and said unto them,
MRK.8.2	I have mercy on the multitude because they have now been with me three days and have nothing to eat;
MRK.8.3	And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way, for some of them came from afar.
MRK.8.4	And his disciples answered him, From where can anyone satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness?
MRK.8.5	And he asked them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven.
MRK.8.6	And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground; and taking the seven loaves and having given thanks, he broke them and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they set them before the multitude.
MRK.8.7	And they also had a few small fishes; and he blessed them and commanded to set them also before them.
MRK.8.8	So they ate and were filled; and they took up of the broken food that was left seven baskets.
MRK.8.9	And those that had eaten were about four thousand; and he dispatched them.
MRK.8.10	And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples and came into the parts of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	And the Pharisees came forth and began to argue with him, demanding of him a sign from heaven, tempting him.
MRK.8.12	And crying out in his spirit, he said, Why does this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.
MRK.8.13	And he left them and, entering into the ship again, departed to the other side.
MRK.8.14	Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.
MRK.8.15	And he commanded them, saying, Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the leaven of Herod.
MRK.8.16	And they argued among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread.
MRK.8.17	And as Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why argue ye because ye have no bread? Do ye not consider nor understand? is your heart yet blind?
MRK.8.18	Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember?
MRK.8.19	When I broke the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? They said unto him, Twelve.
MRK.8.20	And when the seven loaves among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up? And they said, Seven.
MRK.8.21	And he said unto them, How is it that ye do not yet understand?
MRK.8.22	And he came to Bethsaida, and they bring a blind man unto him and beseech him to touch him.
MRK.8.23	So, taking the blind man by the hand, he led him out of the town; and spitting into his eyes and putting his hands upon them, he asked him if he saw anything.
MRK.8.24	And looking, he said, I see men; I see that they walk as trees.
MRK.8.25	After that, he put his hands again upon his eyes and caused him to see; and he was whole and saw everyone, far away and clearly.
MRK.8.26	And he sent him away to his house, saying, Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.
MRK.8.27	And Jesus and his disciples went out into the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, Who do men say that I am?
MRK.8.28	And they answered, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.
MRK.8.29	Then he said unto them, But who say ye that I am? And Peter answered and said unto him, Thou art the Christ!
MRK.8.30	And he commanded them that they should tell no one of this regarding him.
MRK.8.31	And he began to teach them that it was convenient that the Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the princes of the priests and of the scribes, and be killed and after three days rise again.
MRK.8.32	And he spoke this word clearly. Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him.
MRK.8.33	And he, turning about and looking at his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Get thyself from me, Satan, for thou knowest not the things that are of God, but the things that are of men.
MRK.8.34	And calling the multitude unto him with his disciples, he said unto them, Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross {Gr. stauros – stake} and follow me.
MRK.8.35	For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel’s, the same shall save it.
MRK.8.36	For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?
MRK.8.37	Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
MRK.8.38	Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.
MRK.9.1	He also said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That there are some of those who are here who shall not taste of death until they have seen the kingdom of God which comes with power.
MRK.9.2	And six days afterwards Jesus took Peter and James and John, and separated them apart by themselves unto a high mountain; and he was transfigured before them.
MRK.9.3	And his raiment became shining, exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can white them.
MRK.9.4	And there appeared unto them Elijah with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus.
MRK.9.5	Then Peter answering, said unto Jesus, Master, it shall be good for us to remain here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for thee, and another for Moses, and another for Elijah.
MRK.9.6	For he knew not what he was saying, for he was beside himself.
MRK.9.7	And a cloud came that overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear ye him.
MRK.9.8	And suddenly, when they had looked around, they saw no one any more, except Jesus only with themselves.
MRK.9.9	And as they came down from the mountain, he commanded them that they should tell no one what things they had seen until the Son of man was risen from the dead.
MRK.9.10	And they kept the word within themselves, questioning one with another what the rising from the dead should be.
MRK.9.11	And they asked him, saying, Why do the scribes say that Elijah must first come?
MRK.9.12	And he answered and told them, Elijah verily shall come first and restore all things and how it is written of the Son of man, that he must suffer many things and be esteemed as nothing.
MRK.9.13	But I say unto you, That Elijah has indeed come, and they have done unto him whatsoever they wished, as it is written of him.
MRK.9.14	And as he came to the disciples, he saw a great multitude about them and scribes that disputed with them.
MRK.9.15	And straightway all the people, when they beheld him, were greatly amazed, and running to him saluted him.
MRK.9.16	And he asked the scribes, What dispute ye with them?
MRK.9.17	And one of the multitude answering, said, Master, I have brought unto thee my son, who has a dumb spirit;
MRK.9.18	and wherever he takes him, he tears him, and he foams and gnashes with his teeth and pines away; and I spoke to thy disciples that they should cast him out, and they could not.
MRK.9.19	Answering, he said unto him, O unfaithful generation, how long shall I be with you? How long must I suffer you? Bring him unto me.
MRK.9.20	And they brought him unto him; and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tore him; and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming.
MRK.9.21	And Jesus asked his father, How long ago is it since this came unto him? And he said, Of a child.
MRK.9.22	And ofttimes it has cast him into the fire and into the waters to kill him, but if thou canst do any thing, help us, having mercy on us.
MRK.9.23	And Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe this, all things are possible to him that believes.
MRK.9.24	And straightway the father of the child crying out with tears, said, Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief.
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that the multitude concurred, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying unto him, Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I command thee, come out of him and enter no more into him.
MRK.9.26	Then the spirit, crying out and rending him sore, came out; and he remained as one dead, insomuch that many said that he was dead.
MRK.9.27	But Jesus, taking him by the hand, straightened him up; and he arose.
MRK.9.28	And when he was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we cast him out?
MRK.9.29	And he said unto them, This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer and fasting.
MRK.9.30	And having left there, they walked together through Galilee; and he did not wish that anyone should know of it.
MRK.9.31	For he went on teaching his disciples and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into hands of men, and they shall kill him; and after he is dead, he shall rise the third day.
MRK.9.32	But they did not understand this word and were afraid to ask him.
MRK.9.33	And he came to Capernaum; and being in the house he asked them, What was it that ye disputed among yourselves on the way?
MRK.9.34	But they were silent; for on the way they had disputed among themselves, who should be the greatest.
MRK.9.35	Then, sitting down, he called the twelve and said unto them, If anyone desires to be first, the same shall be last of all and servant of all.
MRK.9.36	And taking a child, he set him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms, he said unto them,
MRK.9.37	Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him that sent me.
MRK.9.38	And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name and he does not follow us; and we forbade him because he does not follow us.
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, Forbid him not, for there is no one who does a miracle in my name that can then speak evil of me.
MRK.9.40	For he that is not against us is for us.
MRK.9.41	For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink in my name because ye are of the Christ, verily I say unto you, he shall not lose his reward.
MRK.9.42	And whosoever shall be a stumbling block to one of these little ones that believe in me, it would be better for him if a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.
MRK.9.43	And if thy hand causes thee to fall, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that can never be quenched,
MRK.9.44	where their worm does not die, and the fire is never quenched.
MRK.9.45	And if thy foot causes thee to fall, cut it off; it is better for thee to enter halt into life than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that can never be quenched,
MRK.9.46	where their worm does not die, and the fire is never quenched.
MRK.9.47	And if thine eye causes thee to fall, pluck it out; it is better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than having two eyes to be cast into hell,
MRK.9.48	where their worm does not die, and the fire is never quenched.
MRK.9.49	For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.
MRK.9.50	Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltness, with what will ye season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another.
MRK.10.1	And he left there and came into the borders of Judaea and behind the Jordan; and the multitude joined him again, and he taught them again as was his custom.
MRK.10.2	And the Pharisees came to him and asked him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife? tempting him.
MRK.10.3	And he answered and said unto them, What did Moses command you?
MRK.10.4	And they said, Moses suffered to write a bill of divorce and to put her away.
MRK.10.5	And Jesus answered and said unto them, For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this commandment.
MRK.10.6	But at the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.
MRK.10.7	For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall join to his wife;
MRK.10.8	and they that were two shall be made one flesh, so then they are no longer two, but one flesh.
MRK.10.9	Therefore what God has joined together, let not man separate.
MRK.10.10	And in the house his disciples asked him again of the same matter.
MRK.10.11	And he said unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife and marry another commits adultery against her.
MRK.10.12	And if the woman shall put away her husband and be married to another, she commits adultery.
MRK.10.13	And they brought young children to him that he should touch them, and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
MRK.10.14	And Jesus seeing it, became angry and said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto me and hinder them not, for of such is the kingdom of God.
MRK.10.15	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.
MRK.10.16	And taking them up in his arms and putting his hands upon them, he blessed them.
MRK.10.17	And as he was leaving to continue his way, there came one running, who kneeled before him and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?
MRK.10.18	And Jesus said unto him, Why dost thou call me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.
MRK.10.19	Thou knowest the commandments: Do not commit adultery, Do not murder, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honour thy father and mother.
MRK.10.20	And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these I have observed from my youth.
MRK.10.21	Then Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him, One thing thou lackest: go, sell all that thou hast and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, take up the cross {Gr. stauros – stake}, and follow me taking up thy stake (if thy desire is to be perfect).
MRK.10.22	But he, saddened by this word, went away grieved, for he had great possessions.
MRK.10.23	Then Jesus, looking around, said unto his disciples, How hardly shall those that have riches enter into the kingdom of God!
MRK.10.24	And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answered again and said unto them, Children, how hard is it for those that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
MRK.10.25	It is easier to pass a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
MRK.10.26	But they were astonished even more, saying in themselves, Who then can save himself?
MRK.10.27	Then Jesus looking upon them said, For men it is impossible, but not for God because all things are possible for God.
MRK.10.28	Then Peter began to say unto him, Behold, we have left all and have followed thee.
MRK.10.29	And answering him, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, There is no one that has left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake and the gospel’s
MRK.10.30	who shall not receive one hundredfold now in this time: houses and brethren and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the world to come eternal life.
MRK.10.31	But many of the first shall be last; and of the last first.
MRK.10.32	And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus went before them; and they were amazed, and they followed him with fear. Then, taking the twelve aside again, he began to tell them what things would happen unto him,
MRK.10.33	saying, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered unto the princes of the priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death and shall deliver him to the Gentiles,
MRK.10.34	and they shall mock him and shall scourge him and shall spit upon him and shall kill him; but the third day he shall rise again.
MRK.10.35	Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came unto him, saying, Master, we would that thou should do for us whatever we shall ask.
MRK.10.36	And he said unto them, What would ye that I should do for you?
MRK.10.37	They said unto him, Grant unto us that we may sit, one at thy right hand and the other at thy left hand in thy glory.
MRK.10.38	Then Jesus said unto them, Ye know not what ye ask; can ye drink the cup that I drink? Or be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?
MRK.10.39	And they said unto him, We can. And Jesus said unto them, Ye shall indeed drink the cup that I drink, and of the baptism that I am baptized with ye shall be baptized;
MRK.10.40	but to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared.
MRK.10.41	And when the ten heard it, they began to be angry against James and John.
MRK.10.42	But Jesus, calling unto them, said unto them, Ye know that those who are seen to be princes among the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those that are great among them wield power over them.
MRK.10.43	But it shall not be like this among you, for whosoever desires to make himself great among you shall be your servant;
MRK.10.44	and whosoever of you that desires to be first shall be slave of all.
MRK.10.45	For even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to serve and to give his life in ransom for many.
MRK.10.46	And so they come to Jericho, and as he went out of Jericho with his disciples and a great multitude, blind Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, sat by the highway side begging.
MRK.10.47	And hearing that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
MRK.10.48	And many told him to be silent, but he cried even more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
MRK.10.49	Then Jesus stood still and commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying unto him, Have confidence, rise; he calls thee.
MRK.10.50	He, therefore, casting away his garment, rose and came to Jesus.
MRK.10.51	And Jesus, answering, said unto him, What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? And the blind man said unto him, Master, that I might receive my sight.
MRK.10.52	And Jesus said unto him, Go; thy faith has saved thee. And immediately he received his sight and followed Jesus in the way.
MRK.11.1	And when they came near to Jerusalem unto Bethphage and Bethany at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples
MRK.11.2	and said unto them, Go to the place which is before you; and as soon as ye are entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, upon which no man ever sat; loose him and bring him.
MRK.11.3	And if anyone says unto you, Why do ye this? say ye that the Lord has need of him, and straightway he will send him here.
MRK.11.4	And they went and found the colt tied by the door outside between two ways, and they loosed him.
MRK.11.5	And some of those that stood there said unto them, What do ye, loosing the colt?
MRK.11.6	Then they said unto them even as Jesus had commanded, and they let them go.
MRK.11.7	They brought the colt to Jesus and cast their garments on him, and he sat upon him.
MRK.11.8	And many spread their garments in the way, and others cut down leaves off the trees and spread them in the way.
MRK.11.9	And those that went before and those that followed cried out, saying, Hosanna; Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord;
MRK.11.10	blessed be the kingdom of our father David, that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.
MRK.11.11	And the Lord entered into Jerusalem and into the temple; and when he had looked around upon all things, and it being now late, he went out unto Bethany with the twelve.
MRK.11.12	And the next day when they left Bethany, he was hungry,
MRK.11.13	and seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing upon her; but when he came to her, he found nothing but leaves, for the time of figs was not yet.
MRK.11.14	Then Jesus, answering, said to the fig tree, Never again shall anyone eat fruit of thee hereafter for ever. And his disciples heard it.
MRK.11.15	And they come to Jerusalem, and Jesus, entering into the temple, began to cast out those that sold and bought in the temple and overthrew the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of those that sold doves
MRK.11.16	and would not suffer that any man should carry any vessel through the temple.
MRK.11.17	And he taught them, saying, Is it not written that my house shall be called house of prayer by all the nations? but ye have made it a den of thieves.
MRK.11.18	And the scribes and the princes of the priests heard it and sought how they might kill him, for they feared him because all the multitude was astonished at his doctrine.
MRK.11.19	But when evening was come, Jesus went out of the city.
MRK.11.20	And passing by in the morning, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.
MRK.11.21	Then Peter, remembering, said unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou didst curse is withered away.
MRK.11.22	And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Have faith in God.
MRK.11.23	For verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain, Remove thyself and cast thyself into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that what he says shall be done whatsoever he says shall be done unto him.
MRK.11.24	Therefore I say unto you that everything that ye ask for, praying, believe that ye receive it, and it shall come upon you.
MRK.11.25	And when ye are praying, forgive if ye have anything against anyone, so that your Father who is in the heavens will also forgive you your trespasses.
MRK.11.26	For if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father who is in the heavens forgive your trespasses.
MRK.11.27	And they returned to Jerusalem, and as he was walking in the temple, the princes of the priests and the scribes and the elders came
MRK.11.28	and said unto him, By what faculty doest thou these things? and who gave thee this faculty to do these things?
MRK.11.29	Then Jesus, answering, said unto them, I will also ask of you one word, and respond unto me, and I will tell you with what faculty I do these things.
MRK.11.30	The baptism of John, was it of heaven or of men? Respond unto me.
MRK.11.31	Then they thought inside themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
MRK.11.32	But if we shall say, Of men, we fear the people, for everyone judged regarding John that he truly was a prophet.
MRK.11.33	And answering, they said unto Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Neither shall I tell you with what faculty I do these things.
MRK.12.1	And he began to speak unto them by parables. A certain man planted a vineyard and set a hedge about it and dug a place for the winefat and built a tower and let it out to husbandmen and went far away.
MRK.12.2	And at the season he sent to the husbandmen a slave that he might receive from the husbandmen of the fruit of the vineyard.
MRK.12.3	And taking him, they beat him and sent him away empty.
MRK.12.4	And again he sent unto them another slave, and casting stones at him, they wounded him in the head and sent him away shamefully handled.
MRK.12.5	And again he sent another, and him they killed and many others, beating some and killing some.
MRK.12.6	Having yet therefore one son, his wellbeloved, he sent him also last unto them, saying, They will reverence my son.
MRK.12.7	But those husbandmen said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and the place shall be ours.
MRK.12.8	And taking hold of him, they killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.
MRK.12.9	What, therefore, shall the lord of the vineyard do? He shall come and destroy those husbandmen and shall give his vineyard unto others.
MRK.12.10	And have ye not read this scripture: The stone which the builders rejected is placed as the head of the corner;
MRK.12.11	This was the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?
MRK.12.12	And they sought to lay hold on him but feared the multitude, for they understood that he had spoken the parable against them, and leaving him, they went away.
MRK.12.13	And they send unto him certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to catch him in his words.
MRK.12.14	And when they were come, they say unto him, Master, we know that thou art a man of truth who regards no man; for thou dost not look upon the appearance of men, but dost with truth teach the way of God; is it lawful to give tribute to Caesar or not?
MRK.12.15	Shall we give or shall we not give? Then he, understanding their hypocrisy, said unto them, Why tempt ye me? Bring me the coin that I may see it.
MRK.12.16	And they brought it. And he said unto them, Of whom is this image and inscription? And they said unto him, Of Caesar.
MRK.12.17	And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Render that which is of Caesar unto Caesar, and that which is of God unto God. And they marvelled at this.
MRK.12.18	Then come unto him the Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection; and they asked him, saying,
MRK.12.19	Master, Moses wrote unto us, If a man’s brother dies and leaves his wife behind him and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.
MRK.12.20	Now there were seven brethren, and the first took a wife and dying left no seed.
MRK.12.21	And the second took her, and died, neither left he any seed; and the third likewise.
MRK.12.22	And the seven had her and left no seed; last of all the woman died also.
MRK.12.23	In the resurrection, therefore, when they shall rise, whose wife shall she be of them? for the seven had her to wife.
MRK.12.24	Then Jesus, answering, said unto them, Do ye not therefore err because ye know not the scriptures, neither the power of God?
MRK.12.25	For when they shall rise from the dead, neither shall they marry nor husbands take women nor women, husbands; but are as the angels who are in the heavens.
MRK.12.26	And regarding the dead who are to rise, have ye not read in the book of Moses how in the bush God spoke unto him, saying, I Am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob?
MRK.12.27	He is not God of the dead, but God of the living; ye therefore do greatly err.
MRK.12.28	And one of the scribes came, having heard their dispute and knowing that he had given a good response unto them, asked him, Which is the principal commandment of all?
MRK.12.29	And Jesus responded unto him, The principal of all the commandments is, Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God, the Lord is one;
MRK.12.30	and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy thought and with all thy strength: this is the principal commandment.
MRK.12.31	And the second is like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. There is no other commandment greater than these.
MRK.12.32	Then the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth, that God is one, and there is none other outside of him;
MRK.12.33	and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and to love his neighbour as himself is more than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices.
MRK.12.34	Then Jesus, seeing that he responded wisely, said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. And no man after that dared ask him any question.
MRK.12.35	And answering, Jesus said, while he taught in the temple, How do the scribes say that the Christ is Son of David?
MRK.12.36	For David himself said by the Holy Spirit, The 
MRK.12.37	David therefore himself calls him Lord, and where then is he his son? And the many people heard him gladly.
MRK.12.38	And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, who love to go in long clothing and love the salutations in the marketplaces
MRK.12.39	and the first chairs in the synagogues and the first seats at the suppers,
MRK.12.40	which devour widows’ houses and for a pretence make long prayers: these shall receive greater judgment.
MRK.12.41	And with Jesus sitting in front of the ark of the offering, he beheld how the people cast money into the ark and many that were rich cast in much.
MRK.12.42	And as there came a certain poor widow, she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.
MRK.12.43	Then calling his disciples, he said unto them, Verily I say unto you that this poor widow has cast more in than all those who have cast into the treasury,
MRK.12.44	for they all did cast in of their abundance, but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.
MRK.13.1	And as he went out of the temple, one of his disciples said unto him, Master, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here!
MRK.13.2	And Jesus, answering, said unto him, Seest thou these great buildings? There shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.
MRK.13.3	And as he sat upon the mount of Olives over against the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately,
MRK.13.4	Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all things are to be finished?
MRK.13.5	And Jesus, answering them, began to say, Take heed that no one deceive you,
MRK.13.6	for many shall come in my name, saying, I Am Christ, and shall deceive many.
MRK.13.7	And when ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars, be ye not troubled, for such things must needs be; but the end shall not be yet.
MRK.13.8	For people shall rise against people and kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be earthquakes in each place, and there shall be famines and troubles: these shall be the beginnings of sorrows.
MRK.13.9	But take heed to yourselves, for they shall deliver you up in the councils, and in the synagogues ye shall be beaten; and ye shall be called before rulers and kings for my sake for a testimony unto them.
MRK.13.10	And the gospel needs to be preached unto all the Gentiles first.
MRK.13.11	But when they shall bring you to deliver you up, do not premeditate beforehand what ye shall speak, neither think ye regarding it, but whatever shall be given you in that hour, that speak ye, for it is not ye that speak, but the Holy Spirit.
MRK.13.12	Now the brother shall deliver the brother unto death, and the father the son; and children shall rise up against their parents and shall kill them.
MRK.13.13	And ye shall be hated by everyone for my name, but he that shall persevere unto the end, the same shall be saved.
MRK.13.14	But when ye shall see the abomination of desolation (spoken of by Daniel the prophet) standing where it ought not, he that reads, let him understand, then let those that are in Judaea flee to the mountains;
MRK.13.15	and let him that is on the housetop not go down into the house, neither enter therein to take any thing out of his house;
MRK.13.16	and let him that is in the field not turn back again even to take up his garment.
MRK.13.17	But woe to those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days!
MRK.13.18	Pray, therefore, that your flight not be in winter.
MRK.13.19	For those days shall be of affliction such as never was from the beginning of the creation of the things which God created unto this time, neither shall be.
MRK.13.20	And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved, but for the elect’s sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened those days.
MRK.13.21	And then if anyone should say to you, Behold, here is the Christ, or, Behold, he is there, do not believe him;
MRK.13.22	for false Christs and false prophets shall rise and shall show signs and wonders to seduce, if possible, even the elect.
MRK.13.23	But take ye heed; behold, I have told you everything beforehand.
MRK.13.24	But in those days after that affliction, the sun shall darken, and the moon shall not give her light,
MRK.13.25	and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers that are in the heavens shall be shaken.
MRK.13.26	And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.
MRK.13.27	And then shall he send his angels and shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from the uttermost part of the earth unto the uttermost part of the heaven.
MRK.13.28	Learn the similitude from the fig tree: When her branch is yet tender and puts forth leaves, ye know that summer is near;
MRK.13.29	so ye in like manner, when ye shall see these things come to pass, know that it is near, even at the doors.
MRK.13.30	Verily I say unto you that this generation shall not pass until all these things are done.
MRK.13.31	Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
MRK.13.32	But of that day and that hour no one knows, no, not even the angels who are in the heaven, neither the Son, but only the Father.
MRK.13.33	Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time shall be.
MRK.13.34	As the man who, taking a far journey, left his house and gave his estate to his slaves and to each one his responsibility and commanded the porter to watch.
MRK.13.35	Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the Lord of the house comes: at evening or at midnight or at the cockcrowing or in the morning,
MRK.13.36	lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.
MRK.13.37	And what I say unto you, I say unto all: Watch.
MRK.14.1	Two days after was the passover and the days of unleavened bread; and the princes of the priests and the scribes sought how they might take him by craft, that they might kill him.
MRK.14.2	But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar of the people.
MRK.14.3	And he being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, sitting at the table, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment of spikenard very precious; and breaking the alabaster, she poured it over his head.
MRK.14.4	And there were some that had indignation within themselves and said, Why was this waste of the ointment made?
MRK.14.5	For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarius and given to the poor. And they murmured against her.
MRK.14.6	But Jesus said, Let her alone; why trouble ye her? She has wrought a good work on me.
MRK.14.7	For ye have the poor with you always, and whenever ye will, ye may do them good; but me ye have not always.
MRK.14.8	She has done what she could, for she has anticipated anointing my body for the burial.
MRK.14.9	Verily I say unto you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached throughout the whole world, this also that she has done shall be spoken of for a memorial of her.
MRK.14.10	Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, came unto the princes of the priests to deliver him unto them.
MRK.14.11	And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought how he might conveniently betray him.
MRK.14.12	And the first day of the feast of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the passover, his disciples said unto him, Where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou may eat the passover?
MRK.14.13	And he sends forth two of his disciples and said unto them, Go into the city, and a man shall meet you bearing a pitcher of water; follow him.
MRK.14.14	And wherever he shall go in, say to the husband of the house, The Master says, Where is the guestchamber where I shall eat the passover with my disciples?
MRK.14.15	And he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared: there make ready for us.
MRK.14.16	And his disciples went forth and came into the city and found as he had said unto them, and they made ready the passover.
MRK.14.17	And in the evening he went with the twelve.
MRK.14.18	And when they sat at the table and ate, Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, One of you who eats with me shall betray me.
MRK.14.19	And they began to be sorrowful and to say unto him one by one, shall it be I? and another said, shall it be I?
MRK.14.20	And he, answering, said unto them, It is one of the twelve, that dips with me in the dish.
MRK.14.21	The Son of man indeed goes, as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! good were it for that man if he had never been born.
MRK.14.22	And as they were eating, Jesus took bread and, blessing it, broke it and gave to them and said, Take, eat: this is my body.
MRK.14.23	And taking the cup, having given thanks, he gave it to them; and they all drank of it.
MRK.14.24	And he said unto them, This is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many.
MRK.14.25	Verily I say unto you, I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God.
MRK.14.26	And when they had sung the hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	Then Jesus said unto them, All ye shall be scandalized in me this night; for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered.
MRK.14.28	But after I have risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
MRK.14.29	Then Peter said unto him, Although all be scandalized, yet I will not.
MRK.14.30	And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this day, even in this night, before the cock crows twice, thou shalt deny me three times.
MRK.14.31	But he spoke the more vehemently, If I should die with thee, I will not deny thee in any wise. Likewise also said the others.
MRK.14.32	And they come to the place which is named Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, Sit ye here while I pray.
MRK.14.33	And he takes with him Peter and James and John and began to be alarmed and to be anguished
MRK.14.34	and said unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful unto death; tarry ye here, and watch.
MRK.14.35	And he went forward a little and fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.
MRK.14.36	And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible unto thee; take away this cup from me; nevertheless not what I will, but what thou wilt.
MRK.14.37	And he came and found them sleeping and said unto Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? Could thou not watch one hour?
MRK.14.38	Watch ye and pray; enter not into temptation. The spirit truly is ready, but the flesh is sick.
MRK.14.39	And again he went away and prayed and spoke the same words.
MRK.14.40	And when he returned, he found them asleep again (for their eyes were heavy), nor did they know what to answer him.
MRK.14.41	And he came the third time and said unto them, Sleep on now and rest; it is enough, the hour is come; behold, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of the sinners.
MRK.14.42	Rise up, let us go; behold, he that betrays me is at hand.
MRK.14.43	And immediately, while he yet spoke, Judas came, who was one of the twelve, and with him a multitude with swords and staves from the princes of the priests and of the scribes and of the elders.
MRK.14.44	And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him and lead him away securely.
MRK.14.45	And as soon as he was come, he went straightway to him and said, Master, Master, and kissed him.
MRK.14.46	And they laid their hands on him and took him.
MRK.14.47	And one of them that stood by drew a sword and smote the slave of the high priest and cut off his ear.
MRK.14.48	And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Are ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and with staves to take me?
MRK.14.49	I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and ye took me not, but it is this way that the scriptures might be fulfilled.
MRK.14.50	And they all forsook him and fled.
MRK.14.51	And there followed him a certain young man having a linen cloth cast about his naked body, and the young men laid hold on him,
MRK.14.52	and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked.
MRK.14.53	And they brought Jesus to the high priest, and with him were assembled all the princes of the priests and the elders and the scribes.
MRK.14.54	But Peter followed him afar off, even into the palace of the high priest, and he was seated with the servants and warming himself at the fire.
MRK.14.55	And the princes of the priests and all the council sought for witness against Jesus to put him to death and found none.
MRK.14.56	For many bore false witness against him, but their witness did not agree together.
MRK.14.57	And there arose some that bore false witness against him, saying,
MRK.14.58	We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.
MRK.14.59	But neither so did their witness agree together.
MRK.14.60	So the high priest, standing up in the midst, asked Jesus, saying, Answerest thou nothing to what these witness against thee?
MRK.14.61	But he was silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked him and said unto him, Art thou the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?
MRK.14.62	And Jesus said unto him, I AM, and ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the power of God and coming in the clouds of the heaven.
MRK.14.63	Then the high priest rent his clothes and said, What need have we any more for witnesses?
MRK.14.64	Ye have heard the blasphemy: what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of death.
MRK.14.65	And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to buffet him and to say unto him, Prophesy. And the servants struck him with the palms of their hands.
MRK.14.66	And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there came one of the maids of the high priest;
MRK.14.67	and when she saw Peter warming himself, looking upon him, said, And thou also wast with Jesus of Nazareth.
MRK.14.68	But he denied, saying, I know him not, neither understand I what thou sayest. And he went out into the porch; and the cock crew.
MRK.14.69	And the maid seeing him again began to say to those that stood by, This is one of them.
MRK.14.70	But he denied it again. And a little after, those that stood by said again to Peter, Surely thou art one of them, for thou art a Galilaean, and thy speech agrees unto it.
MRK.14.71	And he began to curse and to swear, saying, I do not know this man of whom ye speak.
MRK.14.72	And the second time the cock crew. And Peter called to mind the words that Jesus had said unto him, Before the cock crows twice, thou shalt deny me three times. And thinking on this, he wept.
MRK.15.1	And straightway in the morning the princes of the priests having held a consultation with the elders and with the scribes and with the whole council, took Jesus away bound and delivered him to Pilate.
MRK.15.2	And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he, answering, said unto him, Thou sayest it.
MRK.15.3	And the princes of the priests accused him of many things.
MRK.15.4	And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they accuse thee of.
MRK.15.5	But Jesus yet answered nothing, so that Pilate marvelled.
MRK.15.6	Now at that feast it was customary that he release unto them one prisoner, whoever they desired.
MRK.15.7	And there was one named Barabbas, who lay bound with those that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
MRK.15.8	And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had always done unto them.
MRK.15.9	And Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
MRK.15.10	For he knew that the princes of the priests had delivered him for envy.
MRK.15.11	But the princes of the priests moved the multitude that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
MRK.15.12	And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
MRK.15.13	And they cried out again, crucify him. {Gr. stauroo – Hang him on a stake}
MRK.15.14	Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil has he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, crucify him.
MRK.15.15	And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
MRK.15.16	And the soldiers led him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they call together the whole band.
MRK.15.17	And they clothed him with purple and platted a crown of thorns and put it about his head
MRK.15.18	and began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
MRK.15.19	And they smote him on the head with a reed and spit upon him and bowing their knees worshipped him.
MRK.15.20	And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him and put his own clothes on him and led him out to crucify him.
MRK.15.21	And they compel one Simon, a Cyrenian, who passed by coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross {Gr. stauros – stake}.
MRK.15.22	And they brought him unto the place of Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
MRK.15.23	And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, but he received it not.
MRK.15.24	And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
MRK.15.25	And it was the third hour when they crucified him.
MRK.15.26	And the inscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
MRK.15.27	And with him they crucified two thieves: the one on his right hand and the other on his left.
MRK.15.28	And the scripture was fulfilled, which says, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
MRK.15.29	And those that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads and saying, Ah, thou that would destroy the temple of God and build it in three days,
MRK.15.30	save thyself and come down from the cross {Gr. stauros – stake}.
MRK.15.31	Likewise also the princes of the priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
MRK.15.32	Let the Christ, King of Israel, descend now from the stake that we may see and believe. And those that were crucified {Gr. Stauroo – to hang on a stake} with him reviled him.
MRK.15.33	And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
MRK.15.34	And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
MRK.15.35	And some of those that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calls Elijah.
MRK.15.36	And one ran and filled a sponge full of vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.
MRK.15.37	But Jesus, giving a great cry, expired.
MRK.15.38	Then the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom.
MRK.15.39	And when the centurion, who stood in front of him, saw that he so cried out and expired, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
MRK.15.40	There were also some women looking on afar off, among whom was Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James the lesser and of Joses, and Salome
MRK.15.41	(who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him and ministered unto him), and many other women who came up with him unto Jerusalem.
MRK.15.42	And now when the evening was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
MRK.15.43	Joseph of Arimathaea, a noble senator, who also waited for the kingdom of God, came and went in boldly unto Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
MRK.15.44	And Pilate marvelled that he was already dead; and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.
MRK.15.45	And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
MRK.15.46	And he bought fine linen and took him down and wrapped him in the linen and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
MRK.15.47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
MRK.16.1	And when the sabbath of the great feast of the passover was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James, and Salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him.
MRK.16.2	And very early in the morning the first of the sabbaths, they come unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun.
MRK.16.3	And they said among themselves, Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre?
MRK.16.4	And when they looked, they saw that the stone was rolled away, for it was very great.
MRK.16.5	And entering into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting to the right hand side, covered in a long white garment; and they were frightened.
MRK.16.6	But he said unto them, Do not be frightened; Ye seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified; he is risen; he is not here; behold the place where they laid him.
MRK.16.7	But go tell his disciples and Peter that he goes before you into Galilee: there shall ye see him as he said unto you.
MRK.16.8	And they went out quickly and fled from the sepulchre, for they trembled and were amazed; neither said they any thing to anyone, for they were afraid.
MRK.16.9	Now as Jesus rose early the first of the sabbaths, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven devils.
MRK.16.10	And she went and told those that had been with him, as they mourned and wept.
MRK.16.11	And they, when they had heard that he was alive and had been seen of her, did not believe.
MRK.16.12	After that he appeared in another form unto two of them, as they walked and went into the country.
MRK.16.13	And they went and told it unto the others, yet they did not believe them.
MRK.16.14	Finally he appeared unto the eleven as they sat at the table and upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart because they did not believe those who had seen him after he was risen.
MRK.16.15	And he said unto them, Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature.
MRK.16.16	He that believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believes not shall be condemned.
MRK.16.17	And these signs shall follow those that believe: In my name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;
MRK.16.18	they shall take away serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands upon the sick, and they shall be healed.
MRK.16.19	So then after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven and sat at the right hand of God.
MRK.16.20	And they, going forth, preached everywhere, the Lord working with them and confirming the word with the signs which followed them. Amen.
LUK.1.1	Forasmuch as many have attempted to set forth in order the history of those things which among us have been most certain,
LUK.1.2	even as those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning taught us and thus were ministers of the word,
LUK.1.3	it seemed good also to me, after having understood all the things from the beginning with great diligence, to write them unto thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,
LUK.1.4	that thou mightest know the security of those things in which thou hast been instructed.
LUK.1.5	There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abia, and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.
LUK.1.6	And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord, blameless.
LUK.1.7	And they had no child because Elisabeth was barren, and they both were now well advanced in years.
LUK.1.8	And it came to pass that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,
LUK.1.9	according to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense entering into the temple of the Lord.
LUK.1.10	And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.
LUK.1.11	And there appeared unto him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.
LUK.1.12	And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.
LUK.1.13	But the angel said unto him, Fear not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.
LUK.1.14	And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.
LUK.1.15	For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.
LUK.1.16	And he shall turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.
LUK.1.17	And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the rebellious to the prudence of the just, to make ready a prepared people for the Lord.
LUK.1.18	And Zacharias said unto the angel, Whereby shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years.
LUK.1.19	And the angel answering said unto him, I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and am sent to speak unto thee and to show thee this gospel.
LUK.1.20	And, behold, thou shalt be dumb and not able to speak until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou didst not believe my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.
LUK.1.21	And the people waited for Zacharias and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.
LUK.1.22	And when he came out, he could not speak unto them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he communicated with signs and remained speechless.
LUK.1.23	And it came to pass that as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.
LUK.1.24	And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived and hid herself five months, saying,
LUK.1.25	Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days wherein he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.
LUK.1.26	And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth
LUK.1.27	to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David and the virgin’s name was Mary.
LUK.1.28	And the angel came in unto her and said, Hail, thou that art much graced, the Lord is with thee; blessed art thou among women.
LUK.1.29	And when she saw him, she was troubled at his words and wondered in her mind what manner of salutation this should be.
LUK.1.30	Then the angel said unto her, Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God.
LUK.1.31	And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shalt call his name Jesus.
LUK.1.32	He shall be great and shall be called the Son of the Highest, and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David;
LUK.1.33	and he shall reign in the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there shall be no end.
LUK.1.34	Then Mary said unto the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?
LUK.1.35	And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
LUK.1.36	And, behold, thy relative Elisabeth, she has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.
LUK.1.37	For with God nothing is impossible.
LUK.1.38	Then Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.
LUK.1.39	And Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste into a city of Juda
LUK.1.40	and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elisabeth.
LUK.1.41	And it came to pass that when Elisabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit;
LUK.1.42	and she spoke out with a loud voice and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.
LUK.1.43	And whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?
LUK.1.44	For, behold, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.
LUK.1.45	And blessed is she that believed, for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord.
LUK.1.46	Then Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,
LUK.1.47	and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saving Health,
LUK.1.48	for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden; for, behold, from now on all generations shall call me blessed.
LUK.1.49	For he that is mighty has done great things unto me, and holy is his name.
LUK.1.50	And his mercy is on those that fear him from generation to generation.
LUK.1.51	He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.
LUK.1.52	He has put down the mighty from their thrones and exalted the humble.
LUK.1.53	He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich he has sent empty away.
LUK.1.54	He has received his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy
LUK.1.55	as he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed forever.
LUK.1.56	And Mary abode with her about three months and then returned to her own house.
LUK.1.57	Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered and she brought forth a son.
LUK.1.58	And her neighbours and her relatives heard how the Lord had showed great mercy upon her, and they rejoiced with her.
LUK.1.59	And it came to pass that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they called him Zacharias after the name of his father.
LUK.1.60	And his mother answered and said, Not so, but he shall be called John.
LUK.1.61	And they said unto her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.
LUK.1.62	And they communicated with signs to his father, asking how he would have him called.
LUK.1.63	And he asked for a writing table and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marvelled.
LUK.1.64	And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke blessing God.
LUK.1.65	And fear came on all that dwelt round about them, and all these things were spoken of throughout all the hill country of Judaea.
LUK.1.66	And all those that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, Who shall this child be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.
LUK.1.67	And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,
LUK.1.68	Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for he has visited and made redemption for his people
LUK.1.69	And has raised up a horn of saving health for us in the house of his servant David,
LUK.1.70	as he spoke by the mouth of the saints who from the beginning were his prophets;
LUK.1.71	salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all that hate us;
LUK.1.72	to fulfill mercy unto our fathers and remembering his holy covenant
LUK.1.73	of the oath which he made to our father Abraham,
LUK.1.74	that he would grant unto us, that without fear delivered out of the hand of our enemies, we might serve him
LUK.1.75	in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.
LUK.1.76	And thou, child, shalt be called prophet of the Most High, for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways,
LUK.1.77	giving knowledge of saving health unto his people for the remission of their sins
LUK.1.78	through the bowels of mercy of our God, whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us
LUK.1.79	to give light to those that dwell in darkness and in the shadow of death, to direct our feet into the way of peace.
LUK.1.80	And the child grew and was comforted of the Spirit and was in the deserts until the day of his showing unto Israel.
LUK.2.1	And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.
LUK.2.2	(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)
LUK.2.3	And all went to be taxed, each one into his own city.
LUK.2.4	And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judaea unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem (because he was of the house and family of David)
LUK.2.5	to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.
LUK.2.6	And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.
LUK.2.7	And she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.
LUK.2.8	And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night.
LUK.2.9	And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the clarity of the Lord shone round about them, and they feared greatly.
LUK.2.10	But the angel said unto them, Fear not; for, behold, I bring you a gospel of great joy, which shall be to all the people.
LUK.2.11	For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.
LUK.2.12	And this shall be a sign unto you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.
LUK.2.13	And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying,
LUK.2.14	Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will in man.
LUK.2.15	And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord has made known unto us.
LUK.2.16	And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the babe lying in the manger.
LUK.2.17	And when they had seen it, they made known abroad that which had been told them concerning this child.
LUK.2.18	And all those that heard it marvelled at those things which were told them by the shepherds.
LUK.2.19	But Mary kept all these things, pondering them in her heart.
LUK.2.20	And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told unto them.
LUK.2.21	And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called Jesus, which he was called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.
LUK.2.22	And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord
LUK.2.23	(as it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord)
LUK.2.24	and to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.
LUK.2.25	And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
LUK.2.26	And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Spirit that he should not see death before he should see the Christ of the Lord.
LUK.2.27	And he came by the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,
LUK.2.28	then he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,
LUK.2.29	Lord, now let thy slave depart in peace, according to thy word,
LUK.2.30	for mine eyes have seen thy saving health,
LUK.2.31	which thou hast prepared before the face of all the peoples:
LUK.2.32	a light to be revealed unto the Gentiles and the glory of thy people Israel.
LUK.2.33	And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken of him.
LUK.2.34	And Simeon blessed them and said unto Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against
LUK.2.35	(yea, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.
LUK.2.36	And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser; she was of a great age and had lived with her husband seven years from her virginity,
LUK.2.37	and she was a widow eighty-four years, who departed not from the temple, serving night and day with fastings and prayers.
LUK.2.38	And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto the Lord and spoke of him to all those that looked for redemption in Jerusalem.
LUK.2.39	And when they had completed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee to their own city Nazareth.
LUK.2.40	And the child grew and was comforted of the Spirit, filled with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him.
LUK.2.41	And his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.
LUK.2.42	And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.
LUK.2.43	And having completed the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.
LUK.2.44	But they, supposing him to have been in the company, went a day’s journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintances.
LUK.2.45	And when they found him not, they turned back again to Jerusalem, seeking him.
LUK.2.46	And it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both hearing them and asking them questions.
LUK.2.47	And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.
LUK.2.48	And when they saw him, they were amazed; and his mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? Behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.
LUK.2.49	And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? Knew ye not that it behooves me to be about my Father’s business?
LUK.2.50	And they understood not the word which he spoke unto them.
LUK.2.51	And he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them, but his mother kept all these things in her heart.
LUK.2.52	And Jesus increased in wisdom and in age and in grace with God and men.
LUK.3.1	Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,
LUK.3.2	Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came upon John the son of Zachariah in the wilderness.
LUK.3.3	And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;
LUK.3.4	as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.
LUK.3.5	Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the crooked ways shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth;
LUK.3.6	and all flesh shall see the saving health of God.
LUK.3.7	Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized of him, O generation of vipers, who taught you to flee from the wrath to come?
LUK.3.8	Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father; for I say unto you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.
LUK.3.9	And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees; every tree therefore which does not bring forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.
LUK.3.10	And the people asked him, saying, What shall we do then?
LUK.3.11	He answered and said unto them, He that has two coats, let him impart to him that has none; and he that has food, let him do likewise.
LUK.3.12	Then the publicans also came to be baptized and said unto him, Master, what shall we do?
LUK.3.13	And he said unto them, Exact no more than that which is appointed you.
LUK.3.14	And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Oppress no one, neither accuse anyone falsely; and be content with your wages.
LUK.3.15	And as the people were in expectation, and all men mused in their hearts of John, whether he were the Christ, or not,
LUK.3.16	John answered, saying unto them all, I indeed baptize you in water, but one mightier than I comes, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose; he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire;
LUK.3.17	whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his threshing floor and will gather the wheat into his storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.
LUK.3.18	And exhorting many other things he announced the gospel unto the people.
LUK.3.19	Then Herod the tetrarch, being reproved by him for Herodias his brother Philip’s wife and for all the evils which Herod had done,
LUK.3.20	added yet this above all, that he shut up John in prison.
LUK.3.21	Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass that, Jesus also being baptized and praying, the heaven was opened,
LUK.3.22	and the Holy Spirit descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee is my delight.
LUK.3.23	And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, who was the son of Heli,
LUK.3.24	who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi, who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Janna, who was the son of Joseph,
LUK.3.25	who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Amos, who was the son of Naum, who was the son of Esli, who was the son of Nagge,
LUK.3.26	who was the son of Maath, who was the son of Mattathias, who was the son of Semei, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Juda,
LUK.3.27	who was the son of Joanna, who was the son of Rhesa, who was the son of Zorobabel, who was the son of Salathiel, who was the son of Neri,
LUK.3.28	who was the son of Melchi, who was the son of Addi, who was the son of Cosam, who was the son of Elmodam, who was the son of Er,
LUK.3.29	who was the son of Joshua, who was the son of Eliezer, who was the son of Jorim, who was the son of Matthat, who was the son of Levi,
LUK.3.30	who was the son of Simeon, who was the son of Juda, who was the son of Joseph, who was the son of Jonan, who was the son of Eliakim,
LUK.3.31	who was the son of Melea, who was the son of Menan, who was the son of Mattatha, who was the son of Nathan, who was the son of David,
LUK.3.32	who was the son of Jesse, who was the son of Obed, who was the son of Booz, who was the son of Salmon, who was the son of Naasson,
LUK.3.33	who was the son of Aminadab, who was the son of Aram, who was the son of Esrom, who was the son of Phares, who was the son of Juda,
LUK.3.34	who was the son of Jacob, who was the son of Isaac, who was the son of Abraham, who was the son of Thara, who was the son of Nachor,
LUK.3.35	who was the son of Saruch, who was the son of Ragau, who was the son of Peleg, who was the son of Heber, who was the son of Sala,
LUK.3.36	who was the son of Cainan, who was the son of Arphaxad, who was the son of Shem, who was the son of Noah, who was the son of Lamech,
LUK.3.37	who was the son of Mathusala, who was the son of Enoch, who was the son of Jared, who was the son of Maleleel, who was the son of Cainan,
LUK.3.38	who was the son of Enos, who was the son of Seth, who was the son of Adam, who was the son of God.
LUK.4.1	And Jesus being full of the Holy Spirit returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness
LUK.4.2	for forty days and was tempted of the devil. And in those days he ate nothing; and when they were ended, he afterward hungered.
LUK.4.3	Then the devil said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, command this stone that it be made bread.
LUK.4.4	And Jesus answered him, saying, It is written, That man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.
LUK.4.5	And the devil took him up into a high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the sphere of the world in a moment of time.
LUK.4.6	And the devil said unto him, All this authority I will give thee and the glory of them, for that is delivered unto me, and to whomsoever I will I give it.
LUK.4.7	If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.
LUK.4.8	And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.
LUK.4.9	And he brought him to Jerusalem and set him on a pinnacle of the temple and said unto him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself down from here;
LUK.4.10	for it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee,
LUK.4.11	and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
LUK.4.12	And Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.
LUK.4.13	And having finished all temptation, the devil departed from him for a season.
LUK.4.14	And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee, and his fame went out through all the region round about.
LUK.4.15	And he taught in their synagogues, being glorified of all.
LUK.4.16	And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up; and, as his custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up to read.
LUK.4.17	And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written,
LUK.4.18	The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those that are broken,
LUK.4.19	to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.
LUK.4.20	And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister and sat down. And the eyes of all those that were in the synagogue were fastened on him.
LUK.4.21	And he began to say unto them, Today this scripture is fulfilled in your ears.
LUK.4.22	And all bore him witness and marvelled at the words of grace which proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son?
LUK.4.23	And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, Physician, heal thyself; whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in thy country.
LUK.4.24	And he said, Verily I say unto you, No prophet is accepted in his own country.
LUK.4.25	But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land,
LUK.4.26	but unto none of them was Elijah sent, except unto Sarepta, a city of Sidon, unto a widow woman.
LUK.4.27	And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed, except Naaman the Syrian.
LUK.4.28	And all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath
LUK.4.29	and rose up and thrust him out of the city and led him unto the brow of the hill upon which their city was built that they might cast him down headlong.
LUK.4.30	But he, passing through the midst of them, went away.
LUK.4.31	And he went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the sabbath days.
LUK.4.32	And they were astonished at his doctrine, for his word was with power.
LUK.4.33	And in the synagogue there was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon and cried out with a loud voice,
LUK.4.34	saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art: the Holy One of God.
LUK.4.35	And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent and come out of him. And the demon, throwing him down in the midst, came out of him and hurt him not.
LUK.4.36	And they were all amazed and spoke among themselves, saying, What word is this! For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.
LUK.4.37	And his fame went out into every place of the country round about.
LUK.4.38	And he arose out of the synagogue, and entered into Simon’s house. And Simon’s wife’s mother was taken with a great fever, and they besought him for her.
LUK.4.39	And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she arose and ministered unto them.
LUK.4.40	Now when the sun was setting, all those who had anyone sick with diverse diseases brought them unto him, and laying his hands on each one of them, he healed them.
LUK.4.41	And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, Thou art the Christ, the Son of God. And he rebuking them suffered them not to speak, for they knew that he was the Christ.
LUK.4.42	And when it was day, he departed and went into a desert place, and the people sought him and came unto him and stayed him, that he should not depart from them.
LUK.4.43	And he said unto them, I must announce the gospel of the kingdom of God to other cities also because for this am I sent.
LUK.4.44	And he preached in the synagogues of Galilee.
LUK.5.1	And it came to pass that, as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God, he stood by the lake of Gennesaret
LUK.5.2	and saw two ships that were by the shore of the lake, but the fishermen were gone out of them and were washing their nets.
LUK.5.3	And he entered into one of the ships, which was Simon’s, and prayed him that he would thrust out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people out of the ship.
LUK.5.4	Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.
LUK.5.5	And Simon answering said unto him, Master, we have toiled all the night and have taken nothing; nevertheless, at thy word I will let down the net.
LUK.5.6	And when they had done this, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes, and their net was breaking.
LUK.5.7	And they beckoned unto their partners, who were in the other ship, that they should come and help them. And they came and filled both the ships, so that they began to sink.
LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down on his knees before Jesus, saying, Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.
LUK.5.9	For he was overcome with fear, and all that were with him, at the catch of the fishes which they had taken;
LUK.5.10	and likewise James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said unto Simon, Fear not; from now on thou shalt catch men.
LUK.5.11	And when they had brought their ships to land, they forsook all and followed him.
LUK.5.12	And it came to pass when he was in a certain city, behold a man full of leprosy who, seeing Jesus, fell on his face and besought him, saying, Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
LUK.5.13	And he put forth his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be thou clean. And immediately the leprosy departed from him.
LUK.5.14	And he charged him to tell no one. But go and show thyself to the priest and offer for thy cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them.
LUK.5.15	But so much the more his fame went forth, and great multitudes came together to hear and to be healed by him of their infirmities.
LUK.5.16	But he withdrew himself into the wilderness and prayed.
LUK.5.17	And it came to pass on a certain day, as he was teaching, that there were Pharisees and doctors of the law sitting by, who were come out of every town of Galilee and Judaea and Jerusalem; and the power of the Lord was present to heal them.
LUK.5.18	And, behold, men brought in a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they sought means to bring him in and to lay him before him.
LUK.5.19	And when they could not find any way they might bring him in because of the multitude, they went upon the housetop and let him down through the tiling with his couch into the midst before Jesus.
LUK.5.20	And when he saw their faith, he said unto him, Man, thy sins are forgiven thee.
LUK.5.21	And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, Who is this who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?
LUK.5.22	Then Jesus, knowing their thoughts and answering them said, What reason ye in your hearts?
LUK.5.23	What is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee, or to say, Rise up and walk?
LUK.5.24	But that ye may know that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins (he said unto the paralytic), I say unto thee, Arise and take up thy couch and go to thine house.
LUK.5.25	And immediately he rose up before them and took up that upon which he lay and departed to his own house, glorifying God.
LUK.5.26	And they were all amazed, and they glorified God and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen marvels today.
LUK.5.27	And after these things he went forth and saw a publican, named Levi, sitting at the receipt of custom, and he said unto him, Follow me.
LUK.5.28	And he left all, rose up, and followed him.
LUK.5.29	And Levi made a great banquet in his own house and there was a great company of publicans and of others that sat down at the table with them.
LUK.5.30	But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do ye eat and drink with publicans and sinners?
LUK.5.31	And Jesus answering said unto them, Those that are whole have no need of a physician, but those that are sick.
LUK.5.32	I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.
LUK.5.33	Then they said unto him, Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers and likewise the disciples of the Pharisees, but thine eat and drink?
LUK.5.34	And he said unto them, Can ye make the sons of the bridechamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?
LUK.5.35	But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then shall they fast in those days.
LUK.5.36	And he also spoke a parable unto them: No one takes a piece of a new garment to mend an old one; if otherwise, then the new one is rent, and the piece that was taken out of the new does not agree with the old.
LUK.5.37	And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; or else the new wine will burst the wineskins and be spilled and the wineskins shall perish.
LUK.5.38	But new wine must be put into new wineskins, and both are preserved.
LUK.5.39	No one also having drunk of the old straightway desires the new, for he says, The old is better.
LUK.6.1	And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first that he went through the grain fields and his disciples plucked the ears of grain and ate, rubbing them in their hands.
LUK.6.2	And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?
LUK.6.3	And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, what David did, when he and those that were with him were hungry,
LUK.6.4	how he went into the house of God and did take and eat the showbread and gave also to those that were with him, which it is not lawful to eat but for the priests alone?
LUK.6.5	And he said unto them, The Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.
LUK.6.6	And it came to pass also on another sabbath that he entered into the synagogue and taught, and a man was there whose right hand was withered.
LUK.6.7	And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the sabbath day, that they might find an accusation against him.
LUK.6.8	But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, Rise up and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and stood forth.
LUK.6.9	Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the sabbath days to do good or to do evil? to save a person or to destroy them?
LUK.6.10	And looking round about upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth thy hand. And he did so, and his hand was restored whole as the other.
LUK.6.11	And they were filled with madness and talked one with another about what they might do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	And it came to pass in those days that he went out into the mountain to pray and continued all night in prayer to God.
LUK.6.13	And when it was day, he called unto him his disciples; and of them he chose twelve, whom he also named apostles:
LUK.6.14	Simon (whom he also named Peter) and Andrew his brother, James and John, Philip and Bartholomew,
LUK.6.15	Matthew and Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon called Zelotes
LUK.6.16	and Judas the brother of James and Judas Iscariot, who also was the traitor.
LUK.6.17	And he came down with them and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases;
LUK.6.18	and those that were tormented with unclean spirits were healed.
LUK.6.19	And the whole multitude sought to touch him, for there went virtue out of him and healed them all.
LUK.6.20	And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples and said, Blessed are the poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.
LUK.6.21	Blessed are those that hunger now, for ye shall be filled. Blessed are those that weep now, for ye shall laugh.
LUK.6.22	Blessed are ye when men shall hate you and when they shall separate you from their company and shall reproach you and cast out your name as evil for the sake of the Son of man.
LUK.6.23	Rejoice ye in that day and leap for joy; for, behold, your reward is great in heaven, for their fathers treated the prophets in the same manner.
LUK.6.24	But woe unto you that are rich! for ye have received your consolation.
LUK.6.25	Woe unto you that are full! for ye shall hunger. Woe unto you that laugh now! for ye shall mourn and weep.
LUK.6.26	Woe unto you when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers treat the false prophets.
LUK.6.27	But I say unto you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
LUK.6.28	bless those that curse you, and pray for those who despitefully use you.
LUK.6.29	And unto the one that smites thee on the one cheek offer also the other, and to the one that takes away thy cloak defend not thy coat also.
LUK.6.30	Give to everyone that asks of thee, and of the one that takes away thy goods ask them not to return them.
LUK.6.31	And as ye desire that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.
LUK.6.32	For if ye love those who love you, what grace shall ye have? for sinners also love those that love them.
LUK.6.33	And if ye do good to those who do good to you, what grace shall ye have? for sinners also do even the same.
LUK.6.34	And if ye lend to those of whom ye hope to receive, what grace shall ye have? for sinners also lend to sinners to receive as much again.
LUK.6.35	But rather love ye your enemies and do good and lend, hoping for nothing again, and your reward shall be great; and ye shall be the sons of the Most High, for he is kind even unto the unthankful and to the evil.
LUK.6.36	Be ye therefore merciful, as your Father also is merciful.
LUK.6.37	Judge not, and ye shall not be judged; condemn not, and ye shall not be condemned; forgive, and ye shall be forgiven;
LUK.6.38	give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down and shaken together and running over, shall men give into your bosom. For with the same measure that ye measure out it shall be measured to you again.
LUK.6.39	And he spoke a parable unto them, Can the blind lead the blind? Shall they not both fall into the pit?
LUK.6.40	The disciple is not above his master, but any one that is as the master shall be perfect.
LUK.6.41	And why dost thou behold the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but not perceive the beam that is in thine own eye?
LUK.6.42	Or how canst thou say to thy brother, Brother, let me pull out the mote that is in thine eye, when thou thyself dost not behold the beam that is in thine own eye? Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye, and then shalt thou see clearly to pull out the mote that is in thy brother’s eye.
LUK.6.43	For a good tree does not bring forth corrupt fruit; neither does a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
LUK.6.44	For every tree is known by its own fruit. For of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush do they gather grapes.
LUK.6.45	The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth that which is good, and the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth that which is evil, for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks.
LUK.6.46	And why call ye me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say?
LUK.6.47	Whosoever comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you to whom he is like:
LUK.6.48	he is like a man who built a house and dug deep and laid the foundation upon rock; and when the flood arose, the river beat vehemently upon that house and could not shake it, for it was founded upon rock.
LUK.6.49	But he that hears and does not do is like a man that built a house upon the earth without a foundation against which the river beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.
LUK.7.1	Now when he had ended all his words in the audience of the people, he entered into Capernaum.
LUK.7.2	And a certain centurion’s slave, who was dear unto him, was sick and ready to die.
LUK.7.3	And when he heard of Jesus, he sent unto him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and free his slave.
LUK.7.4	And when they came to Jesus, they besought him instantly, saying, That he is worthy that this should be done for him,
LUK.7.5	for he loves our nation and he has built us a synagogue.
LUK.7.6	Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying unto him, Lord, trouble not thyself, for I am not worthy that thou should enter under my roof;
LUK.7.7	therefore neither did I think myself worthy to come unto thee but say the word, and my slave shall be healed.
LUK.7.8	For I also am a man set under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say unto one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes; and to my slave, Do this, and he does it.
LUK.7.9	When Jesus heard these things, he marvelled at him and turned about and said unto the people that followed him, I say unto you that not even in Israel have I found such great faith.
LUK.7.10	And those that had been sent, returning to the house, found the slave that had been sick whole.
LUK.7.11	And it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called Nain, and many of his disciples went with him, and many people.
LUK.7.12	Now when he came near to the gate of the city, behold, there was a dead man carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow; and many people from the city were with her.
LUK.7.13	And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and said unto her, Weep not.
LUK.7.14	And he came and touched the bier, and those that bore him stood still. And he said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise.
LUK.7.15	And he that was dead sat up and began to speak. And he delivered him to his mother.
LUK.7.16	And there came a fear on all, and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us, and, That God has visited his people.
LUK.7.17	And this word of him went forth throughout all Judaea and throughout all the region round about.
LUK.7.18	And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.
LUK.7.19	And John calling unto him two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
LUK.7.20	When the men were come unto him, they said, John the Baptist has sent us unto thee, saying, Art thou he that should come? or look we for another?
LUK.7.21	And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues and of evil spirits, and unto many that were blind he gave sight.
LUK.7.22	Then Jesus answering said unto them, Go and tell John the things ye have seen and heard: how the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, to the poor the gospel is preached;
LUK.7.23	and blessed is whoever shall not be offended in me.
LUK.7.24	And when the messengers of John were departed, he began to speak unto the people concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
LUK.7.25	But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment? Behold, those that are gorgeously apparelled and live delicately are in kings’ courts.
LUK.7.26	But what went ye out to see? A prophet? Yea, I say unto you, and much more than a prophet.
LUK.7.27	This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.
LUK.7.28	For I say unto you, Among those that are born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist, but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.
LUK.7.29	And all the people that heard him and the publicans justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not baptized of him.
LUK.7.31	And the Lord said, Unto whom then shall I compare the men of this generation? and to what are they like?
LUK.7.32	They are like unto children sitting in the marketplace and calling one to another and saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have mourned to you, and ye have not wept.
LUK.7.33	For John the Baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and ye say, He has a demon.
LUK.7.34	The Son of man is come eating and drinking, and ye say, Behold a gluttonous man and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners!
LUK.7.35	But wisdom is justified of all her children.
LUK.7.36	And one of the Pharisees asked him if he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house and sat down to food.
LUK.7.37	And, behold, a woman who had been a sinner in the city, when she knew that Jesus sat at food in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,
LUK.7.38	and stood at his feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.
LUK.7.39	Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he spoke within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that touches him, for she is a sinner.
LUK.7.40	And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have something to say unto thee. And he said, Master, say on.
LUK.7.41	There was a certain creditor who had two debtors: the one owed five hundred denarius, and the other fifty.
LUK.7.42	And when they had nothing to pay, he released them both from their debt. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?
LUK.7.43	Simon answered and said, I suppose that he to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.
LUK.7.44	And he turned to the woman and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thy house, thou didst give me no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head.
LUK.7.45	Thou gavest me no kiss; but this woman since the time I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet.
LUK.7.46	Thou didst not anoint my head with oil; but this woman has anointed my feet with ointment.
LUK.7.47	Therefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much; but to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little.
LUK.7.48	And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.
LUK.7.49	And those that sat at food with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgives sins also?
LUK.7.50	And he said to the woman, Thy faith has saved thee; go in peace.
LUK.8.1	And it came to pass afterward that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and announcing the gospel of the kingdom of God, and the twelve with him,
LUK.8.2	and certain women, who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,
LUK.8.3	and Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others who ministered unto him of their substance.
LUK.8.4	And when many people were gathered together and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:
LUK.8.5	A sower went out to sow his seed, and as he sowed, some fell along the way, and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.
LUK.8.6	And some fell upon the rock, and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away because it lacked moisture.
LUK.8.7	And some fell among thorns, and the thorns sprang up with it and choked it.
LUK.8.8	And some fell on good ground and sprang up and bore fruit a hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
LUK.8.9	And his disciples asked him, saying, What might this parable be?
LUK.8.10	And he said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the others in parables that seeing they might not see and hearing they might not understand.
LUK.8.11	Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.
LUK.8.12	Those along the way are those that hear; then comes the devil and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.
LUK.8.13	Those on the rock are those that when they hear, receive the word with joy, but these have no root, who for a while believe and in time of temptation fall away.
LUK.8.14	And that which fell among thorns are those who when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to perfection.
LUK.8.15	But that on the good ground are those who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it and bring forth fruit with patience.
LUK.8.16	No one when they have lighted a lamp cover it with a vessel or put it under a bed, but set it on a lampstand, that those who enter in may see the light.
LUK.8.17	For nothing is secret that shall not be made manifest, neither any thing hid that shall not be known and come to light.
LUK.8.18	Take heed therefore how ye hear, for whosoever has, to him shall be given; and whosoever has not, from him shall be taken even that which he seems to have.
LUK.8.19	Then his mother and his brethren came to him and could not get to him for the crowd.
LUK.8.20	And it was told him by certain who said, Thy mother and thy brethren stand outside, desiring to see thee.
LUK.8.21	And he answered and said unto them, My mother and my brethren are those who hear the word of God and do it.
LUK.8.22	Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a ship with his disciples, and he said unto them, Let us go over unto the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.
LUK.8.23	But as they sailed, he fell asleep; and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were being filled with water and were in jeopardy.
LUK.8.24	And they came to him and awoke him, saying, Master, master, we perish. Then he arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water, and they ceased, and there was a calm.
LUK.8.25	And he said unto them, Where is your faith? And they, being afraid, wondered, saying one to another, Who is this! for he even commands the winds and the water, and they obey him.
LUK.8.26	And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee.
LUK.8.27	And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, who had demons for a long time and wore no clothes, neither abode in any house, but in the tombs.
LUK.8.28	When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him and with a loud voice said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of God most high? I beseech thee, torment me not.
LUK.8.29	(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For oftentimes it had caught him, and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters, and he broke the bands and was driven of the demon into the wilderness.)
LUK.8.30	And Jesus asked him, saying, What is thy name? And he said, Legion, because many demons were entered into him.
LUK.8.31	And they besought him that he would not command them to go out into the abyss.
LUK.8.32	And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain, and they besought him that he would allow them to enter into them. And he allowed them.
LUK.8.33	Then the demons went out of the man and entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake and were choked.
LUK.8.34	When those that fed them saw what was done, they fled and went and told it in the city and in the country.
LUK.8.35	Then they went out to see what was done and came to Jesus and found the man, out of whom the demons were departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind; and they were afraid.
LUK.8.36	And those who saw it told them by what means he that was possessed of the demons was saved.
LUK.8.37	Then the whole multitude of the country of the Gadarenes round about besought him to depart from them, for they were taken with great fear; and he went up into the ship and returned back again.
LUK.8.38	Now the man out of whom the demons were departed besought him that he might be with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying,
LUK.8.39	Return to thine own house and tell what great things God has done unto thee. And he went, preaching throughout the whole city what great things Jesus had done unto him.
LUK.8.40	And it came to pass that when Jesus returned, the people received him, for they were all waiting for him.
LUK.8.41	And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a prince of the synagogue, and he fell down at Jesus’ feet and besought him that he would come into his house;
LUK.8.42	for he had an only daughter, about twelve years of age, and she lay dying. But as he went, the people thronged him.
LUK.8.43	And a woman having an issue of blood twelve years, who had spent all her living upon physicians but could not be healed by any,
LUK.8.44	came behind him and touched the border of his garment, and immediately her issue of blood stopped.
LUK.8.45	Then Jesus said, Who touched me? When all denied, Peter and those that were with him said, Master, the multitude throng thee and press thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?
LUK.8.46	And Jesus said, Someone has touched me, for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me.
LUK.8.47	And when the woman saw that she was not hid, she came trembling, and falling down before him, she declared unto him before all the people for what cause she had touched him and how she was healed immediately.
LUK.8.48	And he said unto her, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith has made thee whole; go in peace.
LUK.8.49	While he yet spoke, there came one from the ruler of the synagogue’s house, saying to him, Thy daughter is dead; trouble not the Master.
LUK.8.50	But when Jesus heard it, he answered him, saying, Fear not; only believe, and she shall be made whole.
LUK.8.51	And when he came into the house, he allowed no one to go in except Peter and James and John and the father and the mother of the maiden.
LUK.8.52	And all wept and bewailed her, but he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but sleeps.
LUK.8.53	And they laughed him to scorn, knowing that she was dead.
LUK.8.54	And he put them all out and took her by the hand and called, saying, Maid, arise.
LUK.8.55	Then her spirit returned, and she arose straightway, and he commanded to give her food.
LUK.8.56	And her parents were astonished, but he charged them that they should tell no one what was done.
LUK.9.1	Then he called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases.
LUK.9.2	And he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
LUK.9.3	And he said unto them, Take nothing for your journey: neither staves nor provision bag, neither bread, neither money, neither have two coats apiece.
LUK.9.4	And whatever house ye enter into, abide there and depart from there.
LUK.9.5	And whosoever will not receive you, when ye go out of that city, shake off the very dust from your feet for a testimony against them.
LUK.9.6	And they departed and went through the towns, preaching the gospel and healing every where.
LUK.9.7	Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done by him, and he was perplexed because it was said of some that John was risen from the dead,
LUK.9.8	and of some, that Elijah had appeared, and of others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
LUK.9.9	And Herod said, I have beheaded John, but who is this of whom I hear such things? And he desired to see him.
LUK.9.10	And the apostles, when they were returned, told him all that they had done. And he took them and went aside privately into a desert place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.
LUK.9.11	And the people, when they knew it, followed him, and he received them and spoke unto them of the kingdom of God and healed those that had need of healing.
LUK.9.12	And when the day began to wear away, then came the twelve and said unto him, Send the multitude away that they may go into the towns and country round about and lodge and get victuals, for we are here in a desert place.
LUK.9.13	But he said unto them, Give ye them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes, unless we should go and buy food for all these people.
LUK.9.14	For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in companies of fifty.
LUK.9.15	And they did so and made them all sit down.
LUK.9.16	Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them and broke and gave to the disciples to set before the multitude.
LUK.9.17	And they ate and were all filled, and there was taken up of fragments that remained to them twelve baskets.
LUK.9.18	And it came to pass as he was alone praying, his disciples were with him, and he asked them, saying, Who do the people say that I am?
LUK.9.19	They answering said, John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets is risen again.
LUK.9.20	He said unto them, But who do ye say that I am? Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
LUK.9.21	And he straitly charged them and commanded them not to tell anyone this,
LUK.9.22	saying, The Son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the elders and of the princes of the priests and scribes and be slain and be raised the third day.
LUK.9.23	And he said to them all, If anyone will come after me, let them deny themself and take up their cross {Gr. stauros – stake} daily and follow me.
LUK.9.24	For whosoever desires to save his soul shall lose it, but whosoever will lose his soul for my sake, the same shall save it.
LUK.9.25	For what is a man advantaged if he gains the whole world, having destroyed himself or having suffered the loss of himself?
LUK.9.26	For whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed when he shall come in his own glory and in his Father’s and of the holy angels.
LUK.9.27	But I tell you in truth, there are some standing here who shall not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God.
LUK.9.28	And it came to pass about eight days after these words, he took Peter and John and James and went up into the mountain to pray.
LUK.9.29	And as he prayed, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and glistering.
LUK.9.30	And, behold, two men talked with him, who were Moses and Elijah,
LUK.9.31	who appeared in majesty and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.
LUK.9.32	But Peter and those that were with him were heavy with sleep, and when they awoke, they saw his glory and the two men that stood with him.
LUK.9.33	And it came to pass as they departed from him, Peter said unto Jesus, Master, it is good for us to remain here; and let us make three tabernacles: one for thee and one for Moses and one for Elijah, not knowing what he said.
LUK.9.34	While he was speaking this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they feared as they entered into the cloud.
LUK.9.35	And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son; hear him.
LUK.9.36	And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days any of those things which they had seen.
LUK.9.37	And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, many people met him.
LUK.9.38	And, behold, a man of the multitude cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son, for he is my only child.
LUK.9.39	And, behold, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it throws him into convulsions with foaming, and with difficulty it departs from him, bruising him.
LUK.9.40	And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, and they could not.
LUK.9.41	And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you and suffer you? Bring thy son here.
LUK.9.42	And as he was yet a coming, the demon threw him down into convulsions; but Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the child and delivered him again to his father.
LUK.9.43	And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they all wondered at all the things which Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,
LUK.9.44	Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.
LUK.9.45	But they did not understand this word, and it was hid from them that they should not understand, and they feared to ask him regarding this.
LUK.9.46	Then there arose a dispute among them, which of them should be the greatest.
LUK.9.47	But Jesus, seeing the thoughts of their heart, took a child and set him by him,
LUK.9.48	and said unto them, Whosoever shall receive this child in my name receives me, and whosoever shall receive me receives him that sent me; for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.
LUK.9.49	And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us.
LUK.9.50	And Jesus said unto him, Forbid him not, for he that is not against us is for us.
LUK.9.51	And it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem
LUK.9.52	and sent messengers before his face; and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him.
LUK.9.53	And they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.
LUK.9.54	And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them, even as Elijah did?
LUK.9.55	But he turned and rebuked them and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.
LUK.9.56	For the Son of man is not come to lose men’s souls, but to save them. And they went to another village.
LUK.9.57	And it came to pass that as they went in the way, a certain man said unto him, Lord, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
LUK.9.58	And Jesus said unto him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the heaven have nests, but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.
LUK.9.59	And he said unto another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.
LUK.9.60	Jesus said unto him, Let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and declare the kingdom of God.
LUK.9.61	And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee, but let me first go bid farewell those who are at home at my house.
LUK.9.62	And Jesus said unto him, No one having put his hand to the plough and looking back is fit for the kingdom of God.
LUK.10.1	After these things the Lord appointed another seventy also and sent them two by two before his face into every city and place where he himself would come.
LUK.10.2	Therefore he said unto them, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few; pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.
LUK.10.3	Go; behold, I send you forth as lambs among wolves.
LUK.10.4	Carry neither purse nor provision bag nor shoes, and greet no one on the way.
LUK.10.5	And into whatever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house.
LUK.10.6	And if indeed there is a son of peace there, your peace shall rest upon it; if not, it shall turn to you again./strong>
LUK.10.7	And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give, for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.
LUK.10.8	And into whatever city ye enter and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you
LUK.10.9	and heal the sick that are therein and say unto them, The kingdom of God is come near unto you.
LUK.10.10	But into whatever city ye enter and they receive you not, go out into the streets of the same and say,
LUK.10.11	Even the very dust of your city which cleaves on us we do wipe off against you; notwithstanding be ye sure of this that the kingdom of God is come near unto you.
LUK.10.12	But I say unto you that it shall be more tolerable in that day for Sodom than for that city.
LUK.10.13	Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works had been done in Tyre and Sidon which have been done in you, they would have repented a long while ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
LUK.10.14	Therefore it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you.
LUK.10.15	And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto the heavens, shalt be thrust down to Hades.
LUK.10.16	He that hears you hears me, and he that despises you despises me, and he that despises me despises him that sent me.
LUK.10.17	And the seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the demons are subject unto us in thy name.
LUK.10.18	And he said unto them, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
LUK.10.19	Behold, I give unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.
LUK.10.20	Notwithstanding, rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject unto you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in the heavens.
LUK.10.21	In that same hour Jesus rejoiced in spirit and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes; even so, Father; for so it seemed good in thy sight.
LUK.10.22	All things are delivered to me of my Father, and no one knows who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son and he to whom the Son will reveal him.
LUK.10.23	And he turned him unto his disciples and said privately, Blessed are the eyes which see the things that ye see,
LUK.10.24	for I tell you that many prophets and kings desired to see those things which ye see and did not see them and to hear those things which ye hear and did not hear them.
LUK.10.25	And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
LUK.10.26	He said unto him, What is written in the law? How readest thou?
LUK.10.27	And he answering said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy strength and with all thy understanding, and thy neighbour as thyself.
LUK.10.28	And he said unto him, Thou hast answered right; do this, and thou shalt live.
LUK.10.29	But he, desiring to justify himself, said unto Jesus, And who is my neighbour?
LUK.10.30	And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed, leaving him half dead.
LUK.10.31	And it so happened that a certain priest came down that way; and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side.
LUK.10.32	And likewise a Levite, when he came near the place and looked on him, he passed by on the other side.
LUK.10.33	But a certain Samaritan, as he journeyed, came where he was; and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion
LUK.10.34	and went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him.
LUK.10.35	And on the morrow when he departed, he took out two denarius and gave them to the host and said unto him, Take care of him; and whatever thou spendest more, when I come again, I will repay thee.
LUK.10.36	Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?
LUK.10.37	And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go and do thou likewise.
LUK.10.38	Now it came to pass, as they went, that he entered into a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha received him into her house.
LUK.10.39	And she had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus’ feet and heard his word.
LUK.10.40	But Martha was cumbered about in much serving and came to him and said, Lord, dost thou not care that my sister has left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me.
LUK.10.41	And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things;
LUK.10.42	but only one thing is necessary, and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.
LUK.11.1	And it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place, when he ceased, one of his disciples said unto him, Lord, teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples.
LUK.11.2	And he said unto them, When ye pray, say, Our Father who art in the heavens, Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, as in heaven, so also in the earth.
LUK.11.3	Give us day by day our daily bread.
LUK.11.4	And forgive us our sins, for we also forgive every one that is indebted to us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
LUK.11.5	And he said unto them, Which of you shall have a friend and shall go unto him at midnight and say unto him, Friend, lend me three loaves;
LUK.11.6	for a friend of mine in his journey is come to me, and I have nothing to set before him?
LUK.11.7	And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not; the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give thee.
LUK.11.8	I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity, he will rise and give him as many as he needs.
LUK.11.9	And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
LUK.11.10	For every one that asks receives; and he that seeks finds; and to him that knocks it shall be opened.
LUK.11.11	If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he for a fish give him a serpent?
LUK.11.12	Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion?
LUK.11.13	If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those that ask him?
LUK.11.14	And he was casting out a demon, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the demon was gone out, the one who had been dumb spoke; and the people marvelled.
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, He casts out devils through Beelzebub the prince of the demons.
LUK.11.16	And others, tempting him, sought of him a sign from heaven.
LUK.11.17	But he, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every house or city divided against itself will not remain.
LUK.11.18	If Satan also is divided against himself, how shall his kingdom stand? because ye say that I cast out demons through Beelzebub.
LUK.11.19	And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your sons cast them out? therefore shall they be your judges.
LUK.11.20	But if I with the finger of God cast out the demons, certainly the kingdom of God is come upon you.
LUK.11.21	When an armed strong man keeps his palace, his goods are in peace;
LUK.11.22	but when another stronger than he shall come upon him and overcome him, he takes from him all his arms in which he trusted and divides his spoils.
LUK.11.23	He that is not with me is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters.
LUK.11.24	When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walks through dry places, seeking rest; and finding none, he says, I will return unto my house from which I came out.
LUK.11.25	And when he comes, he finds it swept and garnished.
LUK.11.26	Then he goes, and takes unto him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and they enter in and dwell there, and the last state of that man is worse than the first.
LUK.11.27	And it came to pass as he spoke these things, a certain woman of the crowd lifted up her voice and said unto him, Blessed is the womb that bare thee and the breasts which thou hast sucked.
LUK.11.28	But he said, Rather, blessed are those that hear the word of God and keep it.
LUK.11.29	And gathering the people unto him, he began to say, This is an evil generation: they seek a sign, and no sign shall be given it but the sign of Jonah the prophet.
LUK.11.30	For as Jonah was a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation.
LUK.11.31	The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment against the men of this generation and condemn them, for she came from the utmost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.
LUK.11.32	The men of Nineve shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and, behold, a greater than Jonah is here.
LUK.11.33	No one, when he has lighted a lamp, puts it in a secret place, neither under a bushel, but on a lampstand that those who come in may see the light.
LUK.11.34	The lamp of the body is the eye; therefore when thine eye is sincere, thy whole body also is full of light; but when thine eye is evil, thy body also is full of darkness.
LUK.11.35	Take heed therefore if the light which is in thee is darkness.
LUK.11.36	If thy whole body therefore is full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a lamp doth give thee light.
LUK.11.37	And as he spoke, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him, and he went in and sat down to food.
LUK.11.38	And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first washed before dinner.
LUK.11.39	And the Lord said unto him, Now do ye Pharisees make clean the outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is full of ravening and wickedness.
LUK.11.40	Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is within also?
LUK.11.41	But rather give alms {lit. do acts of mercy} of such things as ye have; and, behold, all things are clean unto you.
LUK.11.42	But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner of herbs and pass over the judgment and the charity of God; these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone.
LUK.11.43	Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the first seats in the synagogues and greetings in the markets.
LUK.11.44	Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves which are not seen, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them.
LUK.11.45	Then one of the lawyers answered and said unto him, Master, saying these things, thou dost reproach us also.
LUK.11.46	And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye burden men with burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens with one of your fingers.
LUK.11.47	Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your fathers killed them.
LUK.11.48	Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres.
LUK.11.49	Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall slay and others they shall persecute:
LUK.11.50	that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world may be required of this generation,
LUK.11.51	from the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, who perished between the altar and the temple; verily I say unto you, It shall be required of this generation.
LUK.11.52	Woe unto you, lawyers! for ye have taken the key of knowledge: ye entered not in yourselves, and those that were entering in, ye hindered.
LUK.11.53	And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to urge him vehemently and to provoke him to speak of many things,
LUK.11.54	laying wait for him and seeking to catch something out of his mouth that they might accuse him.
LUK.12.1	In the meantime, when there were gathered together an innumerable multitude of people, insomuch that they trode one upon another, he began to say unto his disciples first of all, Beware ye of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.
LUK.12.2	For there is nothing covered that shall not be revealed, neither hid that shall not be known.
LUK.12.3	Therefore whatever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light, and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.
LUK.12.4	And I say unto you my friends, Be not afraid of those that kill the body and, after that, have no more that they can do.
LUK.12.5	But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear: Fear him, who, after being killed, has power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, Fear him.
LUK.12.6	Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?
LUK.12.7	But even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not, therefore; ye are of more value than many sparrows.
LUK.12.8	Also I say unto you, Whosoever shall confess me before men, him shall the Son of man also confess before the angels of God;
LUK.12.9	but he that denies me before men shall be denied before the angels of God.
LUK.12.10	And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, there is forgiveness for him; but unto him that blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven.
LUK.12.11	And when they bring you unto the synagogues and unto magistrates and powers, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall answer or what ye shall say;
LUK.12.12	for the Holy Spirit shall teach you in the same hour what ye ought to say.
LUK.12.13	And one of the crowd said unto him, Master, speak to my brother, that he divide the inheritance with me.
LUK.12.14	And he said unto him, Man, who made me a judge or a divider over you?
LUK.12.15	And he said unto them, Take heed and beware of all covetousness; for a man’s life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.
LUK.12.16	And he spoke a parable unto them, saying, The ground of a certain rich man brought forth plentifully;
LUK.12.17	and he thought within himself, saying, What shall I do because I have no room where to bestow my fruits?
LUK.12.18	And he said, This will I do: I will pull down my storehouses and build greater, and there will I bestow all my fruits and my goods.
LUK.12.19	And I will say to my soul, Soul, thou hast many goods laid up for many years; take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry.
LUK.12.20	But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee; then whose shall those things be which thou hast stored up?
LUK.12.21	So is he that lays up treasure for himself and is not rich in God.
LUK.12.22	And he said unto his disciples, Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on.
LUK.12.23	The life is more than food, and the body is more than raiment.
LUK.12.24	Consider the ravens, for they neither sow nor reap, which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are ye better than the fowls?
LUK.12.25	And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?
LUK.12.26	If ye then are not able to do that thing which is least, why take ye thought for the rest?
LUK.12.27	Consider the lilies how they grow: they toil not, they spin not; and yet I say unto you that Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
LUK.12.28	If then God so clothes the grass, which is today in the field and tomorrow is cast into the oven, how much more will he clothe you, O ye of little faith?
LUK.12.29	And seek not what ye shall eat or what ye shall drink, neither be ye high minded.
LUK.12.30	For all these things do the Gentiles of the world seek after, and your Father knows that ye have need of these things.
LUK.12.31	But rather seek ye the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you.
LUK.12.32	Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.
LUK.12.33	Sell what ye have and give alms; {lit. do acts of mercy}; provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that fails not, where no thief approaches neither moth corrupts.
LUK.12.34	For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
LUK.12.35	Let your loins be girded about and your lamps burning,
LUK.12.36	and ye yourselves like unto men that wait for their lord, when he will return from the wedding; that when he comes and knocks, they may open unto him immediately.
LUK.12.37	Blessed are those slaves, whom the lord when he comes shall find watching; verily I say unto you that he shall gird himself and make them to sit down to food and will come forth and serve them.
LUK.12.38	And if he shall come in the second watch or come in the third watch and find them so, blessed are those slaves.
LUK.12.39	And know this: that if the husband of the house had known what hour the thief would come, he would have watched and not have suffered his house to be broken through.
LUK.12.40	Be ye therefore ready also; for the Son of man comes at an hour when ye think not.
LUK.12.41	Then Peter said unto him, Lord, speakest thou this parable unto us or even to all?
LUK.12.42	And the Lord said, Who then is that faithful and wise steward whom his lord shall make ruler over his household to give them their portion of food in due season?
LUK.12.43	Blessed is that slave whom his lord when he comes shall find so doing.
LUK.12.44	Of a truth I say unto you that he will make him ruler over all that he has.
LUK.12.45	But and if that slave shall say in his heart, My lord delays his coming, and shall begin to beat the menslaves and maids and to eat and drink and to be drunken,
LUK.12.46	the lord of that slave will come in a day when he does not look for him and at an hour when he is not aware and will cut him off and will appoint him his portion with the unfaithful.
LUK.12.47	And that slave who knew his lord’s will and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes.
LUK.12.48	But he that knew not and did commit things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall much be required; and to whom much was committed, more will be asked of him.
LUK.12.49	I am come to cast fire into the earth; and what do I desire, except that it be kindled?
LUK.12.50	But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am anguished until it is accomplished!
LUK.12.51	Think ye that I am come to the earth to give peace? No, I tell you, but rather division;
LUK.12.52	for from now on there shall be five in one house divided: three against two and two against three.
LUK.12.53	The father shall be divided against the son and the son against the father, the mother against the daughter and the daughter against the mother, the mother-in-law against her daughter- in-law and the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
LUK.12.54	And he said also to the people, When ye see the cloud rising out of the west, straightway ye say, A shower comes, and so it is.
LUK.12.55	And when the south wind blows, ye say, There will be heat, and it comes to pass.
LUK.12.56	Ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the sky and of the earth; but how is it that ye do not discern this time?
LUK.12.57	Yea, and why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?
LUK.12.58	When thou goest with thine adversary to the magistrate, as thou art in the way, give diligence that thou may be delivered from him, lest he drag thee away to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and the officer cast thee into prison.
LUK.12.59	I tell thee, in no wise shalt thou come out of there until thou hast paid the very last mite.
LUK.13.1	There were present at the same time some that told him of the Galilaeans whose blood Pilate had mingled with his sacrifices.
LUK.13.2	And Jesus, answering, said unto them, Think ye that these Galilaeans suffered such things because they were greater sinners than all the other Galilaeans?
LUK.13.3	I tell you, No; but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
LUK.13.4	Or those eighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them, think ye that they were greater debtors than all the other men that dwelt in Jerusalem?
LUK.13.5	I tell you, No; but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.
LUK.13.6	And He spoke this parable: A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came and sought fruit upon it and found none.
LUK.13.7	Then he said unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none; cut it down; why does it cumber the ground?
LUK.13.8	And he, answering, said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also until I shall dig about it and dung it,
LUK.13.9	and if it bears fruit, well; and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down.
LUK.13.10	And he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the sabbath.
LUK.13.11	And, behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years and was bowed together and could in no wise lift herself up.
LUK.13.12	And when Jesus saw her, he called her and said unto her, Woman, thou art loosed from thine infirmity.
LUK.13.13	And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight and glorified God.
LUK.13.14	And the prince of the synagogue answered with indignation because Jesus had healed on the sabbath, and said unto the people, There are six days in which it behooves men to work; in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the sabbath day.
LUK.13.15	The Lord then answered him and said, Thou hypocrite, does not each one of you on the sabbath loose his ox or his ass from the stall and lead it away to drink?
LUK.13.16	And regarding this daughter of Abraham, who, behold, Satan had bound eighteen years, does it not behoove us to release her from this bond on the Sabbath day?
LUK.13.17	And as he said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed, but all the people rejoiced for all the glorious things that were done by him.
LUK.13.18	Then said he, Unto what is the kingdom of God like? and unto what shall I compare it?
LUK.13.19	It is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man took and cast into his garden; and it grew and waxed a great tree; and the fowls of the heaven lodged in the branches of it.
LUK.13.20	And again he said, Unto what shall I compare the kingdom of God?
LUK.13.21	It is like leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal until the whole was leavened.
LUK.13.22	And he went through the cities and villages, teaching and journeying toward Jerusalem.
LUK.13.23	Then someone said unto him, Lord, are there few that are saved? And he said unto them,
LUK.13.24	Strive to enter in at the narrow gate; for many, I say unto you, will seek to enter in and shall not be able.
LUK.13.25	When once the husband of the house is risen up and shall have shut the door, and ye begin to stand without and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open unto us; and he shall answer and say unto you, I know you not from where ye are,
LUK.13.26	then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets.
LUK.13.27	But he shall say unto you, I know you not from where ye are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity.
LUK.13.28	In that place shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth when ye shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves thrust out.
LUK.13.29	And others shall come from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south and shall sit at the table in the kingdom of God.
LUK.13.30	And, behold, there are last which shall be first, and there are first which shall be last.
LUK.13.31	The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, Go out and depart from here, for Herod will kill thee.
LUK.13.32	And he said unto them, Go ye and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out demons, and I do cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.
LUK.13.33	Nevertheless I must walk today and tomorrow and the day following, for it cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.
LUK.13.34	O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kills the prophets and stones those that are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and ye would not!
LUK.13.35	Behold, your house is left unto you desolate; and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me until the time comes when ye shall say, Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.
LUK.14.1	And it came to pass as he went into the house of one of the princes of the Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day that they watched him.
LUK.14.2	And, behold, there was a certain man before him who had the dropsy.
LUK.14.3	And Jesus, answering, spoke unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day?
LUK.14.4	And they were silent. And he took him and healed him and dismissed him
LUK.14.5	and answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox fallen into a pit and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day?
LUK.14.6	And they could not answer him as to these things.
LUK.14.7	And observing how they chose the first seats at the table, he put forth a parable to those who were invited, saying unto them,
LUK.14.8	When thou art called to a wedding by anyone, do not sit down in the highest place, lest a more honourable man than thou be invited of him,
LUK.14.9	and he that called thee and him come and say to thee, Give this man place, and thou begin with shame to have the lowest place.
LUK.14.10	But when thou art called, go and sit down in the lowest place that when he that invited thee comes, he may say unto thee, Friend, come up higher; then shalt thou have glory in the presence of those that sit at the table with thee.
LUK.14.11	For whosoever exalts himself shall be abased, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
LUK.14.12	Then said he also to him that invited him, When thou makest a dinner or a supper, call not thy friends nor thy brethren, neither thy kinsmen nor thy rich neighbours, lest they also invite thee again, and a recompense be made thee.
LUK.14.13	But when thou makest a banquet, call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind,
LUK.14.14	and thou shalt be blessed, for they cannot recompense thee; for thou shalt be recompensed at the resurrection of the just.
LUK.14.15	And when one of those that sat at the table with him heard these things, he said unto him, Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of God.
LUK.14.16	Then said he unto him, A certain man made a great supper and called many
LUK.14.17	and sent his slave at supper time to say to those that were called, Come, for all things are now ready.
LUK.14.18	And they all with one consent began to make excuse. The first said unto him, I have bought a field, and I have need to go and see it; I pray thee have me excused.
LUK.14.19	And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them; I pray thee have me excused.
LUK.14.20	And another said, I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come.
LUK.14.21	So that slave came and showed his lord these things. Then the husband of the house, being angry, said to his slave, Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the halt and the blind.
LUK.14.22	And the slave said, Lord, it is done as thou hast commanded, and yet there is room.
LUK.14.23	And the lord said unto the slave, Go out into the highways and hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be filled.
LUK.14.24	For I say unto you, That none of those men which were called shall taste of my supper.
LUK.14.25	And great multitudes went with him, and he turned and said unto them,
LUK.14.26	If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother and wife and children and brethren and sisters, and even his own life also, he cannot be my disciple.
LUK.14.27	And whosoever does not bear his cross {Gr. stauros – stake} and come after me cannot be my disciple.
LUK.14.28	For which of you intending to build a tower does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has sufficient to finish it?
LUK.14.29	Lest perhaps after he has laid the foundation and is not able to finish it, all that behold it begin to mock him,
LUK.14.30	saying, This man began to build, and was not able to finish.
LUK.14.31	Or what king going to make war against another king does not sit down first and consult whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him that comes against him with twenty thousand?
LUK.14.32	Or else, while the other is yet a great way off, he sends an embassy and desires conditions of peace.
LUK.14.33	So likewise, any one of you that does not forsake all that he has cannot be my disciple.
LUK.14.34	Salt is good; but if the salt has lost its savour, with what shall it be seasoned?
LUK.14.35	It is neither good for the land, nor for the dunghill; it is cast out. He that has ears to hear, let him hear.
LUK.15.1	Then all the publicans and sinners drew near unto him to hear him.
LUK.15.2	And the Pharisees and scribes murmured, saying, This man receives sinners and eats with them.
LUK.15.3	And he spoke this parable unto them, saying,
LUK.15.4	What man of you having a hundred sheep if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost until he finds it?
LUK.15.5	And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing.
LUK.15.6	And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbours, saying unto them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost.
LUK.15.7	I say unto you that likewise there shall be more joy in heaven over one sinner that repents than over ninety-nine just persons, who need no repentance.
LUK.15.8	Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she loses one drachma, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and seek diligently until she finds it?
LUK.15.9	And when she has found it, she calls her friends and her neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.
LUK.15.10	Likewise, I say unto you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner that repents.
LUK.15.11	And he said, A certain man had two sons;
LUK.15.12	and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of the estate that falls to me. And he divided unto them his living.
LUK.15.13	And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his estate with riotous living.
LUK.15.14	And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.
LUK.15.15	And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.
LUK.15.16	And he longed to fill his belly with the husks that the swine ate, but no one gave them unto him.
LUK.15.17	And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father’s have abundance of bread, and I perish here with hunger!
LUK.15.18	I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before thee
LUK.15.19	and am no longer worthy to be called thy son; make me as one of thy hired servants.
LUK.15.20	And he arose and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.
LUK.15.21	And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no longer worthy to be called thy son.
LUK.15.22	But the father said to his slaves, Bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet
LUK.15.23	and bring here the fatted calf and kill it, and let us eat and be merry;
LUK.15.24	for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.
LUK.15.25	Now his elder son was in the field, and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.
LUK.15.26	And he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant.
LUK.15.27	And he said unto him, Thy brother is come, and thy father has killed the fatted calf because he has received him safe and sound.
LUK.15.28	And he was angry and would not go in, therefore his father came out and intreated him.
LUK.15.29	And he, answering, said to his father, Behold, these many years I have served thee, neither at any time have I transgressed thy commandment; and yet thou never gavest me a kid that I might make merry with my friends.
LUK.15.30	But as soon as this thy son was come who has devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed the fatted calf for him.
LUK.15.31	And he said unto him, Son, thou art always with me, and all that I have is thine.
LUK.15.32	It was necessary that we should make merry and be glad, for this thy brother was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.
LUK.16.1	And he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man who had a steward, and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.
LUK.16.2	And he called him and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou may no longer be steward.
LUK.16.3	Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? for my lord takes the stewardship away from me; I cannot dig, and I am ashamed to beg.
LUK.16.4	I know what I shall do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.
LUK.16.5	So he called each one of his lord’s debtors unto him and said unto the first, How much dost thou owe unto my lord?
LUK.16.6	And he said, A hundred measures of oil. And he said unto him, Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write fifty.
LUK.16.7	Then said he to another, And how much dost thou owe? And he said, A hundred measures of wheat. And he said unto him, Take thy bill and write eighty.
LUK.16.8	And the lord commended the unjust steward because he had done discreetly; for the sons of this age are in their generation more prudent than the sons of light.
LUK.16.9	And I say unto you, Make friends unto yourselves with the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when these fail, you may be received into eternal dwellings.
LUK.16.10	He that is faithful with little is faithful also with much, and he that is unjust with little is unjust also with much.
LUK.16.11	If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true?
LUK.16.12	And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man’s, who shall give you that which is your own?
LUK.16.13	No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
LUK.16.14	And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things, and they derided him.
LUK.16.15	And he said unto them, Ye are they who justify themselves before men, but God knows your hearts, for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.
LUK.16.16	The law and the prophets were until John; since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and whosoever will presses into it.
LUK.16.17	And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass than one tittle of the law to fail.
LUK.16.18	Whosoever puts away his wife and marries another commits adultery, and whosoever marries her that is put away of her husband commits adultery.
LUK.16.19	There was a certain rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and fared sumptuously every day;
LUK.16.20	and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, who was laid at his gate, full of sores
LUK.16.21	and desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man’s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
LUK.16.22	And it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the angels into Abraham’s bosom; the rich man also died and was buried;
LUK.16.23	and in Hades he lifted up his eyes, being in torments, and saw Abraham afar off and Lazarus in his bosom.
LUK.16.24	And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
LUK.16.25	But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime didst receive thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted here, and thou art tormented.
LUK.16.26	And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that those who would pass from here to you cannot; neither can they pass from there to us.
LUK.16.27	Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou would send him to my father’s house,
LUK.16.28	for I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.
LUK.16.29	Abraham said unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.
LUK.16.30	And he said, No, father Abraham; but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.
LUK.16.31	And he said unto him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, even though one rose from the dead.
LUK.17.1	Then he said unto the disciples, It is impossible that offenses will not come, but woe unto the one through whom they come!
LUK.17.2	It would be better for him if a millstone turned by an ass were placed around his neck and he were cast into the sea than that he should cause one of these little ones to stumble.
LUK.17.3	Take heed to yourselves: If thy brother should trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him.
LUK.17.4	And if he trespasses against thee seven times in a day and seven times in a day turns again to thee, saying, I repent, thou shalt forgive him.
LUK.17.5	And the apostles said unto the Lord, Increase our faith.
LUK.17.6	And the Lord said, If ye had faith as a grain of mustard seed, ye might say unto this sycamore tree, Pluck thyself up by the root, and plant thyself in the sea, and it would obey you.
LUK.17.7	But which of you, having a slave plowing or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by when he is come from the field, Go and sit down at the table?
LUK.17.8	And will not rather say unto him, Make ready wherewith I may sup and gird thyself and serve me until I have eaten and drunken, and afterward thou shalt eat and drink?
LUK.17.9	Does he thank that slave because he did the things that were commanded him? I think not.
LUK.17.10	So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable slaves: we have done that which was our duty to do.
LUK.17.11	And it came to pass as he went to Jerusalem that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.
LUK.17.12	And as he entered into a certain village, ten men that were lepers met him, who stood afar off
LUK.17.13	and lifted up their voices and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.
LUK.17.14	When he saw them, he said unto them, Go show yourselves unto the priests. And it came to pass that as they went, they were cleansed.
LUK.17.15	Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back and with a loud voice glorified God
LUK.17.16	and fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks; and he was a Samaritan.
LUK.17.17	And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?
LUK.17.18	Were there not found any returning to give glory to God, except this stranger?
LUK.17.19	And he said unto him, Arise, go; thy faith has saved thee.
LUK.17.20	And when he was asked of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God does not come with observation;
LUK.17.21	neither shall they say, Behold it here! or, Behold it there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.
LUK.17.22	And he said unto the disciples, The days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.
LUK.17.23	And they shall say to you, Behold it here, or, Behold it there; do not go, nor follow them.
LUK.17.24	For as the lightning, which shines from the region under heaven, shines in that which is under heaven; so also shall the Son of man be in his day.
LUK.17.25	But first he must suffer many things and be rejected of this generation.
LUK.17.26	And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.
LUK.17.27	They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came and destroyed them all.
LUK.17.28	Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;
LUK.17.29	but the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
LUK.17.30	Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.
LUK.17.31	In that day, he who shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away; and he that is in the field, let him likewise not turn back.
LUK.17.32	Remember Lot’s wife.
LUK.17.33	Whosoever shall seek to save his soul shall lose it, and whosoever shall lose it shall cause it to live.
LUK.17.34	I tell you in that night there shall be two men in one bed: the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.
LUK.17.35	Two women shall be grinding together: the one shall be taken, and the other left.
LUK.17.36	Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.
LUK.17.37	And they answered and said unto him, Where, Lord? And he said unto them, Where the body is, there will the eagles be gathered together.
LUK.18.1	And he spoke a parable unto them to this end, that it behooves us always to pray and not faint,
LUK.18.2	saying, There was in a city a judge who did not fear God nor regard man;
LUK.18.3	and there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying, Defend me from my adversary.
LUK.18.4	And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself, Though I do not fear God, nor regard man,
LUK.18.5	yet because this widow troubles me, I will do her justice, lest by her continual coming she weary me.
LUK.18.6	And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge says.
LUK.18.7	And shall not God avenge his own elect who cry day and night unto him though he bears long regarding them?
LUK.18.8	I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man comes, shall he find faith on the earth?
LUK.18.9	And he spoke this parable unto some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous and despised others:
LUK.18.10	Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican.
LUK.18.11	The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee that I am not as other men are: extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.
LUK.18.12	I fast two meals every sabbath; I give tithes of all that I possess.
LUK.18.13	And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God, reconcile me, a sinner.
LUK.18.14	I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for anyone that exalts himself shall be humbled, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.
LUK.18.15	And they brought unto him also infants that he would touch them; but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them.
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called them unto him and said, Suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God.
LUK.18.17	Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein.
LUK.18.18	And a certain prince asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?
LUK.18.19	And Jesus said unto him, Why dost thou call me good? No one is good except one, that is, God.
LUK.18.20	Thou knowest the commandments, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother.
LUK.18.21	And he said, All these things I have kept from my youth up.
LUK.18.22	Now when Jesus heard this, he said unto him, Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me.
LUK.18.23	And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful, for he was very rich.
LUK.18.24	And when Jesus saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, How difficult it is for those that have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!
LUK.18.25	For it is easier to put a cable through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.
LUK.18.26	And those that heard it said, Who then can be saved?
LUK.18.27	And he said, The things which are impossible with men are possible with God.
LUK.18.28	Then Peter said, Behold, we have left all and followed thee.
LUK.18.29	And he said unto them, Verily I say unto you, There is no one that has left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God’s sake
LUK.18.30	who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the age to come, eternal life.
LUK.18.31	Then he took unto him the twelve and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished.
LUK.18.32	For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles and shall be mocked and spitefully treated and spitted on;
LUK.18.33	and they shall scourge him and put him to death, but the third day he shall rise again.
LUK.18.34	And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they did not know what was said.
LUK.18.35	And it came to pass that as he came near unto Jericho, a certain blind man sat beside the way begging,
LUK.18.36	and hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what this might be.
LUK.18.37	And they told him that Jesus of Nazareth passes by.
LUK.18.38	And he cried out, saying, Jesus, thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
LUK.18.39	And those who went before rebuked him that he should remain silent; but he cried out so much the more, Thou Son of David, have mercy on me.
LUK.18.40	And Jesus stopped and commanded him to be brought unto him, and when he was come near, he asked him,
LUK.18.41	saying, What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? And he said, Lord, that I may see.
LUK.18.42	And Jesus said unto him, See; thy faith has saved thee.
LUK.18.43	And immediately he saw and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.
LUK.19.1	And Jesus, having entered, was passing through Jericho;
LUK.19.2	and, behold, a man named Zacchaeus, who was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.
LUK.19.3	And he sought to see who Jesus was and could not for the crowd because he was small of stature.
LUK.19.4	And running ahead, he climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was to pass that way.
LUK.19.5	And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and saw him and said unto him, Zacchaeus, make haste and come down; for today I must abide at thy house.
LUK.19.6	And he made haste and came down and received him joyfully.
LUK.19.7	And when they saw it, they all murmured, saying, That he was gone to be guest with a man that is a sinner.
LUK.19.8	Then Zacchaeus stood and said unto the Lord; Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.
LUK.19.9	And Jesus said unto him, This day saving health is come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.
LUK.19.10	For the Son of man is come to seek and to save that which was lost.
LUK.19.11	And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable because he was near to Jerusalem and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately be manifested.
LUK.19.12	He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.
LUK.19.13	And having called ten of his slaves, he delivered them ten minas and said unto them, Trade until I come.
LUK.19.14	But his citizens hated him and sent an embassy after him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us.
LUK.19.15	And it came to pass that when he was returned, having received the kingdom, then he commanded these slaves to be called unto him, to whom he had given the money, that he might know how much each one had gained by trading.
LUK.19.16	Then came the first, saying, Lord, thy mina has gained ten minas.
LUK.19.17	And he said unto him, Well done, thou good slave; because thou hast been faithful in a very little, thou shalt have authority over ten cities.
LUK.19.18	And the second came, saying, Lord, thy mina has made five minas.
LUK.19.19	And he said likewise to him, Be thou also over five cities.
LUK.19.20	And another came, saying, Lord, behold, here is thy mina, which I have kept laid up in a napkin,
LUK.19.21	for I feared thee because thou art an austere man: thou takest up that which thou didst not lay down and dost reap that which thou didst not sow.
LUK.19.22	Then he said unto him, Out of thine own mouth I will judge thee, thou wicked slave. Thou knewest that I was an austere man, taking up that which I did not lay down, and reaping that which I did not sow;
LUK.19.23	why then didst thou not give my money into the bank, that at my coming I might have required my own with interest?
LUK.19.24	And he said unto those that stood by, Take from him the mina and give it to him that has the ten minas.
LUK.19.25	(And they said unto him, Lord, he has ten minas.)
LUK.19.26	For I say unto you, That unto every one who has shall be given; and from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken away from him.
LUK.19.27	Moreover, those enemies of mine, who were unwilling that I should reign over them, bring them here and slay them before me.
LUK.19.28	And when he had thus spoken, he went before, ascending up to Jerusalem.
LUK.19.29	And it came to pass, when he was come nigh to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,
LUK.19.30	saying, Go ye into the village over against you, in which at your entering ye shall find a colt tied, upon whom no one has ever sat; loose him, and bring him here.
LUK.19.31	And if anyone asks you, Why do ye loose him? thus shall ye say unto him, Because the Lord has need of him.
LUK.19.32	And those that were sent went and found even as he had said unto them.
LUK.19.33	And as they were loosing the colt, its owners said unto them, Why loose ye the colt?
LUK.19.34	And they said, The Lord has need of him.
LUK.19.35	And they brought him to Jesus, and they cast their garments upon the colt, and they set Jesus upon it.
LUK.19.36	And as he went, they spread their garments in the way.
LUK.19.37	And when he was come near, even now at the descent of the mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen,
LUK.19.38	saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.
LUK.19.39	And some of the Pharisees from among the multitude said unto him, Master, rebuke thy disciples.
LUK.19.40	And he answered and said unto them, I tell you that if these should be silent, the stones would immediately cry out.
LUK.19.41	And when he was come near, he beheld the city and wept over it,
LUK.19.42	saying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.
LUK.19.43	For the days shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about thee and compass thee round and constrain thee on every side
LUK.19.44	and shall cast thee down to the ground and thy children within thee, and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.
LUK.19.45	And he went into the temple and began to cast out those selling and buying therein,
LUK.19.46	saying unto them, It is written, My house is a house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.
LUK.19.47	And he taught daily in the temple. But the princes of the priests and the scribes and the principals of the people sought to kill him
LUK.19.48	and could not find what they might do, for all the people were very attentive to hear him.
LUK.20.1	And it came to pass that on one of those days as he taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, the princes of the priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders
LUK.20.2	and spoke unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?
LUK.20.3	And he answered and said unto them, I will also ask you one thing, and answer me:
LUK.20.4	The baptism of John, was it from heaven or of men?
LUK.20.5	And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven, he will say, Why then did ye not believe him?
LUK.20.6	But and if we say, Of men, all the people will stone us; for they are certain that John was a prophet.
LUK.20.7	And they answered that they knew not from where.
LUK.20.8	Then Jesus said unto them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.
LUK.20.9	And he began to speak this parable to the people: A certain man planted a vineyard and let it out to husbandmen and went into a far country for a long time.
LUK.20.10	And at the season he sent a slave to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard, but the husbandmen beat him and sent him away empty.
LUK.20.11	And again he sent another slave, and they beat him also and treated him shamefully and sent him away empty.
LUK.20.12	And again he sent a third, and they wounded him also and cast him out.
LUK.20.13	Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; it may be they will reverence him when they see him.
LUK.20.14	But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, let us kill him that the inheritance may be ours.
LUK.20.15	So they cast him out of the vineyard and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them?
LUK.20.16	He shall come and destroy these husbandmen and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, May it not be!
LUK.20.17	But he beheld them and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?
LUK.20.18	Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
LUK.20.19	And the princes of the priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him, for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them; but they feared the people.
LUK.20.20	And they watched him and sent forth spies who feigned themselves just men that they might take hold of him as he was speaking, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor.
LUK.20.21	And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither dost thou accept the person of any, but teachest the way of God with truth;
LUK.20.22	Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto Caesar or no?
LUK.20.23	But he, perceiving their craftiness, said unto them, Why tempt ye me?
LUK.20.24	Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have? They answered and said, Caesar’s.
LUK.20.25	And he said unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s and unto God the things which are God’s.
LUK.20.26	And they could not take hold of his words before the people, and they marvelled at his answer and were silent.
LUK.20.27	Then certain of the Sadducees came, who deny that there is any resurrection, and they asked him,
LUK.20.28	saying, Master, Moses wrote unto us, If any man’s brother dies, having a wife, and he dies without children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.
LUK.20.29	There were therefore seven brethren, and the first took a wife and died without children.
LUK.20.30	And the second took her to wife, and he died childless.
LUK.20.31	And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also, and they left no children and died.
LUK.20.32	Last of all the woman died also.
LUK.20.33	Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be? for seven had her to wife.
LUK.20.34	And Jesus answering said unto them, The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,
LUK.20.35	but those who are accounted worthy to obtain that age and the resurrection from the dead neither marry, nor are given in marriage;
LUK.20.36	for neither can they die any more, for they are equal unto the angels and are the sons of God, being the sons of the resurrection.
LUK.20.37	Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed this at the bush when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.
LUK.20.38	For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for all live unto him.
LUK.20.39	Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.
LUK.20.40	And after that they dared not ask him any question at all.
LUK.20.41	And he said unto them, How do they say that the Christ is David’s son?
LUK.20.42	And David himself says in the book of Psalms, The 
LUK.20.43	until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
LUK.20.44	David therefore calls him Lord; how is he then his son?
LUK.20.45	Then in the audience of all the people, he said unto his disciples,
LUK.20.46	Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes and love greetings in the markets and the first seats in the synagogues and the first places at suppers;
LUK.20.47	who devour the houses of the widows and for a pretext make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.
LUK.21.1	And he looked up and saw the rich casting their gifts into the treasury.
LUK.21.2	And he saw also a certain poor widow casting two mites in there.
LUK.21.3	And he said, Of a truth I say unto you that this poor widow has cast in more than they all;
LUK.21.4	for all these have of their abundance cast in unto the offerings of God, but she out of her poverty has cast in all the living that she had.
LUK.21.5	And as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with goodly stones and gifts, he said,
LUK.21.6	As for these things which ye behold, the days will come in which there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down.
LUK.21.7	And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall begin to come to pass?
LUK.21.8	Then he said, Take heed that ye not be deceived, for many shall come in my name, saying, I am; and the time draws near; therefore, go ye not after them.
LUK.21.9	But when ye shall hear of wars and seditions, be not terrified; for these things must first come to pass, but the end is not yet.
LUK.21.10	Then he said unto them, Gentiles shall rise against Gentiles, and kingdom against kingdom;
LUK.21.11	and there shall be great earthquakes in different places and famines and pestilences, and there shall be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.
LUK.21.12	But before all these, they shall lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons, being brought before kings and governors for my name’s sake.
LUK.21.13	And it shall turn out to you for a testimony.
LUK.21.14	Settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer;
LUK.21.15	for I will give you a mouth and wisdom which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
LUK.21.16	And ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolk and friends, and some of you they shall cause to be put to death.
LUK.21.17	And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake.
LUK.21.18	But not a hair of your head shall perish.
LUK.21.19	In your patience ye shall possess your souls.
LUK.21.20	And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is near.
LUK.21.21	Then let those who are in Judaea flee to the mountains, and let those who are in the midst of it depart out, and let not those that are in the country enter thereinto.
LUK.21.22	For these are days of vengeance, that all things which are written may be fulfilled.
LUK.21.23	But woe unto those that are with child and to those that give suck in those days! For there shall be great distress in the land and wrath upon this people.
LUK.21.24	And they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations, and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.
LUK.21.25	Then there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars, and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;
LUK.21.26	men’s hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.
LUK.21.27	And then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
LUK.21.28	And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption draws near.
LUK.21.29	And he spoke unto them a parable: Behold the fig tree and all the trees;
LUK.21.30	when they now shoot forth, ye see and know of your own selves that summer is now near at hand.
LUK.21.31	So likewise ye, when ye see these things come to pass, know ye that the kingdom of God is near at hand.
LUK.21.32	Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass away until all is fulfilled.
LUK.21.33	The heaven and the earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.
LUK.21.34	And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with excess and drunkenness and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.
LUK.21.35	For as a snare it shall come on all those that dwell on the face of the whole earth.
LUK.21.36	Watch ye therefore and pray always that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and to stand before the Son of man.
LUK.21.37	And in the daytime he was teaching in the temple, and at night he went out and abode in the mount that is called the mount of Olives.
LUK.21.38	And all the people came unto him early in the morning to hear him in the temple.
LUK.22.1	Now the feast of unleavened bread drew near, which is called the Passover.
LUK.22.2	And the princes of the priests and scribes sought how they might kill him, but they feared the people.
LUK.22.3	Then Satan entered into Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.
LUK.22.4	And he went and spoke with the princes of the priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them.
LUK.22.5	And they were glad and covenanted to give him money.
LUK.22.6	And he promised and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude.
LUK.22.7	Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover lamb must be killed.
LUK.22.8	And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover lamb that we may eat.
LUK.22.9	And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare?
LUK.22.10	And he said unto them, Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there ye shall find a man bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he enters in.
LUK.22.11	And ye shall say unto the husband of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber where I shall eat the passover lamb with my disciples?
LUK.22.12	And he shall show you a large upper room furnished; there make ready.
LUK.22.13	And they went and found as he had said unto them; and they made ready the passover lamb.
LUK.22.14	And when the hour was come, he sat down at the table, and the twelve apostles with him.
LUK.22.15	And he said unto them, With desire I have greatly desired to eat this passover lamb with you before I suffer;
LUK.22.16	for I say unto you, I will not eat any more thereof until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.
LUK.22.17	And taking the cup, having given thanks, he said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves,
LUK.22.18	for I say unto you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God shall come.
LUK.22.19	And taking bread, having given thanks, he broke it and gave unto them, saying, This is my body which is given for you; do this in remembrance of me.
LUK.22.20	Likewise also he took and gave them the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.
LUK.22.21	But with all this, behold, the hand of him that betrays me is with me on the table.
LUK.22.22	And truly the Son of man goes as it was determined; but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed!
LUK.22.23	And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing.
LUK.22.24	And there was also a contention among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.
LUK.22.25	Then he said unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and those that exercise authority upon them are called well-doers.
LUK.22.26	But ye shall not be so, but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is prince, as he that doth serve.
LUK.22.27	For who is greater, he that sits at the table or he that serves? Is it not he that sits at the table? But I am among you as he that serves.
LUK.22.28	But ye are those who have continued with me in my temptations.
LUK.22.29	And I appoint unto you a kingdom as my Father has appointed unto me;
LUK.22.30	that ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
LUK.22.31	And the Lord said, Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat;
LUK.22.32	but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not; and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren.
LUK.22.33	And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison and to death.
LUK.22.34	And he said, I tell thee, Peter, thou shalt deny three times that thou knowest me before the cock shall crow this day.
LUK.22.35	And he said unto them, When I sent you without purse and provision bag and shoes, lacked ye anything? And they said, Nothing.
LUK.22.36	Then he said unto them, But now, he that has a purse, let him take it and likewise his provision bag; and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment and buy one.
LUK.22.37	For I say unto you that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors; for the things written concerning me have a fulfillment.
LUK.22.38	Then they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, It is enough.
LUK.22.39	And he came out and went as he was wont to the mount of Olives, and his disciples also followed him.
LUK.22.40	And when he was at the place, he said unto them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.
LUK.22.41	And he withdrew from them about a stone’s cast and kneeled down and prayed,
LUK.22.42	saying, Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.
LUK.22.43	And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him.
LUK.22.44	And being in agony, he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.
LUK.22.45	And when he rose up from prayer and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow
LUK.22.46	and said unto them, Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation.
LUK.22.47	And while he yet spoke, behold a multitude, and he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him.
LUK.22.48	But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?
LUK.22.49	When those who were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?
LUK.22.50	And one of them smote the slave of the prince of the priests and cut off his right ear.
LUK.22.51	And Jesus answered and said, Suffer ye thus far. And he touched his ear and healed him.
LUK.22.52	Then Jesus said unto the princes of the priests and captains of the temple and the elders, who were come to him, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves?
LUK.22.53	When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me; but this is your hour, and the power of darkness.
LUK.22.54	Then they took him and led him and brought him into the house of the prince of the priests. And Peter followed afar off.
LUK.22.55	And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall and were set down together, Peter sat down among them.
LUK.22.56	But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire and earnestly looked upon him and said, This man was also with him.
LUK.22.57	And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not.
LUK.22.58	And after a little while another saw him and said, Thou art also of them. And Peter said, Man, I am not.
LUK.22.59	And about the space of one hour after, another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him, for he is a Galilaean.
LUK.22.60	And Peter said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately while he yet spoke, the cock crew.
LUK.22.61	Then the Lord turned and looked upon Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord how he had said unto him, Before the cock crows, thou shalt deny me three times.
LUK.22.62	And Peter went out and wept bitterly.
LUK.22.63	And the men that held Jesus mocked him and smote him.
LUK.22.64	And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee?
LUK.22.65	And they spoke many other things blasphemously against him.
LUK.22.66	And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the princes of the priests and the scribes came together and led him into their council, saying,
LUK.22.67	Art thou the Christ? tell us. And he said unto them, If I tell you, ye will not believe;
LUK.22.68	and if I also ask you, ye will not answer me nor let me go;
LUK.22.69	but from now on the Son of man shall sit on the right hand of the power of God.
LUK.22.70	Then they all said, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, Ye say that I AM.
LUK.22.71	And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.
LUK.23.1	And the whole multitude of them arose and led him unto Pilate.
LUK.23.2	And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
LUK.23.3	Then Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.
LUK.23.4	Then said Pilate to the princes of the priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.
LUK.23.5	And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to this place.
LUK.23.6	When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
LUK.23.7	And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
LUK.23.8	And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad, for he was desirous to see him of a long season because he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to see some sign done by him.
LUK.23.9	Then he questioned with him in many words, but he answered him nothing.
LUK.23.10	And the princes of the priests and the scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
LUK.23.11	And Herod with his court despised him and mocked him and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe and sent him again to Pilate.
LUK.23.12	And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together, for before they were at enmity between themselves.
LUK.23.13	Then Pilate, calling together the princes of the priests and the rulers and the people,
LUK.23.14	said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverts the people; and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things of which ye accuse him;
LUK.23.15	no, nor yet Herod, for I sent you to him; and, behold, he has done nothing worthy of death.
LUK.23.16	I will therefore chastise him and release him.
LUK.23.17	(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
LUK.23.18	And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas
LUK.23.19	(who for a certain sedition made in the city and for murder was cast into prison).
LUK.23.20	Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.
LUK.23.21	But they cried, saying, crucify him, crucify him. {Gr. stauroo – hang him on a stake}
LUK.23.22	And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil has he done? I have found no cause of death in him; I will therefore chastise him and let him go.
LUK.23.23	And they insisted with loud voices, asking that he be crucified. And the voices of them and of the princes of the priests prevailed.
LUK.23.24	And Pilate gave sentence that it should be according to their request.
LUK.23.25	And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
LUK.23.26	And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross {Gr. stauros – stake}, that he might bear it after Jesus.
LUK.23.27	And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.
LUK.23.28	But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
LUK.23.29	For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren and the wombs that never bare and the breasts which never gave suck.
LUK.23.30	Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
LUK.23.31	For if they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
LUK.23.32	And there were also two others, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
LUK.23.33	And when they were come to the place, which is called of the Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
LUK.23.34	Then Jesus said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment and cast lots.
LUK.23.35	And the people stood beholding. And the princes also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Christ, the chosen of God.
LUK.23.36	And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar
LUK.23.37	and saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.
LUK.23.38	And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek and Latin and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
LUK.23.39	And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou art the Christ, save thyself and us.
LUK.23.40	But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
LUK.23.41	And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds; but this man has done nothing amiss.
LUK.23.42	And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
LUK.23.43	And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, Today shalt thou be with me in paradise.
LUK.23.44	And when it was about the sixth hour, there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
LUK.23.45	And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
LUK.23.46	Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit; and having said thus, he gave up the spirit.
LUK.23.47	Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
LUK.23.48	And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, returned smiting their breasts.
LUK.23.49	And all his acquaintance and the women that had followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
LUK.23.50	And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a senator; and he was a good man and just
LUK.23.51	(the same had not consented in the counsel nor in their deeds); he was of Arimathaea, a city of Judea, who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
LUK.23.52	This man went unto Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
LUK.23.53	And he took it down and wrapped it in linen and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, where no one had ever been placed.
LUK.23.54	And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
LUK.23.55	And the women who had come with him from Galilee also followed after and beheld the sepulchre and how his body was laid.
LUK.23.56	And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
LUK.24.1	Now upon the first of the sabbaths, very early in the morning they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.
LUK.24.2	And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.
LUK.24.3	And they entered in and did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.
LUK.24.4	And it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments;
LUK.24.5	and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead?
LUK.24.6	He is not here, but is risen; remember how he spoke unto you when he was yet in Galilee,
LUK.24.7	saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and the third day rise again.
LUK.24.8	Then they remembered his words
LUK.24.9	and returned from the sepulchre and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest.
LUK.24.10	It was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were with them who told these things unto the apostles.
LUK.24.11	And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they did not believe them.
LUK.24.12	But Peter arose and ran unto the sepulchre, and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass.
LUK.24.13	And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was about sixty furlongs from Jerusalem.
LUK.24.14	And they talked together of all these things which had happened.
LUK.24.15	And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near and went together with them.
LUK.24.16	But their eyes were held fast that they should not know him.
LUK.24.17	And he said unto them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad?
LUK.24.18	And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days?
LUK.24.19	Then he said unto them, What things? And they said unto him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,
LUK.24.20	and how the princes of the priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and crucified him.
LUK.24.21	But we were hoping that it was he who should redeem Israel, and beside all this, today is the third day since these things were done.
LUK.24.22	Although also certain women of our company made us astonished, who before daybreak were at the sepulchre;
LUK.24.23	and when they did not find his body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.
LUK.24.24	And certain of those who were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said; but they did not see him.
LUK.24.25	Then he said unto them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken;
LUK.24.26	ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter (like this) into his glory?
LUK.24.27	And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded this unto them in all the scriptures concerning himself.
LUK.24.28	And they drew near unto the village where they went, and he made as though he would have gone further.
LUK.24.29	But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.
LUK.24.30	And it came to pass as he sat at the table with them, he took bread and blessed it and broke and gave to them.
LUK.24.31	And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.
LUK.24.32	And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us while he talked with us in the way and while he opened to us the scriptures?
LUK.24.33	And they rose up the same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven gathered together and those that were with them,
LUK.24.34	saying, The Lord is risen indeed and has appeared to Simon.
LUK.24.35	And they told what things were done in the way and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.
LUK.24.36	And as they spoke these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them and said unto them, Peace be unto you.
LUK.24.37	But they were terrified and frightened, and supposed that they were seeing a spirit.
LUK.24.38	And he said unto them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?
LUK.24.39	Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
LUK.24.40	And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.
LUK.24.41	And as they were not believing him yet for joy and wondering, he said unto them, Have ye here any food?
LUK.24.42	So they gave him a piece of a broiled fish and of a honeycomb.
LUK.24.43	And he took it and ate before them.
LUK.24.44	And he said unto them, These are the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the law of Moses and in the prophets and in the psalms, concerning me.
LUK.24.45	Then he opened their understanding that they might understand the scriptures
LUK.24.46	and said unto them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day;
LUK.24.47	and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning from Jerusalem.
LUK.24.48	And ye are witnesses of these things.
LUK.24.49	And, behold, I shall send the promise of my Father upon you, but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye are endued with power from on high.
LUK.24.50	And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands and blessed them.
LUK.24.51	And it came to pass while he blessed them, he was parted from them and carried up into heaven.
LUK.24.52	And they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy
LUK.24.53	and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with the God, and the Word was God.
JHN.1.2	The same was in the beginning with the God.
JHN.1.3	All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.
JHN.1.4	In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
JHN.1.5	And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness apprehended it not.
JHN.1.6	There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
JHN.1.7	The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
JHN.1.8	He was not the Light, but was sent to bear witness of the Light.
JHN.1.9	That Word was the true Light, which lightens every man that comes into this world.
JHN.1.10	He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
JHN.1.11	He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
JHN.1.12	But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on his name,
JHN.1.13	who are not born of blood, nor of the will of flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.
JHN.1.14	And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father), full of grace and truth.
JHN.1.15	John bore witness of him and cried, saying, This is he of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for he was before me.
JHN.1.16	And of his fullness we have all received, and grace for grace.
JHN.1.17	For the law was given through Moses, but the grace and the truth of God came through Jesus, the Christ.
JHN.1.18	No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.
JHN.1.19	And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
JHN.1.20	And he confessed and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Christ.
JHN.1.21	And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he said, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.
JHN.1.22	Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to those that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
JHN.1.23	He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Isaiah.
JHN.1.24	And those who were sent were of the Pharisees.
JHN.1.25	And they asked him and said unto him, Why dost thou baptize then if thou art not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?
JHN.1.26	John answered them, saying, I baptize with water, but there stands one among you, whom ye know not;
JHN.1.27	he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
JHN.1.28	These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing.
JHN.1.29	The next day John saw Jesus coming unto him and said, Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world.
JHN.1.30	This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who is preferred before me, for he was before me.
JHN.1.31	And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
JHN.1.32	And John gave testimony, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
JHN.1.33	And I knew him not; but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding on him, the same is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.
JHN.1.34	And I have seen and have given testimony that this is the Son of God.
JHN.1.35	And again the next day John stood, and two of his disciples,
JHN.1.36	and looking upon Jesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!
JHN.1.37	And the two disciples heard him speak and followed Jesus.
JHN.1.38	Then Jesus turned and saw them following and said unto them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Master), where dwellest thou?
JHN.1.39	He said unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he dwelt and abode with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.
JHN.1.40	One of the two who heard John speak and followed him was Andrew, brother of Simon Peter.
JHN.1.41	He first found his own brother Simon and said unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.
JHN.1.42	And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of Jonah: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
JHN.1.43	The day following Jesus desired to go forth into Galilee and found Philip and said unto him, Follow me.
JHN.1.44	Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
JHN.1.45	Philip found Nathanael and said unto him, We have found him of whom Moses in the law and the prophets wrote: Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
JHN.1.46	And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip said unto him, Come and see.
JHN.1.47	Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him and said of him, Behold a true Israelite, in whom is no guile!
JHN.1.48	Nathanael said unto him, From where dost thou know me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
JHN.1.49	Nathanael answered and said unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art the King of Israel.
JHN.1.50	Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.
JHN.1.51	And he said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see the heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.
JHN.2.1	And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,
JHN.2.2	and Jesus and his disciples were also called to the marriage.
JHN.2.3	And being short of wine, the mother of Jesus said unto him, They have no wine.
JHN.2.4	Jesus said unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? My hour is not yet come.
JHN.2.5	His mother said unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
JHN.2.6	And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
JHN.2.7	Jesus said unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
JHN.2.8	And he said unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the butler. And they bore it.
JHN.2.9	When the butler had tasted the water that was made wine and knew not where it was from (but the servants who drew the water knew), the butler called the bridegroom
JHN.2.10	and said unto him, Every man at the beginning sets forth the good wine, and when they are well satisfied, then that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
JHN.2.11	This beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee and manifested forth his glory, and his disciples believed on him.
JHN.2.12	After this he went down to Capernaum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples, and they continued there not many days.
JHN.2.13	And passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem
JHN.2.14	and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers seated;
JHN.2.15	and when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changers’ money and overthrew the tables
JHN.2.16	and said unto those that sold the doves, Take these things away from here; do not make my Father’s house a house of merchandise.
JHN.2.17	Then his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house has consumed me.
JHN.2.18	Then the Jews answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered and said unto them, Dissolve this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
JHN.2.20	Then said the Jews, This temple was forty-six years in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?
JHN.2.21	But he spoke of the temple of his body.
JHN.2.22	Therefore when he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had said.
JHN.2.23	Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, seeing the signs which he did.
JHN.2.24	But Jesus did not trust himself unto them because he knew all men
JHN.2.25	and needed not that any man should give testimony, for he knew what was in man.
JHN.3.1	There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a prince of the Jews;
JHN.3.2	the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no one can do these signs that thou doest unless God is with him.
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a person be born again from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus said unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter the second time into his mother’s womb and be born?
JHN.3.5	Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Unless a man is born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
JHN.3.6	That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
JHN.3.7	Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again from above.
JHN.3.8	The wind blows where it desires, and thou hearest the sound of it, but canst not tell from where it comes or where it goes; so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can this be done?
JHN.3.10	Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a teacher of Israel and knowest not this?
JHN.3.11	Verily, verily, I say unto thee that we speak what we know and testify that which we have seen, and ye do not receive our witness.
JHN.3.12	If I have told you earthly things and ye do not believe, how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things?
JHN.3.13	And no one has ascended up to the heaven but he that came down from the heaven, even the Son of man, who is in the heaven.
JHN.3.14	And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up,
JHN.3.15	that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
JHN.3.16	For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.
JHN.3.17	For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.
JHN.3.18	He that believes on him is not condemned, but he that does not believe is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
JHN.3.19	And this is the condemnation, that the light is come into the world, and men loved darkness more than the light because their deeds were evil.
JHN.3.20	For every one that does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
JHN.3.21	But he that does truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
JHN.3.22	After these things Jesus and his disciples came into the land of Judaea, and he tarried there with them and baptized.
JHN.3.23	And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim because there was much water there, and they came and were baptized.
JHN.3.24	For John was not yet cast into prison.
JHN.3.25	Then there arose a question between the disciples of John and the Jews about purifying.
JHN.3.26	And they came unto John and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan of whom thou gave witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.
JHN.3.27	John answered and said, A man can receive nothing except it is given him from the heaven.
JHN.3.28	Ye yourselves are my witnesses that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him.
JHN.3.29	He that has the bride is the bridegroom, but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom’s voice; this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
JHN.3.30	It is expedient unto him to increase, but unto me, to decrease.
JHN.3.31	He that comes from above is above all; he that is of the earth is earthly and speaks earthly things: he that comes from heaven is above all.
JHN.3.32	And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies; and no one receives his testimony.
JHN.3.33	He that has received his testimony has set to his seal that God is true.
JHN.3.34	For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God does not give the Spirit by measure unto him.
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
JHN.3.36	He that believes in the Son has eternal life, and he that does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.
JHN.4.1	When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John
JHN.4.2	(though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),
JHN.4.3	he left Judaea and departed again into Galilee.
JHN.4.4	And it was necessary that he go through Samaria.
JHN.4.5	Then he came to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
JHN.4.6	Now Jacob’s well was there. Jesus, therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well; and it was about the sixth hour.
JHN.4.7	There came a woman of Samaria to draw water; Jesus said unto her, Give me to drink.
JHN.4.8	(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy food.)
JHN.4.9	Then said the Samaritan woman unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
JHN.4.10	Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
JHN.4.11	The woman said unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; from where then hast thou that living water?
JHN.4.12	Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank thereof himself, and his sons and his cattle?
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinks of this water shall thirst again,
JHN.4.14	but whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst, but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.
JHN.4.15	The woman said unto him, Lord, give me this water, that I not thirst, neither come here to draw.
JHN.4.16	Jesus said unto her, Go, call thy husband and come here.
JHN.4.17	The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband;
JHN.4.18	for thou hast had five husbands, and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband; this hast thou said with truth.
JHN.4.19	The woman said unto him, Lord, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
JHN.4.20	Our fathers worshipped in this mountain, and ye say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.
JHN.4.21	Jesus said unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes when neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall ye worship the Father.
JHN.4.22	Ye worship what ye know not; we worship what we know, for saving health is of the Jews.
JHN.4.23	But the hour comes, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for the Father seeks such to worship him.
JHN.4.24	God is a Spirit and those that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
JHN.4.25	The woman said unto him, I know that the Messiah is to come, who is called the Christ; when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.
JHN.4.26	Jesus said unto her, I AM that speak unto thee.
JHN.4.27	And upon this came his disciples and marvelled that he talked with that woman; yet no one said, What askest thou? or, What talkest thou with her?
JHN.4.28	The woman then left her waterpot and went into the city and said to those men,
JHN.4.29	Come, see a man who told me all that I have done; is perchance this the Christ?
JHN.4.30	Then they went out of the city and came unto him.
JHN.4.31	In the meanwhile his disciples entreated him, saying, Rabbi, eat.
JHN.4.32	But he said unto them, I have a food to eat that ye know not of.
JHN.4.33	Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has anyone brought him anything to eat?
JHN.4.34	Jesus said unto them, My food is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work.
JHN.4.35	Do ye not say, There are yet four months and then comes harvest? Behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes and look on the fields, for they are white already to harvest.
JHN.4.36	And he that reaps receives wages and gathers fruit unto eternal life, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.
JHN.4.37	And herein is that saying true, One sows and another reaps.
JHN.4.38	I have sent you to reap that upon which ye bestowed no labour; others laboured, and ye have entered into their labours.
JHN.4.39	And many of the Samaritans of that city believed in him by the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all that I have done.
JHN.4.40	So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they asked him to abide with them; and he abode there two days.
JHN.4.41	And many more believed by his own word
JHN.4.42	and said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speech; for we have heard him ourselves and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
JHN.4.43	Now after two days he departed from that place and went into Galilee.
JHN.4.44	For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honour in his own country.
JHN.4.45	Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they had also gone to the feast.
JHN.4.46	So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him and besought him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.
JHN.4.48	Then Jesus said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
JHN.4.49	The nobleman said unto him, Sir, come down before my child dies.
JHN.4.50	Jesus said unto him, Go; thy son lives. And the man believed the word that Jesus spoke unto him, and he went.
JHN.4.51	And as he was now going down, his slaves met him and told him, saying, Thy son lives.
JHN.4.52	Then he enquired of them the hour when he began to get better. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
JHN.4.53	So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son lives; and he believed, and his whole house.
JHN.4.54	This again is the second sign that Jesus did when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
JHN.5.1	After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
JHN.5.2	Now in Jerusalem there is a pool by the sheep gate, which in Hebrew is called, Bethesda, having five porches.
JHN.5.3	In these lay a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
JHN.5.4	For an angel went down at a certain time into the pool and troubled the water; whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatever disease he had.
JHN.5.5	And a certain man was there who had an infirmity thirty-eight years.
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he said unto him, Dost thou desire to be made whole?
JHN.5.7	The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool, but while I am coming, another steps down before me.
JHN.5.8	Jesus said unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
JHN.5.9	And immediately the man was made whole and took up his bed and walked, and on that day was the sabbath.
JHN.5.10	The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day; it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
JHN.5.11	He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed and walk.
JHN.5.12	Then they asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up thy bed and walk?
JHN.5.13	And he that was healed did not know who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
JHN.5.14	Afterward Jesus found him in the temple and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole; sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
JHN.5.15	The man departed and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.
JHN.5.16	And for this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus and sought to kill him: because he had done these things on a sabbath.
JHN.5.17	But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now, and I work.
JHN.5.18	Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.
JHN.5.19	Then Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the Father do; for all that he does, this also the Son does together with him.
JHN.5.20	For the Father loves the Son and shows him all the things that he does, and he will show him greater works than these that ye may marvel.
JHN.5.21	For as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life; even so the Son gives life unto whom he will.
JHN.5.22	For the Father judges no man but has committed all judgment unto the Son
JHN.5.23	that everyone should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that does not honour the Son does not honour the Father who has sent him.
JHN.5.24	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that hears my word and believes him that sent me has eternal life and shall not come into judgment but has passed from death unto life.
JHN.5.25	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour shall come, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.
JHN.5.26	For as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son to have life in himself
JHN.5.27	and has also given him power and authority to execute judgment because he is the Son of man.
JHN.5.28	Marvel not at this, for an hour shall come when all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
JHN.5.29	and those that have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life; but those that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.
JHN.5.30	I can of my own self do nothing; as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who has sent me.
JHN.5.31	If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
JHN.5.32	There is another that bears witness of me, and I know that the witness which he witnesses of me is true.
JHN.5.33	Ye sent unto John, and he bore witness unto the truth.
JHN.5.34	But I receive not testimony from man, but I say these things that ye might be saved.
JHN.5.35	He was a burning and a shining light, and ye were willing to rejoice for one hour in his light.
JHN.5.36	But I have greater testimony than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me that the Father has sent me.
JHN.5.37	And the Father himself, who has sent me, has borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his appearance.
JHN.5.38	And ye do not have his word abiding in you; for whom he has sent, him ye do not believe.
JHN.5.39	Search the scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are those who testify of me.
JHN.5.40	And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
JHN.5.41	I do not receive glory from men.
JHN.5.42	But I know you that ye have not the love of God in you.
JHN.5.43	I have come in my Father’s name, and ye receive me not; if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
JHN.5.44	How can ye believe, who take glory one from another, and seek not the glory that comes only from God?
JHN.5.45	Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.
JHN.5.46	For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me, for he wrote of me.
JHN.5.47	But if ye do not believe his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
JHN.6.1	After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.
JHN.6.2	And a great multitude followed him because they saw his signs which he did on the sick.
JHN.6.3	And Jesus went up into a mountain, and he sat there with his disciples.
JHN.6.4	And the passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
JHN.6.5	Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him; he said unto Philip, From where shall we buy bread that these may eat?
JHN.6.6	But he said this to prove him, for he knew what he would do.
JHN.6.7	Philip answered him, Two hundred denarius of bread is not sufficient for them, that each one of them may take a little.
JHN.6.8	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said unto him,
JHN.6.9	There is a lad here, who has five barley loaves and two small fishes, but what are they among so many?
JHN.6.10	Then Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five thousand.
JHN.6.11	And Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to those that were sitting down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they desired.
JHN.6.12	When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost.
JHN.6.13	Therefore they gathered them together and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves which were left over from those that had eaten.
JHN.6.14	Then those men, as they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth the prophet that was to come into the world.
JHN.6.15	Jesus therefore knowing that they would come and take him by force to make him king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.
JHN.6.16	And when evening was come, his disciples went down unto the sea
JHN.6.17	and entered into a ship and were crossing the sea toward Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus had not come to them.
JHN.6.18	And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
JHN.6.19	So when they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they saw Jesus walking upon the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship, and they were afraid.
JHN.6.20	But he said unto them, I AM; be not afraid.
JHN.6.21	Then they willingly received him into the ship, and immediately the ship was at the land where they went.
JHN.6.22	The day following when the multitude which was on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except the one in which his disciples had entered and that Jesus had not gone with his disciples into the boat, but that his disciples had gone away alone
JHN.6.23	(but other boats came from Tiberias near unto the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks);
JHN.6.24	when the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also entered into the boats and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
JHN.6.25	And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they said unto him, Rabbi, when didst thou come here?
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye have seen the signs, but because ye ate of the loaves and were filled.
JHN.6.27	Labour not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of man shall give unto you, for him has God the Father sealed.
JHN.6.28	Then they said unto him, What shall we do that we might work the works of God?
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe in him whom he has sent.
JHN.6.30	They said therefore unto him, What sign showest thou then that we may see and believe thee? what dost thou work?
JHN.6.31	Our fathers ate manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them of the bread from the heaven to eat.
JHN.6.32	Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from the heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from the heaven.
JHN.6.33	For the bread of God is he who descended from heaven and gives life unto the world.
JHN.6.34	Then said they unto him, Lord, always give us this bread.
JHN.6.35	And Jesus said unto them, I AM the bread of life; he that comes to me shall never hunger, and he that believes in me shall never thirst.
JHN.6.36	But I said unto you, That even though ye have seen me, ye do not believe.
JHN.6.37	All that the Father gives me shall come to me, and he that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.
JHN.6.38	For I came down from the heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me.
JHN.6.39	And this is the Father’s will who has sent me, that of all whom he has given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again in the last day.
JHN.6.40	And this is the will of him that sent me, That every one who sees the Son and believes in him may have eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.
JHN.6.41	The Jews then murmured of him because he said, I AM the bread which descended from the heaven.
JHN.6.42	And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How is it then that he says, I descended from heaven?
JHN.6.43	Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among yourselves.
JHN.6.44	No one can come to me unless the Father who has sent me draws him, and I will raise him up in the last day.
JHN.6.45	It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught of God. Every man therefore that has heard from the Father and has learned comes unto me.
JHN.6.46	Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is of God, he has seen the Father.
JHN.6.47	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believes in me has eternal life.
JHN.6.48	I AM the bread of life.
JHN.6.49	Your fathers ate manna in the wilderness and are dead.
JHN.6.50	This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that anyone may eat of it and not die.
JHN.6.51	I AM the living bread which came down from heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, they shall live for ever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.
JHN.6.52	The Jews therefore contended among themselves, saying, How is he able to give us his flesh to eat?
JHN.6.53	Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Unless ye eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, ye shall have no life in you.
JHN.6.54	Whosoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.
JHN.6.55	For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
JHN.6.56	He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.
JHN.6.57	As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eats me, he shall also live by me.
JHN.6.58	This is the bread which came down from heaven; not as your fathers ate manna and are dead; he that eats of this bread shall live eternally.
JHN.6.59	He said these things in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	Many therefore of his disciples when they had heard this said, This is a hard word; who can hear it?
JHN.6.61	But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said unto them, Does this offend you?
JHN.6.62	What if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before?
JHN.6.63	The Spirit is he that gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words that I have spoken unto you, they are Spirit and they are life.
JHN.6.64	But there are some of you that do not believe. For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were that did not believe and who should betray him.
JHN.6.65	And he said, Therefore I said unto you that no one can come unto me unless it is given unto them of my Father.
JHN.6.66	After this, many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him.
JHN.6.67	Then Jesus said unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
JHN.6.68	Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life.
JHN.6.69	And we believe and know that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
JHN.6.70	Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?
JHN.6.71	He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon, for it was he that should betray him, being one of the twelve.
JHN.7.1	After these things Jesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Judea because the Jews sought to kill him.
JHN.7.2	Now the feast of the Jews, of the tabernacles, was at hand.
JHN.7.3	His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart from this place and go into Judea that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
JHN.7.4	For no one who seeks to be clearly known does anything in secret. If thou doest these things, show thyself to the world.
JHN.7.5	For not even his brethren believed in him.
JHN.7.6	Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come, but your time is always ready.
JHN.7.7	The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.
JHN.7.8	Go ye up unto this feast; I go not up yet unto this feast, for my time is not yet fulfilled.
JHN.7.9	And having said these things unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	But when his brethren were gone up, then he also went up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
JHN.7.11	Then the Jews sought him at the feast and said, Where is he?
JHN.7.12	And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him, for some said, He is a good man; others said, No, but he deceives the people.
JHN.7.13	But no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.
JHN.7.14	Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.
JHN.7.15	And the Jews marvelled, saying, How does this man know letters, having never learned?
JHN.7.16	Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
JHN.7.17	If anyone desires to do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it is of God or whether I speak of myself.
JHN.7.18	He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory, but he that seeks the glory of him that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
JHN.7.19	Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keeps the law? Why do ye go about to kill me?
JHN.7.20	The people answered and said, Thou hast a demon; who goes about to kill thee?
JHN.7.21	Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
JHN.7.22	Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers), and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
JHN.7.23	If a man on the sabbath day receives circumcision without the law of Moses being broken, are ye angry at me because I have made a man entirely whole on the sabbath day?
JHN.7.24	Judge not according to the appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.
JHN.7.25	Then one of those of Jerusalem said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?
JHN.7.26	But, behold, he speaks boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Have the rulers truly understood that this is indeed the Christ?
JHN.7.27	But we know where this man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one shall know where he is from.
JHN.7.28	Then Jesus cried out in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye know me, and ye know from where I come, but I have not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
JHN.7.29	But I know him, for I am from him, and he has sent me.
JHN.7.30	Then they sought to take him, but no one laid hands on him because his hour was not yet come.
JHN.7.31	And many of the people believed in him and said, When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than these which this man has done?
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard the people that murmured such things concerning him, and the princes of the priests and the Pharisees sent officers to take him.
JHN.7.33	Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while I shall be with you, and then I shall go unto him that sent me.
JHN.7.34	Ye shall seek me and shall not find me, and where I shall be, ye shall not be able to come.
JHN.7.35	Then the Jews said among themselves, Where will he go that we shall not find him? Will he go unto the dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?
JHN.7.36	What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me and shall not find me, and where I shall be ye shall not be able to come?
JHN.7.37	In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If any man thirsts, let him come unto me and drink.
JHN.7.38	He that believes in me, as the scripture has said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
JHN.7.39	(But this he spoke concerning the Spirit, which those that believe on him should receive, for the Holy Spirit was not yet given because Jesus was not yet glorified.)
JHN.7.40	Then many of the people, when they heard this word, said, Truly this is the Prophet.
JHN.7.41	Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall the Christ come out of Galilee?
JHN.7.42	Has not the scripture said, That the Christ comes of the seed of David and out of the town of Bethlehem where David was?
JHN.7.43	So there was a division among the people because of him.
JHN.7.44	And some of them would have taken him, but no one laid hands on him.
JHN.7.45	Then the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees came, and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
JHN.7.46	The officers answered, Never has anyone spoken like this man.
JHN.7.47	Then the Pharisees answered them, Are ye also deceived?
JHN.7.48	Have any of the princes or of the Pharisees believed on him?
JHN.7.49	But this people who do not know the law are cursed.
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus said unto them (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them),
JHN.7.51	Does our law judge any man before it hears him and knows what he does?
JHN.7.52	They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search and see, for a prophet has never arisen out of Galilee.
JHN.7.53	And each one went unto his own house.
JHN.8.1	Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
JHN.8.2	And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down and taught them.
JHN.8.3	Then the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery, and when they had set her in the midst,
JHN.8.4	they said unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery in the very act.
JHN.8.5	Now Moses in the law commanded us that such should be stoned, but what sayest thou?
JHN.8.6	This they said, tempting him, that they might be able to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground.
JHN.8.7	So when they continued asking him, he lifted himself up and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him be the first to cast a stone at her.
JHN.8.8	And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.
JHN.8.9	And those who heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest even unto the last; and Jesus was left alone and the woman that had been in the midst.
JHN.8.10	Jesus, lifting himself up and seeing no one but the woman, said unto her, Woman, where are thine accusers? Has no one condemned thee?
JHN.8.11	And she said, No one, Lord. Then Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee; go and sin no more.
JHN.8.12	Then Jesus spoke again unto them, saying, I AM the light of the world; he that follows me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life.
JHN.8.13	Then the Pharisees said unto him, Thou dost bear witness of thyself; thy witness is not true.
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear witness of myself, my witness is true, for I know from where I came and where I go; but ye do not know where I came from and where I go.
JHN.8.15	Ye judge after the flesh, but I judge no one.
JHN.8.16	And yet if I judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.
JHN.8.17	It is also written in your law that the testimony of two men is true.
JHN.8.18	I AM one that bears witness of myself, and the Father that sent me bears witness of me.
JHN.8.19	Then they said unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father; if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.
JHN.8.20	Jesus spoke these words in the treasury as he taught in the temple, and no one laid hands on him, for his hour was not yet come.
JHN.8.21	Then Jesus said again unto them, I am going away, and ye shall seek me, but ye shall die in your sins; where I go, ye shall not be able to come.
JHN.8.22	Then the Jews said, Will he kill himself? because he says, Where I go, ye shall not be able to come.
JHN.8.23	And he said unto them, Ye are from below, I am from above; ye are of this world, I am not of this world.
JHN.8.24	Therefore I said unto you that ye shall die in your sins, for if ye do not believe that I AM, ye shall die in your sins.
JHN.8.25	And said they unto him, Who art thou? Then Jesus said unto them, He that I said unto you also from the beginning.
JHN.8.26	I have many things to say and to judge regarding you, but he that sent me is true; and those things which I have heard of him, I speak in the world.
JHN.8.27	But they did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.
JHN.8.28	Then Jesus said unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then ye shall know that I AM and that I do nothing of myself, but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.
JHN.8.29	And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone, for I always do those things that please him.
JHN.8.30	As he spoke these words, many believed in him.
JHN.8.31	Then Jesus said to those Jews who had believed him, If ye abide in my word, ye shall be my disciples indeed;
JHN.8.32	and ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.
JHN.8.33	They answered him, We are Abraham’s seed, and we have never served anyone; how sayest thou, Ye shall be set free?
JHN.8.34	Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever commits sin is the slave of sin.
JHN.8.35	And the slave does not abide in the house for ever, but the Son abides for ever.
JHN.8.36	If the Son therefore shall set you free, ye shall be free indeed.
JHN.8.37	I know that ye are Abraham’s seed, but ye seek to kill me because my word has no place in you.
JHN.8.38	I speak that which I have seen with my Father, and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.
JHN.8.39	They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus said unto them, If ye were Abraham’s sons, ye would do the works of Abraham.
JHN.8.40	But now ye seek to kill me, a man that has told you the truth, which I have heard of God; Abraham did not do this.
JHN.8.41	Ye do the deeds of your father. Then they said to him, We are not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.
JHN.8.42	Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would surely love me, for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither did I come of myself, but he sent me.
JHN.8.43	Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot hear my word.
JHN.8.44	Ye are of your father the devil, and the desires of your father ye desire to do. He was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks of his own, for he is a liar and the father of it.
JHN.8.45	And because I tell you the truth, ye do not believe me.
JHN.8.46	Which of you reproves me of sin? And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?
JHN.8.47	He that is of God hears God’s words; ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God.
JHN.8.48	Then the Jews answered, and said unto him, Do we not say well that thou art a Samaritan and hast a demon?
JHN.8.49	Jesus answered, I do not have a demon; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.
JHN.8.50	And I seek not my own glory; there is one that seeks it and judges.
JHN.8.51	Verily, verily, I say unto you, If anyone keeps my word, he shall not see death forever.
JHN.8.52	Then the Jews said unto him, Now we know that thou hast a demon. Abraham died and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keeps my word, he shall not taste death forever?
JHN.8.53	Art thou greater than our father Abraham who died? and the prophets died; whom makest thou thyself?
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father that glorifies me, of whom ye say that he is your God;
JHN.8.55	yet ye have not known him, but I know him; and if I should say, I do not know him, I shall be a liar like unto you; but I know him and keep his word.
JHN.8.56	Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad.
JHN.8.57	Then the Jews said unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?
JHN.8.58	Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I AM.
JHN.8.59	Then they took up stones to cast at him, but Jesus concealed himself and went out of the temple, and going through the midst of them, went away.
JHN.9.1	And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man who was blind from his birth.
JHN.9.2	And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned nor his parents, but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
JHN.9.4	It is expedient that I do the works of him that sent me while it is day; the night comes, when no one can work.
JHN.9.5	As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
JHN.9.6	When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay
JHN.9.7	and said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent). Then he went and washed and came back seeing.
JHN.9.8	The neighbours, therefore, and those who before had seen him that he was blind said, Is not this he that sat and begged?
JHN.9.9	Some said, This is he; others said, He is like him; but he said, I am he.
JHN.9.10	Then they said unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
JHN.9.11	He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash; and I went and washed, and I received sight.
JHN.9.12	Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
JHN.9.13	They brought to the Pharisees him that beforehand had been blind.
JHN.9.14	And it was the sabbath day when Jesus had made the clay and had opened his eyes.
JHN.9.15	Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon my eyes, and I washed and do see.
JHN.9.16	Therefore some of the Pharisees said, This man is not of God because he does not keep the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such signs? And there was a division among them.
JHN.9.17	They said unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that has opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
JHN.9.18	But the Jews did not believe concerning him that he had been blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.
JHN.9.19	And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then does he now see?
JHN.9.20	His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son and that he was born blind;
JHN.9.21	but by what means he now sees, we know not; or who has opened his eyes, we know not; he is of age, ask him; he shall speak for himself.
JHN.9.22	These words spoke his parents because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone did confess that he was the Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
JHN.9.23	Therefore his parents said, He is of age, ask him.
JHN.9.24	Then they called again the man that had been blind and said unto him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.
JHN.9.25	He answered and said, Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know; one thing I know, that having been blind, now I see.
JHN.9.26	Then said they to him again, What did he do to thee? How did he open thine eyes?
JHN.9.27	He answered them, I have told you already, and ye have heard; what more would ye hear? Do ye also desire to be his disciples?
JHN.9.28	Then they reviled him and said, Be thou his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
JHN.9.29	We know that God spoke unto Moses; as for this fellow, we do not know where he is from.
JHN.9.30	The man answered and said unto them, Indeed this is a marvellous thing that ye do not know where he is from, and yet he has opened my eyes.
JHN.9.31	Now we know that God does not hear sinners, but if anyone should fear God and do his will, him he will hear.
JHN.9.32	Since the world began it has not been heard of that anyone opened the eyes of one that was born blind.
JHN.9.33	If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.
JHN.9.34	They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.
JHN.9.35	Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and finding him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe in the Son of God?
JHN.9.36	He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe in him?
JHN.9.37	And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast seen him, and it is he that talks with thee.
JHN.9.38	And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him.
JHN.9.39	And Jesus said, For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see might see and that those who see might be blinded.
JHN.9.40	And some of the Pharisees who were with him heard these words and said unto him, Are we blind also?
JHN.9.41	Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin; but now because ye say, We see, therefore your sin abides.
JHN.10.1	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
JHN.10.2	But he that enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
JHN.10.3	To him the porter opens, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
JHN.10.4	And when he puts forth his own sheep, he goes before them; and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
JHN.10.5	And they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.
JHN.10.6	Jesus spoke this parable unto them, but they did not understand what it was that he spoke unto them.
JHN.10.7	Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I AM the door of the sheep.
JHN.10.8	All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep did not hear them.
JHN.10.9	I AM the door; whosoever enters in by me shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture.
JHN.10.10	The thief comes not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy the sheep; I am come that they might have life and that they might have it in abundance.
JHN.10.11	I AM the good shepherd; the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep.
JHN.10.12	But the hireling, who is not a shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf catches them and scatters the sheep.
JHN.10.13	The hireling flees because he is a hireling, and the sheep do not belong to him.
JHN.10.14	I AM the good shepherd, and know my sheep and am known of mine.
JHN.10.15	As the Father knows me, even so I know the Father, and I lay down my soul for the sheep.
JHN.10.16	And I have other sheep which are not of this fold; it is expedient that I bring them also, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and one shepherd.
JHN.10.17	Therefore does my Father love me, because I lay down my soul that I might take it again.
JHN.10.18	No man takes it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment I have received of my Father.
JHN.10.19	There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these words.
JHN.10.20	And many of them said, He has a demon and is beside himself; why do ye hear him?
JHN.10.21	Others said, These are not the words of him that has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?
JHN.10.22	And they celebrated the dedication in Jerusalem, and it was winter.
JHN.10.23	And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon’s porch.
JHN.10.24	Then the Jews came round about him and said unto him, Until when wilt thou hold our soul in suspense? If thou art the Christ, tell us plainly.
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered them, I have told you, and ye do not believe; the works that I do in my Father’s name, they bear witness of me.
JHN.10.26	But ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
JHN.10.27	My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me;
JHN.10.28	and I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall anyone pluck them out of my hand.
JHN.10.29	My Father, who gave them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to pluck them out of my Father’s hand.
JHN.10.30	I and my Father are one.
JHN.10.31	Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
JHN.10.32	Jesus answered them, Many good works have I showed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
JHN.10.33	The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we do not stone thee, but for blasphemy; and because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
JHN.10.35	If he called them gods unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),
JHN.10.36	do ye say of him whom the Father has sanctified and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest, because I said, I am the Son of God?
JHN.10.37	If I do not do the works of my Father, do not believe me.
JHN.10.38	But if I do, though ye do not believe me, believe the works that ye may know and believe that the Father is in me and I in him.
JHN.10.39	Therefore they sought again to take him, but he escaped out of their hand
JHN.10.40	and went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized, and there he abode.
JHN.10.41	And many came unto him and said, John certainly did no sign, but all the things that John spoke of this man were true.
JHN.10.42	And many believed in him there.
JHN.11.1	Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.
JHN.11.2	(It was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
JHN.11.3	Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.
JHN.11.4	When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby.
JHN.11.5	Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
JHN.11.6	When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was.
JHN.11.7	Then after that he said to his disciples, Let us go into Judea again.
JHN.11.8	His disciples said unto him, Rabbi, the Jews of late sought to stone thee, and goest thou there again?
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble because he sees the light of this world.
JHN.11.10	But he who walks in the night stumbles because there is no light in him.
JHN.11.11	Having said that he said unto them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may awake him out of sleep.
JHN.11.12	Then his disciples said, Lord, if he sleeps, he shall be saved.
JHN.11.13	But Jesus had spoken of his death, and they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
JHN.11.14	Then Jesus said unto them plainly, Lazarus has died.
JHN.11.15	And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, in order that ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
JHN.11.16	Then Thomas said, who is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us go also, that we may die with him.
JHN.11.17	Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already.
JHN.11.18	Now Bethany was near unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;
JHN.11.19	and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.
JHN.11.20	Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him; but Mary sat still in the house.
JHN.11.21	Then Martha said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.
JHN.11.22	But I know that even now whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it unto thee.
JHN.11.23	Jesus said unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
JHN.11.24	Martha said unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection in the last day.
JHN.11.25	Jesus said unto her, I AM the resurrection and the life; he that believes in me, though he is dead, yet shall he live;
JHN.11.26	and whosoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Believest thou this?
JHN.11.27	She said unto him, Yes, Lord, I believe that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, who should come into the world.
JHN.11.28	And having said this, she went away and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calls for thee.
JHN.11.29	As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly and came unto him.
JHN.11.30	(Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met him.)
JHN.11.31	Then the Jews who were with her in the house and comforted her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goes unto the grave to weep there.
JHN.11.32	Then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother would not have died.
JHN.11.33	When Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews also weeping who came with her, he became enraged in the Spirit and stirred himself up
JHN.11.34	and said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord, come and see.
JHN.11.35	Jesus wept.
JHN.11.36	Then the Jews said, Behold how he loved him!
JHN.11.37	And some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have also caused that this man should not have died?
JHN.11.38	Jesus therefore, becoming enraged again in himself, came to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
JHN.11.39	Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that had died, said unto him, Lord, by this time he stinks, for he has been dead four days.
JHN.11.40	Jesus said unto her, Did I not say unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou shalt see the glory of God?
JHN.11.41	Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And Jesus, lifting up his eyes, said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.
JHN.11.42	And I knew that thou hearest me always, but because of the people who stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.
JHN.11.43	And having said these things, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.
JHN.11.44	Then he that had been dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes, and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus said unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
JHN.11.45	Then many of the Jews who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did believed on him.
JHN.11.46	But some of them went unto the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
JHN.11.47	Then the high priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, What shall we do? for this man does many signs.
JHN.11.48	If we let him thus alone, everyone will believe on him, and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and the nation.
JHN.11.49	And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all
JHN.11.50	nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation be lost.
JHN.11.51	And this he spoke not of himself; but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;
JHN.11.52	and not for that nation only, but that he should also gather together in one the sons of God that were scattered abroad.
JHN.11.53	So that from that day forth they took counsel together to kill him.
JHN.11.54	Jesus therefore no longer walked openly among the Jews, but went from there unto a country near to the wilderness into a city called Ephraim and there continued with his disciples.
JHN.11.55	And the passover of the Jews was now at hand, and many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover to purify themselves;
JHN.11.56	and they sought for Jesus and spoke among themselves as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast?
JHN.11.57	Now both the high priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that if anyone knew where he was he should show it, that they might take him.
JHN.12.1	Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
JHN.12.2	There they made him a supper; and Martha served, but Lazarus was one of those that sat at the table with him.
JHN.12.3	Then Mary took a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
JHN.12.4	Then said one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, who should betray him,
JHN.12.5	Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarius and given to the poor?
JHN.12.6	This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief and had the bag and would take from what was put therein.
JHN.12.7	Therefore Jesus said, Let her alone; against the day of my burying she has kept this;
JHN.12.8	for the poor ye always have with you, but ye shall not always have me.
JHN.12.9	A great multitude of the Jews therefore knew that he was there; and they came not only for Jesus’ sake, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
JHN.12.10	So the princes of the priests took counsel that they might also put Lazarus to death
JHN.12.11	because by reason of him many of the Jews went away and believed on Jesus.
JHN.12.12	On the next day the multitude that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
JHN.12.13	took branches of palm trees and went forth to meet him and cried, Hosanna; Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.
JHN.12.14	And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat upon it, as it is written,
JHN.12.15	Fear not, daughter of Sion; behold, thy King comes, sitting on an ass’s colt.
JHN.12.16	His disciples did not understand these things at first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of him and that they had done these things unto him.
JHN.12.17	The multitude, therefore, that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead, bore witness.
JHN.12.18	For this cause the multitude also met him, for they had heard that he had done this sign.
JHN.12.19	The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
JHN.12.20	And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast;
JHN.12.21	the same came therefore to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Lord, we desire to see Jesus.
JHN.12.22	Philip came and told Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
JHN.12.23	And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour comes in which the Son of man shall be clarified.
JHN.12.24	Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it brings forth much fruit.
JHN.12.25	He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
JHN.12.26	If anyone serves me, let them follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also; the one that serves me, will my Father honour.
JHN.12.27	Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour, but for this have I come in this hour.
JHN.12.28	Father, clarify thy name. Then there came a voice from the heaven, saying, I have clarified it and will clarify it again.
JHN.12.29	The people, therefore, that were present and heard it, said that it thundered; others said, An angel spoke to him.
JHN.12.30	Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
JHN.12.31	Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
JHN.12.32	And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
JHN.12.33	This he said, signifying what death he should die.
JHN.12.34	The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abides for ever; and how sayest thou, It is expedient that the Son of man be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?
JHN.12.35	Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the Light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you; for he that walks in darkness does not know where he goes.
JHN.12.36	While ye have the Light, believe in the Light that ye may be the sons of light. Jesus spoke these things and departed and hid himself from them.
JHN.12.37	But although he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him,
JHN.12.38	that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Lord, who shall believe our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
JHN.12.39	Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again,
JHN.12.40	He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, that they should not see with their eyes nor understand with their heart and be converted, and I should heal them.
JHN.12.41	Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke of him.
JHN.12.42	Nevertheless, even among the princes many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;
JHN.12.43	for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
JHN.12.44	But Jesus cried and said, He that believes in me, believes not in me, but in him that sent me,
JHN.12.45	and he that sees me sees him that sent me.
JHN.12.46	I am come as a light into the world that whosoever believes in me should not abide in darkness.
JHN.12.47	And if anyone hears my words and believes not, I judge him not, for I came not to judge the world but to save the world.
JHN.12.48	He that rejects me and does not receive my words has one that judges him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
JHN.12.49	For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say and what I should speak.
JHN.12.50	And I know that his commandment is eternal life; whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
JHN.13.1	Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them unto the end.
JHN.13.2	And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray him,
JHN.13.3	Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going to God,
JHN.13.4	arose from the supper and laid aside his garments and took a towel and girded himself.
JHN.13.5	After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.
JHN.13.6	Then he came to Simon Peter, and Peter said unto him, Lord, dost thou wash my feet?
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou dost not understand now, but thou shalt understand afterwards.
JHN.13.8	Peter said unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus answered him, If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me.
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
JHN.13.10	Jesus said to him, He that is washed needs only to wash his feet because he is completely clean, and ye are clean, but not all.
JHN.13.11	For he knew who should betray him; therefore, said he, Ye are not all clean.
JHN.13.12	So after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and had sat down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?
JHN.13.13	Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well, for so I am.
JHN.13.14	If I then, the Lord and the Master, have washed your feet, ye also ought to wash one another’s feet.
JHN.13.15	For I have given you an example that ye should do as I have done to you.
JHN.13.16	Verily, verily, I say unto you, The slave is not greater than his lord; neither is the apostle greater than he that sent him.
JHN.13.17	If ye know these things, ye shall be blessed if ye do them.
JHN.13.18	I speak not of you all; I know whom I have chosen; but that the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eats bread with me has lifted up his heel against me,
JHN.13.19	now I tell you before it is done, so that, when it is come to pass, ye may believe that I AM.
JHN.13.20	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that receives whomsoever I send receives me, and he that receives me receives him that sent me.
JHN.13.21	When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit and testified and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
JHN.13.22	Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he spoke.
JHN.13.23	And one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was seated at the table beside Jesus.
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter therefore beckoned to this one that he should ask him who it was of whom he spoke.
JHN.13.25	He then, reclining on Jesus’ breast, said unto him, Lord, who is it?
JHN.13.26	Jesus answered, He it is to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
JHN.13.27	And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then Jesus said unto him, That which thou shalt do, do it more quickly.
JHN.13.28	Now no one at the table understood for what purpose he spoke this unto him.
JHN.13.29	For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we need for the feast, or that he should give something to the poor.
JHN.13.30	He then having received the sop went immediately out, and it was now night.
JHN.13.31	Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man clarified, and God is clarified in him.
JHN.13.32	If God is clarified in him, God shall also clarify him in himself and shall straightway clarify him.
JHN.13.33	Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall seek me; and as I said unto the Jews, Where I go, ye cannot come, so now I say to you.
JHN.13.34	A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
JHN.13.35	By this shall everyone know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, where goest thou? Jesus answered him, Where I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.
JHN.13.37	Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I will lay down my soul for thy sake.
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy soul for my sake? Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow until thou hast denied me three times.
JHN.14.1	Let not your heart be troubled; ye believe in God, believe also in me.
JHN.14.2	In my Father’s house are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you.
JHN.14.3	And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and take you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.
JHN.14.4	So that ye know where I go, and ye know the way.
JHN.14.5	Thomas said unto him, Lord, we know not where thou goest; how, therefore, can we know the way?
JHN.14.6	Jesus said unto him, I AM the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes unto the Father, but by me.
JHN.14.7	If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also; and from now on ye know him and have seen him.
JHN.14.8	Philip said unto him, Lord, show us the Father, and it will suffice us.
JHN.14.9	Jesus said unto him, Have I been such a long time with you, and yet thou hast not known me, Philip? He that has seen me has seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?
JHN.14.10	Believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in me? The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself; but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.
JHN.14.11	Believe me that I am in the Father and the Father in me, or else believe me for the very works’ sake.
JHN.14.12	Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believes in me, the works that I do he shall do also; and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my Father.
JHN.14.13	And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
JHN.14.14	If ye ask any thing in my name, I will do it.
JHN.14.15	If ye love me, keep my commandments;
JHN.14.16	and I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever,
JHN.14.17	even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive because it does not see him, or know him; but ye know him, for he dwells with you and shall be in you.
JHN.14.18	I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.
JHN.14.19	Yet a little while, and the world shall see me no more, but ye shall see me; because I live, ye shall live also.
JHN.14.20	At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.
JHN.14.21	He that has my commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.
JHN.14.22	Judas, not Iscariot, said unto him, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us and not unto the world?
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered and said unto him, He who loves me will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and dwell with him.
JHN.14.24	He that does not love me does not keep my words, and the word which ye have heard is not mine, but of the Father who sent me.
JHN.14.25	I have spoken these things unto you, being yet present with you.
JHN.14.26	But the Comforter, which is the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all the things that I have said unto you.
JHN.14.27	Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you; not as the world gives, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.
JHN.14.28	Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away and come again unto you. If ye loved me, ye would rejoice because I said, I go unto the Father; for my Father is greater than I.
JHN.14.29	And now I have told you before it comes to pass, that when it is come to pass, ye might believe.
JHN.14.30	Hereafter I will not talk much with you, for the prince of this world comes and has nothing in me.
JHN.14.31	But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go from here.
JHN.15.1	I AM the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.
JHN.15.2	Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he shall take away; and every one that bears fruit, he shall purge that they may bring forth more fruit.
JHN.15.3	Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.
JHN.15.4	Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abides in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me.
JHN.15.5	I AM the vine, ye are the branches: he that abides in me, and I in him, the same brings forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing.
JHN.15.6	He who does not abide in me shall be cast forth as an unsound branch and shall wither, and they are gathered and cast into the fire and are burned.
JHN.15.7	If ye abide in me and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.
JHN.15.8	In this is my Father clarified, in that ye bear much fruit; and in this manner ye shall be my disciples.
JHN.15.9	As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you; abide in my love.
JHN.15.10	If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love, even as I have kept my Father’s commandments and abide in his love.
JHN.15.11	These things I have spoken unto you that my joy may abide in you and that your joy might be fulfilled.
JHN.15.12	This is my commandment, That ye love one another as I have loved you.
JHN.15.13	Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his soul for his friends.
JHN.15.14	Ye are my friends if ye do whatsoever I command you.
JHN.15.15	From now on I do not call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his lord does; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.
JHN.15.16	Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it unto you.
JHN.15.17	This I command you, that ye love one another.
JHN.15.18	If the world hates you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.
JHN.15.19	If ye were of the world, the world would love its own; but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.
JHN.15.20	Remember the word that I said unto you, The slave is not greater than his lord. If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my word, they will keep yours also.
JHN.15.21	But they will do all these things unto you for my name’s sake, because they do not know him that sent me.
JHN.15.22	If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their sin.
JHN.15.23	He that hates me hates my Father also.
JHN.15.24	If I had not done among them works which no other man has done, they would not have sin; but now they have seen them and hate both me and my Father.
JHN.15.25	But this comes to pass that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.
JHN.15.26	But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me;
JHN.15.27	and ye also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning.
JHN.16.1	These things I have spoken unto you that ye should not be offended.
JHN.16.2	They shall put you out of the synagogues, and the hour will even come when whosoever kills you will think that he does God service.
JHN.16.3	And they will do these things unto you because they do not know the Father, nor me.
JHN.16.4	But I have told you these things that when that hour shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And I did not say these things unto you at the beginning because I was with you.
JHN.16.5	But now I go unto him that sent me, and none of you asks me, Where goest thou?
JHN.16.6	But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow has filled your heart.
JHN.16.7	Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away; for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
JHN.16.8	And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment:
JHN.16.9	of sin, because they do not believe in me;
JHN.16.10	of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
JHN.16.11	of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
JHN.16.12	I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
JHN.16.13	Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth, for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak, and he will cause you to know the things which are to come.
JHN.16.14	He shall clarify me, for he shall take of that which is mine and shall cause you to know it.
JHN.16.15	All that the Father has is mine; therefore I said that he shall take of that which is mine and shall cause you to know it.
JHN.16.16	A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.
JHN.16.17	Then some of his disciples said among themselves, What is this that he says unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while, and ye shall see me; and, Because I go to the Father?
JHN.16.18	They said therefore, What is this that he says, A little while? we cannot understand what he says.
JHN.16.19	Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of what I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me; and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?
JHN.16.20	Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, and the world shall rejoice; but even though ye shall be sorrowful, your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
JHN.16.21	The woman, when she is in travail, has pain, because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers the anguish no more, for joy that a man is born into the world.
JHN.16.22	And ye now therefore have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and no one shall take your joy from you.
JHN.16.23	And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give you.
JHN.16.24	Until now ye have asked nothing in my name; ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be fulfilled.
JHN.16.25	I have spoken these things unto you in proverbs, but the hour comes when I shall no longer speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father.
JHN.16.26	In that day ye shall ask in my name, and I do not say unto you that I will ask the Father for you;
JHN.16.27	for the Father himself loves you because ye have loved me and have believed that I came out from God.
JHN.16.28	I came forth from the Father and am come into the world; again, I leave the world and go to the Father.
JHN.16.29	His disciples said unto him, Behold, now thou speakest plainly and speakest no proverb.
JHN.16.30	Now we understand that thou knowest all things and needest not that anyone should ask thee; by this we believe that thou didst come forth from God.
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
JHN.16.32	Behold, the hour comes and is now come, that ye shall be scattered, each one to his own, and shall leave me alone; and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
JHN.16.33	These things I have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation; but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
JHN.17.1	Jesus spoke these words and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said, Father, the hour is come; clarify thy Son, that thy Son may also clarify thee,
JHN.17.2	as thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.
JHN.17.3	And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.
JHN.17.4	I have clarified thee on the earth; I have finished the work which thou didst give me to do.
JHN.17.5	And now, O Father, clarify thou me with thine own self with that clarity which I had with thee before the world was.
JHN.17.6	I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou didst give me out of the world; thine they were, and thou didst give them me; and they have kept thy word.
JHN.17.7	Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.
JHN.17.8	For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.
JHN.17.9	I pray for them; I do not pray for the world, but for those whom thou hast given me; for they are thine.
JHN.17.10	And all my things are thine, and thine are mine; and I have been clarified in them.
JHN.17.11	And now I am no longer in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee. Holy Father, those whom thou hast given me, keep them in thy name, that they may be one, as we are.
JHN.17.12	While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name; those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled.
JHN.17.13	And now I come to thee; and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
JHN.17.14	I have given them thy word, and the world has hated them because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
JHN.17.15	I do not pray that thou should take them out of the world, but that thou should keep them from the evil.
JHN.17.16	They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.
JHN.17.17	Sanctify them in thy truth; thy word is the truth.
JHN.17.18	As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.
JHN.17.19	And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified in the truth.
JHN.17.20	Neither do I pray for these alone, but also for those who shall believe in me through their word;
JHN.17.21	that they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.
JHN.17.22	And the clarity which thou gavest me I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one:
JHN.17.23	I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in one and that the world may know that thou hast sent me and hast loved them as thou hast loved me.
JHN.17.24	Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my clarity, which thou hast given me, for thou hast loved me from before the foundation of the world.
JHN.17.25	O righteous Father, the world has not known thee; but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.
JHN.17.26	And I have manifested unto them thy name and will manifest it still, that the love with which thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.
JHN.18.1	When Jesus had spoken these things, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where there was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples.
JHN.18.2	And Judas also, who betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus gathered there often with his disciples.
JHN.18.3	Judas then, taking a company of soldiers and ministers of the high priests and of the Pharisees, came there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
JHN.18.4	Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?
JHN.18.5	They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus said unto them, I AM. And Judas also, who betrayed him, stood with them.
JHN.18.6	And when he said unto them, I AM, they went backward and fell to the ground.
JHN.18.7	Then he asked them again, Whom seek ye? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth.
JHN.18.8	Jesus answered, I have told you that I AM; if, therefore, ye seek me, let these go away,
JHN.18.9	that the word might be fulfilled, which he spoke, Of those whom thou gavest me I have lost none.
JHN.18.10	Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and smote the high priest’s slave and cut off his right ear. The slave’s name was Malchus.
JHN.18.11	Then Jesus said unto Peter, Put up thy sword into the sheath; the cup which my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?
JHN.18.12	Then the company of soldiers and the tribune and the ministers of the Jews took Jesus and bound him
JHN.18.13	and led him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was the high priest of that year and he sent him bound unto Caiaphas, the high priest.
JHN.18.14	Now Caiaphas was he who had given the counsel to the Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
JHN.18.15	And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple; that disciple was known unto the high priest and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest.
JHN.18.16	But Peter stood at the door without. Then that other disciple, who was known unto the high priest, went out and spoke unto her that kept the door and brought in Peter.
JHN.18.17	Then the damsel that kept the door said unto Peter, Art not thou also one of this man’s disciples? He said, I am not.
JHN.18.18	And the slaves and servants stood there, who had made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves; and Peter stood with them and warmed himself.
JHN.18.19	The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples and of his doctrine.
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogue and in the temple, where all the Jews gather; and I have said nothing in secret.
JHN.18.21	Why dost thou ask me? Ask those who heard me what I have said unto them; behold, they know what I said.
JHN.18.22	And when he had thus spoken, one of the servants who stood by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so?
JHN.18.23	Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil, but if well, why dost thou smite me?
JHN.18.24	Thus Annas sent him bound unto Caiaphas the high priest.
JHN.18.25	And Simon Peter stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it and said, I am not.
JHN.18.26	One of the slaves of the high priest, kinsman of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Did I not see thee in the garden with him?
JHN.18.27	Peter then denied again, and immediately the cock crew.
JHN.18.28	Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment, and it was early; and they themselves did not go into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the passover.
JHN.18.29	Pilate then went out unto them and said, What accusation bring ye against this man?
JHN.18.30	They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee.
JHN.18.31	Then Pilate said unto them, Take him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death;
JHN.18.32	that the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke, signifying what death he should die.
JHN.18.33	Then Pilate entered into the judgment hall again and called Jesus and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
JHN.18.34	Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it unto thee of me?
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me; what hast thou done?
JHN.18.36	Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, then my servants would fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; now, therefore, my kingdom is not from here.
JHN.18.37	Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I AM king. To this end I was born, and for this cause I came into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth hears my voice.
JHN.18.38	Pilate said unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and said unto them, I find no fault at all in him.
JHN.18.39	But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover; will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
JHN.18.40	Then they all cried again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate, therefore, took Jesus and scourged him.
JHN.19.2	And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him
JHN.19.3	and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands.
JHN.19.4	Pilate therefore went forth again and said unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him.
JHN.19.5	Then Jesus came forth, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said unto them, Behold the man!
JHN.19.6	When the princes of the priests and the servants saw him, they cried out, saying, crucify him, crucify him. {Gr. stauroo – hang him on a stake} Pilate said unto them, Take him, and crucify him, for I find no fault in him.
JHN.19.7	The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die because he made himself the Son of God.
JHN.19.8	Therefore when Pilate heard that word, he was the more afraid
JHN.19.9	and went again into the judgment hall and said unto Jesus, Where art thou from? But Jesus gave him no answer.
JHN.19.10	Then Pilate said unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee {Gr. stauroo – hang thee on a stake} and have power to release thee?
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, Thou could have no power at all against me, unless it were given thee from above; therefore he that delivered me unto thee has the greater sin.
JHN.19.12	And from then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not Caesar’s friend; whosoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar.
JHN.19.13	Therefore when Pilate heard that word, he brought Jesus forth and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha.
JHN.19.14	And it was the preparation of the passover and about the sixth hour; then he said unto the Jews, Behold your King!
JHN.19.15	But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. Pilate said unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The high priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.
JHN.19.16	So that then, he delivered him unto them to be crucified. And they took Jesus and led him away.
JHN.19.17	And he, bearing his cross {Gr. stauros – stake}, went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew, Golgotha,
JHN.19.18	where they crucified him and two others with him, one on either side and Jesus in the middle.
JHN.19.19	And Pilate also wrote a title and put it above the cross {Gr. stauros – stake}. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS.
JHN.19.20	And many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near to the city; and it was written in Hebrew and Greek and Latin.
JHN.19.21	Then the high priests of the Jews said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews, but that he said, I AM King of the Jews.
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.
JHN.19.23	Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts (to each soldier a part); and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.
JHN.19.24	They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be; that the scripture might be fulfilled, which says, They parted my garments among them, and for my raiment they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did.
JHN.19.25	Now there stood by the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} of Jesus his mother and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
JHN.19.26	When Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he said unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!
JHN.19.27	Then he said to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.
JHN.19.28	After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.
JHN.19.29	Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar, and they filled a sponge with vinegar and put it upon hyssop and put it to his mouth.
JHN.19.30	When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished, and he bowed his head and gave up the Spirit.
JHN.19.31	The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} on the sabbath day (for that sabbath day was a high day) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away.
JHN.19.32	Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and of the other who were crucified with him.
JHN.19.33	But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already, they did not break his legs,
JHN.19.34	but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith blood and water came out.
JHN.19.35	And he that saw it gives testimony, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he says the truth, that ye also might believe.
JHN.19.36	For these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
JHN.19.37	And again another scripture says, They shall look on him whom they pierced.
JHN.19.38	After these things, Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore and took the body of Jesus.
JHN.19.39	Then Nicodemus came also, who at the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about one hundred pounds.
JHN.19.40	And they took the body of Jesus and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as is the manner of the Jews to bury.
JHN.19.41	Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre, in which no one had yet been laid.
JHN.19.42	Therefore they laid Jesus there because of the Jews’ preparation day, for the sepulchre was near.
JHN.20.1	The first of the sabbaths, Mary Magdalene came early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre and saw the stone taken away from the sepulchre.
JHN.20.2	Then she ran and came to Simon Peter and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not where they have laid him.
JHN.20.3	Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came to the sepulchre.
JHN.20.4	So they both ran together, and the other disciple outran Peter and came first to the sepulchre.
JHN.20.5	And he, stooping down and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying; yet he did not go in.
JHN.20.6	Then came Simon Peter following him and went into the sepulchre and saw the linen clothes lying
JHN.20.7	and the napkin, that had been placed over his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
JHN.20.8	Then that other disciple, who came first to the sepulchre, went in also and he saw and believed.
JHN.20.9	For as yet they did not know the scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.
JHN.20.10	Then the disciples went away again unto their own.
JHN.20.11	But Mary stood outside near the sepulchre weeping, and as she wept, she stooped down and looked into the sepulchre
JHN.20.12	and saw two angels in white sitting, the one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been placed.
JHN.20.13	And they said unto her, Woman, why dost thou weep? She said unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.
JHN.20.14	And when she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there and did not know that it was Jesus.
JHN.20.15	Jesus said unto her, Woman, why dost thou weep? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, said unto him, Lord, if thou didst carry him off, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.
JHN.20.16	Jesus said unto her, Mary! Turning herself around, she said unto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master.
JHN.20.17	Jesus said unto her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God.
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene came giving the news to the disciples, That I have seen the Lord, and he spoke these things unto me.
JHN.20.19	Then the same day at evening, being the first of the sabbaths, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst and said unto them, Peace be unto you.
JHN.20.20	And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.
JHN.20.21	Then Jesus said to them again, Peace be unto you; as my Father has sent me, even so send I you.
JHN.20.22	And when he had said this, he breathed on them and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit;
JHN.20.23	unto those whose sins ye release, they shall be released; and unto those whose sins ye retain, they shall be retained.
JHN.20.24	But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
JHN.20.25	The other disciples, therefore, said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Unless I shall see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails and thrust my hand into his side, I will not believe.
JHN.20.26	And again eight days later, his disciples were within and Thomas with them; then Jesus came, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be unto you.
JHN.20.27	Then he said to Thomas, Reach here thy finger and behold my hands and reach here thy hand and thrust it into my side and be not unbelieving, but faithful.
JHN.20.28	And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
JHN.20.29	Jesus said unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed; blessed are those that have not seen and yet have believed.
JHN.20.30	And Jesus truly did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;
JHN.20.31	but these are written that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing ye might have life in his name.
JHN.21.1	After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias, and he manifested himself in this manner:
JHN.21.2	Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two other of his disciples were together.
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter said unto them, I am going fishing. They said unto him, Let us also go with thee. They went forth and entered into a ship immediately, and that night they caught nothing.
JHN.21.4	But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore, but the disciples did not understand that it was Jesus.
JHN.21.5	Then Jesus said unto them, Children, have ye any food? They answered him, No.
JHN.21.6	And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right hand side of the ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
JHN.21.7	Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said unto Peter, It is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher’s coat unto him (for he was naked) and cast himself into the sea.
JHN.21.8	And the other disciples came in the little ship (for they were not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits), dragging the net with the fishes.
JHN.21.9	As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, and a fish laid thereon, and bread.
JHN.21.10	Jesus said unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now caught.
JHN.21.11	Simon Peter went up and drew the net to land full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty-three; and being so many, yet the net was not broken.
JHN.21.12	Jesus said unto them, Come and dine. And none of the disciples dared to ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.
JHN.21.13	Jesus then came and took the bread and gave them, and the fish likewise.
JHN.21.14	This was now the third time that Jesus manifested himself to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.
JHN.21.15	So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He said unto him, Yes, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him, Feed my lambs.
JHN.21.16	He said to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? He said unto him, Yes, Lord thou knowest that I love thee. He said unto him, Feed my sheep.
JHN.21.17	He said unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus said unto him, Feed my sheep.
JHN.21.18	Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thyself and walk where thou wouldest, but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee and carry thee where thou wouldest not.
JHN.21.19	This he spoke, signifying by what death he should clarify God. And when he had spoken this, he said unto him, Follow me.
JHN.21.20	Then Peter, turning about, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also leaned on his breast at supper, and said, Lord, which is he that betrays thee?
JHN.21.21	Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?
JHN.21.22	Jesus said unto him, If I will that he tarry until I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me.
JHN.21.23	Then this saying went abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die; yet Jesus did not say unto him, He shall not die, but, If I will that he tarry until I come, what is that to thee?
JHN.21.24	This is the disciple who testifies of these things and wrote these things, and we know that his testimony is true.
JHN.21.25	And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they should be written every one, I think that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written. Amen.
ACT.1.1	The former treatise I have made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,
ACT.1.2	until the day in which, having given commandments by the Holy Spirit unto the apostles whom he had chosen, he was received on high;
ACT.1.3	unto whom he also showed himself alive, after he had suffered, by many infallible proofs, appearing unto them for forty days and speaking to them of the kingdom of God;
ACT.1.4	and gathering them together, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, Which, he said, ye have heard of me.
ACT.1.5	For John truly baptized in water, but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.
ACT.1.6	Then those that were come together asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?
ACT.1.7	And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put under his authority only.
ACT.1.8	But ye shall receive the virtue of the Holy Spirit which shall come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
ACT.1.9	And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
ACT.1.10	And while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel,
ACT.1.11	who also said, Ye men of Galilee, what do ye stand gazing at up into heaven? This same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
ACT.1.12	Then they returned unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.
ACT.1.13	And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where Peter and James and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James were.
ACT.1.14	These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women and Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
ACT.1.15	And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples and said (the number of names together were about one hundred and twenty),
ACT.1.16	Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, who was guide to those that took Jesus.
ACT.1.17	For he was numbered with us, and had obtained a lot or inheritance of this ministry.
ACT.1.18	He, therefore, purchased a field with the reward of his iniquity; and hanging himself, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
ACT.1.19	And it was known unto all the dwellers of Jerusalem, in such a manner that the field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood.
ACT.1.20	For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no one dwell therein, and let another take his office.
ACT.1.21	It behooves, therefore, of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
ACT.1.22	beginning from the baptism of John unto that same day that he was received on high from among us, that one must be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.
ACT.1.23	And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
ACT.1.24	And they prayed and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of everyone, show which of these two thou hast chosen,
ACT.1.25	that he may take the lot or inheritance of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas rebelled that he might go to his own place.
ACT.1.26	And they gave forth their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
ACT.2.1	And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.
ACT.2.2	And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
ACT.2.3	And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them.
ACT.2.4	And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
ACT.2.5	(And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.)
ACT.2.6	Now at this sound, the multitude came together and were confounded because each one heard them speak in his own tongue.
ACT.2.7	And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these who speak Galilaeans?
ACT.2.8	And how do we hear each one speak in our own tongue, with which we were brought up?
ACT.2.9	Parthians and Medes and Elamites and the dwellers in Mesopotamia and in Judaea and Cappadocia, in Pontus and Asia,
ACT.2.10	Phrygia and Pamphylia, in Egypt and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,
ACT.2.11	Cretes and Arabians, we hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.
ACT.2.12	And they were all amazed and were in doubt, saying one to another, What does this mean?
ACT.2.13	Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.
ACT.2.14	Then Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea and all ye that dwell in Jerusalem, be this known unto you and hearken to my words;
ACT.2.15	for these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the day.
ACT.2.16	But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel:
ACT.2.17	And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;
ACT.2.18	and for certain on my slaves and on my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy;
ACT.2.19	and I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath: blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke;
ACT.2.20	the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood before that great and notable day of the Lord shall come;
ACT.2.21	and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
ACT.2.22	Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know,
ACT.2.23	him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken and by wicked hands have crucified and slain,
ACT.2.24	whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death because it was not possible for him to be held by it.
ACT.2.25	For David speaks concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved,
ACT.2.26	therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover even my flesh shall rest in hope
ACT.2.27	because thou wilt not leave my soul in Hades, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
ACT.2.28	Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
ACT.2.29	Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
ACT.2.30	Therefore being a prophet and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, he would raise up the Christ to sit on his throne;
ACT.2.31	he, seeing this before, spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul was not left in Hades, neither did his flesh see corruption.
ACT.2.32	This Jesus God has raised up, of whom we all are witnesses.
ACT.2.33	Therefore being raised up by the right hand of God and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which ye now see and hear.
ACT.2.34	For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he saith himself, The 
ACT.2.35	until I make thy foes thy footstool.
ACT.2.36	Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
ACT.2.37	Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?
ACT.2.38	Then Peter said unto them, Repent and be baptized each one of you into the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
ACT.2.39	For the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.
ACT.2.40	And with many other words he testified and exhorted, saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.
ACT.2.41	So that those who gladly received his word were baptized, and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.
ACT.2.42	And they continued steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship and in breaking of bread and in prayers.
ACT.2.43	And fear came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
ACT.2.44	And all that believed were together and had all things common
ACT.2.45	and sold their possessions and property and distributed them to everyone, as each one had need.
ACT.2.46	And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house, they ate their food together with gladness and singleness of heart,
ACT.2.47	praising God and having grace with all the people. And the Lord added to the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} daily such as should be saved.
ACT.3.1	Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.
ACT.3.2	And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms {lit. mercy} of those that entered into the temple,
ACT.3.3	who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked for alms.
ACT.3.4	And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
ACT.3.5	And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of them.
ACT.3.6	Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have I give thee: in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
ACT.3.7	And he took him by the right hand and lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
ACT.3.8	And he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping and praising God.
ACT.3.9	And all the people saw him walking and praising God,
ACT.3.10	and they knew that it was he who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
ACT.3.11	And as the lame man who was healed held onto Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.
ACT.3.12	And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own virtue or godliness we had made this man walk?
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus, whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he had judged to let him go.
ACT.3.14	But ye denied the Holy One and the Just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you
ACT.3.15	and killed the Author of life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
ACT.3.16	And in the faith of his name, unto this man whom ye see and know, has confirmed his name; and the faith which is by him has given this man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
ACT.3.17	And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance ye did it as did also your princes.
ACT.3.18	But God has thus fulfilled those things which he had showed in advance by the mouth of all his prophets, that his Christ should suffer.
ACT.3.19	Repent ye therefore and be converted that your sins may be blotted out, for the times of refreshing of the presence of the Lord are come;
ACT.3.20	who has sent Jesus Christ, who before was preached unto you,
ACT.3.21	whom it is certainly necessary that the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the age began.
ACT.3.22	For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things doing whatever he shall say unto you.
ACT.3.23	And it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.
ACT.3.24	And all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.
ACT.3.25	Ye are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
ACT.3.26	Unto you first, God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, that each one of you might turn from his iniquities.
ACT.4.1	And as they spoke unto the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
ACT.4.2	resentful that they taught the people and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
ACT.4.3	And they laid hands on them and put them in jail unto the next day, for it was now evening.
ACT.4.4	But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men was about five thousand.
ACT.4.5	And it came to pass on the next day that their princes and elders and scribes
ACT.4.6	and Annas, the high priest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest were gathered together at Jerusalem.
ACT.4.7	And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what power or by what name have ye done this?
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them, Ye princes of the people and elders of Israel,
ACT.4.9	if we this day be examined of the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole,
ACT.4.10	be it known unto you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, even by him does this man stand here before you whole.
ACT.4.11	This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner.
ACT.4.12	Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men in which we can be saved.
ACT.4.13	Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled, and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus.
ACT.4.14	And beholding the man who was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
ACT.4.15	But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
ACT.4.16	saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable miracle has been done by them is manifest to all those that dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
ACT.4.17	But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly threaten them that from now on they speak to no man in this name.
ACT.4.18	And they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus.
ACT.4.19	Then Peter and John answered and said unto them, Judge whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God.
ACT.4.20	For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
ACT.4.21	So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way how they might punish them because of the people, for everyone glorified God for that which was done.
ACT.4.22	For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing was shown.
ACT.4.23	And being let go, they went to their own company and reported all that the princes of the priests and the elders had said unto them.
ACT.4.24	And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord and said, Lord, thou art the God, who hast made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them,
ACT.4.25	who (in the Holy Spirit) by the mouth of thy servant David (our father) hast said, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth were present, and the princes were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.
ACT.4.27	For of a truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were gathered together (in this city),
ACT.4.28	to do that which thy hand and thy counsel had determined beforehand must be done.
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, behold their threatenings and grant unto thy slaves that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
ACT.4.30	that thou might stretch forth thine hand so that healings and signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy slave Jesus.
ACT.4.31	And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.
ACT.4.32	And of the multitude of those that had believed was one heart and one soul; no one said that anything he possessed was his own, but they had all things common.
ACT.4.33	And with great power the apostles gave witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
ACT.4.34	Neither was there any among them that lacked, for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the prices of the things that were sold
ACT.4.35	and laid them down at the apostles’ feet; and distribution was made unto each one according to their need.
ACT.4.36	Then Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation), a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus,
ACT.4.37	having land, sold it and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
ACT.5.1	But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession
ACT.5.2	and defrauded of the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles’ feet.
ACT.5.3	But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to defraud of the price of the land?
ACT.5.4	Retaining it, was it not thy own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? Why hast thou conceived this thing in thy heart? Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
ACT.5.5	Then Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and gave up the spirit; and great fear came on all those that heard these things.
ACT.5.6	And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out and buried him.
ACT.5.7	And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what was done, came in.
ACT.5.8	Then Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.
ACT.5.9	Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out.
ACT.5.10	Then she fell down straightway at his feet and yielded up the spirit; and the young men came in and found her dead and, carrying her forth, buried her by her husband.
ACT.5.11	And great fear came upon all the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} and upon as many as heard these things.
ACT.5.12	And by the hands of the apostles many signs and wonders were wrought in the people. (And they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
ACT.5.13	And of the others, no one dared join themself to them, but the people magnified them.
ACT.5.14	And those that believed in the Lord increased in number, multitudes both of men and women.)
ACT.5.15	So much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
ACT.5.16	There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks and those who were tormented with unclean spirits, and they were healed every one.
ACT.5.17	Then the prince of the priests rose up, and all those that were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy
ACT.5.18	and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the common prison.
ACT.5.19	But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth and said,
ACT.5.20	Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.
ACT.5.21	And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in the morning and taught. In the meantime, the prince of the priests came, and those that were with him, and called the council together and all the elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
ACT.5.22	But when the officers came and found them not in the prison, they returned and told,
ACT.5.23	saying, We certainly found the prison shut with all security and the keepers standing outside before the doors, but when we had opened, we found no one within.
ACT.5.24	Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the princes of the priests heard these things, they were perplexed regarding what this would come to.
ACT.5.25	Then someone came and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people.
ACT.5.26	Then the captain with the officers went and brought them without violence, for they feared being stoned by the people.
ACT.5.27	And when they had brought them, they set them before the council, and the prince of the priests asked them,
ACT.5.28	saying, Did we not strictly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
ACT.5.29	Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We must persuade God rather than men.
ACT.5.30	The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew, hanging him on a tree.
ACT.5.31	God has exalted him with his right hand as Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
ACT.5.32	And we are his witnesses of these things, and so is also the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those that persuade him.
ACT.5.33	When they heard that, they were divided and took counsel to slay them.
ACT.5.34	Then a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, who had a reputation among all the people, stood up in the council and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space
ACT.5.35	and said unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as concerning these men.
ACT.5.36	For before these days, rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves; who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered and brought to nought.
ACT.5.37	After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing and drew away many people after him; he also perished, and all those that consented with him were dispersed.
ACT.5.38	And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men and let them alone; for if this counsellor or this work is of men, it will come to nought,
ACT.5.39	but if it is of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest ye be found fighting against God.
ACT.5.40	And they agreed with him; and when they had called the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus and let them go.
ACT.5.41	And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.
ACT.5.42	And daily in the temple and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach the gospel of Jesus the Christ.
ACT.6.1	And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, that their widows were neglected in the daily ministry.
ACT.6.2	Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said, It is not right that we should leave the word of God and serve tables;
ACT.6.3	therefore, brethren, seek out among you seven men of whom you bear witness, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
ACT.6.4	And we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word.
ACT.6.5	And the saying pleased the whole multitude, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip and Prochorus and Nicanor and Timon and Parmenas and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch:
ACT.6.6	these they set before the apostles, and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.
ACT.6.7	And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and also a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
ACT.6.8	And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles in the people.
ACT.6.9	Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians and Alexandrians and of those of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.
ACT.6.10	And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spoke.
ACT.6.11	Then they suborned men, who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and against God.
ACT.6.12	And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes and came upon him and caught him and brought him to the council
ACT.6.13	and set up false witnesses, who said, This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law,
ACT.6.14	for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place and shall change the traditions which Moses delivered us.
ACT.6.15	Then all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	Then the prince of the priests said, Are these things so?
ACT.7.2	And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken. The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
ACT.7.3	and said unto him, Get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which I shall show thee.
ACT.7.4	Then he came out of the land of the Chaldaeans and dwelt in Haran; and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, in which ye now dwell.
ACT.7.5	And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on; yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.
ACT.7.6	And God spoke thus, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into slavery and mistreat them four hundred years.
ACT.7.7	And the Gentiles unto whom they shall be in slavery I will judge, said God; and after that they shall come forth and serve me in this place.
ACT.7.8	And he gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham begat Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.
ACT.7.9	And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt, but God was with him
ACT.7.10	and delivered him out of all his afflictions and gave him grace and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
ACT.7.11	Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great tribulation, and our fathers found no sustenance.
ACT.7.12	But when Jacob heard that there was wheat in Egypt, he sent our fathers the first time.
ACT.7.13	And in the second Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s lineage was made known unto Pharaoh.
ACT.7.14	Then Joseph sent and called his father Jacob unto him and all his kindred, seventy-five souls.
ACT.7.15	So Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our fathers,
ACT.7.16	who were carried over into Shechem and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor of Shechem.
ACT.7.17	But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
ACT.7.18	until another king arose, who did not know Joseph.
ACT.7.19	The same dealt subtly with our kindred and mistreated our fathers so that they exposed their babies to death, to the end that the generation would cease.
ACT.7.20	In which time Moses was born and was beautiful to God and was nourished in his father’s house three months;
ACT.7.21	and when he was put in danger, Pharaoh’s daughter took him in and nourished him as her own son.
ACT.7.22	And Moses was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was mighty in his words and deeds.
ACT.7.23	And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the sons of Israel.
ACT.7.24	And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him and smote the Egyptian, avenging the oppressed;
ACT.7.25	for he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God was to give them saving health by his hand, but they had not understood.
ACT.7.26	And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove and urged them to peace, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
ACT.7.27	But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?
ACT.7.28	Wilt thou kill me as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?
ACT.7.29	Then Moses fled at this word and became a sojourner in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons.
ACT.7.30	And when forty years were expired, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
ACT.7.31	When Moses saw it, he wondered at the vision; and as he drew near to consider it, the voice of the Lord came unto him,
ACT.7.32	saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled and dared not to behold.
ACT.7.33	Then the Lord said to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet; for the place where thou dost stand is holy ground.
ACT.7.34	I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
ACT.7.35	This Moses, whom they had refused, saying, Who made thee a prince and a judge? the same did God send as prince and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
ACT.7.36	He brought them out, showing wonders and signs in the land of Egypt and in the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.
ACT.7.37	This is that Moses, who said unto the sons of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren like unto me; him shall ye hear.
ACT.7.38	This is he, who was in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him in the Mount Sinai and with our fathers, who received the oracles of life to give unto us;
ACT.7.39	to whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
ACT.7.40	saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for as for this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
ACT.7.41	And then they made a calf and offered sacrifice unto the idol and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
ACT.7.42	Then God withdrew and gave them up to worship the host of the heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?
ACT.7.43	On the contrary, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them; and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
ACT.7.44	Our fathers had the tabernacle of the testimony in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen,
ACT.7.45	which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus {Joshua in Heb.} into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers unto the days of David,
ACT.7.46	who found grace before God and asked to provide a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.
ACT.7.47	But Solomon built him a house.
ACT.7.48	Howbeit the most High does not dwell in temples made with hands, as saith the prophet,
ACT.7.49	Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool; what house will ye build me? saith the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?
ACT.7.50	Has not my hand made all these things?
ACT.7.51	Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do ye.
ACT.7.52	Who of the prophets have your fathers not persecuted? and they have slain those who announced before the coming of the Just One, of whom ye have now been the betrayers and murderers,
ACT.7.53	who have received the law by the disposition of angels and have not kept it.
ACT.7.54	When they heard these things, they were divided in their hearts and gnashed on him with their teeth.
ACT.7.55	But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God
ACT.7.56	and said, Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
ACT.7.57	And crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears and ran upon him with one accord;
ACT.7.58	and casting him out of the city, they stoned him; and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.
ACT.7.59	And they stoned Stephen calling upon God and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
ACT.7.60	And he kneeled down and cried with a loud voice, Lord, impute not this sin to their charge. And having said this, he fell asleep in the Lord.
ACT.8.1	And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} which was at Jerusalem, and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
ACT.8.2	And devout men carried Stephen to his burial and made great lamentation over him.
ACT.8.3	As for Saul, he made havoc of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}; entering into the houses and dragging out men and women, he committed them to prison.
ACT.8.4	But those that were scattered abroad went everywhere preaching the word of the gospel.
ACT.8.5	Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached the Christ unto them.
ACT.8.6	And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spoke, hearing and seeing the signs which he did.
ACT.8.7	For many unclean spirits, crying with a loud voice, came out of those who were possessed with them, and many paralytics and that were lame were healed.
ACT.8.8	And there was great joy in that city.
ACT.8.9	But there was a certain man called Simon, who before this in the same city used magic arts and amazed the people of Samaria, giving out that he himself was some great one,
ACT.8.10	to whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This is the great virtue of God.
ACT.8.11	And to him they had regard because for a long time he had amazed them with magic arts.
ACT.8.12	But when they believed Philip preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
ACT.8.13	Then Simon himself believed also; and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were being done.
ACT.8.14	Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John unto them,
ACT.8.15	who, when they were come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit.
ACT.8.16	(For as yet he was fallen upon none of them; they were baptized only in the name of the Lord Jesus.)
ACT.8.17	Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
ACT.8.18	And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,
ACT.8.19	saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.
ACT.8.20	But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
ACT.8.21	Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
ACT.8.22	Repent therefore of this thy wickedness and pray God, if perhaps this thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.
ACT.8.23	For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness and in the prison of iniquity.
ACT.8.24	Then Simon answered and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
ACT.8.25	And they, when they had testified and preached the word of God, returned to Jerusalem and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
ACT.8.26	And the angel of the Lord spoke unto Philip, saying, Arise and go toward the south unto the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
ACT.8.27	Then he arose and went, and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
ACT.8.28	was returning and sitting in his chariot reading Isaiah the prophet.
ACT.8.29	Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near and join thyself to this chariot.
ACT.8.30	And Philip ran there to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah and said, Dost thou understand what thou readest?
ACT.8.31	And he said, How can I, except someone should guide me? And he besought Philip to come up and sit with him.
ACT.8.32	The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth;
ACT.8.33	in his humiliation his judgment was taken away, and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
ACT.8.34	And the eunuch answered Philip and said, I pray thee, of whom does the prophet speak this? of himself or of some other?
ACT.8.35	Then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture and preached unto him the gospel of Jesus.
ACT.8.36	And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water; and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what hinders me to be baptized?
ACT.8.37	And Philip said, If thou dost believe with all thine heart, thou may. And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
ACT.8.38	And he commanded the chariot to stand still, and they went both down into the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
ACT.8.39	And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, so that the eunuch saw him no more, and he went on his way rejoicing.
ACT.8.40	But Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through, he preached the gospel in all the cities until he came to Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, came unto the prince of the priests
ACT.9.2	and asked him for letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
ACT.9.3	And as he proceeded, he came near Damascus; and suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven;
ACT.9.4	and falling to the earth, he heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?
ACT.9.5	And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I AM Jesus whom thou dost persecute; it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
ACT.9.6	And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what it behooves thee to do.
ACT.9.7	And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing indeed the voice, but seeing no one.
ACT.9.8	Then Saul arose from the earth; and opening his eyes, he saw no one; so they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus
ACT.9.9	where he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
ACT.9.10	And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; to whom the Lord said in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am here, Lord.
ACT.9.11	And the Lord said unto him, Arise and go into the street which is called Straight and enquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus; for, behold, he prays
ACT.9.12	and has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
ACT.9.13	Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, of how much evil he has done to thy saints in Jerusalem,
ACT.9.14	and even here he has authority from the princes of the priests to bind all that call on thy name.
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said unto him, Go; for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel;
ACT.9.16	for I will show him how much it behooves him to suffer for my name.
ACT.9.17	Then Ananias went and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared unto thee in the way as thou didst come, has sent me, that thou might receive thy sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
ACT.9.18	And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales; and he received sight immediately and arose and was baptized.
ACT.9.19	And when he had received food, he was comforted. Then Saul was certain days with the disciples who were at Damascus.
ACT.9.20	And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is the Son of God.
ACT.9.21	But all that heard him were amazed and said, Is not this he that destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem and came here for that intent that he might bring them bound unto the princes of the priests?
ACT.9.22	But Saul increased the more in strength and confounded the Jews who dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.
ACT.9.23	And as many days passed, the Jews took counsel among themselves to kill him;
ACT.9.24	but their ambushes were understood by Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
ACT.9.25	Then the disciples took him by night and let him down by the wall in a basket.
ACT.9.26	And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they were all afraid of him and did not believe that he was a disciple.
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way and that he had spoken to him and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
ACT.9.28	And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem;
ACT.9.29	and he spoke boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus and disputed against the Greeks; but they went about to slay him,
ACT.9.30	which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	Then the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} had rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria and were edified, walking in the fear of the Lord, and with the comfort of the Holy Spirit they were multiplied.
ACT.9.32	And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints who dwelt at Lydda.
ACT.9.33	And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had been in bed eight years, for he was a paralytic.
ACT.9.34	And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, the Lord Jesus, the Christ, makes thee whole; arise and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
ACT.9.35	And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him and turned to the Lord.
ACT.9.36	Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas; this woman was full of good works and alms-deeds {lit. acts of mercy} which she did.
ACT.9.37	And it came to pass in those days that she was sick and died, whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.
ACT.9.38	And since as Lydda was close to Joppa and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, asking him that he not delay to come to them.
ACT.9.39	Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made them while she was with them.
ACT.9.40	Then Peter put them all out and knelt down and prayed and turned to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes; and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
ACT.9.41	And he gave her his hand and lifted her up; and calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
ACT.9.42	And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord.
ACT.9.43	And it came to pass that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
ACT.10.1	There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the company called the Italian,
ACT.10.2	a devout man and one that feared God with all his house, who gave many alms to the people and prayed to God always.
ACT.10.3	He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming in to him and saying unto him, Cornelius.
ACT.10.4	And when he looked on him, he was afraid and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms {lit. thine acts of mercy} are come up for a memorial before God.
ACT.10.5	And now send men to Joppa and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter;
ACT.10.6	he lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side; he shall tell thee what it behooves thee to do.
ACT.10.7	And when the angel who spoke unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of those that waited on him continually;
ACT.10.8	and when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	On the morrow, as they went on their journey and drew near unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour;
ACT.10.10	and he became very hungry and would have eaten; but while they made ready, he fell into a rapture of understanding
ACT.10.11	and saw the heaven opened and a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners and let down to the earth,
ACT.10.12	in which were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and reptiles and fowls of the air.
ACT.10.13	And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter, kill and eat.
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
ACT.10.15	And the voice spoke unto him again the second time, That which God has cleansed, do not call common.
ACT.10.16	This was done three times, and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
ACT.10.17	Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men who were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon’s house and stood before the gate
ACT.10.18	and called and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, were lodged there.
ACT.10.19	While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
ACT.10.20	Arise therefore and get thee down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them.
ACT.10.21	Then Peter went down to the men who were sent unto him from Cornelius and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek; what is the cause for which ye are come?
ACT.10.22	And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man and one that fears God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house and to hear words of thee.
ACT.10.23	Then he called them in and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
ACT.10.24	And the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them and had called together his kinsmen and near friends.
ACT.10.25	And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshipped him.
ACT.10.26	But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
ACT.10.27	And as he talked with him, he went in and found many that were come together.
ACT.10.28	And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an abominable thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company or come unto one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
ACT.10.29	Therefore I came unto you without doubting, as soon as I was sent for; I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
ACT.10.30	And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing
ACT.10.31	and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
ACT.10.32	Send therefore to Joppa, and call here Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea side, who, when he comes, shall speak unto thee.
ACT.10.33	Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou hast done well to come. Now therefore we are all here present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.
ACT.10.34	Then Peter opened his mouth and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;
ACT.10.35	but in every nation he that fears him and works righteousness is acceptable to him.
ACT.10.36	The word which God sent unto the sons of Israel, preaching the gospel: peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),
ACT.10.37	that word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached,
ACT.10.38	how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed of the devil, for God was with him.
ACT.10.39	And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of Judea and in Jerusalem, whom they slew hanging him on a tree.
ACT.10.40	This same one God raised up the third day and showed him openly,
ACT.10.41	not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
ACT.10.42	And he commanded us to preach unto the people and to testify that it is he who is ordained of God to be the Judge of living and dead.
ACT.10.43	Unto him all the prophets give witness, that whosoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins through his name.
ACT.10.44	While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.
ACT.10.45	And those of the circumcision who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, that also on the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.
ACT.10.46	For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God. Then Peter answered,
ACT.10.47	Can anyone forbid water that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?
ACT.10.48	And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they begged him to tarry certain days.
ACT.11.1	And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
ACT.11.2	When Peter was come up to Jerusalem, those that were of the circumcision contended with him,
ACT.11.3	saying, Why didst thou go in to men uncircumcised and eat with them?
ACT.11.4	But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning and expounded it by order unto them, saying,
ACT.11.5	I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a rapture of understanding I saw a vision: A certain vessel descended like a great sheet let down from heaven by the four corners, and it came unto me,
ACT.11.6	upon which when I had fastened my eyes, I considered and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth and wild beasts and reptiles and fowls of the air.
ACT.11.7	And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter, slay and eat.
ACT.11.8	But I said, Not so, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has at any time entered into my mouth.
ACT.11.9	But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God has cleansed, do not call common.
ACT.11.10	And this was done three times, and it was all drawn up again into heaven.
ACT.11.11	And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.
ACT.11.12	And the Spirit bade me go with them, doubting nothing. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:
ACT.11.13	And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said unto him, Send to Joppa and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter,
ACT.11.14	who shall tell thee words, by which thou and all thy house shall be saved.
ACT.11.15	And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as on us at the beginning.
ACT.11.16	Then I remembered the word of the Lord, when he said, John indeed baptized in water, but ye shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.
ACT.11.17	So then, if God gave them the same gift as he did unto us, who have believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I should withstand God?
ACT.11.18	When they heard these things, they were silent and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted repentance unto life to the Gentiles.
ACT.11.19	Now those who were scattered abroad by the tribulation that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the word to no one except only unto the Jews.
ACT.11.20	And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they came into Antioch, spoke unto the Greeks, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.
ACT.11.21	And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord.
ACT.11.22	Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} which was in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas that he should go unto Antioch.
ACT.11.23	Who, when he came and had seen the grace of God, was glad and exhorted them all to remain in their purpose of heart in the Lord.
ACT.11.24	For he was a good man and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and many people were added unto the Lord.
ACT.11.25	Then Barnabas departed to Tarsus to seek Saul, and when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.
ACT.11.26	And it came to pass that for a whole year they gathered themselves together with the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} and taught many people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
ACT.11.27	And in those days prophets came down from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
ACT.11.28	And one of them named Agabus stood up and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine throughout all the world, which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.
ACT.11.29	Then the disciples, each one according to what he had, determined to send relief unto the brethren who dwelt in Judea,
ACT.11.30	which they likewise did and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
ACT.12.1	Now at that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to mistreat certain of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
ACT.12.2	And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
ACT.12.3	And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
ACT.12.4	And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him, intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.
ACT.12.5	Peter therefore was kept in the prison, and the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} made prayer without unto God for him.
ACT.12.6	And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and the guards before the door that kept the prison.
ACT.12.7	And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shone in the prison, and he smote Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, Arise quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.
ACT.12.8	And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he said unto him, Cast thy garment about thee and follow me.
ACT.12.9	And he went out and followed him and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel, but thought he saw a vision.
ACT.12.10	When they were past the first and the second guard, they came unto the iron gate that leads unto the city, which opened to them of its own accord, and they went out and passed on through one street, and then the angel departed from him.
ACT.12.11	And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety that the Lord has sent his angel and has delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the people of the Jews who waited for me.
ACT.12.12	And considering this, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark, where many were gathered together praying.
ACT.12.13	And as Peter knocked at the door of the patio, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda.
ACT.12.14	And when she recognized Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in and told how Peter stood at the gate.
ACT.12.15	And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then they said, It is his angel.
ACT.12.16	But Peter continued knocking, and when they had opened the door and saw him, they were astonished.
ACT.12.17	But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to be silent, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go make these things known unto James and to the brethren. And he departed and went to another place.
ACT.12.18	Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers concerning what was become of Peter.
ACT.12.19	And when Herod had sought for him and found him not, he examined the guards and commanded that they should be taken away. Then he went down from Judaea to Caesarea and abode there.
ACT.12.20	And Herod was highly displeased with those of Tyre and Sidon, but they came with one accord to him, and, having bribed Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they asked for peace because their lands were supplied through those of the king’s.
ACT.12.21	And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne and made an oration unto them.
ACT.12.22	And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of god, and not of man.
ACT.12.23	And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him because he did not give God the glory, and he expired eaten of worms.
ACT.12.24	But the word of the Lord grew and multiplied.
ACT.12.25	And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
ACT.13.1	Now there were in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} that was at Antioch prophets and teachers: Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius of Cyrene and Manaen, who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
ACT.13.2	As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work unto which I have called them.
ACT.13.3	And when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they released them.
ACT.13.4	So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, departed unto Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
ACT.13.5	And when they arrived at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they also had John as an attendant.
ACT.13.6	And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain wise man, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus,
ACT.13.7	who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a prudent man, who called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of God.
ACT.13.8	But Elymas the wise man (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
ACT.13.9	Then Saul (who also is Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him
ACT.13.10	and said, O full of all deception and all licentiousness, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
ACT.13.11	And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is against thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness, and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
ACT.13.12	Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Now when Paul and his company sailed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; then John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.
ACT.13.14	But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and sat down.
ACT.13.15	And after the reading of the law and the prophets the princes of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, speak.
ACT.13.16	Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel and ye that fear God hearken.
ACT.13.17	The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with a high arm he brought them out of it.
ACT.13.18	And for the time of about forty years, he suffered their manners in the wilderness.
ACT.13.19	And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he divided their land to them by lot.
ACT.13.20	And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
ACT.13.21	And afterward they asked for a king, and God gave unto them Saul the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
ACT.13.22	And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king, to whom also he gave testimony, saying, I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who shall fulfil all my will.
ACT.13.23	Of this man’s seed has God according to his promise raised up Jesus as Saviour unto Israel:
ACT.13.24	John, having first proclaimed before his coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
ACT.13.25	And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not he. But, behold, there comes one after me, whose shoes of his feet I am not worthy to loose.
ACT.13.26	Men and brethren, sons of the lineage of Abraham, and whosoever among you fears God, unto you is this word of saving health sent.
ACT.13.27	For those that dwell at Jerusalem and their princes, because they knew him not nor yet the voices of the prophets who are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.
ACT.13.28	And without finding cause of death in him, yet they asked Pilate that he should be slain.
ACT.13.29	And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a sepulchre.
ACT.13.30	But God raised him from the dead,
ACT.13.31	and he was seen many days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who until now are his witnesses unto the people.
ACT.13.32	And we declare unto you the gospel of the promise which was made unto the fathers,
ACT.13.33	which God has fulfilled unto us their children, in that he has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
ACT.13.34	And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said this, I will give you the sure mercies promised to David.
ACT.13.35	Therefore he also says in another place, Thou shalt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
ACT.13.36	For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep and was gathered unto his fathers and saw corruption;
ACT.13.37	but he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.
ACT.13.38	Be it known unto you, therefore, men and brethren, that through this one is preached unto you the remission of sins;
ACT.13.39	and in him all that believe are justified from all the things from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
ACT.13.40	Beware, therefore, lest what is spoken of in the prophets come upon you:
ACT.13.41	Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish, for I do a work in your days, a work which ye would in no wise believe, if one should declare it unto you.
ACT.13.42	And when they were gone out of the synagogue of the Jews, the Gentiles besought that these words might be spoken to them the next sabbath.
ACT.13.43	Now when the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to remain in the grace of God.
ACT.13.44	And the next sabbath day almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.
ACT.13.45	But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy and spoke against that which Paul said, contradicting and blaspheming.
ACT.13.46	Then Paul and Barnabas speaking with freedom, said, It was necessary indeed that the word of God should first have been spoken to you; but seeing ye put it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
ACT.13.47	For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou should be for saving health unto the ends of the earth.
ACT.13.48	And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
ACT.13.49	And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
ACT.13.50	But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women and the principals of the city and raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their borders.
ACT.13.51	But they shook off the dust of their feet against them and came unto Iconium.
ACT.13.52	And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
ACT.14.1	And it came to pass in Iconium that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews and so spoke, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
ACT.14.2	But the disobedient Jews stirred up the Gentiles and corrupted their desire against the brethren.
ACT.14.3	With all this, they abode there a long time speaking with freedom in the Lord, who gave testimony unto the word of his grace and granted that signs and wonders be done by their hands.
ACT.14.4	But the multitude of the city was divided, and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
ACT.14.5	And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles and also of the Jews with their princes, to insult them and to stone them,
ACT.14.6	they were aware of it and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lies round about.
ACT.14.7	And there they preached the gospel.
ACT.14.8	And a certain man sat at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked;
ACT.14.9	this man heard Paul speak, who steadfastly beholding him and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
ACT.14.10	said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.
ACT.14.11	And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
ACT.14.12	And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius because he was the chief speaker.
ACT.14.13	Then the priest of Jupiter, who was before their city, brought bulls and garlands unto the gates and would have done sacrifice unto them with the people.
ACT.14.14	Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it, they rent their clothes and ran in among the people, crying out
ACT.14.15	and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all the things that are therein,
ACT.14.16	who in generations past suffered all the Gentiles to walk in their own ways.
ACT.14.17	Nevertheless he did not leave himself without witness, in that he did good and gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
ACT.14.18	And with these words they scarcely restrained the people, that they not sacrifice unto them.
ACT.14.19	And certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he was dead.
ACT.14.20	But as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came into the city, and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
ACT.14.21	And when they had preached the gospel to that city and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra and to Iconium and Antioch,
ACT.14.22	confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to remain in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.
ACT.14.23	And having ordained elders for them in every congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} and having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord on whom they believed.
ACT.14.24	And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
ACT.14.25	And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia
ACT.14.26	and from there sailed to Antioch, where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
ACT.14.27	And when they were come and had gathered the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} together, they related what great things God had done with them and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.
ACT.14.28	And there they abode a long time with the disciples.
ACT.15.1	Then certain men who came down from Judaea taught the brethren and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
ACT.15.2	When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain other of them should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.
ACT.15.3	And they, being accompanied by some from the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, passed through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles, and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.
ACT.15.4	And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received by the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} and by the apostles and elders, and they declared all the things that God had done with them.
ACT.15.5	But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees who had believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses.
ACT.15.6	And the apostles and elders came together to consider of this matter.
ACT.15.7	And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God chose that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel and believe.
ACT.15.8	And God, who knows the hearts, bore them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did unto us,
ACT.15.9	and put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
ACT.15.10	Now therefore why tempt ye God, putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
ACT.15.11	For we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved, even as they.
ACT.15.12	Then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what great miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
ACT.15.13	And after they had become silent, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me:
ACT.15.14	Simeon has declared how God first visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
ACT.15.15	And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
ACT.15.16	After this I will return and will restore the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will repair its ruins, and I will set it up again,
ACT.15.17	that the men that are left might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who does all these things.
ACT.15.18	Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world.
ACT.15.19	Therefore my sentence is that those from among the Gentiles who are converted to God not be troubled,
ACT.15.20	but that we write unto them that they abstain from pollutions of idols and from fornication and from things strangled and from blood.
ACT.15.21	For Moses of old time has in every city those that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
ACT.15.22	Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, principal men among the brethren;
ACT.15.23	and they wrote letters by them after this manner: The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia;
ACT.15.24	forasmuch as we have heard that certain ones who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised and keep the law, to whom we gave no such commandment,
ACT.15.25	it seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
ACT.15.26	men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ACT.15.27	We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth.
ACT.15.28	For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
ACT.15.29	that ye abstain from foods offered to idols and from blood and from things strangled and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well.
ACT.15.30	So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle,
ACT.15.31	which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
ACT.15.32	And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words and confirmed them.
ACT.15.33	And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles.
ACT.15.34	Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
ACT.15.35	Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching the word of the Lord and announcing the gospel, with many others also.
ACT.15.36	And some days after, Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord and see how they do.
ACT.15.37	And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
ACT.15.38	But Paul thought it not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia and did not go with them to the work.
ACT.15.39	And the contention was so sharp between them that they departed asunder one from the other, and so Barnabas took Mark and sailed unto Cyprus;
ACT.15.40	and Paul chose Silas and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God.
ACT.15.41	And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
ACT.16.1	Then he came to Derbe and Lystra; and, behold, a certain disciple was there named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman, who was faithful, but his father was a Gentile,
ACT.16.2	of whom the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium gave good witness.
ACT.16.3	Paul desired to have him go forth with him and took and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those quarters, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
ACT.16.4	And as they went through the cities, they asked them to keep the decrees that had been determined by the apostles and elders who were at Jerusalem.
ACT.16.5	And so the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} were established in the faith and increased in number daily.
ACT.16.6	Now passing through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia;
ACT.16.7	after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit suffered them not.
ACT.16.8	And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
ACT.16.9	And a vision was shown to Paul in the night: There stood a man of Macedonia, asking him, saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us.
ACT.16.10	And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them.
ACT.16.11	Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis,
ACT.16.12	and from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony; and we were in that city abiding certain days.
ACT.16.13	And on one of the sabbaths we went out of the city by a river side, where it was customary to pray; and we sat down and spoke unto the women who gathered there.
ACT.16.14	Then a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who feared God, heard us, whose heart the Lord opened that she attended unto the things which were spoken by Paul.
ACT.16.15	And when she was baptized, with her household, she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and abide there. And she constrained us.
ACT.16.16	And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a Pythian spirit met us, which brought her masters much gain by divination:
ACT.16.17	she followed Paul and us and cried out, saying, These men are the slaves of the most high God, who announce unto us the way of deliverance.
ACT.16.18	And she did this for many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
ACT.16.19	And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas and drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers
ACT.16.20	and brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city
ACT.16.21	and teach rites which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe, being Romans.
ACT.16.22	And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them.
ACT.16.23	And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely,
ACT.16.24	who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks.
ACT.16.25	But at midnight as Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God, and the prisoners heard them,
ACT.16.26	then suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bands were loosed.
ACT.16.27	And the keeper of the prison, awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.
ACT.16.28	But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm, for we are all here.
ACT.16.29	Then he called for a light and came inside and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas
ACT.16.30	and brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
ACT.16.31	And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.
ACT.16.32	And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
ACT.16.33	And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
ACT.16.34	And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.
ACT.16.35	And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.
ACT.16.36	And the keeper of the prison made these words known unto Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore depart and go in peace.
ACT.16.37	But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out in secret? no indeed; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
ACT.16.38	And the sergeants returned and told these words unto the magistrates; and they feared when they heard that they were Romans.
ACT.16.39	And they came and besought them, and bringing them out, asked them to depart out of the city.
ACT.16.40	And leaving the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them and departed.
ACT.17.1	Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where the synagogue of the Jews was.
ACT.17.2	And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
ACT.17.3	declaring openly and proposing that it behooved the Christ to have suffered and risen again from the dead and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is the Christ.
ACT.17.4	And some of them believed and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the noble women not a few.
ACT.17.5	But the disobedient Jews, moved with envy, took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort and gathered a company and set all the city on an uproar and assaulted the house of Jason and sought to bring them out to the people.
ACT.17.6	And when they did not find them, they brought Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down have come here also,
ACT.17.7	whom Jason has received, and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.
ACT.17.8	And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city when they heard these things.
ACT.17.9	And when they had taken security of Jason and of the others, they let them go.
ACT.17.10	And the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night unto Berea, who when they got there went into the synagogue of the Jews.
ACT.17.11	These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all diligence and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
ACT.17.12	Therefore many of them believed, also of honourable women who were Greeks and of men, not a few.
ACT.17.13	But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the people.
ACT.17.14	And then immediately the brethren sent Paul to go away towards the sea, but Silas and Timothy abode there still.
ACT.17.15	And those that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens; and receiving an order from him unto Silas and Timothy to come unto him as soon as possible, they departed.
ACT.17.16	Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred in him when he saw the city completely given over to idolatry.
ACT.17.17	Therefore he disputed in the synagogue with the Jews and with the devout persons and in the market daily with those that he met with.
ACT.17.18	Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans and of the Stoics encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? others, He seems to be a setter forth of new gods, because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection.
ACT.17.19	And they took him and brought him unto the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, of which thou speakest?
ACT.17.20	For thou bringest certain new things to our ears; we desire, therefore, to know what these things mean.
ACT.17.21	(For all the Athenians and strangers who were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear some new thing.)
ACT.17.22	Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus, {Mars’ Hill}, and said, Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too superstitious.
ACT.17.23	For as I passed by and beheld your sanctuaries, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him I declare unto you.
ACT.17.24	The God that made the world and all the things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands;
ACT.17.25	neither is worshipped with men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he gives to all life and breath and all things
ACT.17.26	and has made of one blood all the lineage of men to dwell on all the face of the earth and has determined the seasons (which he has limited) and the bounds of their habitation;
ACT.17.27	that they should seek the Lord, if in any manner they might reach out to touch him and find him though he is not far from each one of us;
ACT.17.28	for in him we live and move and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also of his lineage.
ACT.17.29	Being therefore of the lineage of God, we ought not to think that which is Divine is like unto gold or silver or stone, bearing the mark of art and man’s imagination.
ACT.17.30	For the times of this ignorance God overlooked, but he now commands all men everywhere to repent
ACT.17.31	because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he has ordained; of whom he has given assurance unto all men in that he has raised him from the dead.
ACT.17.32	And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked; and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.
ACT.17.33	So Paul departed from among them.
ACT.17.34	But certain men believed and joined themselves with him, among whom was Dionysius of the Areopagus and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
ACT.18.1	After these things Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth
ACT.18.2	and found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla (for Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome) and came unto them.
ACT.18.3	And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them and worked, for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
ACT.18.4	And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks.
ACT.18.5	And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was impressed by the Spirit and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ.
ACT.18.6	And when they opposed themselves and blasphemed, he shook his raiment and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am clean; from now on I will go unto the Gentiles.
ACT.18.7	And he departed from there and entered into a certain man’s house, named Titus the Just, one that feared God, whose house was next to the synagogue.
ACT.18.8	And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.
ACT.18.9	Then the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent,
ACT.18.10	For I am with thee, and no one shall be able to hurt thee, for I have many people in this city.
ACT.18.11	And he continued there a year and six months, teaching them the word of God.
ACT.18.12	And when Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up with one accord against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,
ACT.18.13	saying, This fellow persuades men to honor God contrary to the law.
ACT.18.14	And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews, reason would that I should bear with you;
ACT.18.15	but if it is a question of words and names and of your law, look ye to it, for I will be no judge of such matters.
ACT.18.16	And he drove them from the judgment seat.
ACT.18.17	Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of those things.
ACT.18.18	And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while and then took his leave of the brethren and sailed from there into Syria and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.
ACT.18.19	And he came to Ephesus and left them there, but he himself entered into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
ACT.18.20	When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not,
ACT.18.21	but bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem, but I will return again unto you, if God wills. And he sailed from Ephesus.
ACT.18.22	And when he had landed at Caesarea and gone up to Jerusalem and after greeting the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, he went down to Antioch.
ACT.18.23	And after he had spent some time there, he departed and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, confirming all the disciples.
ACT.18.24	And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
ACT.18.25	This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, teaching only in the baptism of John.
ACT.18.26	And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Aquila and Priscilla had heard him, they took him unto them and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly.
ACT.18.27	And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the exhorted brethren wrote the disciples to receive him, who, when he was come, was very helpful through grace unto those who had believed;
ACT.18.28	for he mightily convinced the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
ACT.19.1	And it came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper coasts, came to Ephesus, and finding certain disciples,
ACT.19.2	he said unto them, Have ye received the Holy Spirit since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there is any Holy Spirit.
ACT.19.3	And he said unto them, Into what then were ye baptized? And they said, Into John’s baptism.
ACT.19.4	Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him who should come after him, that is, on Christ, Jesus.
ACT.19.5	When they heard this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
ACT.19.6	And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.
ACT.19.7	And all the men were about twelve.
ACT.19.8	And he went into the synagogue and spoke freely for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.
ACT.19.9	But when some were hardened and disobedient, but cursing the way before the multitude, he departed from them and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
ACT.19.10	And this continued by the space of two years so that all those who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.
ACT.19.11	And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul
ACT.19.12	so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
ACT.19.13	Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon themselves to invoke over those who had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.
ACT.19.14	(And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew and prince of the priests, who did so.)
ACT.19.15	And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with, but who are ye?
ACT.19.16	And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
ACT.19.17	And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
ACT.19.18	And many that believed came, confessing and declaring their deeds.
ACT.19.19	In the same manner many who had practiced vain arts brought their books together and burned them before everyone, and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.
ACT.19.20	So the word of God grew mightily and prevailed.
ACT.19.21	After these things were ended, Paul purposed by the Spirit to go to Jerusalem, after he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, saying, After I have been there, it behooves me to see Rome also.
ACT.19.22	So he sent into Macedonia two of those that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
ACT.19.23	And the same time there arose no small stir about the way.
ACT.19.24	For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen,
ACT.19.25	whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation and said, Sirs, ye know that by this gain we have our wealth.
ACT.19.26	Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands
ACT.19.27	so that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.
ACT.19.28	And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
ACT.19.29	And the whole city was filled with confusion, and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.
ACT.19.30	And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
ACT.19.31	And certain of the chief persons of Asia, who were his friends, sent unto him, asking him that he not present himself in the theatre.
ACT.19.32	Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was confused; and most of them did not know why they were come together.
ACT.19.33	And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand and would have made his defense unto the people.
ACT.19.34	But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.
ACT.19.35	Then the town scribe, appeasing the people, said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that does not know how the city of the Ephesians is honored of the great goddess Diana and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?
ACT.19.36	Seeing then that these things cannot be gainsaid, ye ought to be quiet and to do nothing rashly.
ACT.19.37	For ye have brought here these men, who are neither guilty of sacrilege, nor blasphemers of your goddess.
ACT.19.38	Therefore if Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are proconsuls; let them accuse one another.
ACT.19.39	But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
ACT.19.40	For we are in danger of being accused of sedition for this day’s uproar, there being no cause by which we may give an account of this concourse.
ACT.19.41	And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
ACT.20.1	And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called the disciples and embraced them and departed to go into Macedonia.
ACT.20.2	And when he had gone over those parts and had exhorted them with much word, he came into Greece
ACT.20.3	and there abode three months. And when the Jews laid in wait for him, as he was about to sail into Syria, he took counsel to return through Macedonia.
ACT.20.4	And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe and Timothy; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.
ACT.20.5	These going before tarried for us at Troas.
ACT.20.6	And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.
ACT.20.7	And the first of the sabbaths, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart the next day, and continued his word until midnight.
ACT.20.8	And there were many lamps in the upper chamber, where they were gathered together.
ACT.20.9	And a certain young man named Eutychus sat in a window, being fallen into a deep sleep; and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep and fell down from the third loft and was taken up dead.
ACT.20.10	And Paul went down and fell on him and, embracing him, said, Trouble not yourselves, for his soul is still in him.
ACT.20.11	When he therefore was come up again and had broken bread and eaten and talked a long while, even until day break, thus he departed.
ACT.20.12	And they took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.
ACT.20.13	And we went into the ship and sailed unto Assos, intending to take in Paul there, for so he had determined that he should go by land.
ACT.20.14	And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in and came to Mitylene.
ACT.20.15	And we sailed from there and came the next day over against Chios, and the next day we arrived in port at Samos; and having rested in Trogyllium, the next day we came to Miletus.
ACT.20.16	For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, not to detain himself in Asia, for he hasted to keep the day of Pentecost, if it were possible for him, in Jerusalem.
ACT.20.17	And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
ACT.20.18	And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
ACT.20.19	serving the Lord with all humility and with many tears and temptations, which have befallen me by the ambushes of the Jews,
ACT.20.20	and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house,
ACT.20.21	testifying both to the Jews and also to the Gentiles, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
ACT.20.22	And now, behold, I go bound of the Spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there,
ACT.20.23	except that the Holy Spirit witnesses in every city, saying that prisons and tribulations await me.
ACT.20.24	But none of these things move me, neither do I count my life dear unto myself, only that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
ACT.20.25	And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.
ACT.20.26	Therefore I take you to record this day that I am pure from the blood of everyone.
ACT.20.27	For I have not refrained from declaring unto you the full counsel of God.
ACT.20.28	Take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has placed you as bishops to feed the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.
ACT.20.29	For I know this, that after my departing, grievous wolves shall enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
ACT.20.30	Also from among your own selves, men shall arise, speaking perverse things to draw away disciples after themselves.
ACT.20.31	Therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
ACT.20.32	And now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is powerful to build you up and to give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
ACT.20.33	I have coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel.
ACT.20.34	Moreover, ye yourselves know that these hands have ministered unto my necessities and to those that were with me.
ACT.20.35	I have showed you in all things how that so labouring, ye ought to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
ACT.20.36	And when he had thus spoken, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
ACT.20.37	Then they all wept sore and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him,
ACT.20.38	sorrowing most of all for the word which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.
ACT.21.1	And it came to pass that after we had left them and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from there unto Patara;
ACT.21.2	and finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard and set forth.
ACT.21.3	Now when we had sighted Cyprus, we left it on the left hand and sailed into Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload her cargo.
ACT.21.4	And finding the disciples, we tarried there seven days, who said to Paul through the Spirit that he should not go up to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.5	And when we had accomplished those days, we departed; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, until we were out of the city; and we knelt down on the shore and prayed.
ACT.21.6	And when we had taken our leave one of another, we embarked on the ship, and they returned home again.
ACT.21.7	And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais and saluted the brethren and abode with them one day.
ACT.21.8	And the next day Paul and those of us that were with him departed and came unto Caesarea; and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and abode with him.
ACT.21.9	And he had four daughters, virgins, who prophesied.
ACT.21.10	And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
ACT.21.11	And when he was come unto us, he took Paul’s girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owns this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
ACT.21.12	And when we heard these things, both we and those of that place besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.13	Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
ACT.21.14	And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, Let the will of the Lord be done.
ACT.21.15	And after those days we packed our baggage and went up to Jerusalem.
ACT.21.16	There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.
ACT.21.17	And when we arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
ACT.21.18	And the day following, Paul went in with us to see James, and all the elders were gathered.
ACT.21.19	And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
ACT.21.20	And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous of the law;
ACT.21.21	and they are informed of thee that thou teachest all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.
ACT.21.22	What is it therefore? The multitude must needs come together, for they will hear that thou art come.
ACT.21.23	Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men among us who have a vow on them;
ACT.21.24	them take, and purify thyself with them, and pay their expenses, that they may shave their heads, and all may know that those things, of which they were informed concerning thee, are nothing, but that thou thyself dost also walk orderly and keep the law.
ACT.21.25	As touching the Gentiles who believe, we have written and concluded that they observe no such thing, except only that they keep themselves from things offered to idols and from blood and from that which has been strangled and from fornication.
ACT.21.26	Then Paul took the men and the next day, purifying himself with them, entered into the temple to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification until an offering should be offered for each one of them.
ACT.21.27	And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews, who were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people and laid hands on him,
ACT.21.28	crying out, Men of Israel, help; this is the man that teaches everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place and further brought Greeks also into the temple and has polluted this holy place.
ACT.21.29	(For before this they had seen Trophimus, an Ephesian, with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)
ACT.21.30	So that all the city was moved, and the people ran together; and they took Paul and drew him out of the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.
ACT.21.31	And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the tribunal of the company that all Jerusalem was in an uproar
ACT.21.32	who immediately took soldiers and centurions and ran down unto them; and when they saw the tribunal and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.
ACT.21.33	Then the tribunal came near and took him and commanded him to be bound with two chains and demanded to know who he was and what he had done.
ACT.21.34	And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude; and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the fortress.
ACT.21.35	And when he came upon the stairs, so it was that he was borne of the soldiers because of the violence of the people.
ACT.21.36	For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
ACT.21.37	And as Paul was to be led into the fortress, he said unto the tribunal, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
ACT.21.38	Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days made an uproar and led four thousand men out into the wilderness that were murderers?
ACT.21.39	But Paul said, I am certainly a Jew, a citizen of Tarsus, a city known in Cilicia; and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
ACT.21.40	And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spoke unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying,
ACT.22.1	Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defense which I make now unto you.
ACT.22.2	(And when they heard that he spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence, and he said,)
ACT.22.3	I am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel and taught according to the truth of the law of the fathers, zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
ACT.22.4	And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
ACT.22.5	As also the prince of the priests bears me witness, and all the estate of the elders, from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring those who were bound there unto Jerusalem to be punished.
ACT.22.6	And it came to pass that, as I made my journey and was come near unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
ACT.22.7	And I fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?
ACT.22.8	And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I Am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou dost persecute.
ACT.22.9	And those that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid, but they did not hear the voice of him that spoke to me.
ACT.22.10	And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise and go into Damascus, and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
ACT.22.11	And when I could not see for the clarity of that light, being led by the hand of those that were with me, I came into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good witness of all the Jews who dwelt there,
ACT.22.13	came unto me and stood and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
ACT.22.14	And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen thee that thou should know his will and see that Just One and should hear the voice of his mouth.
ACT.22.15	For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
ACT.22.16	And now why tarriest thou? Arise and be baptized and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.
ACT.22.17	And it came to pass that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a rapture of understanding
ACT.22.18	and saw him saying unto me, Make haste and go quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
ACT.22.19	And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and in every synagogue beat those that believed on thee;
ACT.22.20	and when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting unto his death and kept the raiment of those that slew him.
ACT.22.21	And he said unto me, Depart, for I will send thee far from here unto the Gentiles.
ACT.22.22	And they gave him audience unto this word and then lifted up their voices and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live.
ACT.22.23	And as they cried out and cast off their clothes and threw dust into the air,
ACT.22.24	the tribunal commanded him to be brought into the fortress and bade that he should be examined by scourging that he might know why they cried out so against him.
ACT.22.25	And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman and uncondemned?
ACT.22.26	When the centurion heard that, he went and told the tribunal, saying, Take heed what thou doest, for this man is a Roman.
ACT.22.27	Then the tribunal came and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yes.
ACT.22.28	And the tribunal answered, With a great sum I obtained this freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.
ACT.22.29	Then straightway those who should have tormented him departed from him, and the tribunal was also afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman and because he had bound him.
ACT.22.30	On the next day, because he wanted to know of certainty the cause for which he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands and commanded the princes of the priests and all their council to appear and brought Paul down and set him before them.
ACT.23.1	Then Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.
ACT.23.2	And the prince of the priests, Ananias, commanded those that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
ACT.23.3	Then Paul said unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whitewashed wall, for dost thou sit to judge me after the law and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?
ACT.23.4	And those that stood by said, Dost thou revile God’s high priest?
ACT.23.5	Then Paul said, I did not know, brethren, that he was the prince of the priests, for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
ACT.23.6	But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee, and of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
ACT.23.7	And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.
ACT.23.8	For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.
ACT.23.9	And there arose a great cry; and the scribes that were of the Pharisees’ part arose and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man, but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.
ACT.23.10	And when there arose a great dissension, the tribunal, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and to take him by force from among them and to bring him into the fortress.
ACT.23.11	And the night following the Lord stood by him and said, Be of good cheer, Paul, for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou also bear witness at Rome.
ACT.23.12	And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together and they vowed under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink until they had killed Paul.
ACT.23.13	And they were more than forty who had made this conspiracy.
ACT.23.14	And they came to the princes of the priests and the elders and said, We have made a vow of anathema that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul.
ACT.23.15	Now therefore ye with the council signify to the tribunal that he bring him down unto you tomorrow, as though ye would enquire something more certain concerning him, and we, before he arrives, are ready to kill him.
ACT.23.16	And when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their ambush, he went and entered into the fortress and told Paul.
ACT.23.17	Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him and said, Bring this young man unto the tribunal, for he has a certain thing to tell him.
ACT.23.18	So he took him and brought him to the tribunal and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto him and asked me to bring this young man unto thee, who has something to say unto thee.
ACT.23.19	Then the tribunal took him by the hand and went with him aside privately and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?
ACT.23.20	And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee that thou would bring down Paul tomorrow into the council, as though they would enquire something more certain of him.
ACT.23.21	But do not believe them, for more than forty of them lie in wait to ambush him, who have vowed under a curse that they will neither eat nor drink until they have killed him, and now they are ready, looking for a promise from thee.
ACT.23.22	So the tribunal then let the young man depart and charged him, See thou tell no one that thou hast showed these things to me.
ACT.23.23	And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea and seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen, at the third hour of the night
ACT.23.24	and provide them beasts that they may set Paul on and bring him safe unto Felix the governor.
ACT.23.25	And he wrote a letter after this manner:
ACT.23.26	Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix sends greeting.
ACT.23.27	This man was taken of the Jews and should have been killed by them; then I came with an army and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
ACT.23.28	And when I desired to know the cause of why they accused him, I brought him forth into their council,
ACT.23.29	whom I found to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
ACT.23.30	And when it was told me how the Jews lay in wait to ambush the man, I sent straightway to thee and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.
ACT.23.31	Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
ACT.23.32	On the next day they left the horsemen to go with him and returned to the fortress,
ACT.23.33	who, when they came to Caesarea and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
ACT.23.34	And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia,
ACT.23.35	I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s judgment hall.
ACT.24.1	And after five days Ananias, the prince of the priests, descended with the elders and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
ACT.24.2	And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great peace and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy prudence,
ACT.24.3	we accept it always and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
ACT.24.4	Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou would hear us of thy clemency a few words.
ACT.24.5	For we have found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world and prince of the seditious sect of the Nazarenes,
ACT.24.6	who also has gone about to profane the temple, whom we took and would have judged according to our law.
ACT.24.7	But the tribunal Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,
ACT.24.8	commanding his accusers to come unto thee; by examining of whom thou may take knowledge of all these things, of which we accuse him.
ACT.24.9	And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
ACT.24.10	Then Paul, after the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself;
ACT.24.11	because thou art able to understand that there have been but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
ACT.24.12	And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city,
ACT.24.13	neither can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.
ACT.24.14	But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call a sect, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets,
ACT.24.15	and have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
ACT.24.16	And for this reason do I exercise myself to have always a conscience void of offense toward God and toward men.
ACT.24.17	Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation and offerings.
ACT.24.18	Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult,
ACT.24.19	who ought to have been here before thee and object if they had anything against me.
ACT.24.20	Or else let these same here say if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
ACT.24.21	except it be for this one voice, that I cried out standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead, I am called in question by you this day.
ACT.24.22	And when Felix heard these things, he deferred them, saying, I shall have more information regarding that way, when Lysias the tribunal shall come down, Then I will know the uttermost of your matter.
ACT.24.23	And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his own to minister or come unto him.
ACT.24.24	And after certain days when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard of him the faith which is in Christ.
ACT.24.25	And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come, Felix trembled and answered, Go away for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
ACT.24.26	He hoped also that money should have been given him from Paul, that he might loose him; therefore he sent for him many times and communed with him.
ACT.24.27	But after two years Felix received Porcius Festus as successor; and Felix, wanting to win the grace of the Jews, left Paul bound.
ACT.25.1	Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
ACT.25.2	Then the prince of the priests and the principals of the Jews informed him against Paul and besought him,
ACT.25.3	asking for grace against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, they placing an ambush in the way to kill him.
ACT.25.4	But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea and that he himself would depart shortly there.
ACT.25.5	Let them, therefore, said he, who among you are able, go down with me and accuse this man, if there is anything in him.
ACT.25.6	And when he had tarried among them no more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea and the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, commanded Paul to be brought.
ACT.25.7	And when he was come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood round about and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
ACT.25.8	While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar have I sinned in anything at all.
ACT.25.9	But Festus, willing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, answered Paul and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
ACT.25.10	Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged; to the Jews I have done no wrong, as thou very well knowest.
ACT.25.11	For if I am an offender or have committed anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die; but if there are none of these things of which these accuse me, no one may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
ACT.25.12	Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.
ACT.25.13	And after certain days King Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
ACT.25.14	And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix,
ACT.25.15	about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the princes of the priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have vengeance against him.
ACT.25.16	To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before the one who is accused is face to face with his accusers and is given license to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
ACT.25.17	Therefore, when they were come here, without any delay on the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought forth.
ACT.25.18	Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed,
ACT.25.19	but had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
ACT.25.20	And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem and there be judged of these matters.
ACT.25.21	But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar.
ACT.25.22	Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
ACT.25.23	And the next day when Agrippa was come and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the tribunals and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment, Paul was brought forth.
ACT.25.24	Then Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem and also here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
ACT.25.25	But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death and that he himself has appealed to Augustus, I have determined to send him.
ACT.25.26	Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O King Agrippa, that, after examination, I might have something to write.
ACT.25.27	For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not to signify the crimes laid against him.
ACT.26.1	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand and answered for himself:
ACT.26.2	I esteem myself blessed, King Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee concerning all the things of which I am accused of the Jews,
ACT.26.3	especially because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews; therefore, I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
ACT.26.4	My manner of life from my youth, which from the beginning was among my own nation at Jerusalem, is known of all the Jews,
ACT.26.5	who knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most perfect sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
ACT.26.6	And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers;
ACT.26.7	unto which promise our twelve tribes, constantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
ACT.26.8	Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you that God should raise the dead?
ACT.26.9	I verily had thought that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
ACT.26.10	Which things I also did in Jerusalem, and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the princes of the priests, and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
ACT.26.11	And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities.
ACT.26.12	Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the princes of the priests,
ACT.26.13	at midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those who journeyed with me.
ACT.26.14	And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me? It is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
ACT.26.15	And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou dost persecute.
ACT.26.16	But rise and stand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things which thou hast seen and of those things in which I will appear unto thee;
ACT.26.17	delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee
ACT.26.18	to open their eyes and to turn them from darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive remission of sins and inheritance among those who are sanctified by the faith that is in me.
ACT.26.19	Whereupon, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision,
ACT.26.20	but I announced first unto those of Damascus and at Jerusalem and throughout all the coasts of Judaea and then to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of repentance.
ACT.26.21	For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple and went about to kill me.
ACT.26.22	Having, therefore, obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said should come:
ACT.26.23	that the Christ should suffer and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead and should show light unto this people and to the Gentiles.
ACT.26.24	And as he spoke these things and answered for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
ACT.26.25	But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth words of truth and temperance.
ACT.26.26	For the king knows of these things, before whom I also speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him, for this thing was not done in a corner.
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, dost thou believe the prophets? I know that thou believest.
ACT.26.28	Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.
ACT.26.29	And Paul said, I desire before God that by little or by much, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, were such as I am, except these bonds.
ACT.26.30	And when he had said these things, the king rose up and the governor and Bernice and those that sat with them;
ACT.26.31	and when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
ACT.26.32	Then Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
ACT.27.1	But when it was determined that we should sail unto Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a centurion of the Augustus company.
ACT.27.2	And entering into the ship, Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia, one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
ACT.27.3	And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously entreated Paul and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
ACT.27.4	And when we had launched from there, we sailed under Cyprus because the winds were contrary.
ACT.27.5	And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
ACT.27.6	And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, and he put us in it.
ACT.27.7	And when we had sailed slowly many days and scarce were come over against Cnidus, the wind not allowing us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone,
ACT.27.8	and, passing it with difficulty, came unto a place which is called The Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
ACT.27.9	Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,
ACT.27.10	saying, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
ACT.27.11	Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
ACT.27.12	And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, many were in agreement to depart from there also, if by any means they might attain to Phenice and winter there, which is a port of Crete and lies toward Africa and the west.
ACT.27.13	And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, raising sails, they sailed close by Crete.
ACT.27.14	But not long after, there arose against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon. {devastating cold north wind from Europe}
ACT.27.15	And when the ship was caught up by it and could not resist against the wind, the ship was taken by the wind and drifted.
ACT.27.16	And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat,
ACT.27.17	Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should fall into Syrtis, {or the sandbanks}, struck sail and so were driven.
ACT.27.18	And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day they lightened the ship;
ACT.27.19	and the third day with our own hands we cast off the dead works of the ship.
ACT.27.20	And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared and no small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then lost.
ACT.27.21	Then after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from Crete to have avoided this harm and loss.
ACT.27.22	And now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of any person’s life among you, but only of the ship.
ACT.27.23	For the angel of God stood by me this night, whose I am and whom I serve,
ACT.27.24	saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar; and, behold, God has given thee all those that sail with thee.
ACT.27.25	Therefore, sirs, be of good cheer; for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
ACT.27.26	However we must be cast upon a certain island.
ACT.27.27	And when the fourteenth night was come as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic sea, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country
ACT.27.28	and sounded and found it twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again and found it fifteen fathoms.
ACT.27.29	Then fearing lest we should fall upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern and wished for the day.
ACT.27.30	And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
ACT.27.31	Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
ACT.27.32	Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat and let her fall off.
ACT.27.33	And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take food, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have waited and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
ACT.27.34	Therefore I pray you to take some food, for this is for your salvation and health, for there shall not one hair fall from the head of any of you.
ACT.27.35	And when he had thus spoken, he took bread and gave thanks to God in presence of them all; and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
ACT.27.36	Then they were all of good cheer, and they also took some food.
ACT.27.37	And we were in all, in the ship, two hundred and seventy-six souls.
ACT.27.38	And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and cast out the grain into the sea.
ACT.27.39	And when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they discovered a certain gulf with a shore, into which they decided, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
ACT.27.40	And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea and loosed the rudder bands and hoisted up the mainsail to the wind and made toward shore.
ACT.27.41	But falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.
ACT.27.42	And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out and escape.
ACT.27.43	But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, frustrated this counsel and commanded that those who could swim should cast themselves first into the sea and get to land;
ACT.27.44	and the rest, some on boards and some on broken pieces of the ship. And so it came to pass that they were all saved by making it to land.
ACT.28.1	And when they were escaped, then we knew that the island was called Melita. {or Malta}
ACT.28.2	And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness; for they kindled a great fire and received all of us because of the present rain and because of the cold.
ACT.28.3	And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out of the heat and fastened on his hand.
ACT.28.4	And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet vengeance does not suffer him to live.
ACT.28.5	And he shook off the beast into the fire and felt no harm.
ACT.28.6	But they were waiting to see when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly; but after they had waited a great while and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
ACT.28.7	In the same quarters were possessions of a principal man of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and lodged us three days courteously.
ACT.28.8	And it came to pass that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of dysentery, to whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him.
ACT.28.9	So when this was done, others also, who had diseases in the island, came and were healed,
ACT.28.10	who also honoured us with many gifts; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.
ACT.28.11	And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose ensign was Castor and Pollux.
ACT.28.12	And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
ACT.28.13	And having gone around, we came to Rhegium, and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli,
ACT.28.14	where we found brethren, who asked us to tarry with them seven days, and so we went toward Rome.
ACT.28.15	And from there, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and The Three Taverns whom when Paul saw, he thanked God and took courage.
ACT.28.16	And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the praetorian prefect, but Paul was allowed to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
ACT.28.17	And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the principals of the Jews together, and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,
ACT.28.18	who, when they had examined me, would have let me go because there was no cause of death in me.
ACT.28.19	But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar, not that I had anything to accuse my nation of.
ACT.28.20	For this cause therefore I have called for you, to see you and to speak with you: because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
ACT.28.21	And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came showed or spoke any harm of thee.
ACT.28.22	But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for as concerning this sect, we know that everywhere it is spoken against.
ACT.28.23	And when they had appointed him a day, many came to him into his lodging, to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, procuring to persuade them of that concerning Jesus, the Christ, out of the law of Moses and out of the prophets, from morning until evening.
ACT.28.24	And some believed the things which were spoken, and some did not believe.
ACT.28.25	And when they did not agree among themselves, they departed, after Paul had spoken this word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit by Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,
ACT.28.26	saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see and not perceive;
ACT.28.27	for the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them.
ACT.28.28	Be it known, therefore, unto you that this saving health of God is sent unto the Gentiles and that they will hear it.
ACT.28.29	And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had a great dispute among themselves.
ACT.28.30	And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house and received all that came in unto him,
ACT.28.31	preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all liberty, without hindrance.
ROM.1.1	Paul, slave of Jesus, the Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God
ROM.1.2	(which he had promised before by his prophets in the holy scriptures)
ROM.1.3	of his Son (who was born unto him of the seed of David according to the flesh,
ROM.1.4	who was declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of sanctification, by the resurrection from the dead), of Jesus, the Christ, our Lord.
ROM.1.5	By whom we have received the grace and the apostleship, to cause the faith to be obeyed among all the Gentiles in his name,
ROM.1.6	among whom ye are also the called of Jesus Christ;
ROM.1.7	to all that are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints; ye have grace and peace of God our Father and of the Lord Jesus, the Christ.
ROM.1.8	First, I thank my God through Jesus, the Christ, regarding you all, that your faith is preached in all the world.
ROM.1.9	For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I always remember you in my prayers,
ROM.1.10	making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.
ROM.1.11	For I long to see you that I may impart with you some spiritual gift to confirm you,
ROM.1.12	that is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.
ROM.1.13	Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that many times I purposed to come unto you (but up until now I have been unable) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.
ROM.1.14	I am debtor both to the Greeks and to the Barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.
ROM.1.15	So, as much as in me is, I am ready to announce the gospel to you that are at Rome also.
ROM.1.16	For I am not ashamed of the gospel of the Christ; for it is the power of God to give saving health to every one that believes: to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
ROM.1.17	For in him is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The just shall live by faith.
ROM.1.18	For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and injustice of men, who hold back the truth with injustice;
ROM.1.19	because that which is known of God is manifest to them; for God has showed it unto them.
ROM.1.20	For the invisible things of him, his eternal power and divinity, are clearly understood by the creation of the world and by the things that are made so that there is no excuse;
ROM.1.21	because having known God, they did not glorify him as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.
ROM.1.22	Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools
ROM.1.23	and exchanged the glory of the incorruptible God for the likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and of fourfooted beasts and of serpents.
ROM.1.24	Therefore God also gave them over to the lusts of their own hearts for uncleanness, to contaminate their own bodies between themselves,
ROM.1.25	who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed for all ages. Amen.
ROM.1.26	For this cause God gave them up unto shameful affections, for even their women changed the natural use into that which is against nature;
ROM.1.27	and likewise also the males, leaving the natural use of the females, burned in their lust one toward another, males with males committing nefarious works and receiving in themselves the recompense that proceeded from their error.
ROM.1.28	And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a perverse understanding, to do those things which are not convenient,
ROM.1.29	being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,
ROM.1.30	backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,
ROM.1.31	without understanding, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, without mercy.
ROM.1.32	Who having understood the righteousness of God, they did not understand that those who do such things are worthy of death, not only those that do the same, but even those who encourage those that do them.
ROM.2.1	Therefore, thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest; for in that which thou dost judge another, thou dost condemn thyself; for thou that judgest others doest the same things.
ROM.2.2	For we are sure that the judgment of God is according to the truth against those who do such things.
ROM.2.3	And dost thou think this, O man, that judgest those who do such things and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?
ROM.2.4	Or dost thou despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering, ignoring that the goodness of God leads thee to repentance?
ROM.2.5	But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasures up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God,
ROM.2.6	who will render to everyone according to his deeds:
ROM.2.7	to those who persevered in well doing, glory and honour and incorruption, to those who seek eternal life;
ROM.2.8	but unto those that are contentious and do not obey the truth, but are persuaded by unrighteousness, indignation and wrath.
ROM.2.9	Tribulation and anguish shall be upon every human soul that does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek;
ROM.2.10	but glory, honour, and peace to everyone that works good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
ROM.2.11	For there is no respect of persons with God.
ROM.2.12	For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law
ROM.2.13	(for not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified;
ROM.2.14	for when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature that which is of the law, these, not having the law, are a law unto themselves;
ROM.2.15	which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, accusing and also excusing their reasonings one with another)
ROM.2.16	in the day when God shall judge that which men have covered up, according to my gospel by Jesus, the Christ.
ROM.2.17	Behold, thou doth call thyself a Jew and art supported by the law and doth glory in God
ROM.2.18	and dost know his will and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,
ROM.2.19	and art confident that thou thyself art a guide of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness,
ROM.2.20	an instructor of the ignorant, a teacher of children, who hast the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.
ROM.2.21	Thou, therefore, who teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? Thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?
ROM.2.22	Thou that sayest a man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? Thou that dost abhor idols, dost thou commit sacrilege?
ROM.2.23	Thou that makest thy boast of the law, with rebellion to the law doth thou dishonour God?
ROM.2.24	For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written.
ROM.2.25	For circumcision verily profits if thou keep the law, but if thou art a rebel to the law, thy circumcision is made into a foreskin.
ROM.2.26	Therefore if the uncircumcised keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his foreskin be counted for circumcision?
ROM.2.27	And that which is by nature foreskin, but keeps the law perfectly, shall judge thee who with the letter and with the circumcision art rebellious to the law.
ROM.2.28	For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is circumcision that which is done outwardly in the flesh;
ROM.2.29	but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.
ROM.3.1	What advantage then has the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
ROM.3.2	Much in every way: first, certainly, that the oracles of God have been entrusted unto them.
ROM.3.3	For what if some of them did not believe? Shall their unbelief have made the truth of God without effect?
ROM.3.4	No, in no wise: for God is true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou might be justified in thy words and might overcome when thou dost judge.
ROM.3.5	And if our iniquity commends the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Shall for this reason God be unjust who sends punishment? (I speak as a man.)
ROM.3.6	No, in no wise: for then how shall God judge the world?
ROM.3.7	For if the truth of God has more abounded through my lie unto his glory, why even so am I also judged as a sinner?
ROM.3.8	And why not say (as we are slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say), Let us do evil, that good may come? The condemnation of whom is just.
ROM.3.9	What then? Are we better than they? No, in no wise; for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles that they are all under sin;
ROM.3.10	as it is written, There is no one righteous, no, not one;
ROM.3.11	there is no one that understands; there is no one that seeks after God.
ROM.3.12	They are all gone out of the way; they are together become unprofitable; there is no one that does good, no, not one.
ROM.3.13	Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips,
ROM.3.14	whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;
ROM.3.15	their feet are swift to shed blood;
ROM.3.16	destruction and misery are in their ways,
ROM.3.17	and the way of peace they have not known;
ROM.3.18	there is no fear of God before their eyes.
ROM.3.19	Now we know that all that the law says, it says to those who are under the law, that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may submit themselves unto God.
ROM.3.20	For by the deeds of the law, no flesh shall be justified in his sight; for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
ROM.3.21	But now, without the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets:
ROM.3.22	the righteousness, that is, of God by the faith of Jesus, the Christ, for all and upon all those that believe in him, for there is no difference;
ROM.3.23	for all have sinned and are made destitute of the glory of God,
ROM.3.24	being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus, the Christ,
ROM.3.25	whom God purposed for reconciliation through faith in his blood for the manifestation of his righteousness, for the remission of sins that are past, by the patience of God,
ROM.3.26	manifesting in this time his righteousness that he only be the just one and the justifier of him that is of the faith of Jesus.
ROM.3.27	Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No, but by the law of faith.
ROM.3.28	Therefore, we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
ROM.3.29	Is he the God of the Jews only? Is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,
ROM.3.30	seeing it is one God who shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision by faith.
ROM.3.31	Do we then make void the law through faith? No, in no wise; to the contrary, we establish the law.
ROM.4.1	What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?
ROM.4.2	For if Abraham were justified by works, he has reason to glory in himself, but not before God.
ROM.4.3	For what does the scripture say? Abraham believed God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness.
ROM.4.4	But unto him that works, the reward is not reckoned as grace, but as debt.
ROM.4.5	But to him that does not work, but believes in him that justifies the ungodly, the faith is counted as righteousness.
ROM.4.6	Even as David also describes the blessedness of the man unto whom God doth attribute righteousness without works,
ROM.4.7	saying, Blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered.
ROM.4.8	Blessed is the man to whom the Lord does not impute sin.
ROM.4.9	Is this blessedness, therefore, only upon the circumcision or also upon the uncircumcision? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham as righteousness.
ROM.4.10	How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.
ROM.4.11	And he received the circumcision as a sign, as a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, yet being uncircumcised, that he might be the father of all the uncircumcised believers, that it might be counted unto them also as righteousness,
ROM.4.12	that he be the father of the circumcision: not only to those who are of the circumcision, but also unto those who walk in the steps of the faith that was in our father Abraham before he was circumcised.
ROM.4.13	For the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.
ROM.4.14	For if those who are of the law are the heirs, faith is in vain, and the promise annulled,
ROM.4.15	because the law works wrath; for where there is no law, there is no rebellion either.
ROM.4.16	Therefore by faith, that it might be by grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to that which is of the law, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
ROM.4.17	as it is written, As a father of many Gentiles have I placed thee before God, whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which are not as those that are.
ROM.4.18	Who believed to wait against all hope, that he might become the father of many Gentiles, according to that which had been spoken unto him, So shall thy seed be.
ROM.4.19	And he did not weaken in faith: he considered not his own body now dead when he was about one hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sara’s womb;
ROM.4.20	he doubted not the promise of God, with unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God,
ROM.4.21	being fully persuaded that he was also powerful to do all that he had promised;
ROM.4.22	therefore, his faith was also attributed unto him as righteousness.
ROM.4.23	Now it is not written for his sake alone that it was so reckoned to him,
ROM.4.24	but for us also to whom it shall be so reckoned, that is, to those that believe in him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,
ROM.4.25	who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justification.
ROM.5.1	Justified therefore by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus, the Christ,
ROM.5.2	by whom we also have access by faith into this grace in which we stand and glory in hope of the glory of the sons of God.
ROM.5.3	And not only this, but we even glory in the tribulations, knowing that the tribulation works patience;
ROM.5.4	and patience, experience; and experience, hope;
ROM.5.5	and the hope shall not be ashamed, because the love of God is poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given unto us.
ROM.5.6	For the Christ, when we were yet weak, in his time died for the ungodly.
ROM.5.7	For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
ROM.5.8	But God increased the price of his charity toward us in that while we were yet sinners the Christ died for us.
ROM.5.9	Then much more now justified in his blood, we shall be saved from wrath by him.
ROM.5.10	For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled with God by the death of his Son, much more, now reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.
ROM.5.11	And not only this, but we even glory in God through our Lord Jesus, the Christ, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.
ROM.5.12	Therefore, in the manner which sin entered into the world by one man, and because of sin, death; and so death passed upon all men in the one in whom all sinned.
ROM.5.13	For until the law, sin was in the world; but the sin was not imputed, there being no law.
ROM.5.14	Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even in those that did not sin after the manner of the rebellion of Adam, who is a figure of him that was to come.
ROM.5.15	But not as the offense, so also is the gift. For if through the offense of that one many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of one man, Jesus the Christ, has abounded unto many.
ROM.5.16	Nor was it in the same manner as by one sin, likewise also the gift; for the judgment truly came of one sin unto condemnation, but grace came of many offenses unto justification.
ROM.5.17	For if by one offense, death reigned because of one man; much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of gifts and of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus the Christ.
ROM.5.18	Therefore, in the same manner that by the iniquity of one guilt came upon all men unto condemnation, even so by the righteousness of one, grace came upon all men unto justification of life.
ROM.5.19	For as by one man’s disobedience, many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.
ROM.5.20	Moreover the law entered that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound,
ROM.5.21	so that in the same manner as sin has reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus, the Christ, our Lord.
ROM.6.1	What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?
ROM.6.2	No, in no wise. How shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein?
ROM.6.3	Know ye not that all of us that are baptized into Jesus the Christ are baptized into his death?
ROM.6.4	For we are buried with him by baptism into death, that just as the Christ was raised up from the dead to the glory of the Father, likewise we also walk in newness of life.
ROM.6.5	For if we have been planted together in him in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection,
ROM.6.6	knowing this: that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that we should not serve sin any longer.
ROM.6.7	For he that is dead is justified from sin.
ROM.6.8	Now if we die with the Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him,
ROM.6.9	knowing that the Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death has no more dominion over him.
ROM.6.10	For he that is dead died unto sin once, and he that lives, lives unto God.
ROM.6.11	Likewise also reckon yourselves to be truly dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ, Jesus, our Lord.
ROM.6.12	Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
ROM.6.13	Neither present your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but present yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
ROM.6.14	So that sin shall have no dominion over you; for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
ROM.6.15	What then? shall we sin because we are not under the law, but under grace? No, in no wise.
ROM.6.16	Or know ye not that to whom ye present yourselves slaves to obey, his slaves ye are to whom ye obey, whether of sin unto death or of the obedience unto righteousness?
ROM.6.17	Thank God that, although ye were the slaves of sin, ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine unto which ye are delivered;
ROM.6.18	and freed from sin, ye are become the slaves of righteousness.
ROM.6.19	I speak a human thing because of the weakness of our flesh: that as ye presented your members to serve uncleanness and iniquity unto iniquity, likewise now present your members to serve righteousness unto holiness.
ROM.6.20	For being previously the slaves of sin, now ye have been made the slaves of righteousness.
ROM.6.21	What fruit had ye then in those things of which ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
ROM.6.22	But now freed from sin and made slaves to God, ye have as your fruit sanctification and as the end, everlasting life.
ROM.6.23	For the wages of sin is death, but the grace of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.7.1	Know ye not, brethren (for I speak to those that know the law), that the law has dominion over a man only as long as he lives?
ROM.7.2	For the woman who is subject to a husband is obligated to the law so long as the husband lives; but if the husband dies, she is free from the law of the husband.
ROM.7.3	So then if, while her husband lives, she belongs to another man, she shall be called an adulteress; but if her husband dies, she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress if she belongs to another man.
ROM.7.4	Likewise ye also, my brethren, are become dead to the law in the body of the Christ that ye should belong to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
ROM.7.5	For while we were in the flesh, the affections of the sins which were by the law worked in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
ROM.7.6	But now we are free from the law of death in which we were held, that we might serve in newness of Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
ROM.7.7	What shall we say then? Is the law sin? No, in no wise. But, I did not know sin except by the law; for neither would I have known lust if the law did not say, Thou shalt not covet.
ROM.7.8	Then sin, when there was occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of lust. For without the law sin was as if it were dormant.
ROM.7.9	So that without the law I lived for some time; but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
ROM.7.10	And I found that the same commandment, which was unto life, was mortal unto me.
ROM.7.11	For sin, having had occasion, deceived me by the commandment and by it killed me.
ROM.7.12	So the law is truly holy, and the commandment holy and just and good.
ROM.7.13	Was then that which is good made death unto me? No, in no wise. But sin, to show itself sin by that which is good, worked death in me, making sin exceedingly sinful by the commandment.
ROM.7.14	For we now know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold unto subjection by sin.
ROM.7.15	For that which I do, I do not understand, and not even the good that I desire is what I do; but what I hate, that is what I do.
ROM.7.16	If then I do that which I do not desire, I approve that the law is good.
ROM.7.17	So that it is no longer I that do it, but sin that dwells in me.
ROM.7.18	And I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) dwells no good thing; for I have the desire, but I am not able to perform that which is good.
ROM.7.19	For I do not do the good that I desire; but the evil which I do not desire, that I do.
ROM.7.20	And if I do that which I do not desire, I am not working, but sin that dwells in me.
ROM.7.21	So that, desiring to do good, I find this law: evil is natural unto me.
ROM.7.22	For I delight with the law of God with the inward man,
ROM.7.23	but I see another law in my members which rebels against the law of my mind, bringing captive unto the law of sin which is in my members.
ROM.7.24	O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
ROM.7.25	The grace of God, by Jesus, the Christ, our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.
ROM.8.1	So that now, there is no condemnation to those who are in Christ, Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
ROM.8.2	For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ, Jesus, has made me free from the law of sin and death.
ROM.8.3	For that which was impossible to the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh
ROM.8.4	that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.
ROM.8.5	For those that are according to the flesh know the things that are of the flesh; but those that are according to the Spirit, the things that are of the Spirit.
ROM.8.6	For the prudence of the flesh is death, but the prudence of the Spirit, life and peace,
ROM.8.7	because the prudence of the flesh is enmity against God; for it does not subject itself to the law of God, neither indeed can it.
ROM.8.8	So then, those that are carnal cannot please God.
ROM.8.9	But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, because the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, that person is not of him.
ROM.8.10	But if Christ is in you, the body is truly dead because of sin, but the Spirit is alive because of righteousness.
ROM.8.11	And if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he that raised up the Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.
ROM.8.12	Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
ROM.8.13	For if ye live according to the flesh, ye shall die; but if through the Spirit ye mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.
ROM.8.14	For all that are led by the Spirit of God, the same are sons of God.
ROM.8.15	For ye have not received the spirit of slavery to be in fear again, but ye have received the Spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.
ROM.8.16	For the same Spirit bears witness unto our spirit that we are sons of God,
ROM.8.17	and if sons, also heirs certainly of God and joint-heirs with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together with him.
ROM.8.18	For I know with certainty that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the coming glory which shall be manifested in us.
ROM.8.19	For the earnest hope of the creatures waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.
ROM.8.20	For the creatures were subjected to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who has subjected them,
ROM.8.21	with the hope that the same creatures shall be delivered from the slavery of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.
ROM.8.22	For we now know that all the creatures groan together and travail in pain together until now.
ROM.8.23	And not only they, but ourselves also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, that is to say, the redemption of our body.
ROM.8.24	For in hope we are saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for what a man sees, he does not wait for.
ROM.8.25	But if we wait for that which we do not see, with patience we wait for it.
ROM.8.26	And likewise also the Spirit helps our weakness; for we know not how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit itself makes entreaty for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
ROM.8.27	But he that searches the hearts knows what is the desire of the Spirit, that according to the will of God, he makes entreaty for the saints.
ROM.8.28	And we now know that unto those who love God, all things help them unto good, to those who according to the purpose are called to be saints.
ROM.8.29	For unto those whom he knew beforehand, he also marked out beforehand the way that they might be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.
ROM.8.30	And unto those whom he did mark out beforehand the way, to these he also called; and to whom he called, these he also justified; and to whom he justified, these he also glorified.
ROM.8.31	What shall we then say to these things? If God is for us, who shall be against us?
ROM.8.32	He that did not spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not also give us all things with him?
ROM.8.33	Who shall accuse the chosen of God’s? God is he that justifies them.
ROM.8.34	Who is he that condemns them? Christ, Jesus, is he who died and, even more, he that also rose again, who furthermore is at the right hand of God, who also makes entreaty for us.
ROM.8.35	Who shall separate us from the charity of Christ? shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?
ROM.8.36	(As it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.)
ROM.8.37	Nevertheless, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us.
ROM.8.38	Therefore I am certain that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come
ROM.8.39	nor height nor depth nor any creature shall be able to separate us from the charity of God, which is in Christ, Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I say the truth in Christ, I do not lie, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit,
ROM.9.2	that I have great sorrow and continual pain in my heart.
ROM.9.3	For I could wish that myself were anathema from Christ for my brethren, those who are my kinsmen according to the flesh,
ROM.9.4	who are Israelites, to whom pertains the adoption as sons and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the law and the service of God and the promises,
ROM.9.5	whose are the fathers, and of whom as concerning the flesh is the Christ, who is God over all things, blessed for all the ages. Amen.
ROM.9.6	Not as though the word of God has been deficient. For not all the descendants of Israel are Israelites;
ROM.9.7	neither, because they are the seed of Abraham, are all sons, but, In Isaac shall thy seed be called.
ROM.9.8	That is, Those who are sons of the flesh, these are not the sons of God; but those who are sons of the promise are counted in the generation.
ROM.9.9	For the word of the promise is this, At this time I will come, and Sara shall have a son.
ROM.9.10	And not only this, but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac
ROM.9.11	(for the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand: not of works, but of him that calls),
ROM.9.12	it was said unto her, The elder shall serve the younger.
ROM.9.13	As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
ROM.9.14	What shall we say then? Is there injustice in God? No, in no wise.
ROM.9.15	For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.
ROM.9.16	So then it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that has mercy.
ROM.9.17	For the scripture saith of Pharaoh, Even for this same purpose have I raised thee up, that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth.
ROM.9.18	Therefore he has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and he hardens whom he will.
ROM.9.19	Thou wilt say then unto me, Why does he become angry? For who shall resist his will?
ROM.9.20	Rather, O man, who art thou to reply against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?
ROM.9.21	Has not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour and another unto dishonour?
ROM.9.22	What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much meekness the vessels of wrath, prepared for death,
ROM.9.23	and making known the riches of his glory on the vessels of mercy, which he has prepared unto glory?
ROM.9.24	Even us, whom he has called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles!
ROM.9.25	As he saith also in Hosea, I will call them my people, who were not my people, and her beloved, who was not beloved.
ROM.9.26	And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called sons of the living God.
ROM.9.27	Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel, Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant shall be saved;
ROM.9.28	when the consumption comes to an end, righteousness shall overflow, because a short sentence will the Lord execute upon the earth.
ROM.9.29	And as Isaiah said before, Except the Lord of the hosts had left us a seed, we had been as Sodom and been made like unto Gomorrha.
ROM.9.30	What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, who did not follow after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, that is to say, the righteousness which is by faith,
ROM.9.31	and Israel, which followed after the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law of righteousness.
ROM.9.32	Why? Because they followed it not by faith but, as it were, by the works (of the law); therefore, they stumbled on the stumblingstone;
ROM.9.33	as it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock that will cause some to fall, and whosoever believes in him shall not be ashamed.
ROM.10.1	Brethren, certainly the desire of my heart and my prayer to God regarding Israel, is for saving health.
ROM.10.2	For I give testimony that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.
ROM.10.3	For they, being ignorant of God’s righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.
ROM.10.4	For Christ is the end of the law, to give righteousness to every one that believes.
ROM.10.5	For Moses describes the righteousness which is by the law, That the man who does those things shall live by them.
ROM.10.6	But thus saith the righteousness which is by faith, Say not in thine heart, Who shall ascend into heaven (that is, to bring the Christ down from above)?
ROM.10.7	Or, Who shall descend into the deep (that is, to bring up the Christ again from the dead)?
ROM.10.8	But what does it say? The word is near thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach,
ROM.10.9	that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.
ROM.10.10	For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto saving health.
ROM.10.11	For the scripture says, Whosoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.
ROM.10.12	For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.
ROM.10.13	For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
ROM.10.14	How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
ROM.10.15	And how shall they preach if they have not been sent? as it is written, How beautiful are the feet of those that announce the gospel of peace, of those that announce the gospel of that which is good!
ROM.10.16	But not everyone hearkens unto the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed our report?
ROM.10.17	So then faith comes by hearing, and the ear to hear by the word of God.
ROM.10.18	But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their fame went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world.
ROM.10.19	But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses says, I will provoke you unto jealousy with people that are not mine, and with ignorant people I will provoke you to anger.
ROM.10.20	But Isaiah is very bold and says, I was found by those that did not seek me; I manifested myself unto those that did not ask after me.
ROM.10.21	And against Israel he says, All day long I have stretched forth my hands unto a disobedient and gainsaying people.
ROM.11.1	I say then, Has God cast away his people? No, in no wise. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
ROM.11.2	God has not cast away his people whom he knew beforehand. Know ye not what the scripture says of Elijah? how speaking to God against Israel, he said,
ROM.11.3	Lord, they have killed thy prophets and ruined thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
ROM.11.4	But what did the answer of God say unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee before Baal.
ROM.11.5	Even so then at this present time also, there is a remnant by the gracious election of God.
ROM.11.6	And if by grace, then is it not by works; otherwise, the grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, then it is no longer grace; otherwise, the work is no longer work.
ROM.11.7	What then? Israel has not obtained that which he seeks after; but the elect have obtained it, and the rest were blinded
ROM.11.8	(according as it is written, God has given them the spirit of anguish, eyes with which they do not see and ears with which they do not hear) unto this day.
ROM.11.9	And David says, Let their table be turned into a snare and a net and a stumblingblock and a recompense unto them;
ROM.11.10	Let their eyes be darkened that they may not see, and bow down their back always.
ROM.11.11	I say then, Have they stumbled in such a manner that they should fall completely? No, in no wise; but rather through their fall, saving health is come unto the Gentiles to provoke them unto jealousy.
ROM.11.12	And if the fall of them is the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more shall their fullness be?
ROM.11.13	For (I call you Gentiles) inasmuch as I am truly the apostle of the Gentiles, my honorable ministry,
ROM.11.14	if in any manner I may provoke my nation to jealousy and cause some of them to be saved.
ROM.11.15	For if the casting away of them is the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
ROM.11.16	For if the firstfruit is holy, so shall the rest be; and if the root is holy, so shall be the branches.
ROM.11.17	And if some of the branches were broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert grafted in among them and hath been made participant of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree,
ROM.11.18	do not boast against the branches. But if thou boast, know that thou dost not bear the root, but the root thee.
ROM.11.19	Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.
ROM.11.20	Good; because of their unbelief they were broken off, but thou by faith art standing. Do not be highminded, but fear
ROM.11.21	that if God did not forgive the natural branches, neither shall he forgive thee.
ROM.11.22	Behold, therefore, the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity, but toward thee, goodness if thou continue in his goodness; otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
ROM.11.23	And even them, if they do not continue in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is powerful enough to graft them in again.
ROM.11.24	For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature and wert grafted contrary to nature into the good olive tree, how much more shall these, which are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?
ROM.11.25	For I would not, brethren, that ye ignore this mystery, that ye not be arrogant regarding yourselves: that blindness in part has happened in Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles are come in.
ROM.11.26	And even if all Israel were saved, as it is written: There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall take away the ungodliness from Jacob;
ROM.11.27	and this shall be my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins.
ROM.11.28	So that, as concerning the gospel, I have them for enemies for your sakes; but as touching the election of God, they are beloved for the fathers’ sakes.
ROM.11.29	For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
ROM.11.30	For as ye in time past have not obeyed God, yet have now obtained mercy through the occasion of their disobedience,
ROM.11.31	likewise these also have not believed now that through the mercy shown unto you they also may obtain mercy.
ROM.11.32	For God enclosed everyone in disobedience, that he might have mercy upon everyone.
ROM.11.33	O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How incomprehensible are his judgments and his ways past finding out!
ROM.11.34	For who has understood the intent of the Lord? or who has been his counsellor?
ROM.11.35	Or who has first given unto him, that it be recompensed unto him again?
ROM.11.36	For of him and by him and in him are all things. To him be the glory for the ages. Amen.
ROM.12.1	Therefore, I beseech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies in living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing unto God, which is your rational worship.
ROM.12.2	And be not conformed to this age, but be ye transformed by the renewing of your soul that ye may experience what is that good and well pleasing and perfect will of God.
ROM.12.3	Therefore I say through the grace given unto me, to all those that are among you not to obtain more knowledge than is prudent to know, but to obtain knowledge with temperance, each one according to the measure of faith that God has dealt.
ROM.12.4	For in the manner that we have many members in one body, nevertheless all the members do not have the same operation;
ROM.12.5	likewise many of us are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
ROM.12.6	So that having different gifts according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, according to the measure of faith;
ROM.12.7	or ministry, in serving; or he that teaches, in doctrine;
ROM.12.8	he that exhorts, in exhortation; he that gives, let him do it in simplicity; he that presides, in earnest care; he that shows mercy, in cheerfulness.
ROM.12.9	Let love be without dissimulation, abhorring that which is evil, causing you to come unto that which is good;
ROM.12.10	loving one another with brotherly love, with honour preferring one another;
ROM.12.11	not slothful in earnest care, but fervent in the Spirit, serving the Lord,
ROM.12.12	rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, constant in prayer,
ROM.12.13	sharing for the needs of the saints, and given to hospitality.
ROM.12.14	Bless those who persecute you: bless, and do not curse.
ROM.12.15	Rejoice with those that rejoice and weep with those that weep.
ROM.12.16	Be unanimous among yourselves, not high minded, but accommodating the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion.
ROM.12.17	Not repaying anyone evil for evil; procuring that which is good not only in the sight of God, but even in the sight of all men.
ROM.12.18	If it can be done, as much as is possible on your part, live in peace with all men.
ROM.12.19	Not defending yourselves, dearly beloved; but rather give place unto the wrath of God, for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
ROM.12.20	Therefore, if thine enemy hungers, feed him; if he thirsts, give him drink; for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
ROM.12.21	Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
ROM.13.1	Let every soul submit itself to the higher powers. For there is no power but of God, and the powers that be are ordained of God.
ROM.13.2	Whosoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God, and those that resist shall receive condemnation to themselves.
ROM.13.3	For the magistrates are not a terror unto those who do good, but to the doer of evil. Is thy desire therefore to not fear the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same;
ROM.13.4	for he is a minister of God for thy good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain, for he is a minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that does evil.
ROM.13.5	Therefore it is necessary that ye be subject, not only for punishment, but also for conscience sake.
ROM.13.6	For this cause ye also pay them tribute, for they are God’s ministers, attending continually to this very thing.
ROM.13.7	Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
ROM.13.8	Owe no one anything, but love one unto another; for he that loves his neighbour has fulfilled the law.
ROM.13.9	For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not murder, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet, and if there is any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
ROM.13.10	Charity works no evil to a neighbour; therefore, charity is the fulfillment of the law.
ROM.13.11	And this, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awaken ourselves out of sleep, for now is our saving health nearer than when we believed.
ROM.13.12	The night is past, and the day is come; let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us clothe ourselves with the weapons of light.
ROM.13.13	Let us walk honestly, as in the day, not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
ROM.13.14	But be clothed with the Lord Jesus Christ, and do not listen to the flesh, to fulfil its desires.
ROM.14.1	Bear with the one who is sick in the faith, but not unto doubtful discernment.
ROM.14.2	For one believes that he may eat all things; another, who is sick, eats vegetables.
ROM.14.3	Let not him that eats despise him that does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him that eats; for God has raised him up.
ROM.14.4	Who art thou that judgest another man’s servant? By his own master he stands or falls; and if he falls, he shall be made to stand, for God is powerful to make him stand.
ROM.14.5	Also, some make a difference between one day and another; others esteem every day alike. Let each one be fully persuaded in his own soul.
ROM.14.6	He that observes the day, let him observe it unto the Lord; and he that does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He that eats, eats unto the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he that does not eat, unto the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks.
ROM.14.7	For none of us live for ourselves, and no one dies for himself.
ROM.14.8	For if we live, we live for the Lord; and if we die, we die for the Lord; whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord’s.
ROM.14.9	For to this end Christ both died and rose and revived: to thus exercise lordship over the dead as well as over the living.
ROM.14.10	But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou belittle thy brother? for we shall all stand before the tribunal of the Christ.
ROM.14.11	For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
ROM.14.12	So then each one of us shall give account of himself to God.
ROM.14.13	Let us, therefore, not judge one another any more, but judge this rather: that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother’s way.
ROM.14.14	I know and trust in the Lord Jesus that for his sake there is nothing unclean, but to him that esteems any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
ROM.14.15	But if thy brother is grieved because of thy food, now thou dost not walk in charity. Do not destroy him with thy food, for whom Christ died.
ROM.14.16	Let not then your good be evil spoken of;
ROM.14.17	for the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
ROM.14.18	For he that in these things serves the Christ is well pleasing unto God and approved of men.
ROM.14.19	Let us, therefore, follow after the things which make for peace and the edification of each one to the others.
ROM.14.20	Because of food, do not destroy the work of God. All things indeed are clean, but it is evil for that man who eats with offense.
ROM.14.21	It is good neither to eat flesh nor to drink wine nor do any thing by which thy brother stumbles or is offended or is sick.
ROM.14.22	Thou hast faith; have it to thyself before God. Blessed is he that does not condemn himself with that thing which he allows.
ROM.14.23	And he that makes a difference is condemned if he eats, because he does not eat by faith; and whatsoever is not out of faith is sin.
ROM.15.1	We then that are stronger ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not please ourselves.
ROM.15.2	Let each one of us please his neighbour in that which is good, unto edification.
ROM.15.3	For the Christ did not please himself; but, as it is written, The reproaches of those that reproached thee fell on me.
ROM.15.4	For the things that were written beforehand were written for our instruction that we, through patient endurance and through the comfort of the scriptures, might have hope.
ROM.15.5	Now the God of patience and consolation grant you to be unanimous among yourselves according to Christ Jesus,
ROM.15.6	that ye may with one accord and one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.15.7	Therefore bear one another, as the Christ also bore us, to the glory of God.
ROM.15.8	Now I say that Christ Jesus, was a minister of the circumcision, by the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers;
ROM.15.9	but that the Gentiles glorify God by mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess thee among the Gentiles and sing unto thy name.
ROM.15.10	And again he says, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.
ROM.15.11	And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and magnify him, all the peoples.
ROM.15.12	And again, Isaiah says, There shall be a root of Jesse and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him the Gentiles shall wait for salvation.
ROM.15.13	And believing, the God of hope fills you with all joy and peace that ye may abound in hope by the virtue of the Holy Spirit.
ROM.15.14	But I am convinced regarding you, my brethren, that even without my exhortation ye are full of charity, full of all knowledge, so as to be able to admonish one another.
ROM.15.15	Nevertheless I have written, brethren, in part boldly, as admonishing you by the grace that is given to me of God,
ROM.15.16	being the minister of Jesus Christ, to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering of the Gentiles might be well pleasing, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
ROM.15.17	Therefore I have something to boast of in Christ Jesus, with regard to God.
ROM.15.18	For I will not dare to speak of any of those things which Christ has not wrought by me, unto the obedience of the Gentiles, with word and with deed,
ROM.15.19	with power of signs and wonders, in virtue of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem and round about unto Illyricum, I have filled the entire area with the gospel of the Christ.
ROM.15.20	And in this manner I preached this gospel, not where Christ had been named previously, not to build upon a foundation belonging to another,
ROM.15.21	but, as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see, and those that have not heard shall understand.
ROM.15.22	For which reason I have even been hindered many times from coming to you.
ROM.15.23	But now having more place in these parts and having a great desire these many years to come unto you,
ROM.15.24	when I leave for Spain, I will come unto you; for I trust to see you on my journey and to be taken there by you, if first I may enjoy your company.
ROM.15.25	But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
ROM.15.26	For it has pleased those of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints who are in Jerusalem.
ROM.15.27	It has pleased them verily, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, they should also minister unto them in carnal things.
ROM.15.28	So that, when I have concluded this and have delivered unto them this fruit, I will come by you unto Spain.
ROM.15.29	For I know that when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of the Christ.
ROM.15.30	But I beseech you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the charity of the Spirit, that ye help me with prayers to God for me,
ROM.15.31	that I may be delivered from the disobedient in Judaea and that the offering of my service to the saints in Jerusalem may be accepted,
ROM.15.32	that I may come unto you with joy by the will of God and may be refreshed together with you.
ROM.15.33	Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.1	I commend unto you Phebe our sister, who is a servant of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} which is at Cenchrea,
ROM.16.2	that ye receive her in the Lord as a worthy saint, and that ye assist her in whatever thing in which she has need of you, for she has been a helper of many and of myself also.
ROM.16.3	Greet Priscilla and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus
ROM.16.4	(who have for my life laid down their own necks; unto whom not only I give thanks, but also all the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of the Gentiles);
ROM.16.5	likewise greet the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} in their house. Salute my wellbeloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia in Christ.
ROM.16.6	Greet Mary, who has laboured much with us.
ROM.16.7	Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellowprisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me.
ROM.16.8	Greet Amplias, my beloved in the Lord.
ROM.16.9	Salute Urbane, our helper in Christ, and Stachys, my beloved.
ROM.16.10	Salute Apelles, approved in Christ. Salute those who are of Aristobulus’ household.
ROM.16.11	Salute Herodion, my kinsman. Greet those that are of the household of Narcissus who are in the Lord.
ROM.16.12	Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, who labour in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, who laboured much in the Lord.
ROM.16.13	Salute Rufus, chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine.
ROM.16.14	Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren who are with them.
ROM.16.15	Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
ROM.16.16	Salute one another with a holy kiss. All the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Christ salute you.
ROM.16.17	And I beseech you, brethren, mark those who cause dissensions and offences outside of the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them.
ROM.16.18	For they that are such do not serve our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly and by smooth words and blessings deceive the hearts of the simple.
ROM.16.19	For your obedience is come abroad unto all places. I am glad therefore on your behalf, but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good and innocent concerning evil.
ROM.16.20	And let the God of peace bruise Satan under your feet quickly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
ROM.16.21	Timothy my fellow worker and Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.
ROM.16.22	I, Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord.
ROM.16.23	Gaius my host, and of the whole congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, salutes you. Erastus, the chamberlain of the city, salutes you, and Quartus, a brother.
ROM.16.24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.25	Now to him that is able to confirm you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which was concealed from times eternal
ROM.16.26	but now is made manifest, and by the writings of the prophets, by the commandment of God eternal, declared unto all the Gentiles, that they might hear and obey by faith,
ROM.16.27	to God, only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen.
1CO.1.1	Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes, our brother,
1CO.1.2	unto the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God which is at Corinth, to those that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be holy, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:
1CO.1.3	Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.4	I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which is given you in Christ Jesus,
1CO.1.5	that in every thing ye are enriched in him in all word and in all knowledge,
1CO.1.6	with which the testimony of the Christ was confirmed in you,
1CO.1.7	so that ye lack nothing in any gift, waiting for the manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1CO.1.8	who shall also confirm that ye shall remain unimpeachable unto the end, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.9	God is faithful, by whom ye were called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
1CO.1.10	Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that ye be perfect, joined together in the same understanding and in the same perception.
1CO.1.11	For it has been declared unto me of you, my brethren, by those of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.
1CO.1.12	In other words, that each one of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.
1CO.1.13	Is the Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized into the name of Paul?
1CO.1.14	I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius,
1CO.1.15	lest any should say that ye were baptized into my name.
1CO.1.16	And I baptized also the household of Stephanas; besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.
1CO.1.17	For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} of Christ should be made void.
1CO.1.18	For the word of the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} is foolishness to those that perish, but unto us who are saved, it is the power of God.
1CO.1.19	For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.
1CO.1.20	Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the philosopher of this world? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?
1CO.1.21	For in the wisdom of God, since the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save those that believe.
1CO.1.22	For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom,
1CO.1.23	but we preach Christ crucified, {Gr. Stauroo – hung on a stake}, unto the Jews a stumblingblock and unto the Gentiles foolishness;
1CO.1.24	but unto those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God, and the wisdom of God.
1CO.1.25	For that which is foolish of God is wiser than men, and that which is weak of God is stronger than men.
1CO.1.26	For look upon your vocation, brothers, that ye are not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble,
1CO.1.27	but rather God has chosen that which is the foolishness of the world to confound the wise, and God has chosen that which is the weakness of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty;
1CO.1.28	and that which is vile of the world and that which is despised God has chosen, and things which are not, to bring to nought the things that are,
1CO.1.29	that no flesh should glory in his presence.
1CO.1.30	But of him ye are reborn in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption,
1CO.1.31	that, according as it is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.
1CO.2.1	And I, brothers, when I came to you, came not with puffed up speech or wisdom to declare unto you the testimony of God.
1CO.2.2	For I judged not to know anything among you, except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
1CO.2.3	And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling.
1CO.2.4	And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
1CO.2.5	that your faith should not be founded in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.
1CO.2.6	For we speak perfect wisdom of God, and not the wisdom of this age nor of the princes of this age, that come to nought,
1CO.2.7	but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God predestined before the ages unto our glory,
1CO.2.8	which none of the princes of this age knew (for had they known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory).
1CO.2.9	But as it is written, That which eye has not seen nor ear heard neither has entered into the heart of man is that which God has prepared for those that love him.
1CO.2.10	But God has revealed this unto us by his Spirit, for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.
1CO.2.11	For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him? Even so no one has known the things of God, but the Spirit of God.
1CO.2.12	Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that God has given us.
1CO.2.13	Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teaches, but with doctrine of the Holy Spirit, jointly fitting spiritual things by spiritual means.
1CO.2.14	But the natural man does not perceive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
1CO.2.15	But he that is spiritual discerns all things, yet he is discerned by no one.
1CO.2.16	For who has known the understanding of the Lord? Who has instructed him? But we have the understanding of Christ.
1CO.3.1	And I, brothers, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.
1CO.3.2	I have fed you with milk, and not with solid food, for until now ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.
1CO.3.3	For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions, are ye not carnal and walk as men?
1CO.3.4	For while one says, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not carnal?
1CO.3.5	Who then is Paul? and who is Apollos? but servants by whom ye believed, each one according to that which the Lord gave.
1CO.3.6	I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.
1CO.3.7	So then neither is he that plants anything, neither he that waters, but God that gives the increase.
1CO.3.8	Now he that plants and he that waters are one although each one shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
1CO.3.9	For we are labourers together with God; ye are God’s husbandry, ye are God’s building.
1CO.3.10	According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds upon it. But let each one see how the building is built.
1CO.3.11	For no one can lay another foundation than that laid, which is Jesus the Christ.
1CO.3.12	Now if anyone builds upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble,
1CO.3.13	the work of each one shall be made manifest, for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire; the work of each one, whatever sort it is, the fire shall put it to test.
1CO.3.14	If the work of anyone abides which he has built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
1CO.3.15	If anyone’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss, but he himself shall be saved, yet so as by fire.
1CO.3.16	Know ye not that ye are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?
1CO.3.17	If anyone defiles the temple of God, God shall destroy that one; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
1CO.3.18	Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you seems to be wise in this age, let them become a fool that they may be wise.
1CO.3.19	For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He takes the wise in their own craftiness.
1CO.3.20	And again, The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
1CO.3.21	Therefore let no one glory in men. For all things are yours;
1CO.3.22	whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or things present or things to come, all are yours;
1CO.3.23	and ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.
1CO.4.1	Let us reckon men as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
1CO.4.2	Moreover, it is required in stewards that each one be found faithful.
1CO.4.3	But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by man’s judgment; I do not even judge my own self.
1CO.4.4	For although I have nothing on my conscience, yet am I not hereby justified, but he that judges me is the Lord.
1CO.4.5	Therefore, judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts; and then shall each one have praise of God.
1CO.4.6	And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes, that in us ye might not learn above that which is written, lest because of one, some of you become puffed up against others.
1CO.4.7	For who makes thee to judge? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, what dost thou glory of, as if thou hadst not received it?
1CO.4.8	Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye reign as kings without us, and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.
1CO.4.9	For I think that God has set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death; for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men.
1CO.4.10	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are prudent in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.
1CO.4.11	Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are ill clad and are buffeted and have no certain dwellingplace
1CO.4.12	and labour, working with our own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it;
1CO.4.13	being blasphemed, we intreat; we are made as the filth of this world and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.
1CO.4.14	I do not write these things to shame you, but to warn you, as to my beloved sons.
1CO.4.15	For though ye may have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet ye shall not have many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.
1CO.4.16	Therefore, I beseech you that ye imitate me.
1CO.4.17	For this cause I have sent Timothy unto you, who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
1CO.4.18	Now some are puffed up as though I will never come to you.
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord wills, and will know not the words of those who are puffed up, but the virtue.
1CO.4.20	For the kingdom of God is not in words, but in virtue.
1CO.4.21	What will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod or in charity and in the spirit of meekness?
1CO.5.1	It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.
1CO.5.2	And ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.
1CO.5.3	For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, him that has so done this deed.
1CO.5.4	In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1CO.5.5	let such a one be delivered unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
1CO.5.6	Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
1CO.5.7	Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ, our passover, is sacrificed for us;
1CO.5.8	therefore let us celebrate the feast, not in the old leaven, neither in the leaven of malice and wickedness, but in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
1CO.5.9	I wrote unto you in an epistle not to associate with fornicators,
1CO.5.10	yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the covetous or extortioners or with idolaters, for then ye would need to go out of the world.
1CO.5.11	But now I have written unto you not to associate with anyone calling himself a brother if he is a fornicator or covetous or an idolater or a railer or a drunkard or an extortioner; with such a one do not even eat.
1CO.5.12	For why shall I judge those that are without? do ye not judge those that are within?
1CO.5.13	But those that are without, God shall judge. Therefore, put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
1CO.6.1	Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go unto judgment before the unjust, and not before the saints?
1CO.6.2	Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
1CO.6.3	Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more the things that pertain to this life?
1CO.6.4	If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set as judges the most humble who are in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
1CO.6.5	I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brothers?
1CO.6.6	But brother goes to judgment against brother, and that before the unbelievers.
1CO.6.7	Now therefore there is certainly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather suffer the wrong? why do ye not rather be defrauded?
1CO.6.8	But ye do wrong and defraud and do this to your brothers.
1CO.6.9	Know ye not that the unjust shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not err: neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals
1CO.6.10	nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God.
1CO.6.11	And such were some of you, but now ye are washed, but now ye are sanctified, but now ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and in the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.12	All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
1CO.6.13	Foods are for the belly, and the belly for foods; but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
1CO.6.14	And God, who raised up the Lord, will also raise up us by his own power.
1CO.6.15	Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? In no wise.
1CO.6.16	What? know ye not that he who is joined to the harlot is one body with her? For they shall be, saith he, two in one flesh.
1CO.6.17	But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
1CO.6.18	Flee fornication. Any other sin that a man does is outside the body, but he that commits fornication sins against his own body.
1CO.6.19	What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom ye have of God, and that ye are not your own?
1CO.6.20	For ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.
1CO.7.1	Now concerning the things of which ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
1CO.7.2	Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.
1CO.7.3	Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence, and likewise also the wife unto the husband.
1CO.7.4	The wife does not have authority of her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband does not have authority of his own body, but the wife.
1CO.7.5	Do not defraud one another, except it be with mutual consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again, that Satan not tempt you for your incontinency.
1CO.7.6	But I speak this by permission, and not by commandment.
1CO.7.7	For I would that all men were even as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one after this manner and another after that.
1CO.7.8	I say, therefore, to the unmarried men and widowers, It is good for them if they abide even as I.
1CO.7.9	But if they do not have the gift of continence, let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn.
1CO.7.10	And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife separate from her husband;
1CO.7.11	and if she separates, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband, and let not the husband put away his wife.
1CO.7.12	But to the rest I speak, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that does not believe, and she consents to dwell with him, let him not put her away.
1CO.7.13	And the woman who has a husband that does not believe and if he consents to dwell with her, let her not leave him.
1CO.7.14	For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
1CO.7.15	But if the unbelieving spouse separates, let them separate. The brother or the sister is not under slavery in such cases, but God has called us to peace.
1CO.7.16	For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or what knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?
1CO.7.17	But as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let them walk. And so I ordain in all the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
1CO.7.18	Is anyone called being circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Is anyone called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.
1CO.7.19	Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing but the keeping of the commandments of God.
1CO.7.20	Let each abide in the same calling in which he was called.
1CO.7.21	Art thou called being a slave? care not for it; but if thou may be made free, use it rather.
1CO.7.22	For he that is called in the Lord, being a slave, is the Lord’s freeman; likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ’s slave.
1CO.7.23	Ye are bought with a price; do not make yourselves the slaves of men.
1CO.7.24	Each one, brothers, in that state in which he was called, let him abide with God.
1CO.7.25	Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord, yet I give my advice, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.
1CO.7.26	I hold, therefore, this to be good because of the present distress, that it is good for a man to be thus:
1CO.7.27	Art thou bound unto a wife? Seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? Seek not a wife.
1CO.7.28	But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have affliction in the flesh, but I forbear you.
1CO.7.29	But this I say, brothers, the time is short; for the rest, let those that have wives be as though they had none;
1CO.7.30	and those that weep, as though they wept not; and those that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and those that buy, as though they possessed not;
1CO.7.31	and those that use this world, as not using it as their own, for the fashion of this world passes away.
1CO.7.32	But I would have you without worry. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord;
1CO.7.33	but he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.
1CO.7.34	There is a difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.
1CO.7.35	And this I speak for your own profit, not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is honourable and that ye may attend upon the Lord without impediment.
1CO.7.36	But if anyone thinks it uncomely regarding his daughter, if she passes the bloom of life, and need so requires, let him do what he will, he does not sin: let them marry.
1CO.7.37	Nevertheless, he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has liberty regarding his own, and has so determined in his heart that he will keep his daughter, does well.
1CO.7.38	So then he that gives her in marriage does well, but he that does not give her in marriage does better.
1CO.7.39	The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband dies, she is free and may be married to whom she will, if it is in the Lord.
1CO.7.40	But she shall be more blessed if she so abides, after my counsel, and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.
1CO.8.1	Now as concerning things offered unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.
1CO.8.2	And if anyone thinks that they know anything, they know nothing yet as they ought to know.
1CO.8.3	But if anyone loves God, the same is known of him.
1CO.8.4	As concerning, therefore, the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God but one.
1CO.8.5	For though there are some that are called gods, whether in heaven or in the earth (as there are many gods and many lords),
1CO.8.6	but to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.
1CO.8.7	Howbeit there is not in everyone that knowledge, for some with conscience of the idol unto now, eat it as a thing offered unto an idol, and their conscience being weak is defiled.
1CO.8.8	But food does not make us more acceptable unto God; for neither if we eat are we the better, neither if we eat not are we the worse.
1CO.8.9	But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours becomes a stumblingblock to those that are weak.
1CO.8.10	For if anyone sees thee who hast this knowledge sit at food in the idol’s temple, shall not the conscience of him who is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols?
1CO.8.11	and through thy knowledge the weak brother shall perish, for whom Christ died.
1CO.8.12	In this manner, therefore, sinning against the brethren and wounding their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ.
1CO.8.13	Therefore, if food makes my brother to fall, I will never eat flesh nor do anything which may cause my brother to fall.
1CO.9.1	Am I not an apostle? Am I not free? Have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? Are not ye my work in the Lord?
1CO.9.2	If I am not an apostle unto others, yet doubtless I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
1CO.9.3	My answer to those that examine me is this,
1CO.9.4	Do we not have authority to eat and to drink?
1CO.9.5	Do we not have authority to bring with us a sister, a wife, as also the other apostles and as the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
1CO.9.6	Do only Barnabas and I not have authority to forbear working?
1CO.9.7	Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its fruit? or who feeds a flock and does not eat of the milk of the flock?
1CO.9.8	Do I say this only according to men? or does not the law say the same also?
1CO.9.9	For it is written in the law of Moses, Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the grain. Does God take care for oxen?
1CO.9.10	Or does he say it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that plows should plow in hope, and that he that threshes in hope should be partaker of his hope.
1CO.9.11	If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap material things from you?
1CO.9.12	If others are partakers of this authority over you, why not us? Nevertheless we have not used this authority, but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ.
1CO.9.13	Do ye not know that those who work with sacred things live of the things of the sanctuary? and those who serve at the altar partake of the altar?
1CO.9.14	Even so the Lord has ordained that those who preach the gospel should live of the gospel.
1CO.9.15	But I have used none of these things, neither have I written these things that it should be so done unto me; for it were better for me to die than that anyone should make this my glory void.
1CO.9.16	For though I preach the gospel, I have no reason to glory, for it is an obligation laid upon me; for woe is me, if I do not preach the gospel!
1CO.9.17	For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward; but if against my will, the stewardship of the gospel is committed unto me.
1CO.9.18	What reward, then, shall I have? That preaching the gospel, I may make the gospel of the Christ without charge, that I abuse not my authority in the gospel.
1CO.9.19	Therefore, though I am free regarding everyone, yet I have made myself slave unto all, that I might gain the more.
1CO.9.20	And unto the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to those that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain those that are under the law;
1CO.9.21	to those that are without law, as without law (being not without law of God, but under the law of Christ), that I might gain those that are without law.
1CO.9.22	To the weak I became as weak, that I might gain the weak; I am made all things to everyone, that I might by all means save some.
1CO.9.23	And this I do for the gospel’s sake, that I might be partaker together of it.
1CO.9.24	Know ye not that those who run in a race indeed all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that ye may obtain it.
1CO.9.25	And every man that strives for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown, but we, an incorruptible one.
1CO.9.26	I therefore so run, not as unto an uncertain thing; so I fight, not as one that beats the air;
1CO.9.27	but I keep my body under, and bring it into subjection, lest preaching to others, I myself should become reprobate.
1CO.10.1	Moreover, brothers, I would that ye not ignore how our fathers were all under the cloud and all passed through the sea
1CO.10.2	and were all baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea
1CO.10.3	and did all eat the same spiritual food
1CO.10.4	and did all drink the same spiritual drink, for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them; and that Rock was the Christ.
1CO.10.5	But with many of them God was not pleased; therefore, they were overthrown in the wilderness.
1CO.10.6	Now these things became types of us, that we should not lust after evil things as they lusted.
1CO.10.7	Neither be ye idolaters, as were some of them; as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
1CO.10.8	Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed and fell dead: in one day, twenty-three thousand.
1CO.10.9	Neither let us tempt the Christ, as some of them also tempted and perished by the serpents.
1CO.10.10	Neither murmur ye, as some of them also murmured and perished by the destroyer.
1CO.10.11	Now all these things happened unto them as types, and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the ages are come.
1CO.10.12	Therefore let him that thinks he stands take heed lest he fall.
1CO.10.13	No temptation has taken you but such as is common to man, but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above what ye are able but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it.
1CO.10.14	Therefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.
1CO.10.15	I speak as to wise men; judge ye what I say.
1CO.10.16	The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the fellowship of the blood of the Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of the Christ?
1CO.10.17	For one loaf of bread means that many are one body, for we are all partakers of that one loaf.
1CO.10.18	Behold Israel after the flesh: are not those who eat of the sacrifices participants of the altar?
1CO.10.19	What do I say then? that the idol is anything or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is anything?
1CO.10.20	But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons, and not to God; and I would not that ye should be participants of demons.
1CO.10.21	Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons; ye cannot be participants of the Lord’s table and of the table of demons.
1CO.10.22	Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? are we stronger than he?
1CO.10.23	All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but all things do not edify.
1CO.10.24	Let no one seek his own good, but that of the other.
1CO.10.25	Whatever is sold in the market, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake;
1CO.10.26	for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof.
1CO.10.27	If any of those that do not believe bid you to a feast, and ye are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you asking no questions for conscience sake.
1CO.10.28	But if anyone says unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, do not eat it for the sake of him that disclosed it and for conscience sake; for the earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof:
1CO.10.29	conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other, for why should my liberty be judged by another man’s conscience?
1CO.10.30	For if I by grace am a partaker, why am I evil spoken of for that for which I give thanks?
1CO.10.31	Whether therefore ye eat or drink or whatever ye do, do everything for the glory of God.
1CO.10.32	Be without offense, neither to the Jews nor to the Gentiles nor to the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God;
1CO.10.33	even as I please everyone in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.
1CO.11.1	Be ye imitators of me, even as I also am of Christ.
1CO.11.2	Now I praise you, brothers, that ye remember me in all things and retain my instructions the same as I spoke unto you.
1CO.11.3	But I would have you know that the head of every man is the Christ, and the head of the woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God.
1CO.11.4	Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonours his head.
1CO.11.5	But every woman that prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonours her head, for that is even the same as if she were shaven.
1CO.11.6	For if the woman is not covered, let her also be shorn; but if it is a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
1CO.11.7	For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God; but the woman is the glory of the man.
1CO.11.8	For the man is not of the woman, but the woman of the man.
1CO.11.9	Neither was the man created for the woman, but the woman for the man.
1CO.11.10	For this cause the woman ought to have authority over her head: because of the angels.
1CO.11.11	Nevertheless, neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
1CO.11.12	For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
1CO.11.13	Judge in yourselves: is it honest that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
1CO.11.14	Does not even nature itself teach you that if a man lets his hair grow, it is dishonest?
1CO.11.15	But if a woman lets her hair grow, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a covering.
1CO.11.16	With all this, if anyone seems to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God.
1CO.11.17	Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not: that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
1CO.11.18	For first of all, when ye come together in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, I hear that there are divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
1CO.11.19	For it is expedient that there also be heresies among you, so that those who are proved may become manifest among you.
1CO.11.20	So that when ye come together in one place, this is not eating the Lord’s supper.
1CO.11.21	For in eating, each one takes his own supper first: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
1CO.11.22	What? Do ye not have houses to eat and to drink in? or do ye despise the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God and shame those that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
1CO.11.23	For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread;
1CO.11.24	and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.
1CO.11.25	After the same manner also he took the cup, after he had eaten supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood; do this each time that ye drink, in remembrance of me.
1CO.11.26	For each time that ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye declare the Lord’s death until he comes.
1CO.11.27	Therefore whoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
1CO.11.28	But let each man prove himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
1CO.11.29	For he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body.
1CO.11.30	For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
1CO.11.31	For if we would examine ourselves, we should not be judged.
1CO.11.32	But being judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
1CO.11.33	Therefore, my brothers, when ye come together to eat, wait for one another.
1CO.11.34	And if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home; that ye not come together unto judgment. And I will set the rest in order when I come.
1CO.12.1	Now regarding spiritual things, brothers, I would not have you ignore them.
1CO.12.2	Ye know that when ye were Gentiles, ye went, even as ye were led, unto the dumb idols.
1CO.12.3	Therefore I give you to understand, that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus anathema and that no one can call Jesus Lord but by the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	Now there is dispersal of gifts, but the same Spirit.
1CO.12.5	And there is dispersal of ministries, but the same Lord.
1CO.12.6	And there is dispersal of operations, but it is the same God who works all in each one.
1CO.12.7	But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to each one to profit with.
1CO.12.8	For to one is given by the Spirit a word of wisdom; to another, a word of knowledge according to the same Spirit;
1CO.12.9	to another, faith by the same Spirit; to another, gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
1CO.12.10	to another, the operation of miracles; to another, prophecy; to another, discerning of spirits; to another, different kinds of tongues; to another, the interpretation of tongues:
1CO.12.11	one and the same Spirit operates all these things, dispersing to each one his own gift as he wills.
1CO.12.12	For as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also the Christ.
1CO.12.13	For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body, whether we are Jews or Greeks, whether we are slaves or free, and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
1CO.12.14	For the body is not one member, but many.
1CO.12.15	If the foot shall say, Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?
1CO.12.16	And if the ear shall say, Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the body?
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, where would the hearing be? If the whole were hearing, where would the smelling be?
1CO.12.18	But now God has set the members each one of them in the body, as it has pleased him.
1CO.12.19	And if they were all one member, where would the body be?
1CO.12.20	But now they are indeed many members, yet but one body.
1CO.12.21	And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
1CO.12.22	For those members of the body, which seem to be weaker, are much more necessary;
1CO.12.23	and those members of the body which we think to be more vile, these we dress with more abundant honour; and those in us who are more indecent have more honesty.
1CO.12.24	For those in us who are more honest need nothing, but God has ordered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that one which lacked,
1CO.12.25	that there should be no contradiction in the body, but that the members should have the same care one for another.
1CO.12.26	And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; or if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice together.
1CO.12.27	Now ye are the body of Christ and members in particular.
1CO.12.28	And God did set certain ones in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}: first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that faculties, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
1CO.12.29	Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? do all have faculties?
1CO.12.30	Do all have gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
1CO.12.31	But earnestly pursue the best gifts, and yet I show unto you a more excellent way.
1CO.13.1	Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.
1CO.13.2	And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
1CO.13.3	And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it profits me nothing.
1CO.13.4	Charity suffers long and is benign; charity envies not; charity does nothing without due reason, is not puffed up,
1CO.13.5	is not injurious, seeks not her own, is not easily provoked, thinks no evil,
1CO.13.6	rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;
1CO.13.7	bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
1CO.13.8	Charity is never lost, but prophecies shall come to an end, tongues shall cease, and knowledge shall come to an end.
1CO.13.9	For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
1CO.13.10	But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
1CO.13.12	For now we see as through a mirror, in darkness, but then we shall see face to face; now I know in part, but then I shall know even as I also am known.
1CO.13.13	And now abide faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
1CO.14.1	Follow after charity and earnestly pursue spiritual gifts, but above all, that ye may prophesy.
1CO.14.2	For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not unto men, but unto God, for no one understands him, even though by the Spirit he speaks mysteries.
1CO.14.3	But he that prophesies speaks unto men for edification and exhortation and comfort.
1CO.14.4	He that speaks in an unknown tongue edifies himself, but he that prophesies edifies the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
1CO.14.5	I would that ye all spoke with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied, for greater is he that prophesies than he that speaks with tongues, unless he interprets, that the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} may receive edifying.
1CO.14.6	Now, brothers, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either with revelation or with knowledge or with prophecy or with doctrine?
1CO.14.7	And even things without life giving sound, whether flute or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is played or harped?
1CO.14.8	For if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?
1CO.14.9	So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue a clear and definite word, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air.
1CO.14.10	There are many kinds of distinct voices in the world, and nothing is dumb.
1CO.14.11	Therefore, if I ignore the virtue of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaks as a barbarian, and he that speaks shall be a barbarian unto me.
1CO.14.12	Even so ye, forasmuch as ye desire the things of the Spirit, earnestly pursue excellence unto the edification of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
1CO.14.13	Therefore, let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
1CO.14.14	For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.
1CO.14.15	What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.
1CO.14.16	Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the place of the ignorant say, Amen, at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what thou sayest?
1CO.14.17	For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.
1CO.14.18	I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all;
1CO.14.19	yet in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I might teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.
1CO.14.20	Brothers, be not children in understanding, howbeit in malice be ye children; but in understanding be perfect.
1CO.14.21	In the law it is written, In other tongues and with other lips I will speak unto this people; and yet for all that, they will not hear me, saith the Lord.
1CO.14.22	Therefore, tongues are for a sign, not to those that believe, but to those that do not believe; but prophecy is not for those that do not believe, but for those who believe.
1CO.14.23	If, therefore, the whole congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} is come together into one place and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?
1CO.14.24	But if all prophesy, and there come in one that does not believe or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all;
1CO.14.25	for the secrets of his heart are made manifest; and so falling down on his face, he will worship God, declaring that God is indeed in you.
1CO.14.26	How is it then, brothers? when ye come together, each one of you has a psalm, has doctrine, has tongues, has revelation, has interpretation. Let all things be done unto edification.
1CO.14.27	If anyone speaks in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.
1CO.14.28	But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silence in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, and let him speak to himself and to God.
1CO.14.29	Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge.
1CO.14.30	If any thing is revealed to another that sits by, let the first be silent.
1CO.14.31	For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be exhorted.
1CO.14.32	And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
1CO.14.33	For God is not the God of disorder, but of peace, as in all the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of the saints.
1CO.14.34	Let your women keep silence in the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be in subjection, as also saith the law.
1CO.14.35	And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a dishonest thing for women to speak in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out one}.
1CO.14.36	What? Did the word of God come out from you? or did it come unto you only?
1CO.14.37	If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.
1CO.14.38	But anyone that ignores them shall be ignored.
1CO.14.39	Therefore, brothers, earnestly pursue prophecy and do not forbid to speak with tongues.
1CO.14.40	But let all things be done decently and in order.
1CO.15.1	Moreover, brothers, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received and in which ye stand;
1CO.15.2	by which also ye are being saved if ye retain the word that I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
1CO.15.3	For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received: how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures
1CO.15.4	and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures
1CO.15.5	and that he appeared to Cephas and then to the twelve;
1CO.15.6	after that, he appeared unto more than five hundred brothers at once, of whom the greater part remain unto now, but some are fallen asleep.
1CO.15.7	After that, he appeared unto James; then to all the apostles.
1CO.15.8	And last of all he appeared unto me also, as of one born out of due time.
1CO.15.9	For I am the least of the apostles, for I am not worthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God.
1CO.15.10	But by the grace of God I am what I am; and his grace towards me was not in vain, for I laboured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
1CO.15.11	Therefore, whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.
1CO.15.12	Now if the Christ is preached that rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?
1CO.15.13	But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then neither is Christ risen;
1CO.15.14	and if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is vain, and your faith is also vain.
1CO.15.15	And we are even found false witnesses of God because we have testified of God that he raised up the Christ, whom he did not raise up, if it so be that the dead do not rise.
1CO.15.16	For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not raised either;
1CO.15.17	and if Christ is not raised, your faith is vain; ye are even yet in your sins.
1CO.15.18	Then those also who are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
1CO.15.19	If in this life only we have existence in Christ, we are the most miserable of all men.
1CO.15.20	But now Christ is risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of those that slept.
1CO.15.21	For since by a man came death, by a man came also the resurrection of the dead.
1CO.15.22	For as in Adam all die, even so in the Christ shall all be made alive.
1CO.15.23	But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward, those that are Christ’s at his coming.
1CO.15.24	Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.
1CO.15.25	For he must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet.
1CO.15.26	The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.
1CO.15.27	For he has put all things under his feet. But when he says all things are put under him, it is clear that he is excepted, who did put all things under him.
1CO.15.28	And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also subject himself unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.
1CO.15.29	Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead do not rise at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?
1CO.15.30	And why do we stand in jeopardy every hour?
1CO.15.31	I die daily to stay in the glory of having taught you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.
1CO.15.32	If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what does it advantage me, if the dead do not rise? let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.
1CO.15.33	Be not deceived: evil companions corrupt good character.
1CO.15.34	Watch diligently, and sin not; for some do not know God: I speak this to your shame.
1CO.15.35	But someone will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?
1CO.15.36	Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not brought to life, unless it dies first;
1CO.15.37	and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not the body that shall be, but bare grain: it may be of wheat or of some other grain;
1CO.15.38	but God gives it a body as it has pleased him, and to each seed its own body.
1CO.15.39	All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.
1CO.15.40	There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the heavenly glory is one thing, and the earthly glory is another.
1CO.15.41	One thing is the glory of the sun, and another the glory of the moon, and another the glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory.
1CO.15.42	So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it shall be raised in incorruption;
1CO.15.43	it is sown in dishonour, it shall be raised with glory; it is sown in weakness, it shall be raised with power;
1CO.15.44	it is sown a natural body, it shall be raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.
1CO.15.45	And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a life-giving Spirit.
1CO.15.46	Howbeit the spiritual is not first, but the natural; and afterward, that which is spiritual.
1CO.15.47	The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord of heaven.
1CO.15.48	As is the earthy, such are those also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such also are those that are heavenly.
1CO.15.49	And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.
1CO.15.50	Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
1CO.15.51	Behold, I show you a mystery: We shall all indeed be raised, but we shall not all be changed;
1CO.15.52	in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised without corruption, and we shall be changed.
1CO.15.53	For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.
1CO.15.54	So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the word that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.
1CO.15.55	O death, where is thy sting? O Hades, where is thy victory?
1CO.15.56	The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
1CO.15.57	But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	Therefore, my beloved brothers, be ye steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.
1CO.16.1	Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given orders to the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Galatia, do ye likewise.
1CO.16.2	Each first sabbath let each one of you set aside in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no collections when I come.
1CO.16.3	And when I come, whomever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
1CO.16.4	And if it is appropriate that I go also, they shall go with me.
1CO.16.5	Now I will come unto you, when I have passed through Macedonia, for I must pass through Macedonia.
1CO.16.6	And it may be that I will abide and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey wherever I go.
1CO.16.7	For I desire not to see you now in passing, but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permits.
1CO.16.8	But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
1CO.16.9	For a great and effectual door is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
1CO.16.10	Now if Timothy comes, see that he may stay with you securely, for he does the work of the Lord, as I also do.
1CO.16.11	Let no man therefore despise him, but conduct him forth in peace that he may come unto me, for I look for him with the brothers.
1CO.16.12	As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with some of the brothers, but his will was not at all to come at this time, but he will come when he shall have opportunity.
1CO.16.13	Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, be brave, be strong.
1CO.16.14	Let all your things be done with charity.
1CO.16.15	I beseech you, brethren (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia and that they have dedicated themselves to the ministry of the saints),
1CO.16.16	that ye submit yourselves unto such and to each one that helps and labours.
1CO.16.17	I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, for they have filled your absence.
1CO.16.18	For they have refreshed my spirit and yours; therefore, acknowledge ye those that are such.
1CO.16.19	The congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} that is in their house.
1CO.16.20	All the brothers greet you. Greet ye one another with a holy kiss.
1CO.16.21	The salutation of me, Paul, is with my own hand.
1CO.16.22	If any man does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema. Our Lord has come.
1CO.16.23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
1CO.16.24	My charity in Christ Jesus be with you all. Amen.
2CO.1.1	Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, unto the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God which is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia:
2CO.1.2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
2CO.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;
2CO.1.4	who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
2CO.1.5	For in the same manner that the sufferings of the Christ abound in us, so also our consolation abounds by Christ.
2CO.1.6	And if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and saving health, which is effected in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer; or if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and saving health.
2CO.1.7	And our hope of you is steadfast, being certain, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation.
2CO.1.8	Because, brothers, we would not have you ignore our tribulation which was done unto us in Asia, that we were burdened beyond our strength, in such a manner that we despaired even of life:
2CO.1.9	But we had the sentence of death in ourselves that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God who raises the dead;
2CO.1.10	who delivered us from so great a death and does deliver; in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;
2CO.1.11	ye also helping us with prayer, that for the gift bestowed upon us by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.
2CO.1.12	For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with carnal wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world and more abundantly towards you.
2CO.1.13	For we write no other things unto you than what ye read or also know, and I trust ye shall know them even to the end
2CO.1.14	as also ye have known in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus.
2CO.1.15	And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before that ye might have a second grace
2CO.1.16	and to pass by you into Macedonia and to come again out of Macedonia unto you and of you to be sent forward to Judaea.
2CO.1.17	When I, therefore, was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that of me there should be yes, yes, and no, no?
2CO.1.18	But God is faithful that our word toward you has not been yes and no.
2CO.1.19	For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timothy, has not been yes and no, but in him was yes.
2CO.1.20	For all the promises of God are yes in him, and in him Amen, by us for the glory of God.
2CO.1.21	Now he who confirms us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God;
2CO.1.22	who has also sealed us and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.
2CO.1.23	Moreover I call God for a witness upon my soul that I have not yet come unto Corinth to spare you.
2CO.1.24	Not for that we have dominion over your faith, but are helpers of your joy, for by faith ye stand.
2CO.2.1	But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in grief.
2CO.2.2	For if I make you grieve, who is he then that shall make me glad, but the same who is grieved by me?
2CO.2.3	And I wrote this same unto you, lest when I came, I should have grief from those of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.
2CO.2.4	For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know how much more charity I have towards you.
2CO.2.5	But if any have caused me grief, he has not grieved me, but in part, that I may not put a burden on you all.
2CO.2.6	Sufficient to such a one is this reprehension, which was inflicted of many.
2CO.2.7	So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with too much grief.
2CO.2.8	Therefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your charity toward him.
2CO.2.9	For to this end also I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye are obedient in all things.
2CO.2.10	To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also; for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it in the person of Christ,
2CO.2.11	lest Satan should deceive us, for we do not ignore his devices.
2CO.2.12	Having come to Troas for the gospel of the Christ, even though a door was opened unto me in the Lord,
2CO.2.13	I had no rest in my spirit because I did not find Titus my brother, but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.
2CO.2.14	Now thanks be unto God, who always causes us to triumph in the Christ and makes manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.
2CO.2.15	For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in those that are saved and in those that perish;
2CO.2.16	to the one we are the savour of death unto death and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
2CO.2.17	For we are not as many, false merchandisers of the word of God, but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.
2CO.3.1	Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or do we need, as some others, epistles of commendation to you or letters of commendation from you?
2CO.3.2	Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:
2CO.3.3	Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart.
2CO.3.4	And such trust we have through the Christ towards God:
2CO.3.5	Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God,
2CO.3.6	who also has made us able ministers of the new testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
2CO.3.7	But if the ministry of death in the letter engraved in stones was glorious, so that the sons of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to fade away,
2CO.3.8	How shall not the ministry of the Spirit be for greater glory?
2CO.3.9	For if the ministry of condemnation had glory, much more shall the ministry of righteousness abound in glory.
2CO.3.10	For even that which was so glorious had no glory in this respect, in comparison with the glory that excels.
2CO.3.11	For if that which fades away was glorious, much more shall that which remains be glorious.
2CO.3.12	Seeing then that we have such hope, we speak with great confidence,
2CO.3.13	And not as Moses, who put a veil over his face, that the sons of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that glory which was to fade away:
2CO.3.14	(And thus their senses became hardened, for until this day remains the same veil not uncovered in the reading of the old testament, which veil is taken away in Christ.
2CO.3.15	But even unto this day when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.
2CO.3.16	Nevertheless when they convert to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away.)
2CO.3.17	For the Lord is the Spirit, and where that Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
2CO.3.18	Therefore we all, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord with uncovered face, are transformed from glory to glory into the same likeness, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.
2CO.4.1	Therefore seeing we have this ministry, according to the mercy we have received, we fault not,
2CO.4.2	but remove from ourselves every hidden shameful thing, not walking in craftiness, nor adulterating the word of God, but in the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man’s conscience in the sight of God.
2CO.4.3	But if our gospel is hid, it is hid to those that are lost,
2CO.4.4	In whom the god of this age has blinded the understanding of those who do not believe, that the light of the gospel of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine in them.
2CO.4.5	For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your slaves for Jesus’ sake.
2CO.4.6	For the God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts to bring forth the light of the knowledge of the clarity of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
2CO.4.7	But we have this treasure in clay vessels that the excellency of the virtue may be of God, and not of us.
2CO.4.8	We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are unsure of our lives, but not in despair;
2CO.4.9	persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed;
2CO.4.10	always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body.
2CO.4.11	For we who live are always delivered unto death for Jesus’ sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh.
2CO.4.12	So then death works in us, but life in you.
2CO.4.13	We having the same Spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed and, therefore, I have spoken; we also believe and, therefore, speak;
2CO.4.14	knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus and shall present us with you.
2CO.4.15	For we suffer all these things for your sakes that the grace abounding through many may in the thanksgiving redound to the glory of God.
2CO.4.16	Therefore we fault not; but though our outward man is wearing out, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.
2CO.4.17	For our tribulation, which is momentary and light, prepares an exceeding and eternal weight of glory unto us;
2CO.4.18	while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen, for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
2CO.5.1	For we know that if the earthly house of this our habitation were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
2CO.5.2	For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven,
2CO.5.3	if so be that we shall be found clothed and not naked.
2CO.5.4	For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened, for we do not desire to be unclothed, but to be clothed upon with life swallowing up that which is mortal.
2CO.5.5	Now he that has made us for this same thing is God, who has likewise given unto us the earnest of the Spirit.
2CO.5.6	Therefore we are always confident, knowing that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord
2CO.5.7	(for we walk by faith, not by sight).
2CO.5.8	We are confident, I say, and willing rather to be absent from the body and to be present with the Lord.
2CO.5.9	Therefore we also procure, whether present or absent, that we may please him.
2CO.5.10	For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ that each one may receive according to that which they have done in the body, good or evil.
2CO.5.11	Therefore being certain of that terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God, and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.
2CO.5.12	For we do not commend ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf that ye may have something to answer those who glory in appearance, and not in heart.
2CO.5.13	For whether we are fools, it is unto God; or whether we are sane, it is for your cause.
2CO.5.14	For the charity of the Christ constrains us because we judge thus: that if one died for all, then all are dead:
2CO.5.15	And that he died for all that those who live should not live from now on unto themselves, but unto him who died and rose again for them.
2CO.5.16	Therefore from now on we know no one according to the flesh: and even if we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know him no longer.
2CO.5.17	Therefore if anyone is in Christ, they are a new creation: old things are passed away; behold, all things are made new.
2CO.5.18	And all this by God, who reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;
2CO.5.19	for certainly God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them and having placed in us the word of reconciliation.
2CO.5.20	Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God did exhort you by us; we beseech you in Christ’s name, be ye reconciled to God.
2CO.5.21	For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.
2CO.6.1	We then, as workers together with him, exhort you also that ye have not received the grace of God in vain.
2CO.6.2	(For he saith, I have heard thee in an acceptable time, and in the day of saving health I have succoured thee; behold, now is the acceptable time; behold, now is the day of saving health.)
2CO.6.3	Giving no offense in anything, that the ministry not be blamed,
2CO.6.4	But in all things showing ourselves as the ministers of God in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses,
2CO.6.5	in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings,
2CO.6.6	in chastity, in knowledge, in meekness, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in unfeigned charity,
2CO.6.7	in the word of truth, in the power of God through the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,
2CO.6.8	through honour and dishonour, through evil report and good report; as deceivers, and yet as men of the truth;
2CO.6.9	as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, but, behold, we live; as chastened, but not killed;
2CO.6.10	as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.
2CO.6.11	O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.
2CO.6.12	Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.
2CO.6.13	Now for a recompense in the same (I speak as unto my children), be ye also enlarged.
2CO.6.14	Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers, for what fellowship does righteousness have with unrighteousness? and what communion does light have with darkness?
2CO.6.15	And what concord does Christ have with Belial? or what part do the faithful have with the unfaithful?
2CO.6.16	And what agreement does the temple of God have with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God has said, I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
2CO.6.17	Therefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and do not touch the unclean thing; and I will receive you
2CO.6.18	and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
2CO.7.1	Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
2CO.7.2	Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.
2CO.7.3	I speak this not to condemn you, for I have said before that ye are in our hearts to die and live together with us.
2CO.7.4	Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you; I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation.
2CO.7.5	For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears.
2CO.7.6	Nevertheless God, who comforts the humble, comforted us by the coming of Titus;
2CO.7.7	and not by his coming only, but by the consolation with which he was comforted in you when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your zeal for me so that I rejoiced the more.
2CO.7.8	For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that the same epistle has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.
2CO.7.9	Now I rejoice, not that ye were made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were made sorry by God that ye might suffer no loss by us.
2CO.7.10	For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation, of which there is no need to repented; but the sorrow of the world works death.
2CO.7.11	For behold this same thing, that when ye were made sorry by God, what carefulness it wrought in you, what clearing of yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what vehement desire, what zeal, what vindication! In all things ye have shown yourselves to be clean in this matter.
2CO.7.12	So that, though I wrote unto you, I did it not only for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you.
2CO.7.13	Therefore we were comforted in your comfort; yea, and we rejoiced even more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.
2CO.7.14	For if I have gloried of anything to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spoke all things to you in truth, even so our glorying, which I made before Titus, was found true.
2CO.7.15	And his inward affection is more abundant toward you while he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.
2CO.7.16	I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.
2CO.8.1	Likewise, brethren, we make known unto you the grace of God bestowed on the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Macedonia,
2CO.8.2	how that in a great trial of tribulation the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
2CO.8.3	For to their power, I bear record, and even beyond their power they were willing of themselves,
2CO.8.4	praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the grace and take upon us the fellowship of the ministry to the saints.
2CO.8.5	And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord and then unto us by the will of God.
2CO.8.6	Insomuch that we exhorted Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also complete among you the same grace also.
2CO.8.7	Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith and in word and in knowledge and in all diligence and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.
2CO.8.8	I speak not as commanding, but by occasion of the diligence of others and to prove the sincerity of your charity.
2CO.8.9	For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor that ye through his poverty might be enriched.
2CO.8.10	And in this I give my advice, for this is expedient for you, who began not only to do, but also to be diligent a year ago.
2CO.8.11	Now therefore finish the doing of it that as there was a readiness to will, so there may also be a performance out of that which ye have.
2CO.8.12	For if there is first a willing desire, it is accepted according to what a person has and not according to what they do not have.
2CO.8.13	For I mean not that others be eased and ye burdened,
2CO.8.14	but by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want that their abundance also may be a supply for your want, that there may be equality:
2CO.8.15	As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over, and he that had gathered little had no lack.
2CO.8.16	But thanks be to God, who put the same diligence into the heart of Titus for you.
2CO.8.17	For indeed he accepted the exhortation, but being more diligent, of his own accord he went unto you.
2CO.8.18	And we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones},
2CO.8.19	and not that only, but who was also ordained by the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord and declaration of your ready desire,
2CO.8.20	avoiding that anyone should blame us regarding this abundance which is ministered by us,
2CO.8.21	providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
2CO.8.22	And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which we have in you.
2CO.8.23	Regarding Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you; or regarding our brethren, they are the apostles of the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} and the glory of Christ.
2CO.8.24	Therefore show ye unto them before the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, the proof of your charity and of our glorying regarding you.
2CO.9.1	For regarding the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:
2CO.9.2	For I know your ready desire, for which I gloried of you to those of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago, and your zeal has provoked many.
2CO.9.3	Yet I have sent the brethren lest our glorying of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready,
2CO.9.4	lest haply if those of Macedonia come with me and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed of this our confidence.
2CO.9.5	Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would first go unto you and prepare beforehand your blessing, of which ye had given notice before that the same might be ready as a blessing, and not as of covetousness.
2CO.9.6	But this I say, He who sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he who sows in blessings shall also reap blessings.
2CO.9.7	Each one according as they purpose in their heart, so let them give, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.
2CO.9.8	And God is able to make all grace abound in you that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:
2CO.9.9	As it is written, He has dispersed abroad; he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains for ever.
2CO.9.10	Now he that supplies seed to the sower shall also supply bread for food and shall multiply your seed sown and shall increase the growing of the fruits of your righteousness,
2CO.9.11	so that being enriched in everything to all generosity, which works out through us thanksgiving unto God.
2CO.9.12	For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also abounds in much thanksgiving unto God;
2CO.9.13	that by the experience of this ministration, they glorify God for the obedience of your consent unto the gospel of the Christ and in your liberal distribution unto them and unto everyone,
2CO.9.14	and in their prayer for you, for they love you because of the eminent grace of God in you.
2CO.9.15	Thanks be unto God for his indescribable gift.
2CO.10.1	Now I, Paul, myself beseech you by the meekness and clemency of the Christ (who in presence am low among you, but being absent am bold toward you)
2CO.10.2	but I beseech you that I need not be bold when I am present with that confidence, with which I am esteemed to use against some who regard us as if we walked according to the flesh.
2CO.10.3	For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh
2CO.10.4	(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God for the destruction of strong holds),
2CO.10.5	casting down reasonings and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and leading captive every thought into the obedience of the Christ
2CO.10.6	and having a readiness to avenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.
2CO.10.7	Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If anyone trusts to himself that he is Christ’s, let him of himself think this again, that as he is Christ’s, even so we are Christ’s.
2CO.10.8	For though I should glory somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I shall not be ashamed,
2CO.10.9	That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
2CO.10.10	For his letters, they say, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.
2CO.10.11	Let such a one think this, that such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.
2CO.10.12	For we dare not mix ourselves in with or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves, but they do not understand that they are measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves.
2CO.10.13	But we will not glory of things beyond our measure, but according to the measure of the rule, of the measure which God has distributed to us, to reach even unto you.
2CO.10.14	For we do not overextend ourselves by reaching unto you; for we are also come unto you with the gospel of the Christ,
2CO.10.15	Not glorying of things beyond our measure in the labours of others; but having hope of the increase of your faith, that we shall be abundantly enlarged among you according to our rule,
2CO.10.16	to preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, without entering into the measure {Gr. rule} of another to glory in that which has already been made ready.
2CO.10.17	But he that glories, let him glory in the Lord.
2CO.10.18	For it is not he that commends himself that is approved, but whom the Lord commends.
2CO.11.1	I wish ye could bear with me a little in my folly and indeed bear with me.
2CO.11.2	For I am jealous over you with the jealousy of God, for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to the Christ.
2CO.11.3	But I fear that as the serpent deceived Eve through his craftiness, so your senses should be corrupted in some way, and ye should fall from the simplicity that is in the Christ.
2CO.11.4	Therefore if anyone comes preaching another Jesus whom we have not preached or if ye receive another spirit from that which ye have received or another gospel from that which ye have accepted, ye bear well with it.
2CO.11.5	I reckon that I have not been inferior in any way to those grandiose apostles.
2CO.11.6	But though I am rude in speech, yet not in knowledge, but we have been thoroughly made manifest among you in all things.
2CO.11.7	Have I committed an offence in humbling myself that ye might be exalted because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?
2CO.11.8	I deprived the other congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, taking wages of them, to do you service.
2CO.11.9	And when I was present with you and had need, I was not a burden to any of you, for that which was lacking to me was supplied by the brethren which came from Macedonia; and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.
2CO.11.10	It is the truth of Christ in me that this glory shall not be sealed up unto me in the regions of Achaia.
2CO.11.11	Why? because I do not love you? God knows.
2CO.11.12	But what I do, I will continue to do that I may take away the occasion from those who desire it to be found like unto us in that in which they glory.
2CO.11.13	For these false apostles are deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.
2CO.11.14	And it is no marvel, for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.
2CO.11.15	Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers transform themselves as ministers of righteousness, whose end shall be according to their works.
2CO.11.16	I say again, Let no one think me a fool if otherwise, receive me as a fool, that I may yet glory a little.
2CO.11.17	That which I speak, I speak it not according to the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of glory.
2CO.11.18	Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.
2CO.11.19	For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.
2CO.11.20	For ye suffer it if anyone brings you into bondage, if anyone devours you, if anyone takes of you, if anyone exalts himself, if anyone smites you on the face.
2CO.11.21	I speak as concerning the reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit in that in which another is bold, (I speak foolishly), I am bold also.
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
2CO.11.23	Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more, in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths often.
2CO.11.24	Of the Jews five times I received forty stripes less one.
2CO.11.25	Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned; three times I suffered shipwreck, night and day I have been in the deep;
2CO.11.26	in journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by those of my nation, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;
2CO.11.27	in labour and travail, in many watches, in hunger and thirst, in many fasts, in cold and nakedness.
2CO.11.28	Beside those things that are without, my daily combat is the welfare of all the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
2CO.11.29	Who is sick, and I am not sick? who stumbles, and I burn not?
2CO.11.30	If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern my weakness.
2CO.11.31	The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed for evermore, knows that I do not lie.
2CO.11.32	In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me;
2CO.11.33	and through a window in a basket I was let down by the wall and escaped his hands.
2CO.12.1	Certainly it is not expedient for me to glory, but I will come to the visions and the revelations of the Lord.
2CO.12.2	I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell; God knows) was caught up to the third heaven.
2CO.12.3	And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell; God knows)
2CO.12.4	who was caught up into paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.
2CO.12.5	Of such a one I will glory, yet of myself I will not glory, except in my weaknesses.
2CO.12.6	Therefore if I should desire to glory in these things, I should not be a fool; for I would say the truth, but now I forbear lest anyone should think of me above that which he sees me to be or that he hears of me.
2CO.12.7	And lest the greatness of the revelations should exalt me above measure, there is given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.
2CO.12.8	For this thing I besought the Lord three times that it might be taken from me.
2CO.12.9	And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee; for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, I will rather glory in my weaknesses that the power of Christ may dwell in me.
2CO.12.10	Therefore I am content in weaknesses, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ’s sake, for when I am weak, then am I strong.
2CO.12.11	I have been a fool, glorying; ye have compelled me; for I ought to have been commended of you, for in nothing am I behind the grandiose apostles, though I am nothing.
2CO.12.12	Truly the signs of the apostle were worked out among you in all patience, in signs and wonders and power.
2CO.12.13	For what is it in which ye were inferior to the other congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} except in that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.
2CO.12.14	Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be burdensome to you, for I seek not your things, but you; for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.
2CO.12.15	And I will very gladly spend and be utterly spent for your souls though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.
2CO.12.16	But be it so, I did not burden you; nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.
2CO.12.17	Did I make a gain of you by any of those whom I sent unto you?
2CO.12.18	I besought Titus and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus defraud you? Did we not walk in the same Spirit and in the same steps?
2CO.12.19	Again, do ye think that we excuse ourselves unto you? We speak before God in Christ, but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.
2CO.12.20	For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I desire and that I shall be found unto you such as ye desire not, lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, rumours, tumults,
2CO.12.21	lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and I would have to mourn over many who have sinned already and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.
2CO.13.1	This third time I am coming unto you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
2CO.13.2	I told you before and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now, I write to those who until now have sinned and to all others that, if I come again, I will not spare,
2CO.13.3	Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, who unto you is not weak, but is mighty in you.
2CO.13.4	For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he lives by the power of God. By which we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God in you.
2CO.13.5	Examine yourselves whether ye are in the faith; prove your own selves. Do ye not know your own selves if Jesus Christ is in you? Unless ye are reprobates.
2CO.13.6	But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.
2CO.13.7	Now I pray to God that ye do no evil, not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is good, though we be as reprobates.
2CO.13.8	For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.
2CO.13.9	By which we are glad that we are weak and ye are strong, and even so we pray for your perfection.
2CO.13.10	Therefore I write these things being absent lest being present I should treat you with more severity, according to the power which the Lord has given me for edification, and not for destruction.
2CO.13.11	For the rest, brethren, that ye may have joy, be perfected, have consolation, be of one mind, having peace; and the God of peace and charity shall be with you.
2CO.13.12	Greet one another with a holy kiss.
2CO.13.13	All the saints salute you.
2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of God and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.
GAL.1.1	Paul, apostle (not from men neither through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead)
GAL.1.2	and all the brethren who are with me, unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Galatia:
GAL.1.3	Grace be unto you and peace from God the Father and from our Lord Jesus Christ,
GAL.1.4	who gave himself for our sins that he might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
GAL.1.5	unto whom be the glory for the ages of the ages. Amen.
GAL.1.6	I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel,
GAL.1.7	for there is not another; but there are some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of the Christ.
GAL.1.8	But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be anathema.
GAL.1.9	As we said before, so do I say now again, If anyone preaches any other gospel unto you than what ye have received, let him be anathema.
GAL.1.10	For do I now persuade men or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the slave of Christ.
GAL.1.11	But I make known unto you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not according to man.
GAL.1.12	For I did not receive it nor learn it from man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
GAL.1.13	For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in Judaism, how that beyond measure I was persecuting and destroying the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God
GAL.1.14	And profited in Judaism above many of my equals in my own nation, being exceedingly more zealous of the traditions of my fathers.
GAL.1.15	But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace,
GAL.1.16	to reveal his Son in me that I might preach him among the Gentiles, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood,
GAL.1.17	neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus.
GAL.1.18	Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and abode with him fifteen days.
GAL.1.19	But I saw none of the other apostles, except James the Lord’s brother.
GAL.1.20	Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I do not lie.
GAL.1.21	Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia
GAL.1.22	and was unknown by face unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Judaea which were in Christ,
GAL.1.23	but they had only heard, That he who persecuted us in time past now preaches the faith which he once destroyed.
GAL.1.24	And they glorified God in me.
GAL.2.1	Then fourteen years later I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas and took Titus with me also.
GAL.2.2	But I went up by revelation and communicated unto them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those who seemed to be of repute, to not run, or have run, in vain.
GAL.2.3	But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised,
GAL.2.4	And that in spite of the false brethren, who entered secretly to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus that they might bring us into bondage;
GAL.2.5	Unto whom we did not submit even for one hour that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.
GAL.2.6	But of these who seemed to be of repute, (whatever they were, it makes no matter to me: God does not accept the appearance of men), for those who seemed to be of repute in conference added nothing to me;
GAL.2.7	But to the contrary, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter
GAL.2.8	(for he that showed himself forth in Peter for apostleship of the circumcision, the same also showed himself forth in me toward the Gentiles);
GAL.2.9	and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision.
GAL.2.10	Only they asked that we should remember the poor; the same which I was also diligent to do.
GAL.2.11	But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face because he was to be blamed.
GAL.2.12	For before certain ones came from James, he ate with the Gentiles, but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.
GAL.2.13	And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him, insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their hypocrisy.
GAL.2.14	But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, dost live after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why dost thou compel the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?
GAL.2.15	We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,
GAL.2.16	knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law; for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.
GAL.2.17	But if, while we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of our sin? No, in no wise.
GAL.2.18	For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a rebel.
GAL.2.19	For through the law I am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.
GAL.2.20	I am crucified with Christ; nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me, and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
GAL.2.21	I do not reject the grace of God, for if righteousness comes by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.
GAL.3.1	O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you that ye should not trust in the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?
GAL.3.2	This only would I learn of you, Did ye receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by the obedient ear of faith?
GAL.3.3	Are ye so foolish? having begun by the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?
GAL.3.4	Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.
GAL.3.5	He therefore that gives unto you the Spirit and does works of power among you, does he do it by the works of the law or by the obedient ear of faith?
GAL.3.6	Even as Abraham believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness.
GAL.3.7	Know ye therefore that those who are of faith, the same are the sons of Abraham.
GAL.3.8	And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles through faith, evangelized Abraham in advance, saying, In thee shall all the Gentiles be blessed.
GAL.3.9	So then those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham, the believer.
GAL.3.10	For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.
GAL.3.11	But that no one is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident, for The just shall live by faith.
GAL.3.12	And the law is not of faith, but The man that does the commandments shall live by them.
GAL.3.13	Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us, (for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangs on a tree),
GAL.3.14	That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
GAL.3.15	Brethren, (I speak after the manner of men) Even when a covenant is of man, once it is confirmed, no one cancels it or adds to it.
GAL.3.16	Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He did not say, And to seeds, as of many, but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.
GAL.3.17	And this I say that regarding the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel it, that it should make the promise of no effect.
GAL.3.18	For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no longer of promise; but God gave it to Abraham by promise.
GAL.3.19	For what then serves the law? It was added because of rebellions until the seed should come to whom the promise was made, and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.
GAL.3.20	Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.
GAL.3.21	Is the law then against the promises of God? No, in no wise, for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.
GAL.3.22	But the scripture has concluded all under sin that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the believers.
GAL.3.23	But before faith came, we were under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.
GAL.3.24	Therefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.
GAL.3.25	But when faith is come, we are no longer under the hand of the schoolmaster.
GAL.3.26	For ye are all sons of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
GAL.3.27	For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
GAL.3.28	Here there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.
GAL.3.29	And if ye are Christ’s, then ye are Abraham’s seed and heirs according to the promise.
GAL.4.1	Now I say That the heir, as long as he is a child differs in nothing from a slave, though he be lord of all,
GAL.4.2	but is under the hand of tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.
GAL.4.3	Even so we, when we were children, were in slavery under the elements of the world,
GAL.4.4	but when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,
GAL.4.5	to redeem those that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.
GAL.4.6	And because ye are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father;
GAL.4.7	therefore, thou art no longer a slave, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.
GAL.4.8	However then, when ye did not know God, ye did service unto those who by nature are not gods.
GAL.4.9	But now, having known God, or rather being known of God, how do ye turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, in which ye desire again to be in slavery?
GAL.4.10	Ye observe days and months and times and years.
GAL.4.11	I am afraid for you, lest I have bestowed labour upon you in vain.
GAL.4.12	Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are; ye have not injured me at all.
GAL.4.13	Ye know how through weakness of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
GAL.4.14	And my affliction which was in my flesh ye did not despise, nor reject but ye received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.
GAL.4.15	Where is then the blessedness ye spoke of? for I bear you record that if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes and have given them to me.
GAL.4.16	Am I, therefore, become your enemy because I tell you the truth?
GAL.4.17	They are zealous after you, but not for good; they would exclude you from us, that ye might be zealous after them.
GAL.4.18	It is good to be always zealous to do good, and not only when I am present with you.
GAL.4.19	My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ is formed in you,
GAL.4.20	I desire to be present with you now and to change my voice, for I stand in doubt of you.
GAL.4.21	Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, have ye not heard the law?
GAL.4.22	For it is written that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.
GAL.4.23	But he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh, but he of the freewoman was born through the promise.
GAL.4.24	Which things are an allegory; for these women are the two covenants: the one from the Mount Sinai, which begat unto slavery, which is Hagar.
GAL.4.25	For this Hagar or Sinai is a mount in Arabia, which corresponds to the one that is now Jerusalem, which together with her children is in slavery.
GAL.4.26	But the Jerusalem of above is free, which is the mother of us all.
GAL.4.27	For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth into praise and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate has many more children than she who has a husband.
GAL.4.28	So that we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.
GAL.4.29	But as then he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was born according to the Spirit, even so it is now.
GAL.4.30	Nevertheless what does the scripture say? Cast out the bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.
GAL.4.31	So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.
GAL.5.1	Stand fast therefore in the liberty with which Christ has made us free and do not be entangled again with the yoke of slavery.
GAL.5.2	Behold, I, Paul, say unto you that if ye become circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
GAL.5.3	For I testify again to every man that becomes circumcised that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
GAL.5.4	Ye are empty of the Christ, whosoever of you that justify yourselves by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
GAL.5.5	For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
GAL.5.6	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails anything nor uncircumcision, but faith which works by charity.
GAL.5.7	Ye did run well; who hindered you that ye should not trust in the truth?
GAL.5.8	This persuasion does not come of him that called you.
GAL.5.9	A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
GAL.5.10	I have confidence in you through the Lord that ye will not be otherwise minded, but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he is.
GAL.5.11	And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the offence of the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} ceased.
GAL.5.12	I even desire that those who trouble you would cut themselves off.
GAL.5.13	For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only do not use liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by charity serve one another.
GAL.5.14	For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
GAL.5.15	But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye are not consumed one of another.
GAL.5.16	This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
GAL.5.17	For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
GAL.5.18	But if ye are led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
GAL.5.19	Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
GAL.5.20	idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
GAL.5.21	envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; which I denounce, as I have also told you in time past that those who do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
GAL.5.22	But the fruit of the Spirit is this: Charity, joy, peace, tolerance, gentleness, goodness, faith,
GAL.5.23	meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
GAL.5.24	For those that are of the Christ have crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts.
GAL.5.25	If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
GAL.5.26	Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
GAL.6.1	Brethren, if anyone is overtaken in a fault, ye who are spiritual restore such a one in the spirit of meekness, considering thyself lest thou also be tempted.
GAL.6.2	Bear ye one another’s burdens and so fulfil the law of the Christ.
GAL.6.3	For if anyone thinks himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
GAL.6.4	But let everyone prove his own work, and then he shall have glory regarding only himself, and not in another.
GAL.6.5	For everyone shall bear his own burden.
GAL.6.6	Let the one that is taught in the word communicate unto the one that teaches in all good things.
GAL.6.7	Do not deceive yourselves; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows that shall he also reap.
GAL.6.8	For he that sows to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption, but he that sows in the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.
GAL.6.9	And let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.
GAL.6.10	Therefore as long as we have the opportunity, let us do good unto everyone, especially unto those who are of the household of faith.
GAL.6.11	Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with my own hand.
GAL.6.12	As many as desire to please in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} of the Christ.
GAL.6.13	For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law, but desire to have you circumcised that they may glory in your flesh.
GAL.6.14	But in no wise should I glory, except in the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
GAL.6.15	For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
GAL.6.16	And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
GAL.6.17	From now on let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
GAL.6.18	Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
EPH.1.1	Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints who are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
EPH.1.2	Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.3	Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly things in Christ;
EPH.1.4	according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blemish before him in charity;
EPH.1.5	having marked out beforehand the way for us to be adopted as sons by Jesus Christ in himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
EPH.1.6	to the praise of the glory of his grace, in which he has made us accepted in the beloved;
EPH.1.7	in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace,
EPH.1.8	which has over abounded in us in all wisdom and prudence;
EPH.1.9	having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself,
EPH.1.10	that in the dispensation of the fulfillment of the times he might restore all things by the Christ, both those which are in heaven and those which are on earth,
EPH.1.11	in him in whom likewise we have obtained an inheritance, having had the way marked out beforehand according to the purpose of him who works all things after the counsel of his own will,
EPH.1.12	so that we should be to the praise of his glory, those of us who first trusted in the Christ.
EPH.1.13	In whom ye also trusted, hearing the word of truth, the gospel of your saving health; in whom also after ye believed, ye were sealed with that Holy Spirit of the promise,
EPH.1.14	which is the earnest of our inheritance unto the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
EPH.1.15	Therefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and charity unto all the saints,
EPH.1.16	cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
EPH.1.17	that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him;
EPH.1.18	illuminating the eyes of your understanding, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling and what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints
EPH.1.19	and what is the exceeding greatness of his power in us who believe, by the operation of the power of his strength,
EPH.1.20	which operated in the Christ, raising him from the dead and setting him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,
EPH.1.21	far above all principality and power and might and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is to come,
EPH.1.22	And has put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones},
EPH.1.23	which is his body, and he is the fullness of her: who fills all things in everyone.
EPH.2.1	And he has made you alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins,
EPH.2.2	in which in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the will of the prince of the power of this air, the spirit that now works in the sons of disobedience,
EPH.2.3	among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath, even as all the others.
EPH.2.4	But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great charity with which he loved us,
EPH.2.5	even as we were dead in sins, he has made us alive together with the Christ (by whose grace ye are saved)
EPH.2.6	and has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
EPH.2.7	That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
EPH.2.8	For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God,
EPH.2.9	Not of works, lest any man should boast.
EPH.2.10	For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God has prepared that we should walk in them.
EPH.2.11	Therefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who were called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh, which is made by hands,
EPH.2.12	that at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world,
EPH.2.13	but now in Christ Jesus ye who at another time were far off are made near by the blood of the Christ.
EPH.2.14	For he is our peace, who of both has made one, breaking down the middle wall of separation,
EPH.2.15	abolishing in his flesh the enmity, which was the law of commandments in the order of rites, to edify in himself the two in one new man, making peace,
EPH.2.16	and to reconcile both with God by the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} in one body, having slain the enmity thereby;
EPH.2.17	and he came and preached peace unto you who were afar off and to those that were near.
EPH.2.18	For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
EPH.2.19	Now therefore ye are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints and of the household of God,
EPH.2.20	and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone,
EPH.2.21	in whom all the building fitly framed together grows unto a holy temple in the Lord,
EPH.2.22	in whom ye also are being built together for the habitation of God in the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	For this cause I, Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,
EPH.3.2	if ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which has been given to me in you,
EPH.3.3	how that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery (as I wrote above in a few words,
EPH.3.4	by which, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of the Christ),
EPH.3.5	which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit,
EPH.3.6	that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs and of the same body and partakers of his promise in the Christ by the gospel,
EPH.3.7	of which I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the operation of his power.
EPH.3.8	Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of the Christ
EPH.3.9	and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the ages has been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ.
EPH.3.10	To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} the manifold wisdom of God,
EPH.3.11	according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord,
EPH.3.12	In whom we have security and access with confidence by the faith of him.
EPH.3.13	Therefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.
EPH.3.14	For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
EPH.3.15	(of whom the whole family in the heavens and on earth is named),
EPH.3.16	that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man,
EPH.3.17	that the Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith, that ye, being rooted and grounded in charity,
EPH.3.18	may be able to well comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height
EPH.3.19	and to know the charity of the Christ, which passes all knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God.
EPH.3.20	Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,
EPH.3.21	unto him be glory in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} by Christ Jesus throughout all generations of the ages of the ages. Amen.
EPH.4.1	I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation with which ye are called,
EPH.4.2	with all humility and meekness, with tolerance, forbearing one another in love,
EPH.4.3	being diligent to guard the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
EPH.4.4	There is one body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling,
EPH.4.5	one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
EPH.4.6	one God and Father of all, who is above all and through all, and in you all.
EPH.4.7	But unto each one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Christ.
EPH.4.8	Therefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men.
EPH.4.9	(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?
EPH.4.10	He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all the heavens, that he might fulfill all things.)
EPH.4.11	And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers,
EPH.4.12	for the perfecting of the saints in the work of the ministry, unto the edifying of the body of the Christ
EPH.4.13	until we all come forth in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the coming of age of the Christ:
EPH.4.14	That we no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness, by which they lie in wait to deceive,
EPH.4.15	but following the truth in charity, let us grow up into him in all things, who is the head, the Christ:
EPH.4.16	From whom the whole body fitly joined together and well tied together among itself by the nourishment that every connecting bond supplies, by the operation of each member according to measure they have received, making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in charity.
EPH.4.17	This I say, therefore, and require in the Lord that from now on ye not walk as the other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their own senses,
EPH.4.18	having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart,
EPH.4.19	who, after losing all sense of feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness to work all uncleanness with greediness.
EPH.4.20	But ye have not so learned of the Christ,
EPH.4.21	if so be that ye have heard him and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus,
EPH.4.22	that ye put off everything concerning the old way of life, that is, the old man who corrupts himself according to deceitful desires,
EPH.4.23	and be renewed in the spirit of your understanding
EPH.4.24	and that ye put on the new man, which is created in conformity to God in righteousness and in the holiness of the truth.
EPH.4.25	Therefore, leaving the lie, speak every man truth with his neighbour, for we are members one of another.
EPH.4.26	Be ye angry and sin not; let not the sun go down upon your wrath,
EPH.4.27	neither give place to the devil.
EPH.4.28	Let him that stole steal no more, but rather let him labour, working with his hands that which is good, that he may have to give to him that is in need.
EPH.4.29	Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good for edification, that it may minister grace unto the hearers.
EPH.4.30	And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God with which ye are sealed for the day of redemption.
EPH.4.31	Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamour and evil speaking be taken away from you, with all malice,
EPH.4.32	and be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another even as God has forgiven you in Christ.
EPH.5.1	Be ye therefore imitators of God, as dear children
EPH.5.2	and walk in charity even as the Christ also has loved us and has given himself for us as an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savour.
EPH.5.3	But fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness, let it not be once named among you as becomes saints,
EPH.5.4	neither dishonest words nor foolishness nor low jesting, which are not convenient, but rather giving of thanks.
EPH.5.5	For this ye know, that no fornicator nor unclean person nor covetous man, who is also an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
EPH.5.6	Let no one deceive you with vain words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
EPH.5.7	Be not ye, therefore, partakers with them.
EPH.5.8	For in another time ye were darkness, but now ye are light in the Lord: walk as children of light;
EPH.5.9	(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth),
EPH.5.10	approving what is well pleasing unto the Lord.
EPH.5.11	And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
EPH.5.12	For it is a shame even to speak of those things which they do in secret.
EPH.5.13	But all these things when they are reproved by the light are made manifest, for the light is that which manifests everything.
EPH.5.14	Therefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest and arise from the dead, and the Christ shall shine upon thee.
EPH.5.15	See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
EPH.5.16	redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
EPH.5.17	Therefore, be ye not unwise, but understanding of what the will of the Lord is.
EPH.5.18	And be not drunk with wine, in which there is excess, but be filled with the Spirit,
EPH.5.19	speaking among yourselves with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and praising the Lord in your hearts,
EPH.5.20	giving thanks always for all things unto the God and Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
EPH.5.21	submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
EPH.5.22	Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husband, as unto the Lord.
EPH.5.23	For the husband is the head of the wife even as the Christ is head of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, and it is he who gives saving health to the body.
EPH.5.24	Therefore, as the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} is subject unto the Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything.
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives even as the Christ also loved the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} and gave himself for her,
EPH.5.26	that he might sanctify and cleanse her in the washing of water by the word,
EPH.5.27	that he might present her glorious for himself, a congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.
EPH.5.28	So ought husbands to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loves his wife loves himself.
EPH.5.29	For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it even as the Lord with his congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}:
EPH.5.30	For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
EPH.5.31	For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife, and they shall be two in one flesh.
EPH.5.32	This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
EPH.5.33	Nevertheless, let each one of you do likewise, let each one so love his wife even as himself, and let the wife see that she reverences her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
EPH.6.2	Honour thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with a promise),
EPH.6.3	that it may be well with thee, and thou may live long on the earth.
EPH.6.4	And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the discipline and admonition of the Lord.
EPH.6.5	Slaves, be obedient to those that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in simplicity of your heart as unto the Christ,
EPH.6.6	not to be seen as only pleasing men, but as the slaves of the Christ, doing the will of God from within,
EPH.6.7	with good will doing service as to the Lord and not to men,
EPH.6.8	knowing that whatever good thing anyone does, the same shall they receive of the Lord, whether they are slaves or free.
EPH.6.9	And, ye masters, do the same unto them, forbearing threats, knowing that their Master and yours is also in the heavens and that he is no respecter of persons.
EPH.6.10	Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord and in the power of his might.
EPH.6.11	Put on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand firm against the wiles of the devil.
EPH.6.12	For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the lords of this age, rulers of this darkness, against spiritual wickedness in the heavens.
EPH.6.13	Therefore, take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day and stand fast, all the work having been finished.
EPH.6.14	Stand firm, therefore, having your loins girt about with truth and having on the breastplate, {the coat of mail and coat of arms} of righteousness,
EPH.6.15	and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace,
EPH.6.16	above all, taking the shield of faith, with which ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
EPH.6.17	And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;
EPH.6.18	praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit and watching in this with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints
EPH.6.19	and for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth with confidence, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
EPH.6.20	for which I am an ambassador in chains, that in this I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.
EPH.6.21	But that ye also may know my affairs and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful servant in the Lord, shall make known to you all things,
EPH.6.22	whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs and that he might comfort your hearts.
EPH.6.23	Peace be to the brethren and charity with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.6.24	Grace be with all those that love our Lord Jesus Christ in incorruption. Amen.
PHP.1.1	Paul and Timothy, slaves of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
PHP.1.2	Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.3	I thank my God upon every remembrance of you
PHP.1.4	always in every prayer of mine for you all, making request with joy,
PHP.1.5	for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now,
PHP.1.6	being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.7	Even as it is right for me to think this of you all because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are joint partakers of my grace.
PHP.1.8	For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.9	And this I pray that your charity may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all perception,
PHP.1.10	that ye may approve the best, that ye may be sincere and without offense until the day of Christ,
PHP.1.11	being filled with fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
PHP.1.12	But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel,
PHP.1.13	so that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places;
PHP.1.14	and many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
PHP.1.15	Some indeed preach the Christ even out of envy and strife, but others also out of good will.
PHP.1.16	Some preach the Christ out of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add tribulation to my bonds,
PHP.1.17	but the others out of charity, knowing that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel.
PHP.1.18	What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached, and I therein do rejoice, and will even rejoice.
PHP.1.19	For I know that this shall become my saving health through your prayer and the nourishment of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
PHP.1.20	according to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life or by death.
PHP.1.21	For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
PHP.1.22	But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour, yet I do not know what to choose.
PHP.1.23	For I am in a strait between the two, having a desire to depart and to be with Christ, which is far better:
PHP.1.24	nevertheless, to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
PHP.1.25	And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith,
PHP.1.26	that your glorying in Jesus Christ may be more abundant by my coming to you again.
PHP.1.27	Only let your conversation be as is worthy of the gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, unanimous, working together for the faith of the gospel,
PHP.1.28	and in nothing terrified by your adversaries, which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of saving health and that of God.
PHP.1.29	For unto you it is granted regarding Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake,
PHP.1.30	having the same conflict which ye saw in me and now hear to be in me.
PHP.2.1	Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of charity, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,
PHP.2.2	fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same charity, unanimous, minding the one thing.
PHP.2.3	Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory, but in humility let each esteem others better than themselves,
PHP.2.4	with each one not looking to their own things, but also to the things of others.
PHP.2.5	Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus,
PHP.2.6	who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God,
PHP.2.7	but emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, made in the likeness of men,
PHP.2.8	and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross {Gr. stauros – stake}.
PHP.2.9	Therefore, God also has highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name,
PHP.2.10	that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth,
PHP.2.11	and that every tongue should confess that the Lord Jesus Christ is Lord in the glory of God the Father.
PHP.2.12	Therefore, my beloved, as ye have always hearkened, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own saving health with fear and trembling.
PHP.2.13	For it is God who works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.
PHP.2.14	Do all things without murmurings and doubts,
PHP.2.15	that ye may be blameless and innocent, children of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world,
PHP.2.16	holding fast the word of life, that I may glory in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.
PHP.2.17	And even if I am poured out as an offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy and rejoice with you all.
PHP.2.18	For the same cause ye also have joy and rejoice with me.
PHP.2.19	But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort when I know your state.
PHP.2.20	For I have no one likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.
PHP.2.21	For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.
PHP.2.22	But ye know the proof of him, that as a son with the father, he has served with me in the gospel.
PHP.2.23	Therefore, I hope to send him presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.
PHP.2.24	But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.
PHP.2.25	Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and companion in labour and fellowsoldier, but your messenger and he that ministered to my needs.
PHP.2.26	For he longed after you all and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he had been sick
PHP.2.27	For indeed he was sick near unto death, but God had mercy on him and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
PHP.2.28	I sent him, therefore, the more carefully, that when ye see him again, ye may rejoice and that I may be the less sorrowful.
PHP.2.29	Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and esteem such
PHP.2.30	because for the work of the Christ he was near unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.
PHP.3.1	It remains, my brethren, that ye rejoice in the Lord. It does not bother me to write the same things to you, and for you it is safe.
PHP.3.2	Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.
PHP.3.3	For we are the circumcision, who serve God in spirit and glory in Christ Jesus, having no confidence in the flesh.
PHP.3.4	Though I might also have reason to confide in the flesh. If any other man thinks that he has whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:
PHP.3.5	Circumcised the eighth day, of the lineage of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; concerning the law, a Pharisee;
PHP.3.6	concerning zeal, a persecutor of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}; concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.
PHP.3.7	But those things which were gain to me, I counted loss for Christ.
PHP.3.8	And doubtless I even count all things as loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ
PHP.3.9	and be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:
PHP.3.10	That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death,
PHP.3.11	if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection of the dead.
PHP.3.12	Not as though I had already attained it, either were already perfect, but I follow after, if I may lay hold of that for which I have also been laid hold of by the Christ, Jesus.
PHP.3.13	Brethren, I do not reckon to have laid hold of it yet, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind and extending myself unto those things which are ahead,
PHP.3.14	I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
PHP.3.15	Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded; and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.
PHP.3.16	Nevertheless, in that unto which we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us have the same mind.
PHP.3.17	Brethren, be imitators of me and consider those who so walk, as ye have us for a pattern.
PHP.3.18	(For many walk, of whom I have told you often and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross {Gr. stauros – stake} of Christ;
PHP.3.19	whose end shall be perdition, whose God is their belly and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things).
PHP.3.20	For our citizenship is in heaven, from where we also look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:
PHP.3.21	Who shall transform our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto the body of his glory, according to the working by which he is also able to subdue all things unto himself.
PHP.4.1	Therefore, my brethren dearly beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my dearly beloved.
PHP.4.2	I beseech Euodias and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.
PHP.4.3	And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women who laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also and with my other fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life.
PHP.4.4	Rejoice in the Lord always, and again I say, Rejoice.
PHP.4.5	Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is near.
PHP.4.6	Be anxious for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.
PHP.4.7	And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.8	Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is any praise, exercise yourselves in these things.
PHP.4.9	Those things, which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me, do, and the God of peace shall be with you.
PHP.4.10	But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again, in which ye were also concerned, but ye lacked opportunity.
PHP.4.11	Not that I speak in respect of want, for I have learned, in whatever state I am, to be content.
PHP.4.12	I know both how to be humbled, and I know how to have an abundance; in everything and by all things I am instructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.
PHP.4.13	I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
PHP.4.14	Notwithstanding ye have done well, that ye did communicate with my tribulation.
PHP.4.15	Now ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel when I departed from Macedonia, no congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but ye only.
PHP.4.16	For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
PHP.4.17	Not because I desire a gift, but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
PHP.4.18	But I have all and abound; I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, wellpleasing to God.
PHP.4.19	But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.20	Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
PHP.4.21	Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me greet you.
PHP.4.22	All the saints greet you, chiefly those that are of the Caesar’s household.
PHP.4.23	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
COL.1.1	Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
COL.1.2	to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ who are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
COL.1.3	We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you
COL.1.4	since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the charity which ye have toward all the saints,
COL.1.5	for the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which ye have already heard by the word of the truth of the gospel,
COL.1.6	which is come unto you, as it is in all the world, and brings forth fruit, as it does also in you, since the day ye heard it and knew the grace of God in truth,
COL.1.7	as ye also learned of Epaphras, our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ,
COL.1.8	who also declared unto us your charity in the Spirit.
COL.1.9	For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, asking that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,
COL.1.10	that ye might walk worthy of the Lord, pleasing him in everything, being fruitful in every good work, and growing in the knowledge of God,
COL.1.11	strengthened with all might, according to the power of his glory unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness,
COL.1.12	giving thanks unto the Father, who has made us worthy to participate in the inheritance of the saints in light,
COL.1.13	who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son,
COL.1.14	in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the remission of sins,
COL.1.15	who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature;
COL.1.16	for by him were all things created, that are in the heavens and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they are thrones or dominions or principalities or powers: all things were created by him and in him;
COL.1.17	And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.
COL.1.18	And he is the head of the body, the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in all things he might have the preeminence.
COL.1.19	For it pleased the Father that in him should all fullness dwell
COL.1.20	and by him to reconcile all things unto himself, having made peace through the blood of his cross {Gr. stauros – stake}, whether they are the things in the earth or the things in the heavens.
COL.1.21	And you, that were in another time alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now he has reconciled you
COL.1.22	in the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight
COL.1.23	if ye continue in the faith grounded and settled and are not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard and which is preached to every creature which is under heaven, of which I Paul am made a minister,
COL.1.24	who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fulfill in my flesh that which is lacking of the tribulations of the Christ for his body’s sake, which is the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones},
COL.1.25	of which I am made a minister by the dispensation of God which is given to me in you, to fulfil the word of God,
COL.1.26	even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints,
COL.1.27	to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery in the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory,
COL.1.28	whom we preach, warning every man and teaching in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus,
COL.1.29	in which I continue to labour, contending according to his operation, which he works in me mightily.
COL.2.1	For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,
COL.2.2	that their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in charity and in all the riches of the fulfilled understanding to know the mystery of the God and Father and of the Christ;
COL.2.3	in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
COL.2.4	And this I say lest anyone should beguile you with enticing words.
COL.2.5	For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.
COL.2.6	Therefore in the manner in which ye received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him,
COL.2.7	rooted and built up in him and confirmed in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving.
COL.2.8	Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, according to the elements of the world, and not after Christ.
COL.2.9	For in him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,
COL.2.10	and ye are complete in him, who is the head of all principality and power.
COL.2.11	In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of the Christ;
COL.2.12	buried together with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.
COL.2.13	And you, being dead in sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, he has quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses,
COL.2.14	blotting out the bill of the decrees that was against us, which was contrary to us and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross {Gr. stauro – stake},
COL.2.15	and having spoiled the principalities and the powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.
COL.2.16	Let no one therefore judge you in food or in drink or in respect of a feast day or of the new moon or of the sabbath days,
COL.2.17	which are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of the Christ.
COL.2.18	Let no one govern you according to their own will under pretext of humility and religion of angels, intruding into those things which they have not seen, vainly puffed up by their fleshly mind,
COL.2.19	and not holding fast to the Head, from whom all the body, fed and united by its joints and bonds, grows in the increase of God.
COL.2.20	For if ye are dead with the Christ to the elements of the world, why, as though living unto the world, do ye decree rites,
COL.2.21	touch not; taste not; handle not?
COL.2.22	Which all perish with the using, because they are the commandments and doctrines of men,
COL.2.23	which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body, but they have absolutely no value against the appetites of the flesh.
COL.3.1	If ye then are risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where the Christ sits at the right hand of God.
COL.3.2	Set your sight on things above, not on things on the earth.
COL.3.3	For ye are dead and your life is hid with the Christ in God.
COL.3.4	When Christ, who is our life, shall be manifested, then shall ye also be manifested with him in glory.
COL.3.5	Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil lust, and covetousness, which is idolatry;
COL.3.6	for which things’ sake the wrath of God comes on the sons of disobedience,
COL.3.7	in which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.
COL.3.8	But now put ye also off all these things: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.
COL.3.9	Lie not one to another, putting off the old man with his deeds
COL.3.10	and being clothed with the new man, who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of the one that created him,
COL.3.11	where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian nor Scythian, slave nor free: but Christ is all and in all.
COL.3.12	Clothed, therefore, (as the elect of God, holy and beloved) with bowels of mercies, with kindness, with humility, with meekness, with tolerance,
COL.3.13	forbearing one another and forgiving one another if anyone has a quarrel against another: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.
COL.3.14	And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfection.
COL.3.15	And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, into which likewise ye are called into one body, and be ye thankful.
COL.3.16	Let the word of the Christ dwell in you in abundance in all wisdom, teaching you and exhorting you one to another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with grace singing in your hearts unto the Lord.
COL.3.17	And whatever ye do whether in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to the God and Father by him.
COL.3.18	Wives, be subject to your own husbands as it is fit in the Lord.
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter against them.
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.
COL.3.21	Fathers, provoke not your children lest they become disheartened.
COL.3.22	Slaves, in all things hearken unto your masters according to the flesh, not serving to be seen as those who only please men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God;
COL.3.23	And whatever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men,
COL.3.24	knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance, for ye serve the Lord Christ.
COL.3.25	But he that does wrong shall receive the wrong which he has done, now that there is no respect of persons.
COL.4.1	Masters, do that which is just and right with your slaves, knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.
COL.4.2	Persevere in prayer and watch in the same with thanksgiving,
COL.4.3	praying also together for us that God would open unto us the door of the word, to speak the mystery of the Christ, for which I am also in bonds,
COL.4.4	that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.
COL.4.5	Walk in wisdom towards outsiders, winning the occasion.
COL.4.6	Let your word be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer each one.
COL.4.7	All my affairs shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother and a faithful servant and fellow slave in the Lord,
COL.4.8	whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your affairs and comfort your hearts,
COL.4.9	with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all the things which are happening here.
COL.4.10	Aristarchus, my fellowprisoner, salutes you, and Mark, nephew to Barnabas, (concerning whom ye have received commandments, if he comes unto you, receive him),
COL.4.11	and Jesus, who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, who have been a comfort unto me.
COL.4.12	Epaphras, who is one of you, a slave of Christ, salutes you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand firm, perfect and fulfilled in all the will of God.
COL.4.13	For I bear witness of him, that he has a great zeal for you and those that are in Laodicea and those in Hierapolis.
COL.4.14	Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.
COL.4.15	Salute the brethren who are in Laodicea and Nymphas and the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} which is in his house.
COL.4.16	And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.
COL.4.17	And say to Archippus, Take heed to fulfil the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord.
COL.4.18	The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
1TH.1.1	Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of the Thessalonians congregated in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.1.2	We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers,
1TH.1.3	remembering without ceasing the work of your faith and labour and charity and of waiting with the hope of our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father,
1TH.1.4	being certain, beloved brethren, that you are chosen of God.
1TH.1.5	For our gospel did not come unto you in word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and in full assurance as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
1TH.1.6	And ye were made imitators of us and of the Lord, having received the word with much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Spirit:
1TH.1.7	So that ye have become examples to all that have believed in Macedonia and Achaia.
1TH.1.8	For through you the word of the Lord has been divulged not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith, which is in God, has become extended, so that we have no need to say anything.
1TH.1.9	For they themselves tell of us what an entrance we had unto you and in what manner ye were converted to God from idols to serve the living and true God
1TH.1.10	and to wait for his Son from the heavens, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivered us from the wrath to come.
1TH.2.1	For you yourselves, brethren, know that our entrance unto you was not vain,
1TH.2.2	but having suffered before and having been shamefully treated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to announce unto you the gospel of God with much diligence.
1TH.2.3	For our exhortation was not of error nor of uncleanness nor in guile,
1TH.2.4	but because we have been approved of God that he might entrust us with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tries our hearts.
1TH.2.5	For we were never flatterers in the word, as ye know, nor tainted with covetousness, God is witness,
1TH.2.6	nor did we seek glory of men neither of you nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome unto you as the apostles of Christ.
1TH.2.7	But we were gentle among you, as a mother feeding and caring for her children,
1TH.2.8	loving you so much, that we were willing to give unto you, not only the gospel of God, but even our own souls, because ye are dear unto us.
1TH.2.9	For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail, for labouring night and day, not to be a burden unto any of you, we preached among you the gospel of God.
1TH.2.10	Ye are witnesses, and God also, of how holy and just and irreprehensible our behaviour was among you that believe,
1TH.2.11	as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father with his children,
1TH.2.12	that ye would walk worthy of God, who has called you unto his kingdom and glory.
1TH.2.13	For this cause also we thank God without ceasing, that having received from us the word to hear from God, ye received it not as the word of men, (but as it is in truth) the word of God, which effectually works in you that believe.
1TH.2.14	For ye, brethren, have been imitators in Christ Jesus of the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God which are in Judaea, for ye also have suffered like things of your own nation, even as they have of the Jews,
1TH.2.15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets and have persecuted us, and they do not please God and are contrary to all men,
1TH.2.16	forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up the measure of their sins always, for the wrath of God has come upon them to the uttermost.
1TH.2.17	But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly with great desire to see your face.
1TH.2.18	Therefore we would have come unto you, even I, Paul, once and again, but Satan hindered us.
1TH.2.19	For what is our hope or joy or crown of rejoicing? Is it not you in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?
1TH.2.20	For ye are our glory and joy.
1TH.3.1	Therefore when we could wait no longer, we agreed to remain in Athens alone
1TH.3.2	and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of the Christ, to confirm you and to exhort you in your faith,
1TH.3.3	that no one should be moved in these tribulations, for you know that we are appointed for this.
1TH.3.4	For even when we were with you, we told you in advance that we must pass through tribulations, even as it has come to pass, and ye know.
1TH.3.5	For this cause I, also, not waiting any longer, have sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter has tempted you and our labour is in vain.
1TH.3.6	But now when Timothy came from you unto us and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you.
1TH.3.7	Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our tribulation and need by your faith;
1TH.3.8	for now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.
1TH.3.9	For what thanks can we render to God again for you for all the joy with which we joy for your sakes before our God,
1TH.3.10	night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face and might complete that which is lacking in your faith?
1TH.3.11	Now may God himself and our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you.
1TH.3.12	And the Lord make you to multiply and make charity to abound among you and toward all men, even as it is with us toward you,
1TH.3.13	that your hearts may be confirmed in holiness, irreprehensible before God, even our Father, for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.
1TH.4.1	It is in order then, brethren, that we beseech and exhort you in the Lord Jesus, that in the manner ye were taught of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would continue to grow.
1TH.4.2	For ye already know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
1TH.4.3	For the will of God is your sanctification, that ye should separate yourselves from fornication,
1TH.4.4	that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honesty,
1TH.4.5	not with affection of lust, as the Gentiles who do not know God,
1TH.4.6	that no one oppress and defraud his brother in any matter because the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.
1TH.4.7	For God has not called us unto uncleanness, but unto sanctification.
1TH.4.8	He therefore that despises us, does not despise man, but God, who has also given unto us his Holy Spirit.
1TH.4.9	But as touching love among the brethren, ye need not that I write unto you, for ye yourselves have learned of God that ye are to show charity to one another.
1TH.4.10	And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia, but we beseech you, brethren, that ye continue to grow
1TH.4.11	and that ye procure to be quiet and to do your business and to work with your hands, as we commanded you,
1TH.4.12	that ye may walk honestly toward those that are without, and that ye may desire nothing from any one.
1TH.4.13	But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as the others who have no hope.
1TH.4.14	For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so those who sleep in Jesus will God also bring with him.
1TH.4.15	For this, we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not precede those who are asleep.
1TH.4.16	For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead in Christ shall rise first;
1TH.4.17	then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air, and so shall we ever be with the Lord.
1TH.4.18	Therefore comfort one another with these words.
1TH.5.1	But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
1TH.5.2	For ye know well that the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night.
1TH.5.3	For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction shall come upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
1TH.5.4	But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should take you as a thief.
1TH.5.5	Ye are all the sons of light, and the sons of the day; we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
1TH.5.6	Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
1TH.5.7	For those that sleep, sleep in the night, and those that are drunken are drunken in the night.
1TH.5.8	But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and charity, and for a helmet, the hope of saving health.
1TH.5.9	For God has not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain saving health by our Lord Jesus Christ,
1TH.5.10	who died for us, that whether we watch or sleep, we should live together with him.
1TH.5.11	Therefore comfort and edify one another, even as ye do.
1TH.5.12	And we beseech you, brethren, to recognize those who labour among you and preside over you in the Lord and admonish you
1TH.5.13	and that you express greater charity unto them for their work’s sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
1TH.5.14	We also exhort you, brethren, that you warn those that are unruly, comfort the fainthearted, support the weak, be patient with everyone.
1TH.5.15	See that no one renders evil for evil unto anyone, but always follow that which is good, both among yourselves and to all men.
1TH.5.16	Always rejoice.
1TH.5.17	Pray without ceasing.
1TH.5.18	In every thing give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
1TH.5.19	Quench not the Spirit.
1TH.5.20	Despise not prophecies.
1TH.5.21	Examine all things; retain that which is good.
1TH.5.22	Separate yourselves from all appearance of evil.
1TH.5.23	And the very God of peace sanctify you completely, that your spirit, soul, and body be preserved whole without reprehension for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.5.24	Faithful is he that has called you, who will also do it.
1TH.5.25	Brethren, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Greet all the brethren with a holy kiss.
1TH.5.27	I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
2TH.1.1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, unto the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of the Thessalonians in God our Father and in our Lord Jesus Christ:
2TH.1.2	Grace unto you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.3	We must thank God always for you, brethren, as is due because your faith grows exceedingly, and the charity of each and every one of you toward each other abounds,
2TH.1.4	so that we ourselves glory in you in the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure and
2TH.1.5	in testimony of the just judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer,
2TH.1.6	seeing it is a just thing with God to recompense tribulation to those that trouble you
2TH.1.7	and to give you, who are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with the angels of his power,
2TH.1.8	with flaming fire, to take vengeance on those that do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,
2TH.1.9	who shall be punished with eternal destruction by the presence of the Lord and by the glory of his power,
2TH.1.10	when he shall come to be glorified in his saints and to be admired in all those that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day.
2TH.1.11	Therefore in this manner we pray always for you that our God would count you worthy of his calling and fill each will with goodness and the work of faith with power
2TH.1.12	that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be clarified in you, and ye in him, by the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.1	Now we beseech you, brethren, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together unto him,
2TH.2.2	that ye not be easily shaken in understanding or be troubled neither by spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us, as if the day of Christ is at hand.
2TH.2.3	Let no one deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition,
2TH.2.4	opposing and exalting himself against all that is called God, or divinity, so that he as God sits in the temple of God, making himself appear to be God.
2TH.2.5	Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things?
2TH.2.6	And ye know what impedes this now, that he might be revealed in his time.
2TH.2.7	For the mystery of iniquity is already working, except that he who dominates now will dominate until he is taken out of the way.
2TH.2.8	And then shall that Wicked one be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth and remove with the clarity of his coming:
2TH.2.9	that wicked one, who shall come by the working of Satan with great power and signs and lying miracles,
2TH.2.10	and with all deception of iniquity working in those that perish because they did not receive the charity of the truth, to be saved.
2TH.2.11	Therefore, for this cause, God shall send the operation of error in them, that they should believe the lie;
2TH.2.12	that they all might be condemned who did not believe the truth, but consented to the iniquity.
2TH.2.13	But we should always give thanks to God for you, brethren, beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to saving health through the sanctification of the Spirit and faith in the truth,
2TH.2.14	unto which he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.15	Therefore, brethren, stand fast and retain the doctrine which ye have been taught, whether by word or our epistle.
2TH.2.16	Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God, even our Father, who has loved us and has given us eternal consolation and good hope through grace,
2TH.2.17	comfort your hearts and confirm you in every good word and work.
2TH.3.1	Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course and be glorified, even as it is with you,
2TH.3.2	And that we may be delivered from perverse and wicked men, for the faith is not of everyone.
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful, who shall confirm you and keep you from evil.
2TH.3.4	And we have confidence in the Lord regarding you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you.
2TH.3.5	And the Lord make your hearts upright in the charity of God and in the hope of the Christ.
2TH.3.6	Now we charge you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks out of order, and not after the doctrine which ye received of us.
2TH.3.7	For you know in what manner you ought to imitate us, for we did not walk disorderly among you,
2TH.3.8	neither did we eat any man’s bread for nought, but working with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you,
2TH.3.9	Not because we did not have authority, but to give you an example that you might imitate us.
2TH.3.10	For even when we were with you, this we declared unto you, that if anyone desires not to work neither should he eat.
2TH.3.11	For we hear that there are some who walk among you out of order, not working at all, but are busybodies.
2TH.3.12	Now those that are such, we charge and exhort in our Lord Jesus Christ, that working with quietness, they eat their bread.
2TH.3.13	But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing.
2TH.3.14	And if anyone does not hearken unto our word by this epistle, note that one and do not join with him, that he may be ashamed.
2TH.3.15	Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother.
2TH.3.16	Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by every means. The Lord be with you all.
2TH.3.17	Receive saving health from my hand, Paul, which is the sign in all my letters: so I write.
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
1TI.1.1	Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God, our Saviour and the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,
1TI.1.2	unto Timothy, true son in the faith, Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
1TI.1.3	Even as I besought thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou might charge some that they not teach diverse doctrine,
1TI.1.4	nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which generate questions other than that the edification of God is by faith.
1TI.1.5	Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of a good conscience and of faith unfeigned:
1TI.1.6	from which some, having swerved, have turned aside unto vanity of words,
1TI.1.7	desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor from where they affirm.
1TI.1.8	But we know that the law is good, if a man uses it legitimately,
1TI.1.9	knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly sinners, for the evil and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
1TI.1.10	for fornicators, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine,
1TI.1.11	according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
1TI.1.12	And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has enabled me, for he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry,
1TI.1.13	who was before a blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious, but I was received unto mercy because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
1TI.1.14	And the grace of our Lord was exceedingly abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
1TI.1.15	This is a faithful saying and worthy of acceptation by all, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am first.
1TI.1.16	But for this cause I was received unto mercy that in me first, Jesus Christ might show forth all clemency, for an example to those who should hereafter believe in him for eternal life.
1TI.1.17	Therefore unto the King forever, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
1TI.1.18	This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, so that according to past prophecies regarding thee, that thou by them might war a good warfare;
1TI.1.19	holding fast faith and a good conscience, which some, having cast away, have shipwrecked in their faith,
1TI.1.20	Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have delivered unto Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.
1TI.2.1	I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men,
1TI.2.2	for kings, and for all that are in authority that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and integrity.
1TI.2.3	For this is good and pleasing in the sight of God our Saviour,
1TI.2.4	who desires that all men be saved and come unto the knowledge of the truth.
1TI.2.5	For there is only one God and likewise only one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
1TI.2.6	who gave himself in ransom for all, the testimony of which was confirmed at the time,
1TI.2.7	of which I am ordained a preacher and an apostle (I speak the truth in Christ and do not lie), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
1TI.2.8	I desire, therefore, that the men in every place, pray, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and strife.
1TI.2.9	In like manner also that the women adorn themselves in an honest manner, with shyness and modesty, not with ostentatious hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing
1TI.2.10	but with good works (as becomes women professing godliness).
1TI.2.11	Let the woman learn, becoming silent in all subjection.
1TI.2.12	For I do not allow a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over a mature man, but to be at rest.
1TI.2.13	For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
1TI.2.14	And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived in the rebellion;
1TI.2.15	notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if she continues in faith and charity and sanctification and modesty.
1TI.3.1	The Word is faithful, If anyone desires the office of a bishop, {to be a pastor or elder in the congregation}, he desires a difficult ministry.
1TI.3.2	It is expedient, therefore, that the bishop be blameless, the husband of only one wife, vigilant, temperate, of worldly affections mortified, given to hospitality, apt to teach;
1TI.3.3	not given to wine, not hurtful, not greedy of dishonest gain, but gentle, not contentious, not covetous;
1TI.3.4	one that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all integrity;
1TI.3.5	(for if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of God?)
1TI.3.6	not a novice, lest being puffed up, he fall into judgment of the devil.
1TI.3.7	Moreover he must have a good report of those who are outside lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
1TI.3.8	Likewise the deacons must be honest, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of dishonest gain;
1TI.3.9	holding the mystery of the faith together with a pure conscience.
1TI.3.10	And let these also first be proved; then let them minister, if they are blameless.
1TI.3.11	The wives likewise are to be honest, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.
1TI.3.12	Let the deacons be the husbands of only one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
1TI.3.13	For those that minister well purchase to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly
1TI.3.15	But if I tarry long, that thou may know how it is expedient to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
1TI.3.16	And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.
1TI.4.1	Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, listening to spirits of error and doctrines of demons;
1TI.4.2	that in hypocrisy shall speak lies; having their conscience seared as with a hot iron;
1TI.4.3	they shall forbid to marry and shall command men to abstain from foods, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving by those who are faithful and have known the truth.
1TI.4.4	For everything that God created is good, and nothing is to be refused, if it is received with thanksgiving,
1TI.4.5	for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
1TI.4.6	If thou put these things before the brethren, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, unto which thou hast attained.
1TI.4.7	But refuse profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.
1TI.4.8	For bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.
1TI.4.9	The Word is faithful and worthy of acceptation by all.
1TI.4.10	For this we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
1TI.4.11	Command and teach this.
1TI.4.12	Let no man despise thy youth, but be thou an example of the faithful in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
1TI.4.13	Until I come, occupy thyself reading, exhorting, teaching.
1TI.4.14	Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which is given unto thee to prophesy, through the laying on of the hands of the elders.
1TI.4.15	Occupy thyself in these things with care, for in this is everything, that thy profiting may be manifest unto all.
1TI.4.16	Take heed unto thyself and unto the doctrine; be diligent in this, for in doing so thou shalt both save thyself and those that hear thee.
1TI.5.1	Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father, and the younger men as brethren,
1TI.5.2	the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity.
1TI.5.3	Honour widows that are widows indeed.
1TI.5.4	But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let those learn first to govern their house in piety and to recompense their parents, for this is honest and pleasing before God.
1TI.5.5	Now she that is a widow indeed and desolate, trusts in God, and is diligent in supplications and prayers night and day,
1TI.5.6	but she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.
1TI.5.7	Therefore command these things, that they may be blameless.
1TI.5.8	But if any provide not for his own and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
1TI.5.9	Let a widow be placed on the list being not less than sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,
1TI.5.10	having a good testimony of good works, if she has brought up well her children, if she has exercised hospitality, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.
1TI.5.11	But the younger widows refuse, for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they desire to marry,
1TI.5.12	having condemnation, because they have cast off their first faith.
1TI.5.13	And reject also the idle, who have learned to wander about from house to house, and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.
1TI.5.14	I desire therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, govern the house, giving no occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.
1TI.5.15	For some are already turned back after Satan.
1TI.5.16	If any faithful man or woman has widows, let them maintain them and let not the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} be charged, that it may relieve those that are widows indeed.
1TI.5.17	Let the elders that govern well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in the word and doctrine.
1TI.5.18	For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward.
1TI.5.19	Against an elder do not receive an accusation, unless there are two or three witnesses.
1TI.5.20	Those that persist in sin rebuke before all, that the others may also fear.
1TI.5.21	I charge thee before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality.
1TI.5.22	Lay hands suddenly on no one, neither be partaker of the sins of others; keep thyself pure.
1TI.5.23	Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach’s sake and thine often infirmities.
1TI.5.24	Some men’s sins are manifest beforehand, before they come unto judgment, but to others they follow after.
1TI.5.25	Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand, and those that are otherwise cannot be hid.
1TI.6.1	Let all that are under the yoke of slavery count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine not be blasphemed.
1TI.6.2	And those that have faithful masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren, but rather serve them better, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. Teach and exhort this.
1TI.6.3	If anyone teaches otherwise and does not consent to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the doctrine which is according to godliness,
1TI.6.4	he is puffed up, knowing nothing, but is driven mad concerning questions and controversy of words, of which comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,
1TI.6.5	perverse disputings of men of corrupt understanding, and destitute of the truth, using piety as a source of gain: from such withdraw thyself.
1TI.6.6	But piety with contentment is great gain.
1TI.6.7	For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.
1TI.6.8	So that, sustenance and covering, let us be content with this.
1TI.6.9	For those that desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition.
1TI.6.10	For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.
1TI.6.11	But thou, O man of God, flee these things and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, charity, tolerance, meekness.
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, unto which thou art also called, having made a good profession before many witnesses.
1TI.6.13	I give thee charge in the sight of God, who gives life to all things and before Christ Jesus, who testified before Pontius Pilate a good profession;
1TI.6.14	that thou keep the commandment without spot, unrebukeable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
1TI.6.15	who in his time shall show the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;
1TI.6.16	the only one who has immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto, whom no man has seen nor can see, to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen.
1TI.6.17	Charge those that are rich in this world, that they not be highminded, not placing their hope in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy;
1TI.6.18	but charge them to do good, that they be rich in good works, liberal to distribute, willing to communicate,
1TI.6.19	laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the future, that they may lay hold on eternal life.
1TI.6.20	O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, turn away from profane voices and vain things and arguments in the vain name of science,
1TI.6.21	which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
2TI.1.1	Paul, apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,
2TI.1.2	to Timothy, dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace of God the Father and of Christ Jesus our Lord.
2TI.1.3	I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day,
2TI.1.4	greatly desiring to see thee (being mindful of thy tears), that I may be filled with joy,
2TI.1.5	when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that in thee also.
2TI.1.6	Therefore I admonish thee that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands.
2TI.1.7	For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of strength and of love and of temperance.
2TI.1.8	Therefore be not thou ashamed to give testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel by the power of God,
2TI.1.9	who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the times of the ages,
2TI.1.10	but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has annulled death, and has brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel,
2TI.1.11	unto which I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles.
2TI.1.12	For which cause I also suffer these things; nevertheless, I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.
2TI.1.13	Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and charity which is in Christ Jesus.
2TI.1.14	Keep the good deposit committed unto thee by the Holy Spirit which dwells in us.
2TI.1.15	This, thou knowest, that all those who are in Asia are turned away from me, of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes.
2TI.1.16	The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chain;
2TI.1.17	for when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently and found me.
2TI.1.18	The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day; and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
2TI.2.1	Thou, therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
2TI.2.2	And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
2TI.2.3	Thou, therefore, work hard as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
2TI.2.4	No man that wars entangles himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who has chosen him to be a soldier.
2TI.2.5	And also if anyone contends in public contest, he is not crowned, except he contends legitimately.
2TI.2.6	The husbandman, in order to receive the fruits, must first work hard.
2TI.2.7	Understand what I say, that the Lord shall give thee understanding in all things.
2TI.2.8	Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead, according to my gospel,
2TI.2.9	in which I suffer trouble, like unto an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
2TI.2.10	Therefore, I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they may also obtain the saving health which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
2TI.2.11	This is a faithful word: That if we are dead with him, we shall also live with him;
2TI.2.12	if we suffer, we shall also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;
2TI.2.13	if we are unfaithful, yet he remains faithful; he cannot deny himself.
2TI.2.14	Counsel these things, charging them before the Lord. Strive not in words that profit nothing, but rather subvert the hearers.
2TI.2.15	Study to show thyself approved unto God, a workman that has nothing to be ashamed of, rightly dividing the word of truth.
2TI.2.16	But avoid profane and vain wordiness, for it will develop into ungodliness.
2TI.2.17	And that word will eat away as gangrene, of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
2TI.2.18	who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is already past and have overthrown the faith of some.
2TI.2.19	Nevertheless, the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows those that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
2TI.2.20	But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of clay, and likewise some to honour, and some to dishonour.
2TI.2.21	If a man, therefore, purges himself from these things, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and profitable for the master’s use, and prepared unto every good work.
2TI.2.22	Flee also youthful lusts, but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with those that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
2TI.2.23	But foolish and unwise questions refuse, knowing that they do beget contentions.
2TI.2.24	That the slave of the Lord should not be contentious, but be meek unto everyone, apt to teach, patient,
2TI.2.25	that with meekness they might teach those that resist, if God peradventure will grant unto them that they might repent and know the truth,
2TI.2.26	and that they may become converted out of the snare of the devil, in which they are captive to do his will.
2TI.3.1	This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
2TI.3.2	For there shall be men who are lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, evil speakers, disobedient to their parents, unthankful, impure,
2TI.3.3	without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, without temperance, without meekness, without goodness,
2TI.3.4	traitors, rash, puffed up, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God,
2TI.3.5	having the appearance of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
2TI.3.6	For of this sort are those who creep into houses and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with various lusts,
2TI.3.7	ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
2TI.3.8	And in the manner that Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth, men of corrupt understanding, reprobate concerning the faith.
2TI.3.9	But they shall not prevail, for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as that of those also was.
2TI.3.10	But thou hast fully known my doctrine, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
2TI.3.11	persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra, persecutions I have endured, and the Lord delivered me out of them all.
2TI.3.12	And all that desire to live godly in Christ Jesus shall also suffer persecution.
2TI.3.13	But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived.
2TI.3.14	But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and in that which has been entrusted unto thee, knowing of whom thou hast learned them,
2TI.3.15	and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto saving health by the faith which is in Christ Jesus.
2TI.3.16	All scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
2TI.3.17	that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.
2TI.4.1	I charge thee, therefore, before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the living and the dead in his appearing and in his kingdom:
2TI.4.2	Preach the word; be instant in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.
2TI.4.3	For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but, having itching ears, they shall heap up unto themselves teachers who shall speak to them according to their own lusts,
2TI.4.4	and thus they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall return unto fables.
2TI.4.5	But watch thou in all things, labour, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill thy ministry.
2TI.4.6	For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my release is at hand.
2TI.4.7	I have fought a good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith;
2TI.4.8	from now on there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all those also that have loved his appearing.
2TI.4.9	Procure to come shortly unto me;
2TI.4.10	for Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.
2TI.4.11	Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee, for he is profitable to me for the ministry.
2TI.4.12	And Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
2TI.4.13	The cloak that I left at Troas in the house of Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee and the books, but especially the parchments.
2TI.4.14	Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
2TI.4.15	of whom be thou ware also; for he has greatly resisted our words.
2TI.4.16	At my first answer no one stood with me, but all men forsook me: let it not be imputed unto them.
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully known and that all the Gentiles might hear, and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.
2TI.4.18	And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will save me for his heavenly kingdom, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
2TI.4.19	Salute Prisca and Aquila and the household of Onesiphorus.
2TI.4.20	Erastus remained at Corinth, but Trophimus I have left at Miletum sick.
2TI.4.21	Procure to come before winter. Eubulus greets thee, and Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brethren.
2TI.4.22	The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
TIT.1.1	Paul, slave of God, and apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God’s elect and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness;
TIT.1.2	for the hope of eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised before the times of the ages
TIT.1.3	and has manifested in due times. It is his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
TIT.1.4	to Titus, true son in the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus, the Christ, our Saviour.
TIT.1.5	For this cause I left thee in Crete, that thou should correct that which is lacking and set in place elders in every city, as I had commanded thee:
TIT.1.6	He who is blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children who can not be accused of dissoluteness, nor insubordinate.
TIT.1.7	For the bishop must be blameless, as a steward of God; not arrogant, not quick to anger, not given to wine, not hurtful, not greedy of dishonest gain,
TIT.1.8	but a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, temperate, just, holy, gentle,
TIT.1.9	holding fast the doctrine according to the faithful word, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
TIT.1.10	For there are many insubordinate and vain talkers and deceivers of souls, especially those of the circumcision,
TIT.1.11	whose mouths it is expedient to stop, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for dishonest gain.
TIT.1.12	One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies.
TIT.1.13	This witness is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
TIT.1.14	not giving heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
TIT.1.15	For unto the pure all things are pure, but unto those that are defiled and unfaithful, nothing is pure, but even their soul and conscience is defiled.
TIT.1.16	They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him, being abominable and rebellious and reprobate unto every good work.
TIT.2.1	But speak thou the things which are expedient unto sound doctrine,
TIT.2.2	that the aged men be temperate, venerable, prudent, sound in faith, in charity, in tolerance.
TIT.2.3	The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of honesty;
TIT.2.4	that they may teach the young women to be prudent, to love their husbands, to love their children,
TIT.2.5	to be temperate, chaste, good housekeepers, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God not be blasphemed.
TIT.2.6	Young men likewise exhort to be temperate;
TIT.2.7	in all things showing thyself as an example of good works, in doctrine showing integrity, seriousness, purity,
TIT.2.8	sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that the adversary may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
TIT.2.9	Exhort slaves to be subject to their own masters and to please them well in all things; not contradicting;
TIT.2.10	not defrauding, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
TIT.2.11	For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men,
TIT.2.12	teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live temperately, righteously, and godly in this present world;
TIT.2.13	waiting for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
TIT.2.14	who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself a people of his own, zealous of good works.
TIT.2.15	These things speak and exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one despise thee.
TIT.3.1	Admonish them to be subject to dominion and power, and to persuade those who have authority, that they be quick unto every good work.
TIT.3.2	That they speak evil of no one, that they not be contentious, but gentle, showing all meekness unto all men.
TIT.3.3	For we ourselves also were foolish in another time, rebellious, deceived, serving diverse lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.
TIT.3.4	But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,
TIT.3.5	not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,
TIT.3.6	which he poured out abundantly in us through Jesus, the Christ, our Saviour;
TIT.3.7	that being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
TIT.3.8	The Word is faithful, and I desire that thou affirm this constantly, that those who have believed God might be careful to conduct themselves in good works. This is good and profitable unto men.
TIT.3.9	But avoid foolish questions and genealogies and contentions and debates concerning the law, for they are unprofitable and vain.
TIT.3.10	A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, reject him,
TIT.3.11	knowing that he that is such is subverted and sins, being condemned of his own judgment.
TIT.3.12	When I shall send Artemas unto thee or Tychicus, procure to come unto me to Nicopolis; for I have determined to winter there.
TIT.3.13	Send Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on ahead, procuring that nothing be lacking unto them.
TIT.3.14	And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they not be unfruitful.
TIT.3.15	All that are with me salute thee. Greet those that love us in the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.
PHM.1.1	Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy, our brother, unto Philemon, our dearly beloved and fellowlabourer,
PHM.1.2	And to our beloved sister, Apphia, and Archippus, our fellowsoldier and to the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} in thy house:
PHM.1.3	Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.4	I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
PHM.1.5	hearing of thy charity and faith, which thou hast in the Lord Jesus and toward all saints;
PHM.1.6	that the communication of thy faith may become effectual for the knowledge of all the good that is in you by Christ Jesus.
PHM.1.7	For we have great joy and consolation in thy charity because the bowels of the saints have been refreshed by thee, brother.
PHM.1.8	Therefore, though I might be very bold in Christ to command thee that which is expedient,
PHM.1.9	yet for the sake of charity I rather beseech thee, being such a one as Paul the aged and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.10	I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds,
PHM.1.11	who in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now is profitable to thee and to me,
PHM.1.12	whom I send again unto thee; therefore, receive him, as you would receive me.
PHM.1.13	I desired to retain him with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel,
PHM.1.14	but I did not want to do anything without thy counsel, that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
PHM.1.15	Perhaps for this, he departed from you for a season, that thou should have him again forever,
PHM.1.16	not now as a slave, but above a slave, a brother beloved, especially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord.
PHM.1.17	If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
PHM.1.18	If he has wronged thee or owes thee anything, put that on my account;
PHM.1.19	I Paul have written it with my own hand, I will repay it; albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
PHM.1.20	Therefore, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord, that thou might refresh my heart in the Lord.
PHM.1.21	Having confidence in thy obedience, I have written unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
PHM.1.22	In the same manner prepare me also a lodging; for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus, salutes thee.
PHM.1.24	Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
PHM.1.25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
HEB.1.1	God, having spoken many times and in many ways in time past unto the fathers by the prophets,
HEB.1.2	has in these last times spoken unto us by his Son, whom he has appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the ages;
HEB.1.3	who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his substance and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;
HEB.1.4	being made so much better than the angels, as he has by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.
HEB.1.5	For unto which of the angels did he say at any time, Thou art my Son, this day I have begotten thee? And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?
HEB.1.6	And again, when he brought in the firstbegotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.
HEB.1.7	And of the angels he said, Who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire.
HEB.1.8	But unto the Son he said, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: a rod of equity is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
HEB.1.9	Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore, God, even thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
HEB.1.10	And Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:
HEB.1.11	they shall perish; but thou dost remain; and they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
HEB.1.12	and as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed; but thou art the same, and thy years shall never fail.
HEB.1.13	But to which of the angels did he say at any time, Sit on my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool?
HEB.1.14	Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth in service for the love of those who are the heirs of saving health?
HEB.2.1	Therefore, it is necessary that we with more diligence keep the things which we have heard, so that we do not fall.
HEB.2.2	For if the word spoken by the ministry of angels was steadfast and every rebellion and disobedience received a just recompense of reward,
HEB.2.3	how shall we escape, if we belittle such great saving health? Which, having begun to be published by the Lord, has been confirmed unto us by those that heard him,
HEB.2.4	God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders and with diverse miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit, distributing them according to his own will?
HEB.2.5	For unto the angels he has not subjected the world to come, of which we speak.
HEB.2.6	But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man, that thou dost visit him?
HEB.2.7	Thou didst make him a little lower than the angels; thou didst crown him with glory and honour and didst set him over the works of thy hands.
HEB.2.8	Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him. But now we do not see yet that all things are put under him.
HEB.2.9	But we see this same Jesus, crowned with glory and honour, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.
HEB.2.10	For it was expedient that he, for whom are all things and by whom are all things, preparing to bring forth many sons in his glory, should perfect the author of their saving health through sufferings.
HEB.2.11	For both he that sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,
HEB.2.12	saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren; in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee.
HEB.2.13	And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the children which God has given me.
HEB.2.14	Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same, that through death he might destroy him that had the empire of death, that is, the devil,
HEB.2.15	and deliver those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to slavery.
HEB.2.16	For verily he did not take the angels, but he took the seed of Abraham.
HEB.2.17	Therefore in all things he should be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people.
HEB.2.18	For in that he himself has suffered and was tempted, he is also powerful to help those that are tempted.
HEB.3.1	Therefore, brethren, saints, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,
HEB.3.2	who was faithful to him that appointed him over all his house, as also Moses was faithful.
HEB.3.3	For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honour than the house.
HEB.3.4	For every house is built by someone, but he that created all things is God.
HEB.3.5	And Moses verily was faithful over all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after,
HEB.3.6	but Christ as a son over his own house, which house we are, if we hold fast the confidence and the glorious hope firmly until the end.
HEB.3.7	Therefore, as the Holy Spirit saith, Today if ye will hear his voice,
HEB.3.8	harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
HEB.3.9	Where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.
HEB.3.10	Therefore, I was indignant with that generation and said, They do always err from their heart, and they have not known my ways.
HEB.3.11	So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.
HEB.3.12	Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unfaithfulness, to depart from the living God.
HEB.3.13	But exhort one another daily, while it is called Today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.
HEB.3.14	For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end;
HEB.3.15	while it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
HEB.3.16	For some of those that came out of Egypt with Moses, when they had heard, did provoke; howbeit not all.
HEB.3.17	But with whom was he indignant forty years? Was it not with those that had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?
HEB.3.18	And to whom he swore that they should not enter into his rest, but to those that disobeyed?
HEB.3.19	So we see that they could not enter in because of their unbelief.
HEB.4.1	Let us, therefore, fear, lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
HEB.4.2	For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them, but it did not profit those that heard the word without mixing it with faith.
HEB.4.3	(For we who have believed do enter into the rest) as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, they shall not enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
HEB.4.4	For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day like this, And God rested the seventh day from all his works.
HEB.4.5	And in this place again, They shall not enter into my rest.
HEB.4.6	Seeing, therefore, it remains that some must enter therein, and those to whom it was first preached did not enter in because of disobedience;
HEB.4.7	Again, he determines a certain day, saying, Today, by David so long a time afterward; as it is said, Today if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
HEB.4.8	For if Jesus {Joshua in Heb.} had given them rest, then he would not afterward have spoken of another day.
HEB.4.9	There remains therefore a rest {Gr. Sabbatismos} for the people of God.
HEB.4.10	For he that is entered into his rest, he also has ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
HEB.4.11	Let us therefore make haste to enter into that rest, lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience.
HEB.4.12	For the word of God is alive and efficient and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
HEB.4.13	Neither is there any created thing that is not manifested in his presence, but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him of whom we speak.
HEB.4.14	Having, therefore, a great high priest who penetrated the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast this profession of our hope.
HEB.4.15	For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
HEB.4.16	Let us, therefore, come boldly unto the throne of his grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
HEB.5.1	For every high priest is taken from among men, constituted on behalf of men in things relating to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,
HEB.5.2	who can have compassion on the ignorant and on those that are in error; for he himself is also compassed with weakness.
HEB.5.3	And by reason of this he ought, as for the people so also for himself, to offer for sins.
HEB.5.4	And no one takes this honour unto himself, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.
HEB.5.5	So also the Christ did not glorify himself to make himself high priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son; today have I begotten thee.
HEB.5.6	As he said also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
HEB.5.7	Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death, was heard because of his reverent fear;
HEB.5.8	although he was the Son of God, yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffered;
HEB.5.9	and being made perfect, he became the author of eternal saving health unto all those that hearken unto him,
HEB.5.10	named by God high priest after the order of Melchisedec.
HEB.5.11	Of whom we have many things to say and difficult to declare, seeing ye are hard of hearing.
HEB.5.12	For you should now be teaching others, if we look at the time, yet you need to be taught again which are the first elements of the oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong food.
HEB.5.13	For any one that uses milk is not qualified in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.
HEB.5.14	But strong food belongs to those that are perfect, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.
HEB.6.1	Therefore, leaving now the word of the beginning of the establishment of the Christ, let us go on unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from works of death, and of faith in God,
HEB.6.2	of the doctrine of the baptisms, and of the laying on of hands, and of the resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.
HEB.6.3	And this we will indeed do, if God permits.
HEB.6.4	For it is impossible that those who once received the light and tasted of that heavenly gift and were made partakers of the Holy Spirit
HEB.6.5	and likewise have tasted the good word of God and the virtue of the age to come,
HEB.6.6	and have backslidden, be renewed again by repentance, crucifying again for themselves the Son of God and putting him to an open shame.
HEB.6.7	For the earth which drinks in the rain that comes often upon it and brings forth herbs in season for those by whom it is dressed receives blessing from God;
HEB.6.8	but that which bears thorns and briers is rejected and is near unto cursing, whose end shall be by fire.
HEB.6.9	But, beloved, we expect better things than these of you, things near unto saving health, though we thus speak.
HEB.6.10	For God is not unjust to forget your work and labour of charity which ye have showed in his name, having helped the saints and helping them.
HEB.6.11	But we desire that each one of you show the same diligence until the end for the fulfillment of your hope,
HEB.6.12	that ye not become slothful, but imitators of those who by faith and patience inherit the promises.
HEB.6.13	For when God promised unto Abraham, because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself,
HEB.6.14	saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee.
HEB.6.15	And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise.
HEB.6.16	For men verily swear by the greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all controversy.
HEB.6.17	In which God, desiring to show more abundantly unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an oath,
HEB.6.18	that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us,
HEB.6.19	which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which enters even into that which is within the veil,
HEB.6.20	where our precursor, Jesus, has entered for us and is made high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
HEB.7.1	For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
HEB.7.2	to whom Abraham also gave a tenth part of all; first being by interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King of Salem, which is King of peace;
HEB.7.3	without father, without mother, without lineage, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life, but made like unto the Son of God; abides a priest continually.
HEB.7.4	Now consider how great this one was, unto whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.
HEB.7.5	And verily those that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they also have come out of the loins of Abraham;
HEB.7.6	but he whose descent is not counted in those took tithes from Abraham and blessed him that had the promises.
HEB.7.7	And without any contradiction the less is blessed of the better.
HEB.7.8	In the same manner, here men that die take tithes; but there he received them, of whom it is witnessed that he lives.
HEB.7.9	And as I may so say, Levi also, who received tithes, paid tithes in Abraham.
HEB.7.10	For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.
HEB.7.11	If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec and not be called after the order of Aaron?
HEB.7.12	For the priesthood being transposed, there is made of necessity a translation also of the law.
HEB.7.13	For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no one presided at the altar.
HEB.7.14	For it is manifest that our Lord sprang out of Juda, of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.
HEB.7.15	And it is yet far more manifest: if there arises another priest who is like unto Melchisedec,
HEB.7.16	who is not made according to the law of a carnal commandment, but by the virtue of an indissoluble life;
HEB.7.17	for the testimony is of this manner, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
HEB.7.18	For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness of it;
HEB.7.19	for the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by which we draw near unto God.
HEB.7.20	And even more, inasmuch as it is not without an oath
HEB.7.21	(for the others indeed without an oath were made priests, but this one with an oath by him that said unto him, The Lord swore and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec);
HEB.7.22	by so much better testament is Jesus made surety.
HEB.7.23	And the others, truly, were many priests because they were not able to continue by reason of death:
HEB.7.24	but this man, because he continues forever, has the intransmissible priesthood.
HEB.7.25	Therefore he is able also to save to the uttermost those that come unto God by him, seeing he ever lives to make intercession for them.
HEB.7.26	For it was expedient that we have such a high priest, who is holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,
HEB.7.27	who needs not daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifice, first for his own sins and then for the people’s; for this he did once, when he offered up himself.
HEB.7.28	For the law makes men high priests who have weakness; but the word of the oath, which was after the law, has made perfect a Son forever.
HEB.8.1	Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such a high priest who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,
HEB.8.2	a minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
HEB.8.3	For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices; therefore, it is also necessary that this one have something to offer.
HEB.8.4	For if he were on earth, he should not even be a priest, being present still the other priests that offer gifts according to the law,
HEB.8.5	(who serve as an example and shadow of the heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern showed unto thee in the mount);
HEB.8.6	but now a more excellent ministry is his, in that he is the mediator of a better testament, which was established upon better promises.
HEB.8.7	For if that first covenant had been faultless, then no place should have been sought for the second.
HEB.8.8	For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new testament with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,
HEB.8.9	not according to the testament that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, because they did not continue in my testament, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
HEB.8.10	For this is the testament that I will ordain to the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my laws into their soul and write them upon their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
HEB.8.11	and no one shall teach his neighbour nor anyone his brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
HEB.8.12	For I will reconcile their iniquities and their sins, and their iniquities I will remember no more.
HEB.8.13	In that he says, New, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.
HEB.9.1	Nevertheless the first had its justifications of worship and its worldly sanctuary.
HEB.9.2	For there was a tabernacle made: the first, in which was the lampstand and the table and the showbread, which is called the sanctuary.
HEB.9.3	And after the second veil was the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,
HEB.9.4	which had a golden censer and the ark of the covenant overlaid round about with gold, in which was the golden urn that had the manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded, and the tables of the testament,
HEB.9.5	and over it the cherubim of glory shadowing the seat of reconciliation, of which we cannot now speak particularly.
HEB.9.6	Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of God.
HEB.9.7	But into the second the high priest went alone once every year, not without blood, which he offered for his own ignorance, and for that of the people:
HEB.9.8	The Holy Spirit signifying in this, that the way into the sanctuary was not yet made manifest, as long as the first tabernacle was yet standing:
HEB.9.9	Which was a figure of that time present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience,
HEB.9.10	but in foods and drinks and different washings and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of correction.
HEB.9.11	But Christ being now come, high priest of the good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is to say, not of this creation,
HEB.9.12	neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood he entered in once into the sanctuary designed for eternal redemption.
HEB.9.13	For if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctified to the purifying of the flesh,
HEB.9.14	how much more shall the blood of the Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from the works of death to serve the living God?
HEB.9.15	And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament, so that death intervening for the redemption of the rebellions that took place under the first testament, those who are called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.
HEB.9.16	For where a testament is, there must also of necessity intervene the death of the testator.
HEB.9.17	For a testament is confirmed by the death: otherwise it is not valid as long as the testator lives.
HEB.9.18	From which came that not even the first one was dedicated without blood.
HEB.9.19	For when Moses had read every commandment of the law to all the people, taking the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book and all the people,
HEB.9.20	saying, This is the blood of the testament which God has commanded unto you.
HEB.9.21	Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry.
HEB.9.22	And almost all things are by the law purged with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.
HEB.9.23	So that it was necessary that the figures of the heavenly things should be purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
HEB.9.24	For Christ is not entered into the sanctuary made with hands (which is a figure of the true), but into the heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us,
HEB.9.25	nor yet that he should offer himself many times (as the high priest enters into the sanctuary each year with blood that is not his own);
HEB.9.26	otherwise it would have been necessary for him to suffer many times since the foundation of the world; but now once in the consummation of the ages he has appeared to abolish sin by the sacrifice of himself.
HEB.9.27	And as it is appointed unto men to die once, and after this the judgment;
HEB.9.28	so also the Christ is offered once to take away the sins of many; and unto those that wait for him without sin he shall appear the second time unto saving health.
HEB.10.1	For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never make perfect those who come by the same sacrifices which they offer year by year continually.
HEB.10.2	Otherwise, they would cease to offer them, because those that sacrifice, once purged, would have no more conscience of sin.
HEB.10.3	But in these sacrifices each year the same remembrance of sins is made.
HEB.10.4	For the blood of bulls and of goats cannot take away sins.
HEB.10.5	Therefore when he came into the world, he said, Sacrifice and offering thou dost not desire, but a body hast thou prepared me;
HEB.10.6	in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no pleasure.
HEB.10.7	Then said I, Behold, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will, O God.
HEB.10.8	Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings and offering for sin thou dost not desire, neither hadst pleasure therein, which are offered by the law;
HEB.10.9	then he said, Behold, I come to do thy will, O God. He took away the first, that he may establish the second.
HEB.10.10	In this will, we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus, the Christ, once for all.
HEB.10.11	And so every priest stands daily ministering and offering many times the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins,
HEB.10.12	but this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, is seated at the right hand of God,
HEB.10.13	waiting for that which follows, that is, until his enemies are made his footstool.
HEB.10.14	For by one offering he has perfected for ever those that are sanctified.
HEB.10.15	Likewise the Holy Spirit gives us the same witness, who afterwards said,
HEB.10.16	This is the testament that I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord, I will give my laws in their hearts, and in their souls will I write them;
HEB.10.17	and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.
HEB.10.18	Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin./strong>
HEB.10.19	Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,
HEB.10.20	by a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
HEB.10.21	and having that great priest over the house of God,
HEB.10.22	let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts purified from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water;
HEB.10.23	let us hold fast the profession of our hope without wavering (for he is faithful that promised).
HEB.10.24	And let us consider one another to provoke unto charity and unto good works,
HEB.10.25	not forsaking our gathering together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another and so much the more, when ye see that day approaching.
HEB.10.26	For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins,
HEB.10.27	but a certain fearful hope of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.
HEB.10.28	He that despised the law of Moses died without mercy under two or three witnesses:
HEB.10.29	Of how much greater punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden underfoot the Son of God and has counted the blood of the covenant, with which he was sanctified, an unholy thing and has done despite unto the Spirit of grace?
HEB.10.30	For we know who he is that has said, Vengeance belongs to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge his people.
HEB.10.31	It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	But bring to memory the former days, in which, after ye received the light, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;
HEB.10.33	on the one hand ye were made a spectacle both by reproaches and tribulations, and on the other ye became companions of those that were so used.
HEB.10.34	For ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing that in yourselves ye have a better substance in the heavens, and that abides.
HEB.10.35	Do not lose, therefore, this your confidence, which has great recompense of reward;
HEB.10.36	for patience is necessary, so that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise.
HEB.10.37	For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come and will not tarry.
HEB.10.38	Now the just shall live by faith, but if any man draws back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.
HEB.10.39	But we are not of those who draw back unto perdition, but faithful unto the saving of the soul.
HEB.11.1	Faith, therefore, is the substance of things waited for, the evidence of things not seen.
HEB.11.2	For by it the elders obtained a good report.
HEB.11.3	Through faith we understand that the ages were framed by the word of God, that which is seen being made of that which was not seen.
HEB.11.4	By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying of his gifts, and by it he being dead yet speaks.
HEB.11.5	By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death, and was not found because God had translated him, for before his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.
HEB.11.6	But without faith it is impossible to please God; for he that comes to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him.
HEB.11.7	By faith Noah, having received revelation of things not seen as yet, with great care prepared an ark to the saving of his house, by which he condemned the world and was made heir of the righteousness which is by faith.
HEB.11.8	By faith Abraham, being called, hearkened to go out into the place which he should afterwards receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he went.
HEB.11.9	By faith he sojourned in the promised land, as in a strange country, dwelling in booths with Isaac and Jacob, the heirs with him of the same promise;
HEB.11.10	for he looked for a city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.
HEB.11.11	By faith also Sara herself being sterile received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age, because she believed him to be faithful who had promised.
HEB.11.12	Therefore there sprang even of one, and him as good as dead, so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea shore innumerable.
HEB.11.13	These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but seeing them afar off and believing them and embracing them and confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.
HEB.11.14	For those that say such things declare plainly that they seek their native country.
HEB.11.15	And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from which they came out, they might have had time to have returned.
HEB.11.16	But now they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one; therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.
HEB.11.17	By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac, and he that had received the promises offered up his only begotten son,
HEB.11.18	of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called,
HEB.11.19	accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the dead; from whence he also received him in a figure.
HEB.11.20	By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning what they should become.
HEB.11.21	By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed both the sons of Joseph, and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.
HEB.11.22	By faith Joseph, as he died, made mention of the departing of the sons of Israel, and gave a commandment concerning his bones.
HEB.11.23	By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months by his parents because they saw he was a beautiful child, and they were not afraid of the king’s commandment.
HEB.11.24	By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter,
HEB.11.25	choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season,
HEB.11.26	esteeming the reproach of the Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt, for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward.
HEB.11.27	By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
HEB.11.28	By faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of the blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.
HEB.11.29	By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land, which the Egyptians attempted to do and were drowned.
HEB.11.30	By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days.
HEB.11.31	By faith the harlot Rahab did not perish together with the disobedient, having received the spies with peace.
HEB.11.32	And what shall I more say? For the time would fail me to tell of Gedeon and of Barak and of Samson and of Jephthae, of David also and Samuel and of the prophets,
HEB.11.33	who by faith won kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
HEB.11.34	quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, recovered from infirmities, were made valiant in battle, turned to flight the armies of foreign enemies;
HEB.11.35	women received their dead raised to life again, and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection;
HEB.11.36	and others experienced cruel mockings and scourgings, and added to this, bonds and imprisonment;
HEB.11.37	they were stoned; they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; poor, afflicted, mistreated,
HEB.11.38	(of whom the world was not worthy); they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth.
HEB.11.39	And these all, approved by testimony of faith, received not the promise,
HEB.11.40	God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.
HEB.12.1	Therefore, seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses, leaving behind all the weight of the sin which surrounds us, let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
HEB.12.2	with our eyes fixed on Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who having been offered joy, endured the cross {Gr. stauros – stake}, despising the shame and was seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
HEB.12.3	For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest ye be wearied in your souls and faint.
HEB.12.4	Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, fighting against sin.
HEB.12.5	And ye have quite forgotten the consolation which speaks unto you as unto sons, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art reproved of him:
HEB.12.6	for whom the Lord loves, he chastens and scourges everyone whom he receives as a son.
HEB.12.7	If ye endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father does not chasten?
HEB.12.8	But if ye are without chastisement, of which all the sons are partakers, then ye are bastards, and not sons.
HEB.12.9	Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh who corrected us, and we gave them reverence; is it not much better to be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and we shall live?
HEB.12.10	For they verily for a few days chastened us as it seemed good unto them, but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of his holiness.
HEB.12.11	It is true that no chastening at present seems to be cause for joy, but rather for grief; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto those who are exercised by it.
HEB.12.12	Therefore, lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees,
HEB.12.13	and make straight steps unto your feet, so that which is lame will not turn out of the way, but let it rather be healed.
HEB.12.14	Follow peace with everyone and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord:
HEB.12.15	looking diligently that no one deviate from the grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up impede you, and thereby many be defiled,
HEB.12.16	lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau, who for one morsel of food sold his birthright.
HEB.12.17	For ye know how that afterward, desiring to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.
HEB.12.18	For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest
HEB.12.19	and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, which voice those that heard intreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more;
HEB.12.20	(for they could not endure that which was commanded, and if so much as a beast should touch the mountain, it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart:
HEB.12.21	and so terrible was the sight that Moses said, I exceedingly fear and quake);
HEB.12.22	but ye are come unto Mount Sion and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels,
HEB.12.23	to the congregation of the called out ones of the firstborn, who are registered in the heavens and to God the Judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect
HEB.12.24	and to Jesus, the mediator of the new testament and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better than that of Abel.
HEB.12.25	See that you do not refuse him that speaks. For if those who refused him that spoke on earth did not escape, much less shall we escape, if we turn away from him that speaks from the heavens,
HEB.12.26	whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, Yet even once, I shall shake not the earth only, but also the heaven.
HEB.12.27	And this word, Yet even once, signifies the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.
HEB.12.28	Therefore, receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us hold fast to the grace, by which we serve God, pleasing him with reverence and godly fear:
HEB.12.29	for our God is a consuming fire.
HEB.13.1	Let brotherly love continue.
HEB.13.2	Do not forget to show hospitality; for thereby some, having entertained angels, were kept.
HEB.13.3	Remember those that are in bonds as bound with them and those who suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body.
HEB.13.4	Let marriage be honourable in all and the bed undefiled; but the fornicators and adulterers God will judge.
HEB.13.5	Let your conversation be without covetousness, and be content with such things as ye have; for he has said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
HEB.13.6	So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
HEB.13.7	Remember your pastors, who have spoken unto you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation:
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and for the ages.
HEB.13.9	Be not taken out of the way with diverse and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with foods which have not profited those that have been occupied with them.
HEB.13.10	We have an altar, of which those who serve the tabernacle have no faculty to eat.
HEB.13.11	For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned outside the camp.
HEB.13.12	Therefore, Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered outside the gate.
HEB.13.13	Let us go forth, therefore, unto him outside the camp, bearing his reproach.
HEB.13.14	For here we have no continuing city, but we seek the one that is coming.
HEB.13.15	By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips confessing his name.
HEB.13.16	Do not forget to do good and to fellowship; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
HEB.13.17	Listen to your pastors, and do not resist them, for they watch for your souls as those that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you.
HEB.13.18	Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience in all things desiring to conduct ourselves well.
HEB.13.19	And I beseech you all the more to do this, that I may be restored unto you sooner.
HEB.13.20	Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the eternal testament,
HEB.13.21	make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for the ages of the ages. Amen.
HEB.13.22	And I beseech you, brethren, that ye receive this word of exhortation, that I have written unto you briefly.
HEB.13.23	Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he comes shortly, I will see you.
HEB.13.24	Salute all thy pastors and all the saints. The brethren of Italy salute you.
HEB.13.25	Grace be with you all. Amen.
JAS.1.1	James, {Gr. Jacob}, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus, the Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
JAS.1.2	My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into diverse trials,
JAS.1.3	knowing that the proving of your faith works patience,
JAS.1.4	and the patience finishes the work, that ye may be perfect and entire, not lacking in anything.
JAS.1.5	And if any of you lacks wisdom, let them ask of God (who gives abundantly to all, and without reproach), and it shall be given them.
JAS.1.6	But ask in faith, not doubting anything. For he that doubts is like the wave of the sea which is driven of the wind and is tossed from one side to another.
JAS.1.7	For let not such a man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord.
JAS.1.8	The double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
JAS.1.9	Let the brother of low degree rejoice in his high status;
JAS.1.10	and he who is rich, in his low status, because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
JAS.1.11	For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and its flower falls, and the beautiful appearance of it perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
JAS.1.12	Blessed is the man that patiently endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to those that love him.
JAS.1.13	Let no one say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither does he tempt anyone:
JAS.1.14	But each one is tempted, when they are drawn away of their own lust and enticed.
JAS.1.15	Then when lust has conceived, it brings forth sin; and sin, when it is finished, brings forth death.
JAS.1.16	Do not err, my beloved brethren.
JAS.1.17	Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness neither shadow of turning.
JAS.1.18	He, of his own will, has begotten us with the word of truth, that we should be the firstfruits of his creatures.
JAS.1.19	Therefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;
JAS.1.20	for the wrath of man does not work the righteousness of God.
JAS.1.21	So then, leave all uncleanness and remains of malice and receive with meekness the word ingested within you, which is able to cause your souls to be saved.
JAS.1.22	But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
JAS.1.23	For if anyone hears the word and does not put it into practice, this same is like unto the man beholding his natural face in a mirror:
JAS.1.24	For he considered himself and went his way and in one hour forgot what he was like.
JAS.1.25	But whosoever has looked attentively into the perfect law of liberty and has persevered in it, not being a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, the same shall be blessed in their deed.
JAS.1.26	If anyone among you thinks to be religious and does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his own heart, his religion is vain.
JAS.1.27	The pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their tribulation and to keep thyself unspotted from this world.
JAS.2.1	My brethren, do not have the faith of our Lord Jesus, the glorious Christ, with respect of persons.
JAS.2.2	For if a man with a gold ring and in precious apparel comes into your synagogue and a poor person in vile raiment also comes in,
JAS.2.3	and ye have respect to him that wears the precious clothing and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there or sit here under my footstool:
JAS.2.4	Are ye not then judging in yourselves and are become judges of evil thoughts?
JAS.2.5	Hearken, my beloved brethren, Has not God chosen the poor of this world that they might be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to those that love him?
JAS.2.6	But ye have despised the poor. Do not the rich oppress you with tyranny and draw you with violence to the courts?
JAS.2.7	Do they not blaspheme that worthy name by which ye are called?
JAS.2.8	If ye truly fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well;
JAS.2.9	but if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin and are accused of the law as rebels.
JAS.2.10	For whosoever shall have kept the whole law, and then offends in one point is made guilty of all.
JAS.2.11	For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not murder. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou commit murder, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
JAS.2.12	So speak ye and so do as those that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
JAS.2.13	For judgment without mercy shall be done unto the one that has shown no mercy; and mercy boasts against judgment.
JAS.2.14	My brethren, What shall it profit though someone says that they have faith and do not have works? Shall this type of faith be able to save them?
JAS.2.15	If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food,
JAS.2.16	and one of you says unto them, Depart in peace; be ye warmed and filled; but ye do not give them those things which are needful for the body; what shall it profit them?
JAS.2.17	Even so faith, if it does not have works, is dead in and of itself.
JAS.2.18	But someone may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works; show me thy faith without thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works.
JAS.2.19	Thou believest that God is one; thou doest well; the demons also believe and tremble.
JAS.2.20	But, O vain man, dost thou desire to know that faith without works is dead?
JAS.2.21	Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar?
JAS.2.22	Dost thou not see how the faith worked together with his works, and the faith was complete by the works?
JAS.2.23	And that the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness, and he was called the Friend of God.
JAS.2.24	Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not only by faith.
JAS.2.25	Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she received the messengers and sent them out another way?
JAS.2.26	For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
JAS.3.1	My brethren, make not unto yourselves many teachers, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
JAS.3.2	For we all offend in many things. If any man offends not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to govern the whole body with restraint.
JAS.3.3	Behold, we put bits (or restraint) in the horses’ mouths to persuade them, and we govern their whole body.
JAS.3.4	Behold also the ships, which though they are so great are driven of fierce winds, yet they are governed with a very small rudder, wherever the governor desires.
JAS.3.5	In the same manner, the tongue is a very small member and boasts of great things. Behold, how great a forest a little fire kindles!
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body and sets on fire the course of our nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
JAS.3.7	For every nature of beasts and of birds and of serpents and of beings in the sea may be tamed and is tamed by mankind,
JAS.3.8	but no man can tame the tongue, which is an evil that cannot be restrained and is full of deadly poison.
JAS.3.9	With it we bless God, even the Father; and with it we curse men, who are made in the image of God.
JAS.3.10	Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so.
JAS.3.11	Does a fountain send forth at the same place both sweet and bitter water?
JAS.3.12	Can the fig tree, my brethren, produce olive berries? or the vine, figs? In the same manner no fountain can yield both salt water and fresh.
JAS.3.13	Who is wise and ready among you? let him show out of a good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom.
JAS.3.14	But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, boast not and do not be liars against the truth.
JAS.3.15	This wisdom is not that which descends from above, but is earthly, natural, diabolical.
JAS.3.16	For where there is envy and contention, there is confusion and every perverse work.
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, modest, benevolent, full of mercy and of good fruits, not judgmental, unfeigned.
JAS.3.18	And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace unto those that make peace.
JAS.4.1	Where do the wars and disputes come from among you? From here that is to say, of your lusts which fight in your members?
JAS.4.2	Ye covet and have not; ye murder, and have envy and cannot obtain; ye fight and war and have not that which ye desire because ye ask not.
JAS.4.3	Ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your pleasures.
JAS.4.4	Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? Whosoever therefore that desires to be a friend of the world, makes himself the enemy of God.
JAS.4.5	Do ye think that the scripture says in vain, The spirit that dwells in us lusts to envy?
JAS.4.6	But he gives greater grace. Therefore he says, God resists the proud, but gives grace unto the humble.
JAS.4.7	Submit yourselves, therefore, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
JAS.4.8	Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
JAS.4.9	Be afflicted and mourn and weep; let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness.
JAS.4.10	Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
JAS.4.11	Murmur not against one another, brethren. He that speaks evil of his brother and judges his brother, speaks evil of the law and judges the law; but if thou judge the law, thou art not a keeper of the law, but a judge.
JAS.4.12	There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou to judge another?
JAS.4.13	Come now, ye that say, Today and tomorrow we will go into such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gain;
JAS.4.14	and ye do not know what shall be tomorrow. For what is your life? Certainly it is a vapour that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.
JAS.4.15	Ye ought to say instead, If the Lord wills, and if we live, we shall do this or that.
JAS.4.16	But now ye boast in your arrogance; all such glory is evil.
JAS.4.17	Therefore sin is still in the one that knows to do good and does not do it.
JAS.5.1	Come now, Oh ye rich, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you.
JAS.5.2	Your riches are rotten, and your garments are motheaten.
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver is corrupted with rust; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you and shall completely eat your flesh, as fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.
JAS.5.4	Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped your fields (which you have kept back by fraud) cries out; and the cries of those who have reaped have entered into the ears of the Lord of the hosts.
JAS.5.5	Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth and been wanton; ye have refreshed your hearts, as in the day of slaughter of sacrifices.
JAS.5.6	Ye have condemned and murdered the just, and he does not resist you.
JAS.5.7	Be patient, therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord. Behold, the husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth, waiting patiently until it receives the early and latter rain.
JAS.5.8	Be ye also patient and confirm your hearts, for the coming of the Lord draws near.
JAS.5.9	Complain not one against another, brethren, that ye not be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.
JAS.5.10	Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.
JAS.5.11	Behold, we count blessed those who endure. Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very merciful, and full of compassion.
JAS.5.12	But above all things, my brethren, do not swear by heaven or by the earth or by any other oath, but let your yes be yes and your no, no; lest ye fall into condemnation.
JAS.5.13	Is anyone among you afflicted? let them pray. Is anyone happy? let them sing.
JAS.5.14	Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}; and let them pray for him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord;
JAS.5.15	and the prayer of faith shall cause the one who is sick to be saved, and the Lord shall raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he shall be forgiven them.
JAS.5.16	Confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that ye may be whole. The effectual prayer of the righteous is very powerful.
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a man subject to passions like unto ours, and he asked in prayer that it might not rain, and it did not rain on the earth for three years and six months.
JAS.5.18	And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought forth her fruit.
JAS.5.19	Brethren, if any of you have erred from the truth, and someone should convert him;
JAS.5.20	let that one know, that whosoever causes the sinner to convert from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall cover a multitude of sins.
1PE.1.1	Peter, apostle of Jesus, the Christ, to the strangers scattered in Pontus, in Galatia, in Cappadocia, in Asia, and in Bithynia,
1PE.1.2	chosen (according to the foreknowledge of God the Father) in sanctification of the Spirit, to obey and be sprinkled with the blood of Jesus, the Christ, Grace and peace, be multiplied unto you.
1PE.1.3	Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, the Christ, who according to his great mercy has begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus, the Christ, from the dead,
1PE.1.4	unto the incorruptible inheritance that cannot be defiled and that does not fade away, conserved in the heavens for you,
1PE.1.5	who are kept in the virtue of God by faith, to attain unto the saving health which is made ready to be manifested in the last time.
1PE.1.6	In which ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, ye are afflicted in diverse temptations,
1PE.1.7	that the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold (which perishes, nevertheless it is tried with fire), might be found unto praise and glory and honour when Jesus, the Christ, is made manifest;
1PE.1.8	whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though at present ye see him not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory;
1PE.1.9	receiving the end of your faith, even the saving health of your souls.
1PE.1.10	Of which saving health the prophets, (who prophesied of the grace that was to come in you) have enquired and searched diligently;
1PE.1.11	searching when and in what point of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, which announced beforehand the afflictions that were to come upon the Christ, and the glory that should follow them.
1PE.1.12	Unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves, but unto us they did administer the things, which are now announced unto you by those that have preached the gospel unto you by the Holy Spirit sent down from heaven, which things the angels desire to look into.
1PE.1.13	Therefore, having the loins of your understanding girded with temperance, wait perfectly in the grace that is presented unto you when Jesus, the Christ, is manifested unto you,
1PE.1.14	as obedient sons, not conforming yourselves with the former desires that you had before in your ignorance,
1PE.1.15	but as he who has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation;
1PE.1.16	for it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.
1PE.1.17	And if ye invoke as Father, he who without respect of persons judges according to the work of each one, converse in fear the entire time of your sojourning here,
1PE.1.18	knowing that ye have been ransomed from your vain conversation (which you received from your fathers), not with corruptible things like silver and gold,
1PE.1.19	but with the precious blood of the Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without contamination,
1PE.1.20	already ordained from before the foundation of the world, but was manifest in these last times for love of you,
1PE.1.21	who by him do believe God, who raised him up from the dead and has given him glory: that your faith and hope might be in God.
1PE.1.22	Having purified your souls in the obedience of the truth, by the Spirit, in unfeigned brotherly love, love one another with a pure heart fervently,
1PE.1.23	being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which lives and abides for ever.
1PE.1.24	For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass. The grass withers, and its flower falls away,
1PE.1.25	but the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you.
1PE.2.1	Having therefore left all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all murmurings,
1PE.2.2	as newborn babes, desire the rational milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby in health;
1PE.2.3	if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is benevolent;
1PE.2.4	coming unto whom (is the living Stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious),
1PE.2.5	ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, well pleasing to God by Jesus, the Christ.
1PE.2.6	Therefore, also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion the chief corner stone, chosen, precious; and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.
1PE.2.7	Unto you, therefore, who believe he is precious; but unto those who are disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,
1PE.2.8	and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, even to those who stumble at the word, not obeying in that for which they were ordained.
1PE.2.9	But ye are the chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, an acquired people, that ye should show forth the virtues of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.
1PE.2.10	Ye who in the time past were not a people, but are now the people of God, who in the time past had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
1PE.2.11	Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from the carnal desires which war against the soul
1PE.2.12	and have your honest conversation among the Gentiles, so that, in that which they murmur about you as of evildoers, having witnessed your good works, they may glorify God in the day of visitation.
1PE.2.13	Therefore, be subject to every human ordinance that is of the Lord, whether it be to a king or to a superior,
1PE.2.14	and unto governors as unto those that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those that do well.
1PE.2.15	For this is the will of God, that in well doing ye may silence the ignorance of vain men,
1PE.2.16	as being free, yet not using your liberty to cover maliciousness, but as slaves of God.
1PE.2.17	Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.
1PE.2.18	Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and humane, but also to the unjust.
1PE.2.19	For this is due to grace, if a man for conscience toward God endures grief, suffering wrongfully.
1PE.2.20	For what glory is it if, when ye are buffeted for your faults, ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well and suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is due to grace from God.
1PE.2.21	Because for this were ye called: for the Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps
1PE.2.22	who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth,
1PE.2.23	who, when he was cursed, did not return the curse; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but committed himself to him that judges righteously;
1PE.2.24	he himself bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness; by whose wound ye were healed.
1PE.2.25	For ye were as sheep that had gone astray, but are now converted unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
1PE.3.1	Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, so that also those who do not obey the Word, may be won without a word by the conversation of their wives,
1PE.3.2	considering your chaste conversation which is in fear.
1PE.3.3	Let their adorning not be outward with ostentatious hairdos and wearing of gold nor in composition of apparel,
1PE.3.4	but let the interior adorning of the heart be without corruption, and of an agreeable spirit and peaceful, which is precious in the sight of God.
1PE.3.5	For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who waited upon God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands,
1PE.3.6	as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, of whom ye are made daughters, doing well and not being afraid of any terror.
1PE.3.7	Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them wisely, giving honour unto the woman, as unto a more fragile vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers not be hindered.
1PE.3.8	And finally, be ye all of one consent, of one affection, loving each other fraternally, merciful, courteous,
1PE.3.9	not rendering evil for evil or curse for curse, but to the contrary, blessing, knowing that ye are called, that ye should possess a blessing by inheritance.
1PE.3.10	For he that desires to love life and see the good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil and his lips that they speak no guile;
1PE.3.11	let him separate himself from evil and do good; let him seek peace and follow it.
1PE.3.12	For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those that do evil.
1PE.3.13	And who is he that can harm you, if ye are followers of that which is good?
1PE.3.14	But also if ye suffer anything for righteousness’ sake, blessed are ye; therefore, be not afraid of their terror neither be troubled,
1PE.3.15	but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to respond to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and reverence,
1PE.3.16	having a good conscience, so in that which they murmur against you as of evildoers, those that blaspheme your good conversation in the Christ may be confused.
1PE.3.17	For it is better (if the will of God so desires) that ye suffer for doing good than for doing evil.
1PE.3.18	For the Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in spirit,
1PE.3.19	in which he also went and preached unto the imprisoned spirits,
1PE.3.20	which in the time past were disobedient, when once the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being made ready, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.
1PE.3.21	Unto the figure of which the baptism that does now correspond saves us (not taking away the uncleanness of the flesh, but giving testimony of a good conscience before God) by the resurrection of Jesus, the Christ,
1PE.3.22	who is at the right hand of God, having ascended into heaven, unto whom the angels and the authorities and powers are subject.
1PE.4.1	Since the Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, be ye also armed with the same thought; for he that has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
1PE.4.2	so that now the time that remains in the flesh, he might live, not unto the lusts of men, but unto the will of God.
1PE.4.3	For it should suffice us that during the time past of our life we had done the will of the Gentiles, when we conversed in lasciviousness, lusts, drunkenness, gluttony, orgies, and abominable idolatries.
1PE.4.4	And it seems strange to those that speak evil of you, that ye do not run with them to the same unchecked dissolution;
1PE.4.5	the same shall give account to him that is ready to judge the living and the dead.
1PE.4.6	Because for this cause was the gospel preached also to those that are dead, that they might be judged in flesh according to men, but live in spirit according to God.
1PE.4.7	But the end of all things is at hand; be ye, therefore, temperate and watch unto prayer.
1PE.4.8	And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves; for charity shall cover a multitude of sins.
1PE.4.9	Lovingly be hospitable one to another without murmuring.
1PE.4.10	Let each one according to the gift that he has received, administer it unto the others, as a good steward of the diverse graces of God.
1PE.4.11	If anyone speaks, let him speak as the oracles of God; if anyone ministers, let them do it according to the virtue which God gives, that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus, the Christ, unto whom is glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE.4.12	Beloved, think it not strange when you are tried by fire (which is done to prove you) as though some strange thing happened unto you,
1PE.4.13	but rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of the afflictions of the Christ, so that also in the revelation of his glory, ye may rejoice in triumph.
1PE.4.14	If ye are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are ye; for the glory and the Spirit of God rests upon you; certainly on their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified.
1PE.4.15	So let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an evildoer, or as desirous of the things of others.
1PE.4.16	But if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this behalf.
1PE.4.17	For it is time that the judgment begins from the house of God; and if it first begins with us, what shall the end be of those that do not obey the gospel of God?
1PE.4.18	And if the righteous are saved with difficulty, where shall the unfaithful and the sinner appear?
1PE.4.19	Therefore, let those that are afflicted according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls unto him as unto a faithful Creator, doing good.
1PE.5.1	The elders who are among you I exhort (I am also an elder with them and a witness of the afflictions of the Christ, and also a participant of the glory that shall be revealed).
1PE.5.2	Feed the flock of God which is among you, caring for her, not by force, but willingly; not for shameful lucre, but with willing desire;
1PE.5.3	and not as having lordship over the heritage of the Lord, but in such a manner as to be examples of the flock.
1PE.5.4	And when the great Prince of the pastors shall appear, ye shall receive the incorruptible crown of glory.
1PE.5.5	Likewise, young people, be subject to the elders in such a manner that you are all subject to one another. Be clothed with humility of will, for God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble.
1PE.5.6	Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time,
1PE.5.7	casting all your cares upon him, for he cares for you.
1PE.5.8	Be temperate and vigilant because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour,
1PE.5.9	resist him steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are to be accomplished in the company of your brethren that are in the world.
1PE.5.10	But the God of all grace, who has called us unto his eternal glory by Jesus, the Christ, after ye have suffered a little while, he himself perfects, confirms, strengthens, and establishes you.
1PE.5.11	To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
1PE.5.12	By Silvanus, a faithful brother; (according to my reckoning), I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which ye stand.
1PE.5.13	Those here at Babylon, chosen together with you, salute you and so does Mark, my son.
1PE.5.14	Greet one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Jesus, the Christ. Amen.
2PE.1.1	Simon Peter, slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those that have obtained like precious faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:
2PE.1.2	Grace and peace be multiplied unto you in the knowledge of God and of our Lord Jesus,
2PE.1.3	as all things that pertain to life and to godliness are given us of his divine power, through the knowledge of him that has called us by his glory and virtue,
2PE.1.4	whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these ye might be made participants of the divine nature, having fled the corruption that is in the world through lust.
2PE.1.5	Ye also, giving all diligence to the same, show forth virtue in your faith; and in virtue, knowledge;
2PE.1.6	and in knowledge, temperance; and in temperance, patience; and in patience, fear of God;
2PE.1.7	and in fear of God, brotherly love; and in brotherly love, charity.
2PE.1.8	For if these things are in you and abound, they shall not let you be idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.9	But he that lacks these things is blind and walks feeling the way with his hand, having forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
2PE.1.10	Therefore, brethren, give all the more diligence to make your calling and election sure; for doing these things, ye shall never fall.
2PE.1.11	Because in this manner the entrance shall be abundantly administered unto you in the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	For this reason, I will not leave off reminding you always of these things, although ye know them and are established in the present truth.
2PE.1.13	Because I have the right (as long as I am in this tabernacle) to stir you up by reminding you,
2PE.1.14	knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has declared unto me.
2PE.1.15	I will also make sure with diligence that after my decease ye might remember these things.
2PE.1.16	For we have not made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, following cunningly devised fables, but as eyewitnesses of his majesty.
2PE.1.17	For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
2PE.1.18	And we heard this voice which came from heaven, when we were together with him in the holy mount.
2PE.1.19	We have also the most sure word of the prophets, unto which ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star arises in your hearts,
2PE.1.20	understanding this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
2PE.1.21	For the prophecy did not come in times past by the will of man, but the holy men of God spoke being inspired by the Holy Spirit.
2PE.2.1	But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who covertly shall bring in destructive sects and shall deny the Lord that bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
2PE.2.2	And many shall follow their pernicious ways, by reason of whom the way of truth shall be blasphemed;
2PE.2.3	and in covetousness they shall make merchandise of you with feigned words, upon whom the condemnation from a long time ago does not delay, and their perdition does not sleep.
2PE.2.4	For if God did not forgive the angels that sinned, but cast them down into the deepest abyss {Gr. Tartarus} and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved unto judgment;
2PE.2.5	and if he did not forgive the old world, but kept Noah, a preacher of righteousness, with seven other persons, bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly;
2PE.2.6	and if he condemned by destruction the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha, turning them into ashes, making them an example unto those that after should live without fear and reverence of God;
2PE.2.7	and delivered just Lot, who was persecuted by those abominable people because of their nefarious conversation;
2PE.2.8	(for that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, afflicted his righteous soul from day to day with the deeds of those unjust people);
2PE.2.9	the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished;
2PE.2.10	and chiefly those that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise dominion; presumptuous, arrogant, they are not afraid to speak evil of the higher powers;
2PE.2.11	whereas even the angels, who are greater in power and might, bring no curse of judgment against them before the Lord.
2PE.2.12	But these, speaking evil of the things that they do not understand (as natural animals without reason, who are made to be taken and destroyed), shall utterly perish in their own corruption,
2PE.2.13	receiving the reward of their unrighteousness, as those that count it pleasure to live luxuriously every day. These are spots and blemishes, who eat together with you, while at the same time they revel in their deceit,
2PE.2.14	having their eyes full of adultery, and not knowing how to cease from sin, baiting unstable souls, having their heart exercised in covetous practices; cursed sons,
2PE.2.15	who forsaking the right way have erred, having followed the way of Balaam the son of Beor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,
2PE.2.16	and was rebuked for his iniquity; a dumb animal accustomed to a yoke (upon which he was seated), speaking with man’s voice, hindered the madness of the prophet.
2PE.2.17	These are wells without water, clouds that are brought by a whirlwind, to whom gross darkness is reserved for ever.
2PE.2.18	For speaking arrogant words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from those who converse in error,
2PE.2.19	promising them liberty, being they themselves the slaves of corruption: for he who is overcome by someone is subject to bondage by the one that overcame him.
2PE.2.20	Certainly, if having separated themselves from the contaminations of the world, by the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they again entangle themselves therein and are overcome, their latter end is made worse for them than the beginnings.
2PE.2.21	For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn back from the holy commandment delivered unto them.
2PE.2.22	But it has happened unto them according to the true proverb, The dog returns unto his own vomit, and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.
2PE.3.1	Beloved, I now write unto you this second epistle, in which I alert with exhortation your pure understanding,
2PE.3.2	that ye keep in memory the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of our commandment, that we are apostles of the Lord and Saviour,
2PE.3.3	knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts
2PE.3.4	and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? For since the day in which the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
2PE.3.5	Of course, they willingly ignore that the heavens were created of old and the earth standing out of the water and in the water, by the word of God;
2PE.3.6	by which the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished;
2PE.3.7	but the heavens, which are now, and the earth are conserved by the same word, kept unto the fire in the day of judgment and of perdition of the ungodly men.
2PE.3.8	But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day before the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years are as one day.
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not late concerning his promise, as some count lateness, but is patient with us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements, burning, shall be dissolved, and the earth and the works that are in it shall be burned up.
2PE.3.11	Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
2PE.3.12	waiting for and desiring earnestly for the coming of the day of God, in which the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
2PE.3.13	Nevertheless we, according to his promises, wait for new heavens and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.
2PE.3.14	Therefore, beloved, seeing that ye hope for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot and blameless.
2PE.3.15	And have as saving health the patience of our Lord, even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him has written unto you
2PE.3.16	in almost all his epistles, speaking in them of these things, among which are some things that are hard to understand, which those that are ignorant and unstable twist, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
2PE.3.17	Ye, therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things in advance, be on guard lest by the error of the wicked ye be deceived with the others and fall from your own steadfastness.
2PE.3.18	But grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and until the day of eternity. Amen.
1JN.1.1	That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life
1JN.1.2	(for the life is manifested, and we also saw it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father and appeared unto us);
1JN.1.3	that which we have seen and heard we declare unto you, that ye also may have communion with us; and truly our communion is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
1JN.1.4	And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be fulfilled.
1JN.1.5	This then is the promise which we have heard of him and declare unto you, That God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
1JN.1.6	If we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth;
1JN.1.7	But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have communion with him in the midst of us, and the blood of Jesus Christ, his Son cleanses us from all sin.
1JN.1.8	If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and there is no truth in us.
1JN.1.9	If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
1JN.1.10	If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
1JN.2.1	My little children, I write these things unto you, that ye sin not; and if anyone has sinned, we have an Advocate before the Father, Jesus, the righteous Christ;
1JN.2.2	and he is the reconciliation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.
1JN.2.3	And in this we do know that we have known him if we keep his commandments.
1JN.2.4	He that says, I have known him, and does not keep his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
1JN.2.5	But whosoever keeps his word, in him verily is the charity of God perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.
1JN.2.6	He that says he abides in him ought himself also so to walk, even as he walked.
1JN.2.7	Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old commandment which ye have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which ye have heard from the beginning.
1JN.2.8	Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which is the truth in him and in you, because the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.
1JN.2.9	He that says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness.
1JN.2.10	He that loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.
1JN.2.11	But he that hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness and does not know where he goes, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes.
1JN.2.12	I write unto you, little children, that your sins are forgiven you for his name’s sake.
1JN.2.13	I write unto you, fathers, that ye have known him that is from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, that ye have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little children, that ye have known the Father.
1JN.2.14	I have written unto you, fathers, that ye have known him that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young men, that ye are strong and the word of God abides in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.
1JN.2.15	Love not the world neither the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the charity of the Father is not in him.
1JN.2.16	For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.
1JN.2.17	And the world passes away and the lust thereof, but he that does the will of God abides for ever.
1JN.2.18	Little children, it is the last hour, and as ye have heard that the antichrist comes, likewise there are also beginning to be many antichrists, by which we know that it is the last time.
1JN.2.19	They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us; but this happened that it might be made manifest that they were not all of us.
1JN.2.20	But ye have the anointing of the Holy One, and ye know all things.
1JN.2.21	I have not written unto you as if ye ignore the truth, but as unto those that know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
1JN.2.22	Who is a liar but he that denies that Jesus is the Christ? This same is antichrist, who denies the Father and the Son.
1JN.2.23	Whosoever denies the Son, the same does not have the Father. Whosoever confesses the Son, has the Father also.
1JN.2.24	Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the beginning. For if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall abide in you, ye also shall continue to abide in the Son and in the Father.
1JN.2.25	And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life.
1JN.2.26	These things I have written unto you concerning those that seduce you.
1JN.2.27	But the anointing which ye have received of him abides in you, and ye do not need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you of all things and is truth, and is no lie; and even as it has taught you, abide ye in him.
1JN.2.28	And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming.
1JN.2.29	If ye know that he is righteous, also know that any one that does righteousness is born of him.
1JN.3.1	Behold, what charity the Father has given us, that we should be called the sons of God; therefore the world does not know us, because it does not know him.
1JN.3.2	Beloved, now we are the sons of God, and it is not yet made manifest what we shall be; but we know that if he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.
1JN.3.3	And every one that has this hope in him purifies himself, even as he is pure.
1JN.3.4	Whosoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.
1JN.3.5	And ye know that he appeared to take away our sins, and there is no sin in him.
1JN.3.6	Whosoever abides in him does not sin: whosoever sins has not seen him or known him.
1JN.3.7	Little children, let no one deceive you; he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he also is righteous.
1JN.3.8	He that commits sin is of the devil; for the devil sins from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God appeared, that he might undo the works of the devil.
1JN.3.9	Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.
1JN.3.10	In this the sons of God are manifest, and the sons of the devil: whosoever does not righteousness and that loves not his brother is not of God.
1JN.3.11	For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, That we should love one another.
1JN.3.12	Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother’s righteous.
1JN.3.13	Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hates you.
1JN.3.14	We know that we are passed from death unto life, in that we love the brethren. He that does not love his brother abides in death.
1JN.3.15	Whosoever hates his brother is a murderer and ye know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
1JN.3.16	In this we have known the charity of God because he laid down his life for us; we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.
1JN.3.17	But whosoever has this world’s goods and sees his brother have need and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how does the charity of God abide in him?
1JN.3.18	My little children, let us not love in word neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth.
1JN.3.19	And in this we know that we are of the truth and have our hearts certified before him.
1JN.3.20	And if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart and knows all things.
1JN.3.21	Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, then we have confidence in God;
1JN.3.22	and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.
1JN.3.23	And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he has commanded us.
1JN.3.24	And he that keeps his commandments dwells in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us.
1JN.4.1	Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
1JN.4.2	In this know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ, is come in flesh is of God:
1JN.4.3	And every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ, is come in flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, of which ye have heard that it should come, and that now it is already in the world.
1JN.4.4	Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world.
1JN.4.5	They are of the world; therefore, they speak of the world, and the world hears them.
1JN.4.6	We are of God; he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
1JN.4.7	Beloved, let us love one another, for charity is of God. Anyone that loves is born of God and knows God.
1JN.4.8	He that does not love does not know God, for God is charity.
1JN.4.9	In this was the charity of God demonstrated in us, in that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
1JN.4.10	In this does the charity consist, not because we had loved God, but because he loved us and has sent his Son to be the reconciliation for our sins.
1JN.4.11	Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
1JN.4.12	No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God abides in us, and his charity is completed in us.
1JN.4.13	In this we know that we abide in him, and he in us, in that he has given us of his Spirit.
1JN.4.14	And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
1JN.4.15	Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
1JN.4.16	And we have known and believed the charity that God has in us. God is charity, and he that abides in charity abides in God, and God in him.
1JN.4.17	In this the charity with us is made perfect, that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, that as he is, so are we in this world.
1JN.4.18	In charity there is no fear; but charity that is perfect casts out fear; because fear has torment; from which he that fears is not complete in charity.
1JN.4.19	We love him, because he first loved us.
1JN.4.20	If anyone says, I love God and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he that does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?
1JN.4.21	And we have this commandment from him, That he who loves God loves his brother also.
1JN.5.1	Whosoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God; and anyone that loves him that begat also loves him that is born of him.
1JN.5.2	In this we know that we love the sons of God, when we love God and keep his commandments.
1JN.5.3	For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous.
1JN.5.4	For whatsoever is born of God overcomes the world; and this is the victory that overcomes the world, even our faith.
1JN.5.5	Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
1JN.5.6	This is Jesus, the Christ, who came by water and blood; not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit is he that bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth.
1JN.5.7	For there are three that bear witness in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these three are one.
1JN.5.8	And there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree in one.
1JN.5.9	If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater: for this is the witness of God which he has testified of his Son.
1JN.5.10	He that believes in the Son of God has the witness of God in himself; he that does not believe God has made God a liar; because he does not believe the witness that God has testified of his Son.
1JN.5.11	And this is the witness, that God has given eternal life to us, and this life is in his Son.
1JN.5.12	He that has the Son has life; and he that does not have the Son of God does not have life.
1JN.5.13	These things I have written unto you that believe in the name of the Son of God, that ye may know that ye have eternal life and that ye may believe in the name of the Son of God.
1JN.5.14	And this is the confidence that we have in God, that, if we ask any thing according to his will, he hears us:
1JN.5.15	And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we also know that we have the petitions that we asked of him.
1JN.5.16	If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask God, and he shall give him life that is, unto those that do not sin unto death. There is sin unto death, for which I do not say that you should pray.
1JN.5.17	All unrighteousness is sin, but there is a sin not unto death.
1JN.5.18	We know that whoever is born of God does not sin; but he that is begotten of God keeps himself, and the wicked one does not touch him.
1JN.5.19	And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.
1JN.5.20	But we know that the Son of God is come and has given us understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life.
1JN.5.21	Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
2JN.1.1	The elder unto the chosen lady and her sons, whom I love in the truth, and not I only, but also all those that have known the truth,
2JN.1.2	for the truth’s sake, which abides in us and shall be with us for ever.
2JN.1.3	Grace be with you, mercy and peace, from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and charity.
2JN.1.4	I have rejoiced greatly, for I have found of thy sons that they walk in the truth, as we have received the commandment from the Father.
2JN.1.5	And now I beseech thee, lady, (not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning) that we love one another.
2JN.1.6	And this is charity, that we walk after his commandment. And this is the commandment, That ye walk in him, as ye have heard from the beginning.
2JN.1.7	For many deceivers are entered into the world, who do not confess Jesus Christ coming in flesh. This same is a deceiver and antichrist.
2JN.1.8	Look to yourselves, that we not lose those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a fulfilled reward.
2JN.1.9	Whosoever rebels and does not abide in the doctrine of the Christ, does not have God. He that abides in the doctrine of the Christ, the same has the Father and the Son.
2JN.1.10	If anyone comes unto you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house neither say unto him, Welcome:
2JN.1.11	For he that says unto him, Welcome, is partaker of his evil deeds.
2JN.1.12	Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink, but I trust to come unto you and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
2JN.1.13	The sons of thy chosen sister greet thee. Amen.
3JN.1.1	The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
3JN.1.2	Beloved, I wish that thou be prospered in all things and be sound, even as thy soul prospers.
3JN.1.3	For I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou dost walk in the truth.
3JN.1.4	I have no greater joy than this, to hear that my sons walk in the truth.
3JN.1.5	Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatever thou doest regarding the brethren and with the strangers,
3JN.1.6	who have borne witness of thy charity before the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, whom if thou wilt help them as is convenient according to God, thou shalt do well;
3JN.1.7	because for his name’s sake, they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
3JN.1.8	We, therefore, ought to receive such, that we might be fellow workers to the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote unto the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, but Diotrephes, who loves to have the preeminence among them, did not receive us.
3JN.1.10	Therefore, if I come, I will cause his deeds to be understood, speaking against us with malicious words, and not content with this, he does not receive the brethren and forbids those that desire to receive them and casts them out of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
3JN.1.11	Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good. He that does good is of God, but he that does evil has not seen God.
3JN.1.12	Everyone gives testimony of Demetrius, even the truth itself; and we also bear witness, and ye have known that our witness is true.
3JN.1.13	I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee,
3JN.1.14	For I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the friends by name.
JUD.1.1	Jude, slave of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to those that are called, sanctified in God the Father, and preserved in Jesus Christ:
JUD.1.2	Mercy and peace and charity be multiplied unto you.
JUD.1.3	Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that ye should earnestly persevere in the faith which was given once unto the saints.
JUD.1.4	For there are certain men crept in unawares without fear or reverence of God, who from beforehand have been ordained unto this condemnation, turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying God who alone has dominion, and our Lord Jesus, the Christ.
JUD.1.5	I will, therefore, remind you, though ye once knew this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those that did not believe.
JUD.1.6	And the angels who did not keep their first estate but left their own habitation, he has reserved in eternal chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.
JUD.1.7	Even as Sodom and Gomorrha and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication and going after strange flesh, were set forth for an example, having received the judgment of eternal fire.
JUD.1.8	In the same manner these deceived dreamers, defile their flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of higher powers.
JUD.1.9	Yet when Michael, the archangel, contended with the devil, disputing over the body of Moses, he dared not bring against him a curse of judgment, but said, The Lord reprehend thee.
JUD.1.10	But these speak evil of those things which they do not know; but what they know by nature as animals without reason, in those things they corrupt themselves.
JUD.1.11	Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain and ran greedily after the error of Balaam for reward and perished in the gainsaying of Core.
JUD.1.12	These are spots in your banquets of charity, feeding themselves without any fear whatsoever: clouds without water, carried to and fro of the winds; trees withered as in fall, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;
JUD.1.13	raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own abominations; erratic stars, to whom is reserved gross darkness eternally.
JUD.1.14	And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these, saying, Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his saints
JUD.1.15	to execute judgment upon all and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have unfaithfully committed and of all the hard words which the unfaithful sinners have spoken against him.
JUD.1.16	These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own desires; and their mouth speaks arrogant things, admiring persons to take advantage.
JUD.1.17	But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken beforehand by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ,
JUD.1.18	how that they told you, That in the last time there would be mockers, who would walk after their own ungodly desires.
JUD.1.19	These are those who make divisions, and are as animals, not having the Spirit.
JUD.1.20	But ye, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit,
JUD.1.21	keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto eternal life,
JUD.1.22	And receive some with mercy, discerning;
JUD.1.23	And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire, hating even the garment defiled by the flesh.
JUD.1.24	Now unto him that is powerful to keep you without sin and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy,
JUD.1.25	to the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty, dominion and power, now and in all the ages. Amen.
REV.1.1	The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his slaves things which are convenient to do quickly, and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his slave John,
REV.1.2	who bore witness of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.
REV.1.3	Blessed is he that reads and those that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand.
REV.1.4	John, to the seven congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} which are in Asia: Grace be unto you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne
REV.1.5	and from Jesus, the Christ, who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins with his own blood
REV.1.6	and has made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
REV.1.7	Behold, he comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see him and those also who pierced him; and all kindreds of the earth shall wail over him. Even so, Amen.
REV.1.8	I AM the Alpha and the Omega, beginning and end, saith the Lord, who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.
REV.1.9	I John, your brother and participant in the tribulation and in the kingdom and in the patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
REV.1.10	I was in the Spirit in the day of the Lord and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet,
REV.1.11	that said, I AM the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, and What thou seest, write in a book and send it unto the seven congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} which are in Asia: unto Ephesus and unto Smyrna and unto Pergamos and unto Thyatira and unto Sardis and unto Philadelphia and unto Laodicea.
REV.1.12	And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden lampstands
REV.1.13	and in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.
REV.1.14	His head and his hairs were white like white wool, as the snow, and his eyes were as a flame of fire
REV.1.15	and his feet like unto brilliant metal as if they burned in a furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters.
REV.1.16	And he had in his right hand seven stars, and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword, and his countenance was as the sun when it shines in its strength.
REV.1.17	And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I AM the first and the last,
REV.1.18	and he that lives and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen, and have the keys of Hades and of death.
REV.1.19	Write the things which thou hast seen and the things which are and the things which must be after these.
REV.1.20	The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}, and the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
REV.2.1	Unto the angel of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Ephesus write; These things, saith he that holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:
REV.2.2	I know thy works and thy labour and thy patience and how thou canst not bear those who are evil; and thou hast tried those who say they are apostles and are not and hast found them liars,
REV.2.3	and hast suffered, and doth suffer and for my name’s sake hast laboured and hast not fainted.
REV.2.4	Nevertheless I have against thee that thou hast left thy first love, charity.
REV.2.5	Remember, therefore, from where thou art fallen and repent and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy lampstand out of its place, except thou repent.
REV.2.6	But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
REV.2.7	He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}; To him that overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
REV.2.8	And unto the angel of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of Smyrna write: These things, saith the first and the last, who was dead, and is alive:
REV.2.9	I know thy works and tribulation and poverty, (but thou art rich), and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
REV.2.10	Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer; behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days; be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee the crown of life.
REV.2.11	He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}; He that overcomes shall not be hurt by the second death.
REV.2.12	And to the angel of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} in Pergamos write; These things, saith he, who has the sharp sword with two edges:
REV.2.13	I know thy works and where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s throne is, and thou holdest fast my name and hast not denied my faith, even in those days in which Antipas was my faithful witness, {or martyr}, who was slain among you, where Satan dwellest.
REV.2.14	But I have a few things against thee because thou hast there those that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication.
REV.2.15	So hast thou also those that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which I hate.
REV.2.16	Repent, or else I will come unto thee quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
REV.2.17	He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}; To him that overcomes I will give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a small white stone and in the stone a new name written, which no one knows except the one that receives it.
REV.2.18	And unto the angel of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} in Thyatira write; These things, saith the Son of God, who has his eyes like unto a flame of fire and his feet like unto brilliant metal:
REV.2.19	I have known thy works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy works and the last to be more than the first.
REV.2.20	Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel (who calls herself a prophetess) to teach and to seduce my slaves to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.
REV.2.21	And I have given her time to repent of her fornication, and she repented not.
REV.2.22	Behold, I will cast her into a bed and those that commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of their deeds.
REV.2.23	And I will kill her children with death, and all the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} shall know that I AM he that searches the kidneys and hearts, and I will give unto each one of you according to your works.
REV.2.24	But unto you I say and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine and who have not known the depths of Satan (as they say); I will put upon you no other burden
REV.2.25	But that which ye have already hold fast until I come.
REV.2.26	And he that overcomes and keeps my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the Gentiles;
REV.2.27	and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter they shall be broken to shivers, even as I received of my Father.
REV.2.28	And I will give him the morning star.
REV.2.29	He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
REV.3.1	And unto the angel of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} in Sardis write; These things, saith he that has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou livest and art dead.
REV.3.2	Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die; for I have not found thy works perfect before God.
REV.3.3	Remember, therefore, of that which thou hast received and heard and hold to it and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will come to thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee.
REV.3.4	Yet thou hast a few persons in Sardis who have not defiled their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
REV.3.5	He that overcomes shall likewise be clothed in white raiment, and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life, but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.
REV.3.6	He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
REV.3.7	And to the angel of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} in Philadelphia write; These things, saith he that is Holy and True, he who has the key of David, who opens and no one shuts and shuts, and no one opens;
REV.3.8	I know thy works; behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no one can shut it, for thou hast a little strength and hast kept my word and hast not denied my name.
REV.3.9	Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, who say they are Jews and are not, but do lie; behold, I will constrain them to come and worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee.
REV.3.10	Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the entire world, to try those that dwell upon the earth.
REV.3.11	Behold, I come quickly; hold fast that which thou hast, that no one take thy crown.
REV.3.12	He that overcomes I will make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more, and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God which is the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from and with my God, and I will write upon him my new name.
REV.3.13	He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
REV.3.14	And unto the angel of the congregation {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones} of the Laodiceans write; Behold, he who saith, Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God:
REV.3.15	I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot; I would thou wert cold or hot.
REV.3.16	So then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.
REV.3.17	Because thou sayest, I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked,
REV.3.18	I counsel thee to buy of me gold refined in the fire, that thou may be made rich; and clothed in white raiment, so that the shame of thy nakedness not be uncovered; and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou may see.
REV.3.19	As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be zealous therefore, and repent.
REV.3.20	Behold, I stand at the door and call; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him and will sup with him, and he with me.
REV.3.21	To him that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame and have sat down with my Father in his throne.
REV.3.22	He that has an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}.
REV.4.1	After these things I looked, and, behold, an open door in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, was like a trumpet that spoke with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show thee the things that need to be done after these.
REV.4.2	And immediately I was in the spirit, and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and there was one seated upon the throne.
REV.4.3	And he that was seated was like a jasper and a sardine stone to look upon; and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.
REV.4.4	And round about the throne were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones I saw twenty-four elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.
REV.4.5	And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices; and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.
REV.4.6	And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal, and in the midst of the throne and round about the throne were four animals full of eyes in front and behind.
REV.4.7	And the first animal was like a lion and the second animal like a calf, and the third animal had a face as a man, and the fourth animal was like a flying eagle.
REV.4.8	And the four animals had each of them six wings about him, and they were full of eyes within, and they did not cease day or night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come.
REV.4.9	And when those animals give glory and honour and praise to the one that is seated on the throne, who lives for ever and ever,
REV.4.10	the twenty-four elders fall down before him that is seated on the throne and worship him that lives for ever and ever and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
REV.4.11	Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and virtue; for thou hast created all things, and by thy will they have their being and were created.
REV.5.1	And I saw in the right hand of him that was seated on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
REV.5.2	And I saw a strong angel preaching with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book and to loose its seals?
REV.5.3	And no one was able not in the heaven nor in the earth neither under the earth to open the book neither to look upon it.
REV.5.4	And I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book nor to read it neither to look upon it.
REV.5.5	And one of the elders said unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, who has overcome to open the book and to loose its seven seals.
REV.5.6	And I saw, and, behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four animals and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.
REV.5.7	And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that was seated upon the throne.
REV.5.8	And when he had taken the book, the four animals and the twenty-four elders fell on their faces before the Lamb, each one of them having harps, and golden vials full of incense, which are the prayers of saints.
REV.5.9	And they sang a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and to open its seals, for thou wast slain and hast redeemed us unto God by thy blood, out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation
REV.5.10	and hast made us unto our God kings and priests, and we shall reign on the earth.
REV.5.11	And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and of the animals and of the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;
REV.5.12	saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to take power and riches and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing.
REV.5.13	And I heard every creature which is in heaven and upon the earth and under the earth and such as are upon the sea and all that are in it, saying, Blessing and honour and glory and power, be unto him that is seated upon the throne, and unto the Lamb for ever and ever.
REV.5.14	And the four animals said, Amen. And the twenty-four elders fell on their faces and worshipped him that lives for ever and ever.
REV.6.1	And I saw when the Lamb had opened the first seal, and I heard the first of the four animals, saying as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.
REV.6.2	And I saw and, behold, a white horse; and he that was seated upon him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth victorious, that he might also overcome.
REV.6.3	And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second animal, which said, Come and see.
REV.6.4	And another horse went forth that was red, and unto him that was seated thereon was given power to take away the peace of the earth and that they should kill one another; and there was given unto him a great sword.
REV.6.5	And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third animal, which said, Come and see. And I saw and, behold, a black horse, and he that was seated upon him had a yoke in his hand.
REV.6.6	And I heard a voice in the midst of the four animals, which said, A choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenix of barley for a denarius; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.
REV.6.7	And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth animal, which said, Come and see.
REV.6.8	And I looked and, behold, a green horse, and he that was seated upon him was named Death, and Hades followed with him. And power was given unto him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth.
REV.6.9	And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those that had been slain because of the word of God and for the testimony which they held:
REV.6.10	And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on those that dwell in the earth?
REV.6.11	And white robes were given unto each one of them; and it was said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little while until their fellow servants and their brethren, that should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.
REV.6.12	And I saw when he had opened the sixth seal, and, behold, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood;
REV.6.13	and the stars of heaven fell upon the earth, even as a fig tree casts her figs, when she is shaken of a mighty wind.
REV.6.14	And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
REV.6.15	And the kings of the earth and the princes and the rich and the captains and the strong and every slave and every free man hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains
REV.6.16	and said to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us and hide us from the face of him that is seated upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb;
REV.6.17	for the great day of his wrath is come, and who shall be able to stand before him?
REV.7.1	And after these things I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth that no wind should blow upon the earth nor upon the sea nor upon any tree.
REV.7.2	And I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God: and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the land and the sea,
REV.7.3	saying, Hurt not the land neither the sea nor the trees until we have sealed the slaves of our God in their foreheads.
REV.7.4	And I heard the number of those that were sealed: and there were sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand of all the tribes of the sons of Israel.
REV.7.5	Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand.
REV.7.6	Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Naphtali were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.
REV.7.7	Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.
REV.7.8	Of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.
REV.7.9	After this I saw, and, behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations and kindreds and peoples and tongues stood before the throne and before the Lamb clothed with long white robes and palms in their hands
REV.7.10	and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation unto him who is seated upon the throne of our God and unto the Lamb.
REV.7.11	And all the angels stood round about the throne and about the elders and the four animals; and they fell upon their faces before the throne and worshipped God,
REV.7.12	saying, Amen: The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanksgiving and the honour and the power and the might, be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.
REV.7.13	And one of the elders responded and asked me, Who are these who are arrayed in long white robes? and where did they come from?
REV.7.14	And I said unto him, lord, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are those who came out of great tribulation and have washed their long robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
REV.7.15	Therefore, they are before the throne of God and serve him day and night in his temple, and he that is seated on the throne shall dwell among them.
REV.7.16	They shall hunger no more neither thirst anymore; neither shall the sun be thrust upon them nor any other heat.
REV.7.17	For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall govern them and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters, and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
REV.8.1	And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour.
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels which stood before God, and to them were given seven trumpets.
REV.8.3	And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense of the prayers of all the saints, that he should offer upon the golden altar which was before the throne.
REV.8.4	And the smoke of the incense of the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel’s hand.
REV.8.5	And the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth; and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake.
REV.8.6	And the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound their trumpets.
REV.8.7	The first angel sounded the trumpet, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the land; and the third part of the trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
REV.8.8	And the second angel sounded the trumpet, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea; and the third part of the sea became blood;
REV.8.9	and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	And the third angel sounded the trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning as a lit torch, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters;
REV.8.11	and the name of the star is called Wormwood; and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter.
REV.8.12	And the fourth angel sounded the trumpet, and the third part of the sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and the third part of the stars, in such a manner that the third part of them was darkened, and the third part of the day did not shine, and the night likewise.
REV.8.13	And I saw and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, who are yet to sound their trumpets!
REV.9.1	And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth; and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit.
REV.9.2	And he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.
REV.9.3	And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
REV.9.4	And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree, but only those men who do not have the seal of God in their foreheads.
REV.9.5	And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should torment them five months; and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he strikes a man.
REV.9.6	And in those days men shall seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.
REV.9.7	And the appearance of the locusts was like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.
REV.9.8	And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.
REV.9.9	And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle.
REV.9.10	And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails; and their power was to hurt men five months.
REV.9.11	And they had a king over them, who is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon meaning destroyer.
REV.9.12	The first woe is past; and, behold, there come two more woes after these things.
REV.9.13	And the sixth angel sounded the trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before the presence of God,
REV.9.14	saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, Loose the four angels who are bound in the great river Euphrates.
REV.9.15	And the four angels were loosed, who were prepared unto the hour and day and month and year, to slay the third part of men.
REV.9.16	And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred million: and I heard the number of them.
REV.9.17	And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those that sat on them, having breastplates of fire and of jacinth and brimstone; and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone.
REV.9.18	By these three plagues was the third part of men killed, by the fire and by the smoke and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths.
REV.9.19	For their power is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails were like unto serpents that have heads, and with them they do hurt.
REV.9.20	And the rest of the men who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons and the images of gold and of silver and of brass and of stone and of wood, which neither can see nor hear nor walk.
REV.9.21	And they did not repent of their murders nor of their witchcraft nor of their fornication nor of their thefts.
REV.10.1	And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed with a cloud; and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:
REV.10.2	And he had in his hand a little open book, and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the land
REV.10.3	And cried out with a loud voice as when a lion roars; and when he had cried out, seven thunders uttered their voices.
REV.10.4	And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write, and I heard a voice from heaven, saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders have spoken and do not write them.
REV.10.5	And the angel whom I saw standing upon the sea and upon the land lifted up his hand to heaven
REV.10.6	and swore by him that lives for ever and ever, who created the heaven and the things that are therein, and the earth, and the things that are therein, and the sea and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer;
REV.10.7	but in the day of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the trumpet, the mystery of God shall be finished, as he did evangelize unto his slaves the prophets.
REV.10.8	And the voice which I heard from heaven spoke unto me again and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and upon the land.
REV.10.9	And I went unto the angel and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey.
REV.10.10	And I took the little book from the angel’s hand and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter.
REV.10.11	And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again as to many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.
REV.11.1	And there was given me a reed like unto a rod, and he said unto me, Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those that worship therein.
REV.11.2	But leave out the court which is within the temple and measure it not, for it is given unto the Gentiles, and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty-two months.
REV.11.3	And I will give my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.
REV.11.4	These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the earth.
REV.11.5	And if anyone desires to hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies; and if anyone desires to hurt them, he must in this manner be killed.
REV.11.6	These have power to shut the heaven, that it not rain in the days of their prophecy and have power over the waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will.
REV.11.7	And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them.
REV.11.8	And their dead bodies shall lie in the streets of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.
REV.11.9	And those of the peoples and kindreds and tongues and Gentiles shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.
REV.11.10	And those that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented those that dwelt on the earth.
REV.11.11	And after three days and a half, the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon those who saw them.
REV.11.12	And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up here. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them.
REV.11.13	And in the same hour there was a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain the names of seven thousand men; and the others were frightened and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe comes quickly.
REV.11.15	And the seventh angel sounded the trumpet, and there were great voices in the heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are reduced unto our Lord and to his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever.
REV.11.16	And the twenty-four elders, who sat before God on their thrones, fell upon their faces and worshipped God,
REV.11.17	saying, We give thee thanks, O Lord God Almighty, who art and wast, and art to come because thou hast taken to thee thy great power and hast reigned.
REV.11.18	And the Gentiles were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou should give the reward unto thy slaves the prophets and to the saints and those that fear thy name, to the small and to the great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.
REV.11.19	And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of his testament was seen in his temple: and there were lightnings and voices and thunderings and earthquakes and great hail.
REV.12.1	And there appeared a great sign in the heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars;
REV.12.2	and she being with child cried out, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
REV.12.3	And there appeared another sign in the heaven; and, behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
REV.12.4	And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth; and the dragon stood before the woman who was ready to be delivered, to devour her child as soon as it was born.
REV.12.5	And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all the Gentiles with a rod of iron; and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne.
REV.12.6	And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.
REV.12.7	And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,
REV.12.8	and did not prevail; neither was their place found any more in heaven.
REV.12.9	And the great dragon was cast out, the serpent of old, who is called Devil and the Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.
REV.12.10	And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation and virtue and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ; for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, who accused them before our God day and night.
REV.12.11	And they have overcome him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.
REV.12.12	Therefore, rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time.
REV.12.13	And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man child.
REV.12.14	And to the woman were given two wings of the great eagle that she might fly from the presence of the serpent into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time.
REV.12.15	And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a river after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away by the river.
REV.12.16	And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon had cast out of his mouth.
REV.12.17	And the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.
REV.13.1	And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon its horns ten crowns, and upon its heads the name of blasphemy.
REV.13.2	And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and its feet were as the feet of a bear, and its mouth as the mouth of a lion; and the dragon gave it his power and his throne and great authority.
REV.13.3	And I saw one of its heads as it were wounded to death; and its deadly wound was healed; and all the earth marveled, and followed the beast.
REV.13.4	And they worshipped the dragon which had given the authority unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast; saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with it?
REV.13.5	And there was given unto it a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto it to continue forty and two months.
REV.13.6	And it opened its mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and those that dwell in heaven.
REV.13.7	And it was given unto it to make war with the saints and to overcome them; and power was given it over all kindreds and tongues and nations.
REV.13.8	And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship it, whose names are not written in the book of the life of the Lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world.
REV.13.9	If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
REV.13.10	He that leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he that kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.
REV.13.11	Then I beheld another beast coming up out of the land; and he had two horns like the Lamb, but he spoke as the dragon.
REV.13.12	And he exercised all the power of the first beast in its presence and caused the earth and those that dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.
REV.13.13	And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven to the earth in the sight of men
REV.13.14	and deceives those that dwell on the earth by those signs which were given unto him to do in the presence of the beast, commanding those that dwell on the earth to make an image of the beast, which has the wound by the sword, and did live.
REV.13.15	And it was given unto him to endue the image of the beast with spirit, so that the image of the beast should speak, and he shall cause those that do not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
REV.13.16	And he caused all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads;
REV.13.17	and that no one might buy or sell, unless he has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of its name.
REV.13.18	Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast: for the number of man; and its number is six hundred sixty-six.
REV.14.1	And I saw and, behold, the Lamb stood upon Mount Sion and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, having the name of his Father written in their foreheads.
REV.14.2	And I heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great thunder; and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps;
REV.14.3	and they sang as it were a new song before the throne and before the four animals and the elders; and no one could learn that song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, who were redeemed from the earth.
REV.14.4	These are those who are not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These are redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.
REV.14.5	And in their mouth was found no guile, for they are without blemish before the throne of God.
REV.14.6	And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the eternal gospel that he might evangelize those that dwell on the earth and every nation and kindred and tongue and people,
REV.14.7	saying with a loud voice, Fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that has made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the fountains of waters.
REV.14.8	And another angel followed, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she has given all the Gentiles to drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.
REV.14.9	And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives the mark in his forehead or in his hand,
REV.14.10	the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb;
REV.14.11	and the smoke of their torment ascends up for ever and ever; and those that worship the beast and its image and whosoever receives the mark of its name, have no rest day or night.
REV.14.12	Here is the patience of the saints; here are those that keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.
REV.14.13	And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on; Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours, and their works do follow them.
REV.14.14	And I looked, and, behold, a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown and in his hand a sharp sickle.
REV.14.15	And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that was seated on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle and reap; for the hour is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is dry.
REV.14.16	And he that was seated on the cloud thrust in his sickle upon the earth; and the earth was reaped.
REV.14.17	And another angel came out of the temple which is in the heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.
REV.14.18	And another angel came out from the altar, who had power over fire, and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe.
REV.14.19	And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth and gathered the vine of the earth and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
REV.14.20	And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the bits of the horses, for a thousand six hundred furlongs.
REV.15.1	And I saw another sign in the heaven, great and marvellous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is completed the wrath of God.
REV.15.2	And I saw, as it were, a sea of glass mingled with fire and those that had gotten the victory over the beast and over its image and over its mark and over the number of its name stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.
REV.15.3	And they sing the song of Moses, the slave of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works, Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of saints.
REV.15.4	Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and magnify thy name? for thou only art holy; therefore, all the Gentiles shall come and worship before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.
REV.15.5	And after these things I looked, and, behold, the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in the heaven was opened;
REV.15.6	and the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles.
REV.15.7	And one of the four animals gave unto the seven angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God, who lives for ever and ever.
REV.15.8	And the temple was filled with smoke from the majesty of God and from his power; and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were fulfilled.
REV.16.1	And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the seven angels, Go and pour out the vials of the wrath of God upon the earth.
REV.16.2	And the first went and poured out his vial upon the earth; and an evil and grievous sore fell upon the men who had the mark of the beast and upon those who worshipped its image.
REV.16.3	And the second angel poured out his vial into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man, and every living soul died in the sea.
REV.16.4	And the third angel poured out his vial into the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood.
REV.16.5	And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, who art and wast the Holy one because thou hast judged these things;
REV.16.6	for they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they deserve it.
REV.16.7	And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.
REV.16.8	And the fourth angel poured out his vial against the sun; and it was given unto it to scorch men with fire.
REV.16.9	And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, who has authority over these plagues; and they did not repent to give him glory.
REV.16.10	And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the throne of the beast; and its kingdom was filled with darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain,
REV.16.11	and blasphemed the God of the heaven because of their pains and their sores and did not repent of their deeds.
REV.16.12	And the sixth angel poured out his vial into the great river Euphrates; and its water was dried up, that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared.
REV.16.13	And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
REV.16.14	For they are spirits of demons, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.
REV.16.15	Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watches and keeps his garments lest he walk naked, and they see his shame.
REV.16.16	And he gathered them together into the place which in Hebrew is called, Armageddon.
REV.16.17	And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of the heaven from the throne, saying, It is done.
REV.16.18	Then there were voices and thunders and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as has never been since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.
REV.16.19	And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the Gentiles fell; and Babylon the great came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
REV.16.20	And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
REV.16.21	And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent; and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.
REV.17.1	And there came one of the seven angels who had the seven vials and talked with me, saying unto me, Come here; I will show unto thee the condemnation of the great whore that sits upon many waters,
REV.17.2	with whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.
REV.17.3	So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman seated upon a scarlet-coloured beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.
REV.17.4	And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and of the filthiness of her fornication;
REV.17.5	and upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.
REV.17.6	And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus; and when I saw her, I marvelled with great surprise.
REV.17.7	And the angel said unto me, Why didst thou marvel? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and ten horns.
REV.17.8	The beast that thou sawest was, and is not, and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and shall go into perdition; and those that dwell on the earth shall wonder (whose names are not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world) when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.
REV.17.9	And here is the meaning which has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.
REV.17.10	And they are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and the other is not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space.
REV.17.11	And the beast that was, and is not, is also the eighth king, and is of the seven, and goes into perdition.
REV.17.12	And the ten horns which thou hast seen are ten kings, which have not yet taken a kingdom, but shall take authority as kings one hour with the beast.
REV.17.13	These have one mind and shall give their power and authority unto the beast.
REV.17.14	These shall make war against the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them; for he is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those that are with him are called and chosen and faithful.
REV.17.15	And he said unto me, The waters which thou hast seen, where the whore sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.
REV.17.16	And the ten horns which thou didst see upon the beast, these shall hate the whore and shall make her desolate and naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with fire.
REV.17.17	For God has put in their hearts to fulfil his will and to agree and give their kingdom unto the beast until the words of God shall be fulfilled.
REV.17.18	And the woman which thou hast seen is that great city, which reigns over the kings of the earth.
REV.18.1	And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power, and the earth was illuminated with his glory.
REV.18.2	And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of demons, and the hold of every unclean spirit, and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird.
REV.18.3	For all the Gentiles have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the power of her delicacies.
REV.18.4	And I heard another voice from the heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye not be partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
REV.18.5	For her sins have reached unto the heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
REV.18.6	Reward her even as she rewarded you and pay her double according to her works; in the cup which she has given thee to drink, give her double.
REV.18.7	As much as she has glorified herself and lived deliciously, give her that much torment and sorrow; for she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.
REV.18.8	Therefore, shall her plagues come in one day, death and mourning and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire; for strong is the Lord God who judges her.
REV.18.9	And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her and lament for her when they shall see the smoke of her burning,
REV.18.10	Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city; for in one hour is thy judgment come!
REV.18.11	And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore:
REV.18.12	The merchandise of gold and of silver and of precious stones and of pearls and of fine linen and of purple and of silk and of scarlet and of all thyine wood and of all manner vessels of ivory and of all manner vessels of most precious wood and of brass and of iron and of marble
REV.18.13	and cinnamon and odours and ointments and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and of sheep, and of horses, and of chariots and of bodies and souls of men.
REV.18.14	And the fruits of the desire of thy soul are departed from thee, and all the fat and excellent things are departed from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.
REV.18.15	The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her, shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and wailing,
REV.18.16	and saying, Alas, alas, that great city, that was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls!
REV.18.17	For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every shipmaster and all the company in ships and sailors and as many as trade by sea stood afar off
REV.18.18	and cried out when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What city was like unto this great city!
REV.18.19	And they cast dust on their heads and cried, weeping and wailing, saying, Alas, alas, that great city, in which all that had ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her riches! for in one hour is she made desolate.
REV.18.20	Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye saints, apostles, and prophets; for God has judged your cause upon her.
REV.18.21	And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with impetus shall that great city Babylon be thrown down and shall be found no more at all.
REV.18.22	And the voice of harpers and musicians and of pipers and trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no craftsman, of whatever craft he is, shall be found any more in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more at all in thee;
REV.18.23	and the light of a lamp shall shine no more at all in thee; and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the princes of the earth in whose witchcraft all the Gentiles have erred.
REV.18.24	And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints and of all that were slain upon the earth.
REV.19.1	And after these things I heard a great voice of a great company in the heaven, saying, Halelu-JAH; Salvation and glory and honour and power unto the Lord our God;
REV.19.2	for true and righteous are his judgments; for he has judged the great whore, who corrupted the earth with her fornication, and has avenged the blood of his slaves at her hand.
REV.19.3	And again they said, Halelu-JAH. And her smoke rose up for ever and ever.
REV.19.4	And the twenty-four elders and the four animals fell upon their faces and worshipped God that was seated upon the throne, saying, Amen! Halelu-JAH!
REV.19.5	And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all ye his slaves and ye that fear him, both small and great.
REV.19.6	And I heard as it were the voice of a great company and as the voice of many waters and as the voice of mighty thunderings, saying, Halelu-JAH; for the Lord God almighty reigns.
REV.19.7	Let us be glad and rejoice and give glory to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his bride has made herself ready.
REV.19.8	And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright: for the fine linen is the righteousness of the saints.
REV.19.9	And he said unto me, Write, Blessed are those who are called unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he said unto me, These are the true words of God.
REV.19.10	And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me, See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant and with thy brethren that have the testimony of Jesus; worship God; for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
REV.19.11	And I saw the heaven open, and behold a white horse; and he that was seated upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.
REV.19.12	And his eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no one has known, but he himself.
REV.19.13	And he was clothed with a garment dipped in blood; and his name is called The Word of God.
REV.19.14	And the armies that are in the heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
REV.19.15	And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the Gentiles; and he shall rule them with a rod of iron; and he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.
REV.19.16	And he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND 
REV.19.17	And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that flew in the midst of the heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God,
REV.19.18	that ye may eat flesh of kings and flesh of captains, and flesh of mighty men and flesh of horses and of those that sit on them and the flesh of everyone, free and bond, both small and great.
REV.19.19	And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that was seated upon the horse and against his army.
REV.19.20	And the beast was taken and with it the false prophet that wrought miracles in its presence, with which he had deceived those that had taken the mark of the beast and had worshipped its image. These two were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.
REV.19.21	And the others were slain with the sword that proceeded out of the mouth of him that was seated upon the horse; and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.
REV.20.1	And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.
REV.20.2	And he laid hold on the dragon, the serpent of old, which is the Devil and Satan and bound him a thousand years
REV.20.3	and cast him into the bottomless pit and shut him up and set a seal upon it, that he should deceive the Gentiles no more, until the thousand years should be fulfilled; and after it is necessary that he be loosed a little while.
REV.20.4	And I saw thrones, and those who sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them; and I saw the souls of those that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus and for the word of God and who had not worshipped the beast neither its image neither had received its mark upon their foreheads or in their hands; and they shall live and reign with Christ the thousand years.
REV.20.5	But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection; on such the second death has no authority, but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years.
REV.20.7	And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison
REV.20.8	and shall go out to deceive the Gentiles which are upon the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
REV.20.9	And they went up on the breadth of the earth and compassed the camp of the saints about and the beloved city; and fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.
REV.20.10	And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.
REV.20.11	And I saw a great white throne and him that was seated upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and their place was not found.
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, great and small, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened; which is the book of life; and the dead were judged by those things which were written in the books, according to their works.
REV.20.13	And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and Hades delivered up the dead which were in them; and the judgment of each one was according to their works.
REV.20.14	And Hades and death were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.
REV.20.15	And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea.
REV.21.2	And I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven, prepared of God as a bride adorned for her husband.
REV.21.3	And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold the tabernacle of God with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them and be their God.
REV.21.4	And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and death shall be no more neither shall there be any more sorrow nor crying nor pain; for the former things are passed away.
REV.21.5	And he that was seated upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are faithful and true.
REV.21.6	And he said unto me, It is done. I AM the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is thirsty of the fountain of the water of life freely.
REV.21.7	He that overcomes shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
REV.21.8	But the fearful and unbelieving and the abominable and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
REV.21.9	And there came unto me one of the seven angels who had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me, saying, Come here, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb’s wife.
REV.21.10	And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of the heaven from and with God,
REV.21.11	having the clarity of God; and her light was like unto a most precious stone, even like a jasper stone, shining like crystal.
REV.21.12	And it had a wall great and high, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:
REV.21.13	On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
REV.21.14	And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
REV.21.15	And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city and its gates and its wall.
REV.21.16	And the city lies foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth; and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs; and the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.
REV.21.17	And he measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel.
REV.21.18	And the material of its wall was jasper; but the city was of pure gold, like unto clean glass.
REV.21.19	And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;
REV.21.20	the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.
REV.21.21	And the twelve gates are twelve pearls; in each one, one; each gate was of one pearl; and the street of the city was pure gold, as shining glass.
REV.21.22	And I saw no temple in her; for the Lord God Almighty is her temple, and the Lamb.
REV.21.23	And the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in her, for the clarity of God has illuminated it, and the Lamb is its lamp.
REV.21.24	And the Gentiles that have been saved shall walk in the light of her; and the kings of the earth shall bring their glory and honour into her.
REV.21.25	And her gates shall never be shut by day; for there shall be no night there.
REV.21.26	And they shall bring the glory and the honour of the Gentiles into it.
REV.21.27	And there shall in no wise enter into it anything unclean or that works abomination or makes a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.
REV.22.1	And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.
REV.22.2	In the midst of her plaza and on either side of the river was the tree of life, which brings forth twelve manner of fruits, yielding her fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the Gentiles.
REV.22.3	And there shall no longer be any cursed thing; but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in her; and his slaves shall serve him;
REV.22.4	and they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their foreheads.
REV.22.5	And there shall be no night there; and they need no lamp neither light of the sun; for the Lord God shall give them light; and they shall reign for ever and ever.
REV.22.6	And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true; and the Lord God of the holy prophets has sent his angel to show unto his slaves the things which are necessary that they be done quickly.
REV.22.7	Behold, I come quickly; blessed is he that keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.
REV.22.8	And I, John, saw these things and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed me these things.
REV.22.9	Then he said unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy fellowslave and with thy brethren the prophets and with those who keep the words of this book: worship God.
REV.22.10	And he said unto me, do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time is at hand.
REV.22.11	He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be justified still; and let the saint be sanctified still.
REV.22.12	And, behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give each one according as his work shall be.
REV.22.13	I AM the Alpha and the Omega, beginning and end, the first and the last.
REV.22.14	Blessed are those who do his commandments that their power and authority might be in the tree of life and they may enter in through the gates into the city.
REV.22.15	But outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the fornicators and the murderers and the idolaters and whosoever loves and makes a lie.
REV.22.16	I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify unto you these things in the congregations {Gr. ekklesia – called out ones}. I AM the root and the offspring of David and the bright and morning star.
REV.22.17	And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that hears say, Come. And let him that is thirsty come; and whosoever will, let him take of the water of life freely.
REV.22.18	For I testify unto everyone that hears the words of the prophecy of this book, If anyone shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book;
REV.22.19	and if anyone shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book.
REV.22.20	He who testifies these things saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.
REV.22.21	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
