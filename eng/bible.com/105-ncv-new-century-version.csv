GEN.1.1	In the beginning God created the sky and the earth. 
GEN.1.2	The earth was empty and had no form. Darkness covered the ocean, and God’s Spirit was moving over the water.
GEN.1.3	Then God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 
GEN.1.4	God saw that the light was good, so he divided the light from the darkness. 
GEN.1.5	God named the light “day” and the darkness “night.” Evening passed, and morning came. This was the first day.
GEN.1.6	Then God said, “Let there be something to divide the water in two.” 
GEN.1.7	So God made the air and placed some of the water above the air and some below it. 
GEN.1.8	God named the air “sky.” Evening passed, and morning came. This was the second day.
GEN.1.9	Then God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered together so the dry land will appear.” And it happened. 
GEN.1.10	God named the dry land “earth” and the water that was gathered together “seas.” God saw that this was good.
GEN.1.11	Then God said, “Let the earth produce plants—some to make grain for seeds and others to make fruits with seeds in them. Every seed will produce more of its own kind of plant.” And it happened. 
GEN.1.12	The earth produced plants with grain for seeds and trees that made fruits with seeds in them. Each seed grew its own kind of plant. God saw that all this was good. 
GEN.1.13	Evening passed, and morning came. This was the third day.
GEN.1.14	Then God said, “Let there be lights in the sky to separate day from night. These lights will be used for signs, seasons, days, and years. 
GEN.1.15	They will be in the sky to give light to the earth.” And it happened.
GEN.1.16	So God made the two large lights. He made the brighter light to rule the day and made the smaller light to rule the night. He also made the stars. 
GEN.1.17	God put all these in the sky to shine on the earth, 
GEN.1.18	to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. God saw that all these things were good. 
GEN.1.19	Evening passed, and morning came. This was the fourth day.
GEN.1.20	Then God said, “Let the water be filled with living things, and let birds fly in the air above the earth.”
GEN.1.21	So God created the large sea animals and every living thing that moves in the sea. The sea is filled with these living things, with each one producing more of its own kind. He also made every bird that flies, and each bird produced more of its own kind. God saw that this was good. 
GEN.1.22	God blessed them and said, “Have many young ones so that you may grow in number. Fill the water of the seas, and let the birds grow in number on the earth.” 
GEN.1.23	Evening passed, and morning came. This was the fifth day.
GEN.1.24	Then God said, “Let the earth be filled with animals, each producing more of its own kind. Let there be tame animals and small crawling animals and wild animals, and let each produce more of its kind.” And it happened.
GEN.1.25	So God made the wild animals, the tame animals, and all the small crawling animals to produce more of their own kind. God saw that this was good.
GEN.1.26	Then God said, “Let us make human beings in our image and likeness. And let them rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the tame animals, over all the earth, and over all the small crawling animals on the earth.”
GEN.1.27	So God created human beings in his image. In the image of God he created them. He created them male and female. 
GEN.1.28	God blessed them and said, “Have many children and grow in number. Fill the earth and be its master. Rule over the fish in the sea and over the birds in the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
GEN.1.29	God said, “Look, I have given you all the plants that have grain for seeds and all the trees whose fruits have seeds in them. They will be food for you. 
GEN.1.30	I have given all the green plants as food for every wild animal, every bird of the air, and every small crawling animal.” And it happened. 
GEN.1.31	God looked at everything he had made, and it was very good. Evening passed, and morning came. This was the sixth day.
GEN.2.1	So the sky, the earth, and all that filled them were finished. 
GEN.2.2	By the seventh day God finished the work he had been doing, so he rested from all his work. 
GEN.2.3	God blessed the seventh day and made it a holy day, because on that day he rested from all the work he had done in creating the world.
GEN.2.4	This is the story of the creation of the sky and the earth. When the L
GEN.2.5	there were still no plants on the earth. Nothing was growing in the fields because the L
GEN.2.6	but a mist would rise up from the earth and water all the ground.
GEN.2.7	Then the L
GEN.2.8	Then the L
GEN.2.9	The L
GEN.2.10	A river flowed through Eden and watered the garden. From there the river branched out to become four rivers. 
GEN.2.11	The first river, named Pishon, flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
GEN.2.12	The gold of that land is excellent. Bdellium and onyx are also found there. 
GEN.2.13	The second river, named Gihon, flows around the whole land of Cush. 
GEN.2.14	The third river, named Tigris, flows out of Assyria toward the east. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
GEN.2.15	The L
GEN.2.16	The L
GEN.2.17	but you must not eat the fruit from the tree which gives the knowledge of good and evil. If you ever eat fruit from that tree, you will die!”
GEN.2.18	Then the L
GEN.2.19	From the ground God formed every wild animal and every bird in the sky, and he brought them to the man so the man could name them. Whatever the man called each living thing, that became its name. 
GEN.2.20	The man gave names to all the tame animals, to the birds in the sky, and to all the wild animals. But Adam did not find a helper that was right for him. 
GEN.2.21	So the L
GEN.2.22	The L
GEN.2.23	And the man said,
GEN.2.23	“Now, this is someone whose bones came from my bones,
GEN.2.23	whose body came from my body.
GEN.2.23	I will call her ‘woman,’
GEN.2.23	because she was taken out of man.”
GEN.2.24	So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one body.
GEN.2.25	The man and his wife were naked, but they were not ashamed.
GEN.3.1	Now the snake was the most clever of all the wild animals the L
GEN.3.2	The woman answered the snake, “We may eat fruit from the trees in the garden. 
GEN.3.3	But God told us, ‘You must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden. You must not even touch it, or you will die.’ ”
GEN.3.4	But the snake said to the woman, “You will not die. 
GEN.3.5	God knows that if you eat the fruit from that tree, you will learn about good and evil and you will be like God!”
GEN.3.6	The woman saw that the tree was beautiful, that its fruit was good to eat, and that it would make her wise. So she took some of its fruit and ate it. She also gave some of the fruit to her husband who was with her, and he ate it.
GEN.3.7	Then, it was as if their eyes were opened. They realized they were naked, so they sewed fig leaves together and made something to cover themselves.
GEN.3.8	Then they heard the L
GEN.3.9	But the L
GEN.3.10	The man answered, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid.”
GEN.3.11	God asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat fruit from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat?”
GEN.3.12	The man said, “You gave this woman to me and she gave me fruit from the tree, so I ate it.”
GEN.3.13	Then the L
GEN.3.13	She answered, “The snake tricked me, so I ate the fruit.”
GEN.3.14	The L
GEN.3.14	“Because you did this,
GEN.3.14	a curse will be put on you.
GEN.3.14	You will be cursed as no other animal, tame or wild, will ever be.
GEN.3.14	You will crawl on your stomach,
GEN.3.14	and you will eat dust all the days of your life.
GEN.3.15	I will make you and the woman
GEN.3.15	enemies to each other.
GEN.3.15	Your descendants and her descendants
GEN.3.15	will be enemies.
GEN.3.15	One of her descendants will crush your head,
GEN.3.15	and you will bite his heel.”
GEN.3.16	Then God said to the woman,
GEN.3.16	“I will cause you to have much trouble
GEN.3.16	when you are pregnant,
GEN.3.16	and when you give birth to children,
GEN.3.16	you will have great pain.
GEN.3.16	You will greatly desire your husband,
GEN.3.16	but he will rule over you.”
GEN.3.17	Then God said to the man, “You listened to what your wife said, and you ate fruit from the tree from which I commanded you not to eat.
GEN.3.17	“So I will put a curse on the ground,
GEN.3.17	and you will have to work very hard for your food.
GEN.3.17	In pain you will eat its food
GEN.3.17	all the days of your life.
GEN.3.18	The ground will produce thorns and weeds for you,
GEN.3.18	and you will eat the plants of the field.
GEN.3.19	You will sweat and work hard for your food.
GEN.3.19	Later you will return to the ground,
GEN.3.19	because you were taken from it.
GEN.3.19	You are dust,
GEN.3.19	and when you die, you will return to the dust.”
GEN.3.20	The man named his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.
GEN.3.21	The L
GEN.3.22	Then the L
GEN.3.23	So the L
GEN.3.24	After God forced humans out of the garden, he placed angels and a sword of fire that flashed around in every direction on its eastern border. This kept people from getting to the tree of life.
GEN.4.1	Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. Eve said, “With the L
GEN.4.2	After that, Eve gave birth to Cain’s brother Abel. Abel took care of flocks, and Cain became a farmer.
GEN.4.3	Later, Cain brought some food from the ground as a gift to God. 
GEN.4.4	Abel brought the best parts from some of the firstborn of his flock. The L
GEN.4.5	but he did not accept Cain and his gift. So Cain became very angry and felt rejected.
GEN.4.6	The L
GEN.4.7	If you do things well, I will accept you, but if you do not do them well, sin is ready to attack you. Sin wants you, but you must rule over it.”
GEN.4.8	Cain said to his brother Abel, “Let’s go out into the field.” While they were out in the field, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
GEN.4.9	Later, the L
GEN.4.9	Cain answered, “I don’t know. Is it my job to take care of my brother?”
GEN.4.10	Then the L
GEN.4.11	And now you will be cursed in your work with the ground, the same ground where your brother’s blood fell and where your hands killed him. 
GEN.4.12	You will work the ground, but it will not grow good crops for you anymore, and you will wander around on the earth.”
GEN.4.13	Then Cain said to the L
GEN.4.14	Today you have forced me to stop working the ground, and now I must hide from you. I must wander around on the earth, and anyone who meets me can kill me.”
GEN.4.15	The L
GEN.4.16	So Cain went away from the L
GEN.4.17	He had sexual relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. At that time Cain was building a city, which he named after his son Enoch. 
GEN.4.18	Enoch had a son named Irad, Irad had a son named Mehujael, Mehujael had a son named Methushael, and Methushael had a son named Lamech.
GEN.4.19	Lamech married two women, Adah and Zillah. 
GEN.4.20	Adah gave birth to Jabal, who became the first person to live in tents and raise cattle. 
GEN.4.21	Jabal’s brother was Jubal, the first person to play the harp and flute. 
GEN.4.22	Zillah gave birth to Tubal-Cain, who made tools out of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah.
GEN.4.23	Lamech said to his wives:
GEN.4.23	“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice!
GEN.4.23	You wives of Lamech, listen to what I say.
GEN.4.23	I killed a man for wounding me,
GEN.4.23	a young man for hitting me.
GEN.4.24	If Cain’s killer is punished seven times,
GEN.4.24	then Lamech’s killer will be punished seventy-seven times.”
GEN.4.25	Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve again, and she gave birth to a son. She named him Seth and said, “God has given me another child. He will take the place of Abel, who was killed by Cain.” 
GEN.4.26	Seth also had a son, and they named him Enosh. At that time people began to pray to the L
GEN.5.1	This is the family history of Adam. When God created human beings, he made them in his own likeness. 
GEN.5.2	He created them male and female, and on that day he blessed them and named them human beings.
GEN.5.3	When Adam was 130 years old, he became the father of another son in his likeness and image, and Adam named him Seth. 
GEN.5.4	After Seth was born, Adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.5	So Adam lived a total of 930 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.6	When Seth was 105 years old, he had a son named Enosh. 
GEN.5.7	After Enosh was born, Seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.8	So Seth lived a total of 912 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.9	When Enosh was 90 years old, he had a son named Kenan. 
GEN.5.10	After Kenan was born, Enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.11	So Enosh lived a total of 905 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.12	When Kenan was 70 years old, he had a son named Mahalalel. 
GEN.5.13	After Mahalalel was born, Kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.14	So Kenan lived a total of 910 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.15	When Mahalalel was 65 years old, he had a son named Jared. 
GEN.5.16	After Jared was born, Mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.17	So Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.18	When Jared was 162 years old, he had a son named Enoch. 
GEN.5.19	After Enoch was born, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.20	So Jared lived a total of 962 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.21	When Enoch was 65 years old, he had a son named Methuselah. 
GEN.5.22	After Methuselah was born, Enoch walked with God 300 years more and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.23	So Enoch lived a total of 365 years. 
GEN.5.24	Enoch walked with God; one day Enoch could not be found, because God took him.
GEN.5.25	When Methuselah was 187 years old, he had a son named Lamech. 
GEN.5.26	After Lamech was born, Methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.27	So Methuselah lived a total of 969 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.28	When Lamech was 182, he had a son. 
GEN.5.29	Lamech named his son Noah and said, “He will comfort us in our work, which comes from the ground the L
GEN.5.30	After Noah was born, Lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters. 
GEN.5.31	So Lamech lived a total of 777 years, and then he died.
GEN.5.32	After Noah was 500 years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.1	The number of people on earth began to grow, and daughters were born to them. 
GEN.6.2	When the sons of God saw that these girls were beautiful, they married any of them they chose. 
GEN.6.3	The L
GEN.6.4	The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also later. That was when the sons of God had sexual relations with the daughters of human beings. These women gave birth to children, who became famous and were the mighty warriors of long ago.
GEN.6.5	The L
GEN.6.6	He was sorry he had made human beings on the earth, and his heart was filled with pain. 
GEN.6.7	So the L
GEN.6.8	But Noah pleased the L
GEN.6.9	This is the family history of Noah. Noah was a good man, the most innocent man of his time, and he walked with God. 
GEN.6.10	He had three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
GEN.6.11	People on earth did what God said was evil, and violence was everywhere. 
GEN.6.12	When God saw that everyone on the earth did only evil, 
GEN.6.13	he said to Noah, “Because people have made the earth full of violence, I will destroy all of them from the earth. 
GEN.6.14	Build a boat of cypress wood for yourself. Make rooms in it and cover it inside and outside with tar. 
GEN.6.15	This is how big I want you to build the boat: four hundred fifty feet long, seventy-five feet wide, and forty-five feet high. 
GEN.6.16	Make an opening around the top of the boat that is eighteen inches high from the edge of the roof down. Put a door in the side of the boat. Make an upper, middle, and lower deck in it. 
GEN.6.17	I will bring a flood of water on the earth to destroy all living things that live under the sky, including everything that has the breath of life. Everything on the earth will die. 
GEN.6.18	But I will make an agreement with you—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives will all go into the boat. 
GEN.6.19	Also, you must bring into the boat two of every living thing, male and female. Keep them alive with you. 
GEN.6.20	Two of every kind of bird, animal, and crawling thing will come to you to be kept alive. 
GEN.6.21	Also gather some of every kind of food and store it on the boat as food for you and the animals.”
GEN.6.22	Noah did everything that God commanded him.
GEN.7.1	Then the L
GEN.7.2	Take with you seven pairs, each male with its female, of every kind of clean animal, and take one pair, each male with its female, of every kind of unclean animal. 
GEN.7.3	Take seven pairs of all the birds of the sky, each male with its female. This will allow all these animals to continue living on the earth after the flood. 
GEN.7.4	Seven days from now I will send rain on the earth. It will rain forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe off from the earth every living thing that I have made.”
GEN.7.5	Noah did everything the L
GEN.7.6	Noah was six hundred years old when the flood came. 
GEN.7.7	He and his wife and his sons and their wives went into the boat to escape the waters of the flood. 
GEN.7.8	The clean animals, the unclean animals, the birds, and everything that crawls on the ground 
GEN.7.9	came to Noah. They went into the boat in groups of two, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah. 
GEN.7.10	Seven days later the flood started.
GEN.7.11	When Noah was six hundred years old, the flood started. On the seventeenth day of the second month of that year the underground springs split open, and the clouds in the sky poured out rain. 
GEN.7.12	The rain fell on the earth for forty days and forty nights.
GEN.7.13	On that same day Noah and his wife, his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their wives went into the boat. 
GEN.7.14	They had every kind of wild and tame animal, every kind of animal that crawls on the earth, and every kind of bird. 
GEN.7.15	Every creature that had the breath of life came to Noah in the boat in groups of two. 
GEN.7.16	One male and one female of every living thing came, just as God had commanded Noah. Then the L
GEN.7.17	Water flooded the earth for forty days, and as it rose it lifted the boat off the ground. 
GEN.7.18	The water continued to rise, and the boat floated on it above the earth. 
GEN.7.19	The water rose so much that even the highest mountains under the sky were covered by it. 
GEN.7.20	It continued to rise until it was more than twenty feet above the mountains.
GEN.7.21	All living things that moved on the earth died. This included all the birds, tame animals, wild animals, and creatures that swarm on the earth, as well as all human beings. 
GEN.7.22	So everything on dry land that had the breath of life in it died. 
GEN.7.23	God destroyed from the earth every living thing that was on the land—every man, animal, crawling thing, and bird of the sky. All that was left was Noah and what was with him in the boat. 
GEN.7.24	And the waters continued to cover the earth for one hundred fifty days.
GEN.8.1	But God remembered Noah and all the wild and tame animals with him in the boat. He made a wind blow over the earth, and the water went down. 
GEN.8.2	The underground springs stopped flowing, and the clouds in the sky stopped pouring down rain. 
GEN.8.3+GEN.8.4	The water that covered the earth began to go down. After one hundred fifty days it had gone down so much that the boat touched land again. It came to rest on one of the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. 
GEN.8.5	The water continued to go down so that by the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains could be seen.
GEN.8.6	Forty days later Noah opened the window he had made in the boat, and 
GEN.8.7	he sent out a raven. It flew here and there until the water had dried up from the earth. 
GEN.8.8	Then Noah sent out a dove to find out if the water had dried up from the ground. 
GEN.8.9	The dove could not find a place to land because water still covered the earth, so it came back to the boat. Noah reached out his hand and took the bird and brought it back into the boat.
GEN.8.10	After seven days Noah again sent out the dove from the boat, 
GEN.8.11	and that evening it came back to him with a fresh olive leaf in its mouth. Then Noah knew that the ground was almost dry. 
GEN.8.12	Seven days later he sent the dove out again, but this time it did not come back.
GEN.8.13	When Noah was six hundred and one years old, in the first day of the first month of that year, the water was dried up from the land. Noah removed the covering of the boat and saw that the land was dry. 
GEN.8.14	By the twenty-seventh day of the second month the land was completely dry.
GEN.8.15	Then God said to Noah, 
GEN.8.16	“You and your wife, your sons, and their wives should go out of the boat. 
GEN.8.17	Bring every animal out of the boat with you—the birds, animals, and everything that crawls on the earth. Let them have many young ones so that they might grow in number.”
GEN.8.18	So Noah went out with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives. 
GEN.8.19	Every animal, everything that crawls on the earth, and every bird went out of the boat by families.
GEN.8.20	Then Noah built an altar to the L
GEN.8.21	The L
GEN.8.22	“As long as the earth continues,
GEN.8.22	planting and harvest,
GEN.8.22	cold and hot,
GEN.8.22	summer and winter,
GEN.8.22	day and night
GEN.8.22	will not stop.”
GEN.9.1	Then God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Have many children; grow in number and fill the earth. 
GEN.9.2	Every animal on earth, every bird in the sky, every animal that crawls on the ground, and every fish in the sea will respect and fear you. I have given them to you.
GEN.9.3	“Everything that moves, everything that is alive, is yours for food. Earlier I gave you the green plants, but now I give you everything for food. 
GEN.9.4	But you must not eat meat that still has blood in it, because blood gives life. 
GEN.9.5	I will demand blood for life. I will demand the life of any animal that kills a person, and I will demand the life of anyone who takes another person’s life.
GEN.9.6	“Whoever kills a human being
GEN.9.6	will be killed by a human being,
GEN.9.6	because God made humans
GEN.9.6	in his own image.
GEN.9.7	“As for you, Noah, I want you and your family to have many children, to grow in number on the earth, and to become many.”
GEN.9.8	Then God said to Noah and his sons, 
GEN.9.9	“Now I am making my agreement with you and your people who will live after you, 
GEN.9.10	and with every living thing that is with you—the birds, the tame and the wild animals, and with everything that came out of the boat with you—with every living thing on earth. 
GEN.9.11	I make this agreement with you: I will never again destroy all living things by a flood. A flood will never again destroy the earth.”
GEN.9.12	And God said, “This is the sign of the agreement between me and you and every living creature that is with you. 
GEN.9.13	I am putting my rainbow in the clouds as the sign of the agreement between me and the earth. 
GEN.9.14	When I bring clouds over the earth and a rainbow appears in them, 
GEN.9.15	I will remember my agreement between me and you and every living thing. Floods will never again destroy all life on the earth. 
GEN.9.16	When the rainbow appears in the clouds, I will see it and I will remember the agreement that continues forever between me and every living thing on the earth.”
GEN.9.17	So God said to Noah, “The rainbow is a sign of the agreement that I made with all living things on earth.”
GEN.9.18	The sons of Noah who came out of the boat with him were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham was the father of Canaan.) 
GEN.9.19	These three men were Noah’s sons, and all the people on earth came from these three sons.
GEN.9.20	Noah became a farmer and planted a vineyard. 
GEN.9.21	When he drank wine made from his grapes, he became drunk and lay naked in his tent. 
GEN.9.22	Ham, the father of Canaan, looked at his naked father and told his brothers outside. 
GEN.9.23	Then Shem and Japheth got a coat and, carrying it on both their shoulders, they walked backwards into the tent and covered their father. They turned their faces away so that they did not see their father’s nakedness.
GEN.9.24	Noah was sleeping because of the wine. When he woke up and learned what his youngest son, Ham, had done to him, 
GEN.9.25	he said,
GEN.9.25	“May there be a curse on Canaan!
GEN.9.25	May he be the lowest slave to his brothers.”
GEN.9.26	Noah also said,
GEN.9.26	“May the L
GEN.9.26	May Canaan be Shem’s slave.
GEN.9.27	May God give more land to Japheth.
GEN.9.27	May Japheth live in Shem’s tents,
GEN.9.27	and may Canaan be their slave.”
GEN.9.28	After the flood Noah lived 350 years. 
GEN.9.29	He lived a total of 950 years, and then he died.
GEN.10.1	This is the family history of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah. After the flood these three men had sons.
GEN.10.2	The sons of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
GEN.10.3	The sons of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
GEN.10.4	The sons of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim. 
GEN.10.5	Those who lived in the lands around the Mediterranean Sea came from these sons of Japheth. All the families grew and became different nations, each nation with its own land and its own language.
GEN.10.6	The sons of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
GEN.10.7	The sons of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.
GEN.10.7	The sons of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
GEN.10.8	Cush also had a descendant named Nimrod, who became a very powerful man on earth. 
GEN.10.9	He was a great hunter before the L
GEN.10.10	At first Nimrod’s kingdom covered Babylon, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh in the land of Babylonia. 
GEN.10.11	From there he went to Assyria, where he built the cities of Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, and Calah. 
GEN.10.12	He also built Resen, the great city between Nineveh and Calah.
GEN.10.13	Mizraim was the father of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites, 
GEN.10.14	Pathrusites, Casluhites, and the people of Crete. (The Philistines came from the Casluhites.)
GEN.10.15	Canaan was the father of Sidon, his first son, and of Heth. 
GEN.10.16	He was also the father of the Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites, 
GEN.10.17	Hivites, Arkites, Sinites, 
GEN.10.18	Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. The families of the Canaanites scattered. 
GEN.10.19	Their land reached from Sidon to Gerar as far as Gaza, and then to Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
GEN.10.20	All these people were the sons of Ham, and all these families had their own languages, their own lands, and their own nations.
GEN.10.21	Shem, Japheth’s older brother, also had sons. One of his descendants was the father of all the sons of Eber.
GEN.10.22	The sons of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
GEN.10.23	The sons of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Meshech.
GEN.10.24	Arphaxad was the father of Shelah, who was the father of Eber. 
GEN.10.25	Eber was the father of two sons—one named Peleg, because the earth was divided during his life, and the other was named Joktan.
GEN.10.26	Joktan was the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
GEN.10.27	Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
GEN.10.28	Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
GEN.10.29	Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these people were the sons of Joktan. 
GEN.10.30	They lived in the area between Mesha and Sephar in the hill country in the East.
GEN.10.31	These are the people from the family of Shem, arranged by families, languages, countries, and nations.
GEN.10.32	This is the list of the families from the sons of Noah, arranged according to their nations. From these families came all the nations who spread across the earth after the flood.
GEN.11.1	At this time the whole world spoke one language, and everyone used the same words. 
GEN.11.2	As people moved from the east, they found a plain in the land of Babylonia and settled there.
GEN.11.3	They said to each other, “Let’s make bricks and bake them to make them hard.” So they used bricks instead of stones, and tar instead of mortar. 
GEN.11.4	Then they said to each other, “Let’s build a city and a tower for ourselves, whose top will reach high into the sky. We will become famous. Then we will not be scattered over all the earth.”

GEN.11.10	This is the family history of Shem. Two years after the flood, when Shem was 100 years old, his son Arphaxad was born. 
GEN.11.11	After that, Shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.12	When Arphaxad was 35 years old, his son Shelah was born. 
GEN.11.13	After that, Arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.14	When Shelah was 30 years old, his son Eber was born. 
GEN.11.15	After that, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.16	When Eber was 34 years old, his son Peleg was born. 
GEN.11.17	After that, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.18	When Peleg was 30 years old, his son Reu was born. 
GEN.11.19	After that, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.20	When Reu was 32 years old, his son Serug was born. 
GEN.11.21	After that, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.22	When Serug was 30 years old, his son Nahor was born. 
GEN.11.23	After that, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.24	When Nahor was 29 years old, his son Terah was born. 
GEN.11.25	After that, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
GEN.11.26	After Terah was 70 years old, his sons Abram, Nahor, and Haran were born.
GEN.11.27	This is the family history of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran. Haran was the father of Lot. 
GEN.11.28	While his father, Terah, was still alive, Haran died in Ur in Babylonia, where he was born. 
GEN.11.29	Abram and Nahor both married. Abram’s wife was named Sarai, and Nahor’s wife was named Milcah. She was the daughter of Haran, who was the father of both Milcah and Iscah. 
GEN.11.30	Sarai was not able to have children.
GEN.11.31	Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (Haran’s son), and his daughter-in-law Sarai (Abram’s wife) and moved out of Ur of Babylonia. They had planned to go to the land of Canaan, but when they reached the city of Haran, they settled there.
GEN.11.32	Terah lived to be 205 years old, and then he died in Haran.

GEN.12.3	I will bless those who bless you,
GEN.12.3	and I will place a curse on those who harm you.
GEN.12.3	And all the people on earth

GEN.12.4	So Abram left Haran as the L
GEN.12.5	He took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, and everything they owned, as well as all the servants they had gotten in Haran. They set out from Haran, planning to go to the land of Canaan, and in time they arrived there.
GEN.12.6	Abram traveled through that land as far as the great tree of Moreh at Shechem. The Canaanites were living in the land at that time. 
GEN.12.7	The L
GEN.12.8	Then he traveled from Shechem to the mountain east of Bethel and set up his tent there. Bethel was to the west, and Ai was to the east. There Abram built another altar to the L
GEN.12.9	After this, he traveled on toward southern Canaan.
GEN.12.10	At this time there was not much food in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live because there was so little food. 
GEN.12.11	Just before they arrived in Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, “I know you are a very beautiful woman. 
GEN.12.12	When the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This woman is his wife.’ Then they will kill me but let you live. 
GEN.12.13	Tell them you are my sister so that things will go well with me and I may be allowed to live because of you.”
GEN.12.14	When Abram came to Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was very beautiful. 
GEN.12.15	The Egyptian officers saw her and told the king of Egypt how beautiful she was. They took her to the king’s palace, and 
GEN.12.16	the king was kind to Abram because he thought Abram was her brother. He gave Abram sheep, cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.
GEN.12.17	But the L
GEN.12.18	So the king sent for Abram and said, “What have you done to me? Why didn’t you tell me Sarai was your wife? 
GEN.12.19	Why did you say, ‘She is my sister’ so that I made her my wife? Now, here is your wife. Take her and leave!” 
GEN.12.20	Then the king commanded his men to make Abram leave Egypt; so Abram and his wife left with everything they owned.
GEN.13.1	So Abram, his wife, and Lot left Egypt, taking everything they owned, and traveled to southern Canaan. 
GEN.13.2	Abram was very rich in cattle, silver, and gold.
GEN.13.3	He left southern Canaan and went back to Bethel where he had camped before, between Bethel and Ai, 
GEN.13.4	and where he had built an altar. So he worshiped the L
GEN.13.5	During this time Lot was traveling with Abram, and Lot also had flocks, herds, and tents. 
GEN.13.6	Abram and Lot had so many animals that the land could not support both of them together, 
GEN.13.7	so Abram’s herdsmen and Lot’s herdsmen began to argue. The Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land at this time.
GEN.13.8	Abram said to Lot, “There should be no arguing between you and me, or between your herdsmen and mine, because we are brothers. 
GEN.13.9	We should separate. The whole land is there in front of you. If you go to the left, I will go to the right. If you go to the right, I will go to the left.”
GEN.13.10	Lot looked all around and saw the whole Jordan Valley and that there was much water there. It was like the L
GEN.13.11	So Lot chose to move east and live in the Jordan Valley. In this way Abram and Lot separated. 
GEN.13.12	Abram lived in the land of Canaan, but Lot lived among the cities in the Jordan Valley, very near to Sodom. 
GEN.13.13	Now the people of Sodom were very evil and were always sinning against the L

GEN.13.17	Get up! Walk through all this land because I am now giving it to you.”
GEN.13.18	So Abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of Mamre at the city of Hebron. There he built an altar to the L
GEN.14.1	Now Amraphel was king of Babylonia, Arioch was king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer was king of Elam, and Tidal was king of Goiim. 
GEN.14.2	All these kings went to war against several other kings: Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela. (Bela is also called Zoar.)
GEN.14.3	These kings who were attacked united their armies in the Valley of Siddim (now the Dead Sea). 
GEN.14.4	They had served Kedorlaomer for twelve years, but in the thirteenth year, they all turned against him. 
GEN.14.5	Then in the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings with him came and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth Karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, and the Emites in Shaveh Kiriathaim. 
GEN.14.6	They also defeated the Horites in the mountains of Edom to El Paran (near the desert). 
GEN.14.7	Then they turned back and went to En Mishpat (that is, Kadesh). They defeated all the Amalekites, as well as the Amorites who lived in Hazazon Tamar.
GEN.14.8	At that time the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela went out to fight in the Valley of Siddim. (Bela is called Zoar.) 
GEN.14.9	They fought against Kedorlaomer king of Elam, Tidal king of Goiim, Amraphel king of Babylonia, and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings fighting against five. 
GEN.14.10	There were many tar pits in the Valley of Siddim. When the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah and their armies ran away, some of the soldiers fell into the tar pits, but the others ran away to the mountains.
GEN.14.11	Now Kedorlaomer and his armies took everything the people of Sodom and Gomorrah owned, including their food. 
GEN.14.12	They took Lot, Abram’s nephew who was living in Sodom, and everything he owned. Then they left. 
GEN.14.13	One of the men who was not captured went to Abram, the Hebrew, and told him what had happened. At that time Abram was camped near the great trees of Mamre the Amorite. Mamre was a brother of Eshcol and Aner, and they had all made an agreement to help Abram.
GEN.14.14	When Abram learned that Lot had been captured, he called out his 318 trained men who had been born in his camp. He led the men and chased the enemy all the way to the town of Dan. 
GEN.14.15	That night he divided his men into groups, and they made a surprise attack against the enemy. They chased them all the way to Hobah, north of Damascus. 
GEN.14.16	Then Abram brought back everything the enemy had stolen, the women and the other people, and Lot, and everything Lot owned.
GEN.14.17	After defeating Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, Abram went home. As he was returning, the king of Sodom came out to meet him in the Valley of Shaveh (now called King’s Valley).
GEN.14.18	Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. He was a priest for God Most High 
GEN.14.19	and blessed Abram, saying,
GEN.14.19	“Abram, may you be blessed by God Most High,
GEN.14.19	the God who made heaven and earth.
GEN.14.20	And we praise God Most High,
GEN.14.20	who has helped you to defeat your enemies.”
GEN.14.20	Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything he had brought back from the battle.
GEN.14.21	The king of Sodom said to Abram, “You may keep all these things for yourself. Just give me my people who were captured.”
GEN.14.22	But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I make a promise to the L
GEN.14.23	I promise that I will not keep anything that is yours. I will not keep even a thread or a sandal strap so that you cannot say, ‘I made Abram rich.’ 
GEN.14.24	I will keep nothing but the food my young men have eaten. But give Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre their share of what we won, because they went with me into battle.”
GEN.15.1	After these things happened, the L

GEN.15.3	Abram said, “Look, you have given me no son, so a slave born in my house will inherit everything I have.”
GEN.15.4	Then the L
GEN.15.5	Then God led Abram outside and said, “Look at the sky. There are so many stars you cannot count them. Your descendants also will be too many to count.”

GEN.15.10	Abram brought them all to God. Then Abram killed the animals and cut each of them into two pieces, laying each half opposite the other half. But he did not cut the birds in half. 
GEN.15.11	Later, large birds flew down to eat the animals, but Abram chased them away.
GEN.15.12	As the sun was going down, Abram fell into a deep sleep. While he was asleep, a very terrible darkness came. 
GEN.15.13	Then the L
GEN.15.14	But I will punish the nation where they are slaves. Then your descendants will leave that land, taking great wealth with them. 
GEN.15.15	And you, Abram, will die in peace and will be buried at an old age. 
GEN.15.16	After your great-great-grandchildren are born, your people will come to this land again. It will take that long, because I am not yet going to punish the Amorites for their evil behavior.”
GEN.15.17	After the sun went down, it was very dark. Suddenly a smoking firepot and a blazing torch passed between the halves of the dead animals. 
GEN.15.18	So on that day the L
GEN.15.19	This is the land of the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites, 
GEN.15.20	Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites, 
GEN.15.21	Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites.”
GEN.16.1	Sarai, Abram’s wife, had no children, but she had a slave girl from Egypt named Hagar. 
GEN.16.2	Sarai said to Abram, “Look, the L
GEN.16.2	Abram did what Sarai said. 
GEN.16.3	It was after he had lived ten years in Canaan that Sarai gave Hagar to her husband Abram. (Hagar was her slave girl from Egypt.)
GEN.16.4	Abram had sexual relations with Hagar, and she became pregnant. When Hagar learned she was pregnant, she began to treat her mistress Sarai badly. 
GEN.16.5	Then Sarai said to Abram, “This is your fault. I gave my slave girl to you, and when she became pregnant, she began to treat me badly. Let the L
GEN.16.6	But Abram said to Sarai, “You are Hagar’s mistress. Do anything you want to her.” Then Sarai was hard on Hagar, and Hagar ran away.

GEN.16.8	The angel said, “Hagar, Sarai’s slave girl, where have you come from? Where are you going?”
GEN.16.8	Hagar answered, “I am running away from my mistress Sarai.”

GEN.16.10	The angel also said, “I will give you so many descendants they cannot be counted.”
GEN.16.11	The angel added,

GEN.16.11	You will name him Ishmael,
GEN.16.11	because the L
GEN.16.12	Ishmael will be like a wild donkey.
GEN.16.12	He will be against everyone,
GEN.16.12	and everyone will be against him.
GEN.16.12	He will attack all his brothers.”
GEN.16.13	The slave girl gave a name to the L
GEN.16.14	So the well there, between Kadesh and Bered, was called Beer Lahai Roi.
GEN.16.15	Hagar gave birth to a son for Abram, and Abram named him Ishmael. 
GEN.16.16	Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.
GEN.17.1	When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the L
GEN.17.2	I will make an agreement between us, and I will make you the ancestor of many people.”
GEN.17.3	Then Abram bowed facedown on the ground. God said to him, 
GEN.17.4	“I am making my agreement with you: I will make you the father of many nations. 
GEN.17.5	I am changing your name from Abram to Abraham because I am making you a father of many nations. 
GEN.17.6	I will give you many descendants. New nations will be born from you, and kings will come from you. 
GEN.17.7	And I will make an agreement between me and you and all your descendants from now on: I will be your God and the God of all your descendants. 
GEN.17.8	You live in the land of Canaan now as a stranger, but I will give you and your descendants all this land forever. And I will be the God of your descendants.”
GEN.17.9	Then God said to Abraham, “You and your descendants must keep this agreement from now on. 
GEN.17.10	This is my agreement with you and all your descendants, which you must obey: Every male among you must be circumcised. 
GEN.17.11	Cut away your foreskin to show that you are prepared to follow the agreement between me and you. 
GEN.17.12	From now on when a baby boy is eight days old, you will circumcise him. This includes any boy born among your people or any who is your slave, who is not one of your descendants. 
GEN.17.13	Circumcise every baby boy whether he is born in your family or bought as a slave. Your bodies will be marked to show that you are part of my agreement that lasts forever. 
GEN.17.14	Any male who is not circumcised will be cut off from his people, because he has broken my agreement.”
GEN.17.15	God said to Abraham, “I will change the name of Sarai, your wife, to Sarah. 
GEN.17.16	I will bless her and give her a son, and you will be the father. She will be the mother of many nations. Kings of nations will come from her.”
GEN.17.17	Abraham bowed facedown on the ground and laughed. He said to himself, “Can a man have a child when he is a hundred years old? Can Sarah give birth to a child when she is ninety?” 
GEN.17.18	Then Abraham said to God, “Please let Ishmael be the son you promised.”
GEN.17.19	God said, “No, Sarah your wife will have a son, and you will name him Isaac. I will make my agreement with him to be an agreement that continues forever with all his descendants.
GEN.17.20	“As for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will bless him and give him many descendants. And I will cause their numbers to grow greatly. He will be the father of twelve great leaders, and I will make him into a great nation. 
GEN.17.21	But I will make my agreement with Isaac, the son whom Sarah will have at this same time next year.” 
GEN.17.22	After God finished talking with Abraham, God rose and left him.
GEN.17.23	Then Abraham gathered Ishmael, all the males born in his camp, and the slaves he had bought. So that day Abraham circumcised every man and boy in his camp as God had told him to do. 
GEN.17.24	Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised. 
GEN.17.25	And Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised. 
GEN.17.26	Abraham and his son were circumcised on the same day. 
GEN.17.27	Also on that day all the men in Abraham’s camp were circumcised, including all those born in his camp and all the slaves he had bought from other nations.
GEN.18.1	Later, the L
GEN.18.2	He looked up and saw three men standing near him. When Abraham saw them, he ran from his tent to meet them. He bowed facedown on the ground before them 
GEN.18.3	and said, “Sir, if you think well of me, please stay awhile with me, your servant. 
GEN.18.4	I will bring some water so all of you can wash your feet. You may rest under the tree, 
GEN.18.5	and I will get some bread for you so you can regain your strength. Then you may continue your journey.”
GEN.18.5	The three men said, “That is fine. Do as you said.”
GEN.18.6	Abraham hurried to the tent where Sarah was and said to her, “Hurry, prepare twenty quarts of fine flour, and make it into loaves of bread.” 
GEN.18.7	Then Abraham ran to his herd and took one of his best calves. He gave it to a servant, who hurried to kill it and to prepare it for food. 
GEN.18.8	Abraham gave the three men the calf that had been cooked and milk curds and milk. While they ate, he stood under the tree near them.
GEN.18.9	The men asked Abraham, “Where is your wife Sarah?”
GEN.18.9	“There, in the tent,” said Abraham.
GEN.18.10	Then the L
GEN.18.10	Sarah was listening at the entrance of the tent which was behind him. 
GEN.18.11	Abraham and Sarah were very old. Since Sarah was past the age when women normally have children, 
GEN.18.12	she laughed to herself, “My husband and I are too old to have a baby.”
GEN.18.13	Then the L
GEN.18.14	Is anything too hard for the L
GEN.18.15	Sarah was afraid, so she lied and said, “I didn’t laugh.”

GEN.18.23	Then Abraham approached him and asked, “Do you plan to destroy the good people along with the evil ones? 
GEN.18.24	What if there are fifty good people in that city? Will you still destroy it? Surely you will save the city for the fifty good people living there. 
GEN.18.25	Surely you will not destroy the good people along with the evil ones; then they would be treated the same. You are the judge of all the earth. Won’t you do what is right?”

GEN.18.28	What if there are only forty-five good people in the city? Will you destroy the whole city for the lack of five good people?”
GEN.18.28	The L
GEN.18.29	Again Abraham said to him, “If you find only forty good people there, will you destroy the city?”
GEN.18.29	The L
GEN.18.30	Then Abraham said, “Lord, please don’t be angry with me, but let me ask you this. If you find only thirty good people in the city, will you destroy it?”
GEN.18.30	He said, “If I find thirty good people there, I will not destroy the city.”
GEN.18.31	Then Abraham said, “I have been brave to speak to the Lord. But what if there are twenty good people in the city?”
GEN.18.31	He answered, “If I find twenty there, I will not destroy the city.”
GEN.18.32	Then Abraham said, “Lord, please don’t be angry with me, but let me bother you this one last time. What if you find ten there?”
GEN.18.32	He said, “If I find ten there, I will not destroy it.”
GEN.18.33	When the L
GEN.19.1	The two angels came to Sodom in the evening as Lot was sitting near the city gate. When he saw them, he got up and went to them and bowed facedown on the ground. 
GEN.19.2	Lot said, “Sirs, please come to my house and spend the night. There you can wash your feet, and then tomorrow you may continue your journey.”
GEN.19.2	The angels answered, “No, we will spend the night in the city’s public square.”
GEN.19.3	But Lot begged them to come, so they agreed and went to his house. Then Lot prepared a meal for them. He baked bread without yeast, and they ate it.
GEN.19.4	Before bedtime, men both young and old and from every part of Sodom surrounded Lot’s house. 
GEN.19.5	They called to Lot, “Where are the two men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so we can have sexual relations with them.”
GEN.19.6	Lot went outside to them, closing the door behind him. 
GEN.19.7	He said, “No, my brothers! Do not do this evil thing. 
GEN.19.8	Look! I have two daughters who have never slept with a man. I will give them to you, and you may do anything you want with them. But please don’t do anything to these men. They have come to my house, and I must protect them.”
GEN.19.9	The men around the house answered, “Move out of the way!” Then they said to each other, “This man Lot came to our city as a stranger, and now he wants to tell us what to do!” They said to Lot, “We will do worse things to you than to them.” They started pushing him back and were ready to break down the door.
GEN.19.10	But the two men staying with Lot opened the door, pulled him back inside the house, and then closed the door. 
GEN.19.11	They struck those outside the door with blindness, so the men, both young and old, could not find the door.
GEN.19.12	The two men said to Lot, “Do you have any other relatives in this city? Do you have any sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or any other relatives? If you do, tell them to leave now, 
GEN.19.13	because we are about to destroy this city. The L
GEN.19.14	So Lot went out and said to his future sons-in-law who were pledged to marry his daughters, “Hurry and leave this city! The L
GEN.19.15	At dawn the next morning, the angels begged Lot to hurry. They said, “Go! Take your wife and your two daughters with you so you will not be destroyed when the city is punished.”
GEN.19.16	But Lot delayed. So the two men took the hands of Lot, his wife, and his two daughters and led them safely out of the city. So the L
GEN.19.17	After they brought them out of the city, one of the men said, “Run for your lives! Don’t look back or stop anywhere in the valley. Run to the mountains, or you will be destroyed.”
GEN.19.18	But Lot said to one of them, “Sir, please don’t force me to go so far! 
GEN.19.19	You have been merciful and kind to me and have saved my life. But I can’t run to the mountains. The disaster will catch me, and I will die. 
GEN.19.20	Look, that little town over there is not too far away. Let me run there. It’s really just a little town, and I’ll be safe there.”
GEN.19.21	The angel said to Lot, “Very well, I will allow you to do this also. I will not destroy that town. 
GEN.19.22	But run there fast, because I cannot destroy Sodom until you are safely in that town.” (That town is named Zoar, because it is little.)
GEN.19.23	The sun had already come up when Lot entered Zoar. 
GEN.19.24	The L
GEN.19.25	and destroyed those cities. He also destroyed the whole Jordan Valley, everyone living in the cities, and even all the plants.
GEN.19.26	At that point Lot’s wife looked back. When she did, she became a pillar of salt.
GEN.19.27	Early the next morning, Abraham got up and went to the place where he had stood before the L
GEN.19.28	He looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and all the Jordan Valley and saw smoke rising from the land, like smoke from a furnace.
GEN.19.29	God destroyed the cities in the valley, but he remembered what Abraham had asked. So God saved Lot’s life, but he destroyed the city where Lot had lived.
GEN.19.30	Lot was afraid to continue living in Zoar, so he and his two daughters went to live in the mountains in a cave. 
GEN.19.31	One day the older daughter said to the younger, “Our father is old. Everywhere on the earth women and men marry, but there are no men around here for us to marry. 
GEN.19.32	Let’s get our father drunk and have sexual relations with him. We can use him to have children and continue our family.”
GEN.19.33	That night the two girls got their father drunk, and the older daughter went and had sexual relations with him. But Lot did not know when she lay down or when she got up.
GEN.19.34	The next day the older daughter said to the younger, “Last night I had sexual relations with my father. Let’s get him drunk again tonight so you can go and have sexual relations with him, too. In this way we can use our father to have children to continue our family.” 
GEN.19.35	So that night they got their father drunk again, and the younger daughter went and had sexual relations with him. Again, Lot did not know when she lay down or when she got up.
GEN.19.36	So both of Lot’s daughters became pregnant by their father. 
GEN.19.37	The older daughter gave birth to a son and named him Moab. He is the ancestor of all the Moabite people who are still living today. 
GEN.19.38	The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-Ammi. He is the father of all the Ammonite people who are still living today.
GEN.20.1	Abraham left Hebron and traveled to southern Canaan where he stayed awhile between Kadesh and Shur. When he moved to Gerar, 
GEN.20.2	he told people that his wife Sarah was his sister. Abimelech king of Gerar heard this, so he sent some servants to take her. 
GEN.20.3	But one night God spoke to Abimelech in a dream and said, “You will die. The woman you took is married.”
GEN.20.4	But Abimelech had not gone near Sarah, so he said, “Lord, would you destroy an innocent nation? 
GEN.20.5	Abraham himself told me, ‘This woman is my sister,’ and she also said, ‘He is my brother.’ I am innocent. I did not know I was doing anything wrong.”
GEN.20.6	Then God said to Abimelech in the dream, “Yes, I know you did not realize what you were doing. So I did not allow you to sin against me and touch her. 
GEN.20.7	Give Abraham his wife back. He is a prophet. He will pray for you, and you will not die. But if you do not give Sarah back, you and all your family will surely die.”
GEN.20.8	So early the next morning, Abimelech called all his officers and told them everything that had happened in the dream. They were very afraid. 
GEN.20.9	Then Abimelech called Abraham to him and said, “What have you done to us? What wrong did I do against you? Why did you bring this trouble to my kingdom? You should not have done these things to me. 
GEN.20.10	What were you thinking that caused you to do this?”
GEN.20.11	Then Abraham answered, “I thought no one in this place respected God and that someone would kill me to get Sarah. 
GEN.20.12	And it is true that she is my sister. She is the daughter of my father, but she is not the daughter of my mother. 
GEN.20.13	When God told me to leave my father’s house and wander in many different places, I told Sarah, ‘You must do a special favor for me. Everywhere we go tell people I am your brother.’ ”
GEN.20.14	Then Abimelech gave Abraham some sheep, cattle, and male and female slaves. He also gave Sarah, Abraham’s wife, back to him 
GEN.20.15	and said, “Look around you at my land. You may live anywhere you want.”
GEN.20.16	Abimelech said to Sarah, “I gave your brother Abraham twenty-five pounds of silver to make up for any wrong that people may think about you. I want everyone to know that you are innocent.”
GEN.20.17	Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his servant girls so they could have children. 
GEN.20.18	The L
GEN.21.1	The L
GEN.21.2	Sarah became pregnant and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age. Everything happened at the time God had said it would. 
GEN.21.3	Abraham named his son Isaac, the son Sarah gave birth to. 
GEN.21.4	He circumcised Isaac when he was eight days old as God had commanded.
GEN.21.5	Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Isaac was born. 
GEN.21.6	And Sarah said, “God has made me laugh. Everyone who hears about this will laugh with me. 
GEN.21.7	No one thought that I would be able to have Abraham’s child, but even though Abraham is old I have given him a son.”
GEN.21.8	Isaac grew, and when he became old enough to eat food, Abraham gave a great feast. 
GEN.21.9	But Sarah saw Ishmael making fun of Isaac. (Ishmael was the son of Abraham by Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian slave.) 
GEN.21.10	So Sarah said to Abraham, “Throw out this slave woman and her son. Her son should not inherit anything; my son Isaac should receive it all.”
GEN.21.11	This troubled Abraham very much because Ishmael was also his son. 
GEN.21.12	But God said to Abraham, “Don’t be troubled about the boy and the slave woman. Do whatever Sarah tells you. The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac. 
GEN.21.13	I will also make the descendants of Ishmael into a great nation because he is your son, too.”
GEN.21.14	Early the next morning Abraham took some food and a leather bag full of water. He gave them to Hagar and sent her away. Carrying these things and her son, Hagar went and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.
GEN.21.15	Later, when all the water was gone from the bag, Hagar put her son under a bush. 
GEN.21.16	Then she went away a short distance and sat down. She thought, “My son will die, and I cannot watch this happen.” She sat there and began to cry.
GEN.21.17	God heard the boy crying, and God’s angel called to Hagar from heaven. He said, “What is wrong, Hagar? Don’t be afraid! God has heard the boy crying there. 
GEN.21.18	Help him up and take him by the hand. I will make his descendants into a great nation.”
GEN.21.19	Then God showed Hagar a well of water. So she went to the well and filled her bag with water and gave the boy a drink.
GEN.21.20	God was with the boy as he grew up. Ishmael lived in the desert and became an archer. 
GEN.21.21	He lived in the Desert of Paran, and his mother found a wife for him in Egypt.
GEN.21.22	Then Abimelech came with Phicol, the commander of his army, and said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do. 
GEN.21.23	So make a promise to me here before God that you will be fair with me and my children and my descendants. Be kind to me and to this land where you have lived as a stranger—as kind as I have been to you.”
GEN.21.24	And Abraham said, “I promise.” 
GEN.21.25	Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about Abimelech’s servants who had seized a well of water.
GEN.21.26	But Abimelech said, “I don’t know who did this. You never told me about this before today.”
GEN.21.27	Then Abraham gave Abimelech some sheep and cattle, and they made an agreement. 
GEN.21.28	Abraham also put seven female lambs in front of Abimelech.
GEN.21.29	Abimelech asked Abraham, “Why did you put these seven female lambs by themselves?”
GEN.21.30	Abraham answered, “Accept these lambs from me to prove that you believe I dug this well.”
GEN.21.31	So that place was called Beersheba because they made a promise to each other there.
GEN.21.32	After Abraham and Abimelech made the agreement at Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, went back to the land of the Philistines.
GEN.21.33	Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba and prayed to the L
GEN.21.34	And Abraham lived as a stranger in the land of the Philistines for a long time.
GEN.22.1	After these things God tested Abraham’s faith. God said to him, “Abraham!”
GEN.22.1	And he answered, “Here I am.”
GEN.22.2	Then God said, “Take your only son, Isaac, the son you love, and go to the land of Moriah. Kill him there and offer him as a whole burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about.”
GEN.22.3	Abraham got up early in the morning and saddled his donkey. He took Isaac and two servants with him. After he cut the wood for the sacrifice, they went to the place God had told them to go. 
GEN.22.4	On the third day Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 
GEN.22.5	He said to his servants, “Stay here with the donkey. My son and I will go over there and worship, and then we will come back to you.”
GEN.22.6	Abraham took the wood for the sacrifice and gave it to his son to carry, but he himself took the knife and the fire. So he and his son went on together.
GEN.22.7	Isaac said to his father Abraham, “Father!”
GEN.22.7	Abraham answered, “Yes, my son.”
GEN.22.7	Isaac said, “We have the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb we will burn as a sacrifice?”
GEN.22.8	Abraham answered, “God will give us the lamb for the sacrifice, my son.”
GEN.22.8	So Abraham and his son went on together 
GEN.22.9	and came to the place God had told him about. Abraham built an altar there. He laid the wood on it and then tied up his son Isaac and laid him on the wood on the altar. 
GEN.22.10	Then Abraham took his knife and was about to kill his son.
GEN.22.11	But the angel of the L
GEN.22.11	Abraham answered, “Yes.”
GEN.22.12	The angel said, “Don’t kill your son or hurt him in any way. Now I can see that you trust God and that you have not kept your son, your only son, from me.”
GEN.22.13	Then Abraham looked up and saw a male sheep caught in a bush by its horns. So Abraham went and took the sheep and killed it. He offered it as a whole burnt offering to God, and his son was saved. 
GEN.22.14	So Abraham named that place The L
GEN.22.15	The angel of the L
GEN.22.16	and said, “The L
GEN.22.17	I will surely bless you and give you many descendants. They will be as many as the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore, and they will capture the cities of their enemies. 
GEN.22.18	Through your descendants all the nations on the earth will be blessed, because you obeyed me.’ ”
GEN.22.19	Then Abraham returned to his servants. They all traveled back to Beersheba, and Abraham stayed there.
GEN.22.20	After these things happened, someone told Abraham: “Your brother Nahor and his wife Milcah have children now. 
GEN.22.21	The first son is Uz, and the second is Buz. The third son is Kemuel (the father of Aram). 
GEN.22.22	Then there are Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” 
GEN.22.23	Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. Milcah was the mother of these eight sons, and Nahor, Abraham’s brother, was the father. 
GEN.22.24	Also Nahor had four other sons by his slave woman Reumah. Their names were Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
GEN.23.1	Sarah lived to be one hundred twenty-seven years old. 
GEN.23.2	She died in Kiriath Arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. Abraham was very sad and cried because of her. 
GEN.23.3	After a while he got up from the side of his wife’s body and went to talk to the Hittites. He said, 
GEN.23.4	“I am only a stranger and a foreigner here. Sell me some of your land so that I can bury my dead wife.”
GEN.23.5	The Hittites answered Abraham, 
GEN.23.6	“Sir, you are a great leader among us. You may have the best place we have to bury your dead. You may have any of our burying places that you want, and none of us will stop you from burying your dead wife.”
GEN.23.7	Abraham rose and bowed to the people of the land, the Hittites. 
GEN.23.8	He said to them, “If you truly want to help me bury my dead wife here, speak to Ephron, the son of Zohar for me. 
GEN.23.9	Ask him to sell me the cave of Machpelah at the edge of his field. I will pay him the full price. You can be the witnesses that I am buying it as a burial place.”
GEN.23.10	Ephron was sitting among the Hittites at the city gate. He answered Abraham, 
GEN.23.11	“No, sir. I will give you the land and the cave that is in it, with these people as witnesses. Bury your dead wife.”
GEN.23.12	Then Abraham bowed down before the Hittites. 
GEN.23.13	He said to Ephron before all the people, “Please let me pay you the full price for the field. Accept my money, and I will bury my dead there.”
GEN.23.14	Ephron answered Abraham, 
GEN.23.15	“Sir, the land is worth ten pounds of silver, but I won’t argue with you over the price. Take the land, and bury your dead wife.”
GEN.23.16	Abraham agreed and paid Ephron in front of the Hittite witnesses. He weighed out the full price, ten pounds of silver, and they counted the weight as the traders normally did.
GEN.23.17+GEN.23.18	So Ephron’s field in Machpelah, east of Mamre, was sold. Abraham became the owner of the field, the cave in it, and all the trees that were in the field. The sale was made at the city gate, with the Hittites as witnesses. 
GEN.23.19	After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre. (Mamre was later called Hebron in the land of Canaan.) 
GEN.23.20	So Abraham bought the field and the cave in it from the Hittites to use as a burying place.
GEN.24.1	Abraham was now very old, and the L
GEN.24.2	Abraham said to his oldest servant, who was in charge of everything he owned, “Put your hand under my leg. 
GEN.24.3	Make a promise to me before the L
GEN.24.4	Instead, go back to my country, to the land of my relatives, and get a wife for my son Isaac.”
GEN.24.5	The servant said to him, “What if this woman does not want to return with me to this land? Then, should I take your son with me back to your homeland?”
GEN.24.6	Abraham said to him, “No! Don’t take my son back there. 
GEN.24.7	The L
GEN.24.8	If the girl won’t come back with you, you will be free from this promise. But you must not take my son back there.” 
GEN.24.9	So the servant put his hand under his master’s leg and made a promise to Abraham about this.
GEN.24.10	The servant took ten of Abraham’s camels and left, carrying with him many different kinds of beautiful gifts. He went to Northwest Mesopotamia to Nahor’s city. 
GEN.24.11	In the evening, when the women come out to get water, he made the camels kneel down at the well outside the city.
GEN.24.12	The servant said, “L
GEN.24.13	Here I am, standing by the spring, and the girls from the city are coming out to get water. 
GEN.24.14	I will say to one of them, ‘Please put your jar down so I can drink.’ Then let her say, ‘Drink, and I will also give water to your camels.’ If that happens, I will know she is the right one for your servant Isaac and that you have shown kindness to my master.”
GEN.24.15	Before the servant had finished praying, Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, came out of the city. (Bethuel was the son of Milcah and Nahor, Abraham’s brother.) Rebekah was carrying her water jar on her shoulder. 
GEN.24.16	She was very pretty, a virgin; she had never had sexual relations with a man. She went down to the spring and filled her jar, then came back up. 
GEN.24.17	The servant ran to her and said, “Please give me a little water from your jar.”
GEN.24.18	Rebekah said, “Drink, sir.” She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and gave him a drink. 
GEN.24.19	After he finished drinking, Rebekah said, “I will also pour some water for your camels.” 
GEN.24.20	So she quickly poured all the water from her jar into the drinking trough for the camels. Then she kept running to the well until she had given all the camels enough to drink.
GEN.24.21	The servant quietly watched her. He wanted to be sure the L
GEN.24.22	After the camels had finished drinking, he gave Rebekah a gold ring weighing one-fifth of an ounce and two gold arm bracelets weighing about four ounces each. 
GEN.24.23	He asked, “Who is your father? Is there a place in his house for me and my men to spend the night?”
GEN.24.24	Rebekah answered, “My father is Bethuel, the son of Milcah and Nahor.” 
GEN.24.25	Then she said, “And, yes, we have straw for your camels and a place for you to spend the night.”
GEN.24.26	The servant bowed and worshiped the L
GEN.24.27	and said, “Blessed is the L
GEN.24.28	Then Rebekah ran and told her mother’s family about all these things. 
GEN.24.29	She had a brother named Laban, who ran out to Abraham’s servant, who was still at the spring. 
GEN.24.30	Laban had heard what she had said and had seen the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms. So he ran out to the well, and there was the man standing by the camels at the spring. 
GEN.24.31	Laban said, “Sir, you are welcome to come in; you don’t have to stand outside. I have prepared the house for you and also a place for your camels.”
GEN.24.32	So Abraham’s servant went into the house. After Laban unloaded the camels and gave them straw and food, he gave water to Abraham’s servant so he and the men with him could wash their feet. 
GEN.24.33	Then Laban gave the servant food, but the servant said, “I will not eat until I have told you why I came.”
GEN.24.33	So Laban said, “Then tell us.”
GEN.24.34	He said, “I am Abraham’s servant. 
GEN.24.35	The L
GEN.24.36	Sarah, my master’s wife, gave birth to a son when she was old, and my master has given everything he owns to that son. 
GEN.24.37	My master had me make a promise to him and said, ‘Don’t get a wife for my son from the Canaanite girls who live around here. 
GEN.24.38	Instead, you must go to my father’s people and to my family. There you must get a wife for my son.’ 
GEN.24.39	I said to my master, ‘What if the woman will not come back with me?’ 
GEN.24.40	But he said, ‘I serve the L
GEN.24.41	Then you will be free from the promise. But if they will not give you a wife for my son, you will be free from this promise.’
GEN.24.42	“Today I came to this spring. I said, ‘L
GEN.24.43	I am standing by this spring. I will wait for a young woman to come out to get water, and I will say, “Please give me water from your jar to drink.” 
GEN.24.44	Then let her say, “Drink this water, and I will also get water for your camels.” By this I will know the L
GEN.24.45	“Before I finished my silent prayer, Rebekah came out of the city with her water jar on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and got water. I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’ 
GEN.24.46	She quickly lowered the jar from her shoulder and said, ‘Drink this. I will also get water for your camels.’ So I drank, and she gave water to my camels too. 
GEN.24.47	When I asked her, ‘Who is your father?’ she answered, ‘My father is Bethuel son of Milcah and Nahor.’ Then I put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms, 
GEN.24.48	and I bowed my head and thanked the L
GEN.24.49	Now, tell me, will you be kind and truthful to my master? And if not, tell me so. Then I will know what I should do.”
GEN.24.50	Laban and Bethuel answered, “This is clearly from the L
GEN.24.51	Rebekah is yours. Take her and go. Let her marry your master’s son as the L
GEN.24.52	When Abraham’s servant heard these words, he bowed facedown on the ground before the L
GEN.24.53	Then he gave Rebekah gold and silver jewelry and clothes. He also gave expensive gifts to her brother and mother. 
GEN.24.54	The servant and the men with him ate and drank and spent the night there. When they got up the next morning, the servant said, “Now let me go back to my master.”
GEN.24.55	Rebekah’s mother and her brother said, “Let Rebekah stay with us at least ten days. After that she may go.”
GEN.24.56	But the servant said to them, “Do not make me wait, because the L
GEN.24.57	Rebekah’s brother and mother said, “We will call Rebekah and ask her what she wants to do.” 
GEN.24.58	They called her and asked her, “Do you want to go with this man now?”
GEN.24.58	She said, “Yes, I do.”
GEN.24.59	So they allowed Rebekah and her nurse to go with Abraham’s servant and his men. 
GEN.24.60	They blessed Rebekah and said,
GEN.24.60	“Our sister, may you be the mother of thousands of people,
GEN.24.60	and may your descendants capture the cities of their enemies.”
GEN.24.61	Then Rebekah and her servant girls got on the camels and followed the servant and his men. So the servant took Rebekah and left.
GEN.24.62	At this time Isaac had left Beer Lahai Roi and was living in southern Canaan. 
GEN.24.63	One evening when he went out to the field to think, he looked up and saw camels coming. 
GEN.24.64	Rebekah also looked and saw Isaac. Then she jumped down from the camel 
GEN.24.65	and asked the servant, “Who is that man walking in the field to meet us?”
GEN.24.65	The servant answered, “That is my master.” So Rebekah covered her face with her veil.
GEN.24.66	The servant told Isaac everything that had happened. 
GEN.24.67	Then Isaac brought Rebekah into the tent of Sarah, his mother, and she became his wife. Isaac loved her very much, and so he was comforted after his mother’s death.
GEN.25.1	Abraham married again, and his new wife was Keturah. 
GEN.25.2	She gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
GEN.25.3	Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. Dedan’s descendants were the people of Assyria, Letush, and Leum. 
GEN.25.4	The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were descendants of Keturah. 
GEN.25.5	Abraham left everything he owned to Isaac. 
GEN.25.6	But before Abraham died, he did give gifts to the sons of his other wives, then sent them to the East to be away from Isaac.
GEN.25.7	Abraham lived to be one hundred seventy-five years old. 
GEN.25.8	He breathed his last breath and died at an old age, after a long and satisfying life. 
GEN.25.9	His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah in the field of Ephron east of Mamre. (Ephron was the son of Zohar the Hittite.) 
GEN.25.10	So Abraham was buried with his wife Sarah in the same field that he had bought from the Hittites. 
GEN.25.11	After Abraham died, God blessed his son Isaac. Isaac was now living at Beer Lahai Roi.
GEN.25.12	This is the family history of Ishmael, Abraham’s son. (Hagar, Sarah’s Egyptian servant, was Ishmael’s mother.) 
GEN.25.13	These are the names of Ishmael’s sons in the order they were born: Nebaioth, the first son, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
GEN.25.14	Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
GEN.25.15	Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
GEN.25.16	These were Ishmael’s sons, and these are the names of the tribal leaders listed according to their settlements and camps. 
GEN.25.17	Ishmael lived one hundred thirty-seven years and then breathed his last breath and died. 
GEN.25.18	His descendants lived from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt stretching toward Assyria. They often attacked the descendants of his brothers.
GEN.25.19	This is the family history of Isaac. Abraham had a son named Isaac. 
GEN.25.20	When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, who came from Northwest Mesopotamia. She was Bethuel’s daughter and the sister of Laban the Aramean. 
GEN.25.21	Isaac’s wife could not have children, so Isaac prayed to the L
GEN.25.22	While she was pregnant, the babies struggled inside her. She asked, “Why is this happening to me?” Then she went to get an answer from the L
GEN.25.23	The L
GEN.25.23	“Two nations are in your body,
GEN.25.23	and two groups of people will be taken from you.
GEN.25.23	One group will be stronger than the other,
GEN.25.23	and the older will serve the younger.”
GEN.25.24	When the time came, Rebekah gave birth to twins. 
GEN.25.25	The first baby was born red. Since his skin was like a hairy robe, he was named Esau. 
GEN.25.26	When the second baby was born, he was holding on to Esau’s heel, so that baby was named Jacob. Isaac was sixty years old when they were born.
GEN.25.27	When the boys grew up, Esau became a skilled hunter. He loved to be out in the fields. But Jacob was a quiet man and stayed among the tents. 
GEN.25.28	Isaac loved Esau because he hunted the wild animals that Isaac enjoyed eating. But Rebekah loved Jacob.
GEN.25.29	One day Jacob was boiling a pot of vegetable soup. Esau came in from hunting in the fields, weak from hunger. 
GEN.25.30	So Esau said to Jacob, “Let me eat some of that red soup, because I am weak with hunger.” (That is why people call him Edom.)
GEN.25.31	But Jacob said, “You must sell me your rights as the firstborn son.”
GEN.25.32	Esau said, “I am almost dead from hunger. If I die, all of my father’s wealth will not help me.”
GEN.25.33	But Jacob said, “First, promise me that you will give it to me.” So Esau made a promise to Jacob and sold his part of their father’s wealth to Jacob. 
GEN.25.34	Then Jacob gave Esau bread and vegetable soup, and he ate and drank, and then left. So Esau showed how little he cared about his rights as the firstborn son.
GEN.26.1	Now there was a time of hunger in the land, besides the time of hunger that happened during Abraham’s life. So Isaac went to the town of Gerar to see Abimelech king of the Philistines. 
GEN.26.2	The L
GEN.26.3	Stay in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. I will give you and your descendants all these lands, and I will keep the oath I made to Abraham your father. 
GEN.26.4	I will give you many descendants, as hard to count as the stars in the sky, and I will give them all these lands. Through your descendants all the nations on the earth will be blessed. 
GEN.26.5	I will do this because your father Abraham obeyed me. He did what I said and obeyed my commands, my teachings, and my rules.”
GEN.26.6	So Isaac stayed in Gerar. 
GEN.26.7	His wife Rebekah was very beautiful, and the men of that place asked Isaac about her. Isaac said, “She is my sister,” because he was afraid to tell them she was his wife. He thought they might kill him so they could have her.
GEN.26.8	Isaac lived there a long time. One day as Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out his window, he saw Isaac holding his wife Rebekah tenderly. 
GEN.26.9	Abimelech called for Isaac and said, “This woman is your wife. Why did you say she was your sister?”
GEN.26.9	Isaac said to him, “I was afraid you would kill me so you could have her.”
GEN.26.10	Abimelech said, “What have you done to us? One of our men might have had sexual relations with your wife. Then we would have been guilty of a great sin.”
GEN.26.11	So Abimelech warned everyone, “Anyone who touches this man or his wife will be put to death.”
GEN.26.12	Isaac planted seed in that land, and that year he gathered a great harvest. The L
GEN.26.13	and he became rich. He gathered more wealth until he became a very rich man. 
GEN.26.14	He had so many slaves and flocks and herds that the Philistines envied him. 
GEN.26.15	So they stopped up all the wells the servants of Isaac’s father Abraham had dug. (They had dug them when Abraham was alive.) The Philistines filled those wells with dirt. 
GEN.26.16	And Abimelech said to Isaac, “Leave our country because you have become much more powerful than we are.”
GEN.26.17	So Isaac left that place and camped in the Valley of Gerar and lived there. 
GEN.26.18	Long before this time Abraham had dug many wells, but after he died, the Philistines filled them with dirt. So Isaac dug those wells again and gave them the same names his father had given them. 
GEN.26.19	Isaac’s servants dug a well in the valley, from which a spring of water flowed. 
GEN.26.20	But the herdsmen of Gerar argued with them and said, “This water is ours.” So Isaac named that well Argue because they argued with him. 
GEN.26.21	Then his servants dug another well. When the people also argued about it, Isaac named that well Fight. 
GEN.26.22	He moved from there and dug another well. No one argued about this one, so he named it Room Enough. Isaac said, “Now the L
GEN.26.23	From there Isaac went to Beersheba. 
GEN.26.24	The L
GEN.26.25	So Isaac built an altar and worshiped the L
GEN.26.26	Abimelech came from Gerar to see Isaac. He brought with him Ahuzzath, who advised him, and Phicol, the commander of his army. 
GEN.26.27	Isaac asked them, “Why have you come to see me? You were my enemy and forced me to leave your country.”
GEN.26.28	They answered, “Now we know that the L
GEN.26.29	that since we did not hurt you, you will not hurt us. We were good to you and sent you away in peace. Now the L
GEN.26.30	So Isaac prepared food for them, and they all ate and drank. 
GEN.26.31	Early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other. Then Isaac sent them away, and they left in peace.
GEN.26.32	That day Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug, saying, “We found water in that well.” 
GEN.26.33	So Isaac named it Shibah and that city is called Beersheba even now.
GEN.26.34	When Esau was forty years old, he married two Hittite women—Judith daughter of Beeri and Basemath daughter of Elon. 
GEN.26.35	These women brought much sorrow to Isaac and Rebekah.
GEN.27.1	When Isaac was old, his eyesight was poor, so he could not see clearly. One day he called his older son Esau to him and said, “Son.”
GEN.27.1	Esau answered, “Here I am.”
GEN.27.2	Isaac said, “I am old and don’t know when I might die. 
GEN.27.3	So take your bow and arrows and go hunting in the field for an animal for me to eat. 
GEN.27.4	When you prepare the tasty food that I love, bring it to me, and I will eat. Then I will bless you before I die.” 
GEN.27.5	So Esau went out in the field to hunt.
GEN.27.5	Rebekah was listening as Isaac said this to his son Esau. 
GEN.27.6	She said to her son Jacob, “Listen, I heard your father saying to your brother Esau, 
GEN.27.7	‘Kill an animal and prepare some tasty food for me to eat. Then I will bless you in the presence of the L
GEN.27.8	So obey me, my son, and do what I tell you. 
GEN.27.9	Go out to our goats and bring me two of the best young ones. I will prepare them just the way your father likes them. 
GEN.27.10	Then you will take the food to your father, and he will bless you before he dies.”
GEN.27.11	But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, “My brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am smooth! 
GEN.27.12	If my father touches me, he will know I am not Esau. Then he will not bless me but will place a curse on me because I tried to trick him.”
GEN.27.13	So Rebekah said to him, “If your father puts a curse on you, I will accept the blame. Just do what I said. Go get the goats for me.”
GEN.27.14	So Jacob went out and got two goats and brought them to his mother, and she cooked them in the special way Isaac enjoyed. 
GEN.27.15	She took the best clothes of her older son Esau that were in the house and put them on the younger son Jacob. 
GEN.27.16	She also took the skins of the goats and put them on Jacob’s hands and neck. 
GEN.27.17	Then she gave Jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made.
GEN.27.18	Jacob went in to his father and said, “Father.”
GEN.27.18	And his father said, “Yes, my son. Who are you?”
GEN.27.19	Jacob said to him, “I am Esau, your first son. I have done what you told me. Now sit up and eat some meat of the animal I hunted for you. Then bless me.”
GEN.27.20	But Isaac asked his son, “How did you find and kill the animal so quickly?”
GEN.27.20	Jacob answered, “Because the L
GEN.27.21	Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Come near so I can touch you, my son. Then I will know if you are really my son Esau.”
GEN.27.22	So Jacob came near to Isaac his father. Isaac touched him and said, “Your voice sounds like Jacob’s voice, but your hands are hairy like the hands of Esau.” 
GEN.27.23	Isaac did not know it was Jacob, because his hands were hairy like Esau’s hands, so Isaac blessed him. 
GEN.27.24	Isaac asked, “Are you really my son Esau?”
GEN.27.24	Jacob answered, “Yes, I am.”
GEN.27.25	Then Isaac said, “Bring me the food, and I will eat it and bless you.” So Jacob gave him the food, and he ate. Jacob gave him wine, and he drank. 
GEN.27.26	Then Isaac said to him, “My son, come near and kiss me.” 
GEN.27.27	So Jacob went to his father and kissed him. When Isaac smelled Esau’s clothes, he blessed him and said,
GEN.27.27	“The smell of my son
GEN.27.27	is like the smell of the field
GEN.27.27	that the L
GEN.27.28	May God give you plenty of rain
GEN.27.28	and good soil
GEN.27.28	so that you will have plenty of grain and new wine.
GEN.27.29	May nations serve you
GEN.27.29	and peoples bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	May you be master over your brothers,
GEN.27.29	and may your mother’s sons bow down to you.
GEN.27.29	May everyone who curses you be cursed,
GEN.27.29	and may everyone who blesses you be blessed.”
GEN.27.30	Isaac finished blessing Jacob. Then, just as Jacob left his father Isaac, Esau came in from hunting. 
GEN.27.31	He also prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father. He said, “Father, rise and eat the food that your son killed for you and then bless me.”
GEN.27.32	Isaac asked, “Who are you?”
GEN.27.32	He answered, “I am your son—your firstborn son—Esau.”
GEN.27.33	Then Isaac trembled greatly and said, “Then who was it that hunted the animals and brought me food before you came? I ate it, and I blessed him, and it is too late now to take back my blessing.”
GEN.27.34	When Esau heard the words of his father, he let out a loud and bitter cry. He said to his father, “Bless me—me, too, my father!”
GEN.27.35	But Isaac said, “Your brother came and tricked me. He has taken your blessing.”
GEN.27.36	Esau said, “Jacob is the right name for him. He has tricked me these two times. He took away my share of everything you own, and now he has taken away my blessing.” Then Esau asked, “Haven’t you saved a blessing for me?”
GEN.27.37	Isaac answered, “I gave Jacob the power to be master over you, and all his brothers will be his servants. And I kept him strong with grain and new wine. There is nothing left to give you, my son.”
GEN.27.38	But Esau continued, “Do you have only one blessing, Father? Bless me, too, Father!” Then Esau began to cry out loud.
GEN.27.39	Isaac said to him,
GEN.27.39	“You will live far away from the best land,
GEN.27.39	far from the rain.
GEN.27.40	You will live by using your sword,
GEN.27.40	and you will be a slave to your brother.
GEN.27.40	But when you struggle,
GEN.27.40	you will break free from him.”
GEN.27.41	After that Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing from Isaac. He thought to himself, “My father will soon die, and I will be sad for him. Then I will kill Jacob.”
GEN.27.42	Rebekah heard about Esau’s plan to kill Jacob. So she sent for Jacob and said to him, “Listen, your brother Esau is comforting himself by planning to kill you. 
GEN.27.43	So, my son, do what I say. My brother Laban is living in Haran. Go to him at once! 
GEN.27.44	Stay with him for a while, until your brother is not so angry. 
GEN.27.45	In time, your brother will not be angry, and he will forget what you did to him. Then I will send a servant to bring you back. I don’t want to lose both of my sons on the same day.”
GEN.27.46	Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am tired of Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of these Hittite women here in this land, I want to die.”
GEN.28.1	Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and commanded him, “You must not marry a Canaanite woman. 
GEN.28.2	Go to the house of Bethuel, your mother’s father, in Northwest Mesopotamia. Laban, your mother’s brother, lives there. Marry one of his daughters. 
GEN.28.3	May God Almighty bless you and give you many children, and may you become a group of many peoples. 
GEN.28.4	May he give you and your descendants the blessing of Abraham so that you may own the land where you are now living as a stranger, the land God gave to Abraham.” 
GEN.28.5	So Isaac sent Jacob to Northwest Mesopotamia, to Laban the brother of Rebekah. Bethuel the Aramean was the father of Laban and Rebekah, and Rebekah was the mother of Jacob and Esau.
GEN.28.6	Esau learned that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Northwest Mesopotamia to find a wife there. He also learned that Isaac had commanded Jacob not to marry a Canaanite woman 
GEN.28.7	and that Jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to Northwest Mesopotamia. 
GEN.28.8	So Esau saw that his father Isaac did not want his sons to marry Canaanite women. 
GEN.28.9	Now Esau already had wives, but he went to Ishmael son of Abraham, and he married Mahalath, Ishmael’s daughter. Mahalath was the sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.28.10	Jacob left Beersheba and set out for Haran. 
GEN.28.11	When he came to a place, he spent the night there because the sun had set. He found a stone and laid his head on it to go to sleep. 
GEN.28.12	Jacob dreamed that there was a ladder resting on the earth and reaching up into heaven, and he saw angels of God going up and coming down the ladder. 
GEN.28.13	Then Jacob saw the L
GEN.28.14	Your descendants will be as many as the dust of the earth. They will spread west and east, north and south, and all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your descendants. 
GEN.28.15	I am with you and will protect you everywhere you go and will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.”
GEN.28.16	Then Jacob woke from his sleep and said, “Surely the L
GEN.28.17	He was afraid and said, “This place frightens me! It is surely the house of God and the gate of heaven.”
GEN.28.18	Jacob rose early in the morning and took the stone he had slept on and set it up on its end. Then he poured olive oil on the top of it. 
GEN.28.19	At first, the name of that city was Luz, but Jacob named it Bethel.
GEN.28.20	Then Jacob made a promise. He said, “I want God to be with me and to protect me on this journey. I want him to give me food to eat and clothes to wear 
GEN.28.21	so I will be able to return in peace to my father’s house. If the L
GEN.28.22	This stone which I have set up on its end will be the house of God. And I will give God one-tenth of all he gives me.”
GEN.29.1	Then Jacob continued his journey and came to the land of the people of the East. 
GEN.29.2	He looked and saw a well in the field and three flocks of sheep lying nearby, because they drank water from this well. A large stone covered the mouth of the well. 
GEN.29.3	When all the flocks would gather there, the shepherds would roll the stone away from the well and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place.
GEN.29.4	Jacob said to the shepherds there, “My brothers, where are you from?”
GEN.29.4	They answered, “We are from Haran.”
GEN.29.5	Then Jacob asked, “Do you know Laban, grandson of Nahor?”
GEN.29.5	They answered, “We know him.”
GEN.29.6	Then Jacob asked, “How is he?”
GEN.29.6	They answered, “He is well. Look, his daughter Rachel is coming now with his sheep.”
GEN.29.7	Jacob said, “But look, it is still the middle of the day. It is not time for the sheep to be gathered for the night, so give them water and let them go back into the pasture.”
GEN.29.8	But they said, “We cannot do that until all the flocks are gathered. Then we will roll away the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep.”
GEN.29.9	While Jacob was talking with the shepherds, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, because it was her job to care for the sheep. 
GEN.29.10	When Jacob saw Laban’s daughter Rachel and Laban’s sheep, he went to the well and rolled the stone from its mouth and watered Laban’s sheep. Now Laban was the brother of Rebekah, Jacob’s mother. 
GEN.29.11	Then Jacob kissed Rachel and cried. 
GEN.29.12	He told her that he was from her father’s family and that he was the son of Rebekah. So Rachel ran home and told her father.
GEN.29.13	When Laban heard the news about his sister’s son Jacob, he ran to meet him. Laban hugged him and kissed him and brought him to his house, where Jacob told Laban everything that had happened.
GEN.29.14	Then Laban said, “You are my own flesh and blood.”
GEN.29.14	Jacob stayed there a month. 
GEN.29.15	Then Laban said to Jacob, “You are my relative, but it is not right for you to work for me without pay. What would you like me to pay you?”
GEN.29.16	Now Laban had two daughters. The older was Leah, and the younger was Rachel. 
GEN.29.17	Leah had weak eyes, but Rachel was very beautiful. 
GEN.29.18	Jacob loved Rachel, so he said to Laban, “Let me marry your younger daughter Rachel. If you will, I will work seven years for you.”
GEN.29.19	Laban said, “It would be better for her to marry you than someone else, so stay here with me.” 
GEN.29.20	So Jacob worked for Laban seven years so he could marry Rachel. But they seemed like just a few days to him because he loved Rachel very much.
GEN.29.21	After seven years Jacob said to Laban, “Give me Rachel so that I may marry her. The time I promised to work for you is over.”
GEN.29.22	So Laban gave a feast for all the people there. 
GEN.29.23	That evening he brought his daughter Leah to Jacob, and they had sexual relations. 
GEN.29.24	(Laban gave his slave girl Zilpah to his daughter to be her servant.) 
GEN.29.25	In the morning when Jacob saw that he had had sexual relations with Leah, he said to Laban, “What have you done to me? I worked hard for you so that I could marry Rachel! Why did you trick me?”
GEN.29.26	Laban said, “In our country we do not allow the younger daughter to marry before the older daughter. 
GEN.29.27	But complete the full week of the marriage ceremony with Leah, and I will give you Rachel to marry also. But you must serve me another seven years.”
GEN.29.28	So Jacob did this, and when he had completed the week with Leah, Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as a wife. 
GEN.29.29	(Laban gave his slave girl Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her servant.) 
GEN.29.30	So Jacob had sexual relations with Rachel also, and Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah. Jacob worked for Laban for another seven years.
GEN.29.31	When the L
GEN.29.32	Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben, because she said, “The L
GEN.29.33	Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She named him Simeon and said, “The L
GEN.29.34	Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She named him Levi and said, “Now, surely my husband will be close to me, because I have given him three sons.”
GEN.29.35	Then Leah gave birth to another son. She named him Judah, because she said, “Now I will praise the L
GEN.30.1	When Rachel saw that she was not having children for Jacob, she envied her sister Leah. She said to Jacob, “Give me children, or I’ll die!” 
GEN.30.2	Jacob became angry with her and said, “Can I do what only God can do? He is the one who has kept you from having children.”
GEN.30.3	Then Rachel said, “Here is my slave girl Bilhah. Have sexual relations with her so she can give birth to a child for me. Then I can have my own family through her.”
GEN.30.4	So Rachel gave Bilhah, her slave girl, to Jacob as a wife, and he had sexual relations with her. 
GEN.30.5	She became pregnant and gave Jacob a son. 
GEN.30.6	Rachel said, “God has judged me innocent. He has listened to my prayer and has given me a son,” so she named him Dan.
GEN.30.7	Bilhah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a second son. 
GEN.30.8	Rachel said, “I have struggled hard with my sister, and I have won.” So she named that son Naphtali.
GEN.30.9	Leah saw that she had stopped having children, so she gave her slave girl Zilpah to Jacob as a wife. 
GEN.30.10	When Zilpah had a son, 
GEN.30.11	Leah said, “I am lucky,” so she named him Gad. 
GEN.30.12	Zilpah gave birth to another son, 
GEN.30.13	and Leah said, “I am very happy! Now women will call me happy,” so she named him Asher.
GEN.30.14	During the wheat harvest Reuben went into the field and found some mandrake plants and brought them to his mother Leah. But Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.15	Leah answered, “You have already taken away my husband, and now you are trying to take away my son’s mandrakes.”
GEN.30.15	But Rachel answered, “If you will give me your son’s mandrakes, you may sleep with Jacob tonight.”
GEN.30.16	When Jacob came in from the field that night, Leah went out to meet him. She said, “You will have sexual relations with me tonight because I have paid for you with my son’s mandrakes.” So Jacob slept with her that night.
GEN.30.17	Then God answered Leah’s prayer, and she became pregnant again. She gave birth to a fifth son 
GEN.30.18	and said, “God has given me what I paid for, because I gave my slave girl to my husband.” So Leah named her son Issachar.
GEN.30.19	Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son. 
GEN.30.20	She said, “God has given me a fine gift. Now surely Jacob will honor me, because I have given him six sons,” so she named him Zebulun. 
GEN.30.21	Later Leah gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
GEN.30.22	Then God remembered Rachel and answered her prayer, making it possible for her to have children. 
GEN.30.23	When she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, she said, “God has taken away my shame,” 
GEN.30.24	and she named him Joseph. Rachel said, “I wish the L
GEN.30.25	After the birth of Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Now let me go to my own home and country. 
GEN.30.26	Give me my wives and my children and let me go. I have earned them by working for you, and you know that I have served you well.”
GEN.30.27	Laban said to him, “If I have pleased you, please stay. I know the L
GEN.30.28	Tell me what I should pay you, and I will give it to you.”
GEN.30.29	Jacob answered, “You know that I have worked hard for you, and your flocks have grown while I cared for them. 
GEN.30.30	When I came, you had little, but now you have much. Every time I did something for you, the L
GEN.30.31	Laban asked, “Then what should I give you?”
GEN.30.31	Jacob answered, “I don’t want you to give me anything. Just do this one thing, and I will come back and take care of your flocks. 
GEN.30.32	Today let me go through all your flocks. I will take every speckled or spotted sheep, every black lamb, and every spotted or speckled goat. That will be my pay. 
GEN.30.33	In the future you can easily see if I am honest. When you come to look at my flocks, if I have any goat that isn’t speckled or spotted or any lamb that isn’t black, you will know I stole it.”
GEN.30.34	Laban answered, “Agreed! We will do what you ask.” 
GEN.30.35	But that day Laban took away all the male goats that had streaks or spots, all the speckled and spotted female goats (all those that had white on them), and all the black sheep. He told his sons to watch over them. 
GEN.30.36	Then he took these animals to a place that was three days’ journey away from Jacob. Jacob took care of all the flocks that were left.
GEN.30.37	So Jacob cut green branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled off some of the bark so that the branches had white stripes on them. 
GEN.30.38	He put the branches in front of the flocks at the watering places. When the animals came to drink, they also mated there, 
GEN.30.39	so the flocks mated in front of the branches. Then the young that were born were streaked, speckled, or spotted. 
GEN.30.40	Jacob separated the young animals from the others, and he made them face the streaked and dark animals in Laban’s flock. Jacob kept his animals separate from Laban’s. 
GEN.30.41	When the stronger animals in the flock were mating, Jacob put the branches before their eyes so they would mate near the branches. 
GEN.30.42	But when the weaker animals mated, Jacob did not put the branches there. So the animals born from the weaker animals were Laban’s, and those born from the stronger animals were Jacob’s. 
GEN.30.43	In this way Jacob became very rich. He had large flocks, many male and female servants, camels, and donkeys.
GEN.31.1	One day Jacob heard Laban’s sons talking. They said, “Jacob has taken everything our father owned, and in this way he has become rich.” 
GEN.31.2	Then Jacob noticed that Laban was not as friendly as he had been before. 
GEN.31.3	The L
GEN.31.4	So Jacob told Rachel and Leah to meet him in the field where he kept his flocks. 
GEN.31.5	He said to them, “I have seen that your father is not as friendly with me as he used to be, but the God of my father has been with me. 
GEN.31.6	You both know that I have worked as hard as I could for your father, 
GEN.31.7	but he cheated me and changed my pay ten times. But God has not allowed your father to harm me. 
GEN.31.8	When Laban said, ‘You can have all the speckled animals as your pay,’ all the animals gave birth to speckled young ones. But when he said, ‘You can have all the streaked animals as your pay,’ all the flocks gave birth to streaked babies. 
GEN.31.9	So God has taken the animals away from your father and has given them to me.
GEN.31.10	“I had a dream during the season when the flocks were mating. I saw that the only male goats who were mating were streaked, speckled, or spotted. 
GEN.31.11	The angel of God spoke to me in that dream and said, ‘Jacob!’ I answered, ‘Yes!’ 
GEN.31.12	The angel said, ‘Look! Only the streaked, speckled, or spotted male goats are mating. I have seen all the wrong things Laban has been doing to you. 
GEN.31.13	I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel, where you poured olive oil on the stone you set up on end and where you made a promise to me. Now I want you to leave here and go back to the land where you were born.’ ”
GEN.31.14	Rachel and Leah answered Jacob, “Our father has nothing to give us when he dies. 
GEN.31.15	He has treated us like strangers. He sold us to you, and then he spent all of the money you paid for us. 
GEN.31.16	God took all this wealth from our father, and now it belongs to us and our children. So do whatever God has told you to do.”
GEN.31.17	So Jacob put his children and his wives on camels, 
GEN.31.18	and they began their journey back to Isaac, his father, in the land of Canaan. All the flocks of animals that Jacob owned walked ahead of them. He carried everything with him that he had gotten while he lived in Northwest Mesopotamia.
GEN.31.19	While Laban was gone to cut the wool from his sheep, Rachel stole the idols that belonged to him. 
GEN.31.20	And Jacob tricked Laban the Aramean by not telling him he was leaving. 
GEN.31.21	Jacob and his family left quickly, crossed the Euphrates River, and traveled toward the mountains of Gilead.
GEN.31.22	Three days later Laban learned that Jacob had run away, 
GEN.31.23	so he gathered his relatives and began to chase him. After seven days Laban found him in the mountains of Gilead. 
GEN.31.24	That night God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream and said, “Be careful! Do not say anything to Jacob, good or bad.”
GEN.31.25	So Laban caught up with Jacob. Now Jacob had made his camp in the mountains, so Laban and his relatives set up their camp in the mountains of Gilead. 
GEN.31.26	Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? You cheated me and took my daughters as if you had captured them in a war. 
GEN.31.27	Why did you run away secretly and trick me? Why didn’t you tell me? Then I could have sent you away with joy and singing and with the music of tambourines and harps. 
GEN.31.28	You did not even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good-bye. You were very foolish to do this! 
GEN.31.29	I have the power to harm you, but last night the God of your father spoke to me and warned me not to say anything to you, good or bad. 
GEN.31.30	I know you want to go back to your home, but why did you steal my idols?”
GEN.31.31	Jacob answered Laban, “I left without telling you, because I was afraid you would take your daughters away from me. 
GEN.31.32	If you find anyone here who has taken your idols, that person will be killed! Your relatives will be my witnesses. You may look for anything that belongs to you and take anything that is yours.” (Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen Laban’s idols.)
GEN.31.33	So Laban looked in Jacob’s tent, in Leah’s tent, and in the tent where the two slave women stayed, but he did not find his idols. When he left Leah’s tent, he went into Rachel’s tent. 
GEN.31.34	Rachel had hidden the idols inside her camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. Although Laban looked through the whole tent, he did not find them.
GEN.31.35	Rachel said to her father, “Father, don’t be angry with me. I am not able to stand up before you because I am having my monthly period.” So Laban looked through the camp, but he did not find his idols.
GEN.31.36	Then Jacob became very angry and said, “What wrong have I done? What law have I broken to cause you to chase me? 
GEN.31.37	You have looked through everything I own, but you have found nothing that belongs to you. If you have found anything, show it to everyone. Put it in front of your relatives and my relatives, and let them decide which one of us is right. 
GEN.31.38	I have worked for you now for twenty years. During all that time none of the lambs and kids died during birth, and I have not eaten any of the male sheep from your flocks. 
GEN.31.39	Any time an animal was killed by wild beasts, I did not bring it to you, but made up for the loss myself. You made me pay for any animal that was stolen during the day or night. 
GEN.31.40	In the daytime the sun took away my strength, and at night I was cold and could not sleep. 
GEN.31.41	I worked like a slave for you for twenty years—the first fourteen to get your two daughters and the last six to earn your flocks. During that time you changed my pay ten times. 
GEN.31.42	But the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac, was with me. Otherwise, you would have sent me away with nothing. But he saw the trouble I had and the hard work I did, and last night he corrected you.”
GEN.31.43	Laban said to Jacob, “These girls are my daughters. Their children belong to me, and these flocks are mine. Everything you see here belongs to me, but I can do nothing to keep my daughters and their children. 
GEN.31.44	Let us make an agreement, and let us set up a pile of stones to remind us of it.”
GEN.31.45	So Jacob took a large rock and set it up on its end. 
GEN.31.46	He told his relatives to gather rocks, so they took the rocks and piled them up; then they ate beside the pile. 
GEN.31.47	Laban named that place in his language A Pile to Remind Us, and Jacob gave the place the same name in Hebrew.
GEN.31.48	Laban said to Jacob, “This pile of rocks will remind us of the agreement between us.” That is why the place was called A Pile to Remind Us. 
GEN.31.49	It was also called Mizpah, because Laban said, “Let the L
GEN.31.50	Remember that God is our witness even if no one else is around us. He will know if you harm my daughters or marry other women. 
GEN.31.51	Here is the pile of rocks that I have put between us and here is the rock I set up on end. 
GEN.31.52	This pile of rocks and this rock set on end will remind us of our agreement. I will never go past this pile to hurt you, and you must never come to my side of them to hurt me. 
GEN.31.53	Let the God of Abraham, who is the God of Nahor and the God of their ancestors, punish either of us if we break this agreement.”
GEN.31.53	So Jacob made a promise in the name of the God whom his father Isaac worshiped. 
GEN.31.54	Then Jacob killed an animal and offered it as a sacrifice on the mountain, and he invited his relatives to share in the meal. After they finished eating, they spent the night on the mountain. 
GEN.31.55	Early the next morning Laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them, and then he left to return home.
GEN.32.1	When Jacob also went his way, the angels of God met him. 
GEN.32.2	When he saw them, he said, “This is the camp of God!” So he named that place Mahanaim.
GEN.32.3	Jacob’s brother Esau was living in the area called Seir in the country of Edom. Jacob sent messengers to Esau, 
GEN.32.4	telling them, “Give this message to my master Esau: ‘This is what Jacob, your servant, says: I have lived with Laban and have remained there until now. 
GEN.32.5	I have cattle, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants. I send this message to you and ask you to accept us.’ ”
GEN.32.6	The messengers returned to Jacob and said, “We went to your brother Esau. He is coming to meet you and has four hundred men with him.”
GEN.32.7	Then Jacob was very afraid and worried. He divided the people who were with him and all the flocks, herds, and camels into two camps. 
GEN.32.8	Jacob thought, “Esau might come and destroy one camp, but the other camp can run away and be saved.”
GEN.32.9	Then Jacob said, “God of my father Abraham! God of my father Isaac! L
GEN.32.10	I am not worthy of the kindness and continual goodness you have shown me. The first time I traveled across the Jordan River, I had only my walking stick, but now I own enough to have two camps. 
GEN.32.11	Please save me from my brother Esau. I am afraid he will come and kill all of us, even the mothers with the children. 
GEN.32.12	You said to me, ‘I will treat you well and will make your children as many as the sand of the seashore. There will be too many to count.’ ”
GEN.32.13	Jacob stayed there for the night and prepared a gift for Esau from what he had with him: 
GEN.32.14	two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred female sheep and twenty male sheep, 
GEN.32.15	thirty female camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten male donkeys. 
GEN.32.16	Jacob gave each separate flock of animals to one of his servants and said to them, “Go ahead of me and keep some space between each herd.” 
GEN.32.17	Jacob gave them their orders. To the servant with the first group of animals he said, “My brother Esau will come to you and ask, ‘Whose servant are you? Where are you going and whose animals are these?’ 
GEN.32.18	Then you will answer, ‘They belong to your servant Jacob. He sent them as a gift to you, my master Esau, and he also is coming behind us.’ ”
GEN.32.19	Jacob ordered the second servant, the third servant, and all the other servants to do the same thing. He said, “Say the same thing to Esau when you meet him. 
GEN.32.20	Say, ‘Your servant Jacob is coming behind us.’ ” Jacob thought, “If I send these gifts ahead of me, maybe Esau will forgive me. Then when I see him, perhaps he will accept me.” 
GEN.32.21	So Jacob sent the gifts to Esau, but he himself stayed that night in the camp.
GEN.32.22	During the night Jacob rose and crossed the Jabbok River at the crossing, taking with him his two wives, his two slave girls, and his eleven sons. 
GEN.32.23	He sent his family and everything he had across the river. 
GEN.32.24	So Jacob was alone, and a man came and wrestled with him until the sun came up. 
GEN.32.25	When the man saw he could not defeat Jacob, he struck Jacob’s hip and put it out of joint. 
GEN.32.26	Then he said to Jacob, “Let me go. The sun is coming up.”
GEN.32.26	But Jacob said, “I will let you go if you will bless me.”
GEN.32.27	The man said to him, “What is your name?”
GEN.32.27	And he answered, “Jacob.”
GEN.32.28	Then the man said, “Your name will no longer be Jacob. Your name will now be Israel, because you have wrestled with God and with people, and you have won.”
GEN.32.29	Then Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.”
GEN.32.29	But the man said, “Why do you ask my name?” Then he blessed Jacob there.
GEN.32.30	So Jacob named that place Peniel, saying, “I have seen God face to face, but my life was saved.” 
GEN.32.31	Then the sun rose as he was leaving that place, and Jacob was limping because of his leg. 
GEN.32.32	So even today the people of Israel do not eat the muscle that is on the hip joint of animals, because Jacob was touched there.
GEN.33.1	Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming, and with him were four hundred men. So Jacob divided his children among Leah, Rachel, and the two slave girls. 
GEN.33.2	Jacob put the slave girls with their children first, then Leah and her children behind them, and Rachel and Joseph last. 
GEN.33.3	Jacob himself went out in front of them and bowed down flat on the ground seven times as he was walking toward his brother.
GEN.33.4	But Esau ran to meet Jacob and put his arms around him and hugged him. Then Esau kissed him, and they both cried. 
GEN.33.5	When Esau looked up and saw the women and children, he asked, “Who are these people with you?”
GEN.33.5	Jacob answered, “These are the children God has given me. God has been good to me, your servant.”
GEN.33.6	Then the two slave girls and their children came up to Esau and bowed down flat on the earth before him. 
GEN.33.7	Leah and her children also came up to Esau and also bowed down flat on the earth. Last of all, Joseph and Rachel came up to Esau, and they, too, bowed down flat before him.
GEN.33.8	Esau said, “I saw many herds as I was coming here. Why did you bring them?”
GEN.33.8	Jacob answered, “They were to please you, my master.”
GEN.33.9	But Esau said, “I already have enough, my brother. Keep what you have.”
GEN.33.10	Jacob said, “No! Please! If I have pleased you, then accept the gift I give you. I am very happy to see your face again. It is like seeing the face of God, because you have accepted me. 
GEN.33.11	So I beg you to accept the gift I give you. God has been very good to me, and I have more than I need.” And because Jacob begged, Esau accepted the gift.
GEN.33.12	Then Esau said, “Let us be going. I will travel with you.”
GEN.33.13	But Jacob said to him, “My master, you know that the children are weak. And I must be careful with my flocks and their young ones. If I force them to go too far in one day, all the animals will die. 
GEN.33.14	So, my master, you go on ahead of me, your servant. I will follow you slowly and let the animals and the children set the speed at which we travel. I will meet you, my master, in Edom.”
GEN.33.15	So Esau said, “Then let me leave some of my people with you.”
GEN.33.15	“No, thank you,” said Jacob. “I only want to please you, my master.” 
GEN.33.16	So that day Esau started back to Edom. 
GEN.33.17	But Jacob went to Succoth, where he built a house for himself and shelters for his animals. That is why the place was named Succoth.
GEN.33.18	Jacob left Northwest Mesopotamia and arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan. There he camped east of the city. 
GEN.33.19	He bought a part of the field where he had camped from the sons of Hamor father of Shechem for one hundred pieces of silver. 
GEN.33.20	He built an altar there and named it after God, the God of Israel.
GEN.34.1	At this time Dinah, the daughter of Leah and Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land. 
GEN.34.2	When Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of the land, saw her, he took her and forced her to have sexual relations with him. 
GEN.34.3	Shechem fell in love with Dinah, and he spoke kindly to her. 
GEN.34.4	He told his father, Hamor, “Please get this girl for me so I can marry her.”
GEN.34.5	Jacob learned how Shechem had disgraced his daughter, but since his sons were out in the field with the cattle, Jacob said nothing until they came home. 
GEN.34.6	While he waited, Hamor father of Shechem went to talk with Jacob.
GEN.34.7	When Jacob’s sons heard what had happened, they came in from the field. They were very angry that Shechem had done such a wicked thing to Israel. It was wrong for him to have sexual relations with Jacob’s daughter; a thing like this should not be done.
GEN.34.8	But Hamor talked to Dinah’s brothers and said, “My son Shechem is deeply in love with Dinah. Please let him marry her. 
GEN.34.9	Marry our people. Give your women to our men as wives and take our women for your men as wives. 
GEN.34.10	You can live in the same land with us. You will be free to own land and to trade here.”
GEN.34.11	Shechem also talked to Jacob and to Dinah’s brothers and said, “Please accept my offer. I will give anything you ask. 
GEN.34.12	Ask as much as you want for the payment for the bride, and I will give it to you. Just let me marry Dinah.”
GEN.34.13	Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and his father with lies, because Shechem had disgraced their sister Dinah. 
GEN.34.14	The brothers said to them, “We cannot allow you to marry our sister, because you are not circumcised. That would be a disgrace to us. 
GEN.34.15	But we will allow you to marry her if you do this one thing: Every man in your town must be circumcised like us. 
GEN.34.16	Then your men can marry our women, and our men can marry your women, and we will live in your land and become one people. 
GEN.34.17	If you refuse to be circumcised, we will take Dinah and leave.”
GEN.34.18	What they asked seemed fair to Hamor and Shechem. 
GEN.34.19	So Shechem quickly went to be circumcised because he loved Jacob’s daughter.
GEN.34.19	Now Shechem was the most respected man in his family. 
GEN.34.20	So Hamor and Shechem went to the gate of their city and spoke to the men of their city, saying, 
GEN.34.21	“These people want to be friends with us. So let them live in our land and trade here. There is enough land for all of us. Let us marry their women, and we can let them marry our women. 
GEN.34.22	But we must agree to one thing: All our men must be circumcised as they are. Then they will agree to live in our land, and we will be one people. 
GEN.34.23	If we do this, their cattle and their animals will belong to us. Let us do what they say, and they will stay in our land.” 
GEN.34.24	All the people who had come to the city gate heard this. They agreed with Hamor and Shechem, and every man was circumcised.
GEN.34.25	Three days later the men who were circumcised were still in pain. Two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi (Dinah’s brothers), took their swords and made a surprise attack on the city, killing all the men there. 
GEN.34.26	They killed Hamor and his son Shechem and then took Dinah out of Shechem’s house and left. 
GEN.34.27	Jacob’s sons came upon the dead bodies and stole everything that was in the city, to pay them back for what Shechem had done to their sister. 
GEN.34.28	So the brothers took the flocks, herds, and donkeys, and everything in the city and in the fields. 
GEN.34.29	They took every valuable thing the people owned, even their wives and children and everything in the houses.
GEN.34.30	Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have caused me a lot of trouble. Now the Canaanites and the Perizzites who live in the land will hate me. Since there are only a few of us, if they join together to attack us, my people and I will be destroyed.”
GEN.34.31	But the brothers said, “We will not allow our sister to be treated like a prostitute.”
GEN.35.1	God said to Jacob, “Go to the city of Bethel and live there. Make an altar to the God who appeared to you there when you were running away from your brother Esau.”
GEN.35.2	So Jacob said to his family and to all who were with him, “Put away the foreign gods you have, and make yourselves clean, and change your clothes. 
GEN.35.3	We will leave here and go to Bethel. There I will build an altar to God, who has helped me during my time of trouble. He has been with me everywhere I have gone.” 
GEN.35.4	So they gave Jacob all the foreign gods they had, and the earrings they were wearing, and he hid them under the great tree near the town of Shechem. 
GEN.35.5	Then Jacob and his sons left there. But God caused the people in the nearby cities to be afraid, so they did not follow them. 
GEN.35.6	And Jacob and all the people who were with him went to Luz, which is now called Bethel, in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.35.7	There Jacob built an altar and named the place Bethel, after God, because God had appeared to him there when he was running from his brother.
GEN.35.8	Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried under the oak tree at Bethel, so they named that place Oak of Crying.
GEN.35.9	When Jacob came back from Northwest Mesopotamia, God appeared to him again and blessed him. 
GEN.35.10	God said to him, “Your name is Jacob, but you will not be called Jacob any longer. Your new name will be Israel.” So he called him Israel. 
GEN.35.11	God said to him, “I am God Almighty. Have many children and grow in number as a nation. You will be the ancestor of many nations and kings. 
GEN.35.12	The same land I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you and your descendants.” 
GEN.35.13	Then God left him. 
GEN.35.14	Jacob set up a stone on edge in that place where God had talked to him, and he poured a drink offering and olive oil on it to make it special for God. 
GEN.35.15	And Jacob named the place Bethel.
GEN.35.16	Jacob and his group left Bethel. Before they came to Ephrath, Rachel began giving birth to her baby, 
GEN.35.17	but she was having much trouble. When Rachel’s nurse saw this, she said, “Don’t be afraid, Rachel. You are giving birth to another son.” 
GEN.35.18	Rachel gave birth to the son, but she herself died. As she lay dying, she named the boy Son of My Suffering, but Jacob called him Benjamin.
GEN.35.19	Rachel was buried on the road to Ephrath, a district of Bethlehem, 
GEN.35.20	and Jacob set up a rock on her grave to honor her. That rock is still there. 
GEN.35.21	Then Israel continued his journey and camped just south of Migdal Eder.
GEN.35.22	While Israel was there, Reuben had sexual relations with Israel’s slave woman Bilhah, and Israel heard about it.
GEN.35.22	Jacob had twelve sons. 
GEN.35.23	He had six sons by his wife Leah: Reuben, his first son, then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
GEN.35.24	He had two sons by his wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.
GEN.35.25	He had two sons by Rachel’s slave girl Bilhah: Dan and Naphtali.
GEN.35.26	And he had two sons by Leah’s slave girl Zilpah: Gad and Asher.
GEN.35.26	These are Jacob’s sons who were born in Northwest Mesopotamia.
GEN.35.27	Jacob went to his father Isaac at Mamre near Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac had lived. 
GEN.35.28	Isaac lived one hundred eighty years. 
GEN.35.29	So Isaac breathed his last breath and died when he was very old, and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.
GEN.36.1	This is the family history of Esau (also called Edom). 
GEN.36.2	Esau married women from the land of Canaan: Adah daughter of Elon the Hittite; and Oholibamah daughter of Anah, the son of Zibeon the Hivite; 
GEN.36.3	and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, the sister of Nebaioth.
GEN.36.4	Adah gave birth to Eliphaz for Esau. Basemath gave him Reuel, 
GEN.36.5	and Oholibamah gave him Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were Esau’s sons who were born in the land of Canaan.
GEN.36.6	Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the people who lived with him, his herds and other animals, and all the belongings he had gotten in Canaan, and he went to a land away from his brother Jacob. 
GEN.36.7	Esau and Jacob’s belongings were becoming too many for them to live in the same land. The land where they had lived could not support both of them, because they had too many herds. 
GEN.36.8	So Esau lived in the mountains of Edom. (Esau is also named Edom.)
GEN.36.9	This is the family history of Esau. He is the ancestor of the Edomites, who live in the mountains of Edom.
GEN.36.10	Esau’s sons were Eliphaz, son of Adah and Esau, and Reuel, son of Basemath and Esau.
GEN.36.11	Eliphaz had five sons: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 
GEN.36.12	Eliphaz also had a slave woman named Timna, and Timna and Eliphaz gave birth to Amalek. These were Esau’s grandsons by his wife Adah.
GEN.36.13	Reuel had four sons: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were Esau’s grandsons by his wife Basemath.
GEN.36.14	Esau’s third wife was Oholibamah the daughter of Anah. (Anah was the son of Zibeon.) Esau and Oholibamah gave birth to Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
GEN.36.15	These were the leaders that came from Esau: Esau’s first son was Eliphaz. From him came these leaders: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
GEN.36.16	Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These were the leaders that came from Eliphaz in the land of Edom. They were the grandsons of Adah.
GEN.36.17	Esau’s son Reuel was the father of these leaders: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the leaders that came from Reuel in the land of Edom. They were the grandsons of Esau’s wife Basemath.
GEN.36.18	Esau’s wife Oholibamah gave birth to these leaders: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the leaders that came from Esau’s wife Oholibamah the daughter of Anah. 
GEN.36.19	These were the sons of Esau (also called Edom), and these were their leaders.
GEN.36.20	These were the sons of Seir the Horite, who were living in the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.21	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These sons of Seir were the leaders of the Horites in Edom.
GEN.36.22	The sons of Lotan were Hori and Homam. (Timna was Lotan’s sister.)
GEN.36.23	The sons of Shobal were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
GEN.36.24	The sons of Zibeon were Aiah and Anah. Anah is the man who found the hot springs in the desert while he was caring for his father’s donkeys.
GEN.36.25	The children of Anah were Dishon and Oholibamah daughter of Anah.
GEN.36.26	The sons of Dishon were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran.
GEN.36.27	The sons of Ezer were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
GEN.36.28	The sons of Dishan were Uz and Aran.
GEN.36.29	These were the names of the Horite leaders: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
GEN.36.30	Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.
GEN.36.30	These men were the leaders of the Horite families who lived in the land of Edom.
GEN.36.31	These are the kings who ruled in the land of Edom before the Israelites ever had a king:
GEN.36.32	Bela son of Beor was the king of Edom. He came from the city of Dinhabah.
GEN.36.33	When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah became king. Jobab was from Bozrah.
GEN.36.34	When Jobab died, Husham became king. He was from the land of the Temanites.
GEN.36.35	When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad, who had defeated Midian in the country of Moab, became king. Hadad was from the city of Avith.
GEN.36.36	When Hadad died, Samlah became king. He was from Masrekah.
GEN.36.37	When Samlah died, Shaul became king. He was from Rehoboth on the Euphrates River.
GEN.36.38	When Shaul died, Baal-Hanan son of Acbor became king.
GEN.36.39	When Baal-Hanan son of Acbor died, Hadad became king. He was from the city of Pau. His wife’s name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, who was the daughter of Me-Zahab.
GEN.36.40	These Edomite leaders, listed by their families and regions, came from Esau. Their names were Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
GEN.36.41	Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
GEN.36.42	Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
GEN.36.43	Magdiel, and Iram. They were the leaders of Edom. (Esau was the father of the Edomites.) The area where each of these families lived was named after that family.
GEN.37.1	Jacob lived in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived. 
GEN.37.2	This is the family history of Jacob:
GEN.37.2	Joseph was a young man, seventeen years old. He and his brothers, the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s wives, cared for the flocks. Joseph gave his father bad reports about his brothers. 
GEN.37.3	Since Joseph was born when his father Israel was old, Israel loved him more than his other sons. He made Joseph a special robe with long sleeves. 
GEN.37.4	When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father loved him more than he loved them, they hated their brother and could not speak to him politely.
GEN.37.5	One time Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him even more. 
GEN.37.6	Joseph said, “Listen to the dream I had. 
GEN.37.7	We were in the field tying bundles of wheat together. My bundle stood up, and your bundles of wheat gathered around it and bowed down to it.”
GEN.37.8	His brothers said, “Do you really think you will be king over us? Do you truly think you will rule over us?” His brothers hated him even more because of his dreams and what he had said.
GEN.37.9	Then Joseph had another dream, and he told his brothers about it also. He said, “Listen, I had another dream. I saw the sun, moon, and eleven stars bowing down to me.”
GEN.37.10	Joseph also told his father about this dream, but his father scolded him, saying, “What kind of dream is this? Do you really believe that your mother, your brothers, and I will bow down to you?” 
GEN.37.11	Joseph’s brothers were jealous of him, but his father thought about what all these things could mean.
GEN.37.12	One day Joseph’s brothers went to Shechem to graze their father’s flocks. 
GEN.37.13	Israel said to Joseph, “Go to Shechem where your brothers are grazing the flocks.”
GEN.37.13	Joseph answered, “I will go.”
GEN.37.14	His father said, “Go and see if your brothers and the flocks are all right. Then come back and tell me.” So Joseph’s father sent him from the Valley of Hebron.
GEN.37.14	When Joseph came to Shechem, 
GEN.37.15	a man found him wandering in the field and asked him, “What are you looking for?”
GEN.37.16	Joseph answered, “I am looking for my brothers. Can you tell me where they are grazing the flocks?”
GEN.37.17	The man said, “They have already gone. I heard them say they were going to Dothan.” So Joseph went to look for his brothers and found them in Dothan.
GEN.37.18	Joseph’s brothers saw him coming from far away. Before he reached them, they made a plan to kill him. 
GEN.37.19	They said to each other, “Here comes that dreamer. 
GEN.37.20	Let’s kill him and throw his body into one of the wells. We can tell our father that a wild animal killed him. Then we will see what will become of his dreams.”
GEN.37.21	But Reuben heard their plan and saved Joseph, saying, “Let’s not kill him. 
GEN.37.22	Don’t spill any blood. Throw him into this well here in the desert, but don’t hurt him!” Reuben planned to save Joseph later and send him back to his father. 
GEN.37.23	So when Joseph came to his brothers, they pulled off his robe with long sleeves 
GEN.37.24	and threw him into the well. It was empty, and there was no water in it.
GEN.37.25	While Joseph was in the well, the brothers sat down to eat. When they looked up, they saw a group of Ishmaelites traveling from Gilead to Egypt. Their camels were carrying spices, balm, and myrrh.
GEN.37.26	Then Judah said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and hide his death? 
GEN.37.27	Let’s sell him to these Ishmaelites. Then we will not be guilty of killing our own brother. After all, he is our brother, our own flesh and blood.” And the other brothers agreed. 
GEN.37.28	So when the Midianite traders came by, the brothers took Joseph out of the well and sold him to the Ishmaelites for eight ounces of silver. And the Ishmaelites took him to Egypt.
GEN.37.29	When Reuben came back to the well and Joseph was not there, he tore his clothes to show he was upset. 
GEN.37.30	Then he went back to his brothers and said, “The boy is not there! What shall I do?” 
GEN.37.31	The brothers killed a goat and dipped Joseph’s robe in its blood. 
GEN.37.32	Then they brought the long-sleeved robe to their father and said, “We found this robe. Look it over carefully and see if it is your son’s robe.”
GEN.37.33	Jacob looked it over and said, “It is my son’s robe! Some savage animal has eaten him. My son Joseph has been torn to pieces!” 
GEN.37.34	Then Jacob tore his clothes and put on rough cloth to show that he was upset, and he continued to be sad about his son for a long time. 
GEN.37.35	All of his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he could not be comforted. He said, “I will be sad about my son until the day I die.” So Jacob cried for his son Joseph.
GEN.37.36	Meanwhile the Midianites who had bought Joseph had taken him to Egypt. There they sold him to Potiphar, an officer to the king of Egypt and captain of the palace guard.
GEN.38.1	About that time, Judah left his brothers and went to stay with a man named Hirah in the town of Adullam. 
GEN.38.2	There Judah met a Canaanite girl, the daughter of a man named Shua, and married her. Judah had sexual relations with her, 
GEN.38.3	and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, whom Judah named Er. 
GEN.38.4	Later she gave birth to another son and named him Onan. 
GEN.38.5	Still later she had another son and named him Shelah. She was at Kezib when this third son was born.
GEN.38.6	Judah chose a girl named Tamar to be the wife of his first son Er. 
GEN.38.7	But Er, Judah’s oldest son, did what the L
GEN.38.8	Then Judah said to Er’s brother Onan, “Go and have sexual relations with your dead brother’s wife. It is your duty to provide children for your brother in this way.”
GEN.38.9	But Onan knew that the children would not belong to him, so when he was supposed to have sexual relations with Tamar he did not complete the sex act. This made it impossible for Tamar to become pregnant and for Er to have descendants. 
GEN.38.10	The L
GEN.38.11	Then Judah said to his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Go back to live in your father’s house, and don’t marry until my young son Shelah grows up.” Judah was afraid that Shelah also would die like his brothers. So Tamar returned to her father’s home.
GEN.38.12	After a long time Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died. After Judah had gotten over his sorrow, he went to Timnah to his men who were cutting the wool from his sheep. His friend Hirah from Adullam went with him. 
GEN.38.13	Tamar learned that Judah, her father-in-law, was going to Timnah to cut the wool from his sheep. 
GEN.38.14	So she took off the clothes that showed she was a widow and covered her face with a veil to hide who she was. Then she sat down by the gate of Enaim on the road to Timnah. She did this because Judah’s younger son Shelah had grown up, but Judah had not made plans for her to marry him.
GEN.38.15	When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, because she had covered her face with a veil. 
GEN.38.16	So Judah went to her and said, “Let me have sexual relations with you.” He did not know that she was Tamar, his daughter-in-law.
GEN.38.16	She asked, “What will you give me if I let you have sexual relations with me?”
GEN.38.17	Judah answered, “I will send you a young goat from my flock.”
GEN.38.17	She answered, “First give me something to keep as a deposit until you send the goat.”
GEN.38.18	Judah asked, “What do you want me to give you as a deposit?”
GEN.38.18	Tamar answered, “Give me your seal and its cord, and give me your walking stick.” So Judah gave these things to her. Then Judah and Tamar had sexual relations, and Tamar became pregnant. 
GEN.38.19	When Tamar went home, she took off the veil that covered her face and put on the clothes that showed she was a widow.
GEN.38.20	Judah sent his friend Hirah with the young goat to find the woman and get back his seal and the walking stick he had given her, but Hirah could not find her. 
GEN.38.21	He asked some of the people at the town of Enaim, “Where is the prostitute who was here by the road?”
GEN.38.21	They answered, “There has never been a prostitute here.”
GEN.38.22	So he went back to Judah and said, “I could not find the woman, and the people who lived there said, ‘There has never been a prostitute here.’ ”
GEN.38.23	Judah said, “Let her keep the things. I don’t want people to laugh at us. I sent her the goat as I promised, but you could not find her.”
GEN.38.24	About three months later someone told Judah, “Tamar, your daughter-in-law, is guilty of acting like a prostitute, and now she is pregnant.”
GEN.38.24	Then Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned to death.”
GEN.38.25	When the people went to bring Tamar out, she sent a message to her father-in-law that said, “The man who owns these things has made me pregnant. Look at this seal and its cord and this walking stick, and tell me whose they are.”
GEN.38.26	Judah recognized them and said, “She is more in the right than I. She did this because I did not give her to my son Shelah as I promised.” And Judah did not have sexual relations with her again.
GEN.38.27	When the time came for Tamar to give birth, there were twins in her body. 
GEN.38.28	While she was giving birth, one baby put his hand out. The nurse tied a red string on his hand and said, “This baby came out first.” 
GEN.38.29	But he pulled his hand back in, so the other baby was born first. The nurse said, “So you are able to break out first,” and they named him Perez. 
GEN.38.30	After this, the baby with the red string on his hand was born, and they named him Zerah.
GEN.39.1	Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt. An Egyptian named Potiphar was an officer to the king of Egypt and the captain of the palace guard. He bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites who had brought him down there. 
GEN.39.2	The L
GEN.39.3	Potiphar saw that the L
GEN.39.4	So Potiphar was very happy with Joseph and allowed him to be his personal servant. He put Joseph in charge of the house, trusting him with everything he owned. 
GEN.39.5	When Joseph was put in charge of the house and everything Potiphar owned, the L
GEN.39.6	So Potiphar left Joseph in charge of everything he owned and was not concerned about anything except the food he ate.
GEN.39.6	Now Joseph was well built and handsome. 
GEN.39.7	After some time the wife of Joseph’s master began to desire Joseph, and one day she said to him, “Have sexual relations with me.”
GEN.39.8	But Joseph refused and said to her, “My master trusts me with everything in his house. He has put me in charge of everything he owns. 
GEN.39.9	There is no one in his house greater than I. He has not kept anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How can I do such an evil thing? It is a sin against God.”
GEN.39.10	The woman talked to Joseph every day, but he refused to have sexual relations with her or even spend time with her.
GEN.39.11	One day Joseph went into the house to do his work as usual and was the only man in the house at that time. 
GEN.39.12	His master’s wife grabbed his coat and said to him, “Come and have sexual relations with me.” But Joseph left his coat in her hand and ran out of the house.
GEN.39.13	When she saw that Joseph had left his coat in her hands and had run outside, 
GEN.39.14	she called to the servants in her house and said, “Look! This Hebrew slave was brought here to shame us. He came in and tried to have sexual relations with me, but I screamed. 
GEN.39.15	My scream scared him and he ran away, but he left his coat with me.” 
GEN.39.16	She kept his coat until her husband came home, 
GEN.39.17	and she told him the same story. She said, “This Hebrew slave you brought here came in to shame me! 
GEN.39.18	When he came near me, I screamed. He ran away, but he left his coat.”
GEN.39.19	When Joseph’s master heard what his wife said Joseph had done, he became very angry. 
GEN.39.20	So Potiphar arrested Joseph and put him into the prison where the king’s prisoners were put. And Joseph stayed there in the prison.
GEN.39.21	But the L
GEN.39.22	The prison warden chose Joseph to take care of all the prisoners, and he was responsible for whatever was done in the prison. 
GEN.39.23	The warden paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph’s care because the L
GEN.40.1	After these things happened, two of the king’s officers displeased the king—the man who served wine to the king and the king’s baker. 
GEN.40.2	The king became angry with his officer who served him wine and his baker, 
GEN.40.3	so he put them in the prison of the captain of the guard, the same prison where Joseph was kept. 
GEN.40.4	The captain of the guard put the two prisoners in Joseph’s care, and they stayed in prison for some time.
GEN.40.5	One night both the king’s officer who served him wine and the baker had a dream. Each had his own dream with its own meaning. 
GEN.40.6	When Joseph came to them the next morning, he saw they were worried. 
GEN.40.7	He asked the king’s officers who were with him, “Why do you look so unhappy today?”
GEN.40.8	The two men answered, “We both had dreams last night, but no one can explain their meaning to us.”
GEN.40.8	Joseph said to them, “God is the only One who can explain the meaning of dreams. Tell me your dreams.”
GEN.40.9	So the man who served wine to the king told Joseph his dream. He said, “I dreamed I saw a vine, and 
GEN.40.10	on the vine were three branches. I watched the branches bud and blossom, and then the grapes ripened. 
GEN.40.11	I was holding the king’s cup, so I took the grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup. Then I gave it to the king.”
GEN.40.12	Then Joseph said, “I will explain the dream to you. The three branches stand for three days. 
GEN.40.13	Before the end of three days the king will free you, and he will allow you to return to your work. You will serve the king his wine just as you did before. 
GEN.40.14	But when you are free, remember me. Be kind to me, and tell the king about me so I can get out of this prison. 
GEN.40.15	I was taken by force from the land of the Hebrews, and I have done nothing here to deserve being put in prison.”
GEN.40.16	The baker saw that Joseph’s explanation of the dream was good, so he said to him, “I also had a dream. I dreamed there were three bread baskets on my head. 
GEN.40.17	In the top basket were all kinds of baked food for the king, but the birds were eating this food out of the basket on my head.”
GEN.40.18	Joseph answered, “I will tell you what the dream means. The three baskets stand for three days. 
GEN.40.19	Before the end of three days, the king will cut off your head! He will hang your body on a pole, and the birds will eat your flesh.”
GEN.40.20	Three days later, on his birthday, the king gave a feast for all his officers. In front of his officers, he released from prison the chief officer who served his wine and the chief baker. 
GEN.40.21	The king gave his chief officer who served wine his old position, and once again he put the king’s cup of wine into the king’s hand. 
GEN.40.22	But the king hanged the baker on a pole. Everything happened just as Joseph had said it would, 
GEN.40.23	but the officer who served wine did not remember Joseph. He forgot all about him.
GEN.41.1	Two years later the king dreamed he was standing on the bank of the Nile River. 
GEN.41.2	He saw seven fat and beautiful cows come up out of the river, and they stood there, eating the grass. 
GEN.41.3	Then seven more cows came up out of the river, but they were thin and ugly. They stood beside the seven beautiful cows on the bank of the Nile. 
GEN.41.4	The seven thin and ugly cows ate the seven beautiful fat cows. Then the king woke up. 
GEN.41.5	The king slept again and dreamed a second time. In his dream he saw seven full and good heads of grain growing on one stalk. 
GEN.41.6	After that, seven more heads of grain sprang up, but they were thin and burned by the hot east wind. 
GEN.41.7	The thin heads of grain ate the seven full and good heads. Then the king woke up again, and he realized it was only a dream. 
GEN.41.8	The next morning the king was troubled about these dreams, so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. The king told them his dreams, but no one could explain their meaning to him.
GEN.41.9	Then the chief officer who served wine to the king said to him, “Now I remember something I promised to do, but I forgot about it. 
GEN.41.10	There was a time when you were angry with the baker and me, and you put us in prison in the house of the captain of the guard. 
GEN.41.11	In prison we each had a dream on the same night, and each dream had a different meaning. 
GEN.41.12	A young Hebrew man, a servant of the captain of the guard, was in the prison with us. When we told him our dreams, he explained their meanings to us. He told each man the meaning of his dream, and 
GEN.41.13	things happened exactly as he said they would: I was given back my old position, and the baker was hanged.”
GEN.41.14	So the king called for Joseph. The guards quickly brought him out of the prison, and he shaved, put on clean clothes, and went before the king.
GEN.41.15	The king said to Joseph, “I have had a dream, but no one can explain its meaning to me. I have heard that you can explain a dream when someone tells it to you.”
GEN.41.16	Joseph answered the king, “I am not able to explain the meaning of dreams, but God will do this for the king.”
GEN.41.17	Then the king said to Joseph, “In my dream I was standing on the bank of the Nile River. 
GEN.41.18	I saw seven fat and beautiful cows that came up out of the river and ate the grass. 
GEN.41.19	Then I saw seven more cows come out of the river that were thin and lean and ugly—the worst looking cows I have seen in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.20	And these thin and ugly cows ate the first seven fat cows, 
GEN.41.21	but after they had eaten the seven cows, no one could tell they had eaten them. They looked just as thin and ugly as they did in the beginning. Then I woke up.
GEN.41.22	“I had another dream. I saw seven full and good heads of grain growing on one stalk. 
GEN.41.23	Then seven more heads of grain sprang up after them, but these heads were thin and ugly and were burned by the hot east wind. 
GEN.41.24	Then the thin heads ate the seven good heads. I told this dream to the magicians, but no one could explain its meaning to me.”
GEN.41.25	Then Joseph said to the king, “Both of these dreams mean the same thing. God is telling you what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.26	The seven good cows stand for seven years, and the seven good heads of grain stand for seven years. Both dreams mean the same thing. 
GEN.41.27	The seven thin and ugly cows stand for seven years, and the seven thin heads of grain burned by the hot east wind stand for seven years of hunger. 
GEN.41.28	This will happen as I told you. God is showing the king what he is about to do. 
GEN.41.29	You will have seven years of good crops and plenty to eat in all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.30	But after those seven years, there will come seven years of hunger, and all the food that grew in the land of Egypt will be forgotten. The time of hunger will eat up the land. 
GEN.41.31	People will forget what it was like to have plenty of food, because the hunger that follows will be so great. 
GEN.41.32	You had two dreams which mean the same thing. This shows that God has firmly decided that this will happen, and he will make it happen soon.
GEN.41.33	“So let the king choose a man who is very wise and understanding and set him over the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.34	And let the king also appoint officers over the land, who should take one-fifth of all the food that is grown during the seven good years. 
GEN.41.35	They should gather all the food that is produced during the good years that are coming, and under the king’s authority they should store the grain in the cities and guard it. 
GEN.41.36	That food should be saved to use during the seven years of hunger that will come on the land of Egypt. Then the people in Egypt will not die during the seven years of hunger.”
GEN.41.37	This seemed like a very good idea to the king, and all his officers agreed. 
GEN.41.38	And the king asked them, “Can we find a better man than Joseph to take this job? God’s spirit is truly in him!”
GEN.41.39	So the king said to Joseph, “God has shown you all this. There is no one as wise and understanding as you are, so 
GEN.41.40	I will put you in charge of my palace. All the people will obey your orders, and only I will be greater than you.”
GEN.41.41	Then the king said to Joseph, “Look! I have put you in charge of all the land of Egypt.” 
GEN.41.42	Then the king took off from his own finger his ring with the royal seal on it, and he put it on Joseph’s finger. He gave Joseph fine linen clothes to wear, and he put a gold chain around Joseph’s neck. 
GEN.41.43	The king had Joseph ride in the second royal chariot, and people walked ahead of his chariot calling, “Bow down!” By doing these things, the king put Joseph in charge of all of Egypt.
GEN.41.44	The king said to him, “I am the king, and I say that no one in all the land of Egypt may lift a hand or a foot without your permission.” 
GEN.41.45	The king gave Joseph the name Zaphenath-Paneah. He also gave Joseph a wife named Asenath, who was the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On. So Joseph traveled through all the land of Egypt.
GEN.41.46	Joseph was thirty years old when he began serving the king of Egypt. And he left the king’s court and traveled through all the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.47	During the seven good years, the crops in the land grew well. 
GEN.41.48	And Joseph gathered all the food produced in Egypt during those seven years of good crops and stored the food in the cities. In every city he stored grain that had been grown in the fields around that city. 
GEN.41.49	Joseph stored much grain, as much as the sand of the seashore—so much that he could not measure it.
GEN.41.50	Joseph’s wife was Asenath daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On. Before the years of hunger came, Joseph and Asenath had two sons. 
GEN.41.51	Joseph named the first son Manasseh and said, “God has made me forget all the troubles I have had and all my father’s family.” 
GEN.41.52	Joseph named the second son Ephraim and said, “God has given me children in the land of my troubles.”
GEN.41.53	The seven years of good crops came to an end in the land of Egypt. 
GEN.41.54	Then the seven years of hunger began, just as Joseph had said. In all the lands people had nothing to eat, but in Egypt there was food. 
GEN.41.55	The time of hunger became terrible in all of Egypt, and the people cried to the king for food. He said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph and do whatever he tells you.”
GEN.41.56	The hunger was everywhere in that part of the world. And Joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the people of Egypt, because the time of hunger became terrible in Egypt. 
GEN.41.57	And all the people in that part of the world came to Joseph in Egypt to buy grain because the hunger was terrible everywhere in that part of the world.
GEN.42.1	Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, so he said to his sons, “Why are you just sitting here looking at one another? 
GEN.42.2	I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy grain for us to eat, so that we will live and not die.”
GEN.42.3	So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
GEN.42.4	But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s brother, with them, because he was afraid that something terrible might happen to him. 
GEN.42.5	Along with many other people, the sons of Israel went to Egypt to buy grain, because the people in the land of Canaan were also hungry.
GEN.42.6	Now Joseph was governor over Egypt. He was the one who sold the grain to people who came to buy it. So Joseph’s brothers came to him and bowed facedown on the ground before him. 
GEN.42.7	When Joseph saw his brothers, he knew who they were, but he acted as if he didn’t know them. He asked unkindly, “Where do you come from?”
GEN.42.7	They answered, “We have come from the land of Canaan to buy food.”
GEN.42.8	Joseph knew they were his brothers, but they did not know who he was. 
GEN.42.9	And Joseph remembered his dreams about his brothers bowing to him. He said to them, “You are spies! You came to learn where the nation is weak!”
GEN.42.10	But his brothers said to him, “No, my master. We come as your servants just to buy food. 
GEN.42.11	We are all sons of the same father. We are honest men, not spies.”
GEN.42.12	Then Joseph said to them, “No! You have come to learn where this nation is weak!”
GEN.42.13	And they said, “We are ten of twelve brothers, sons of the same father, and we live in the land of Canaan. Our youngest brother is there with our father right now, and our other brother is gone.”
GEN.42.14	But Joseph said to them, “I can see I was right! You are spies! 
GEN.42.15	But I will give you a way to prove you are telling the truth. As surely as the king lives, you will not leave this place until your youngest brother comes here. 
GEN.42.16	One of you must go and get your brother. The rest of you will stay here in prison. We will see if you are telling the truth. If not, as surely as the king lives, you are spies.” 
GEN.42.17	Then Joseph put them all in prison for three days.
GEN.42.18	On the third day Joseph said to them, “I am a God-fearing man. Do this and I will let you live: 
GEN.42.19	If you are honest men, let one of your brothers stay here in prison while the rest of you go and carry grain back to feed your hungry families. 
GEN.42.20	Then bring your youngest brother back here to me. If you do this, I will know you are telling the truth, and you will not die.”
GEN.42.20	The brothers agreed to this. 
GEN.42.21	They said to each other, “We are being punished for what we did to our brother. We saw his trouble, and he begged us to save him, but we refused to listen. That is why we are in this trouble now.”
GEN.42.22	Then Reuben said to them, “I told you not to harm the boy, but you refused to listen to me. So now we are being punished for what we did to him.”
GEN.42.23	When Joseph talked to his brothers, he used an interpreter, so they did not know that Joseph understood what they were saying. 
GEN.42.24	Then Joseph left them and cried. After a short time he went back and spoke to them. He took Simeon and tied him up while the other brothers watched. 
GEN.42.25	Joseph told his servants to fill his brothers’ bags with grain and to put the money the brothers had paid for the grain back in their bags. The servants were also to give them what they would need for their trip back home. And the servants did this.
GEN.42.26	So the brothers put the grain on their donkeys and left. 
GEN.42.27	When they stopped for the night, one of the brothers opened his sack to get food for his donkey. Then he saw his money in the top of the sack. 
GEN.42.28	He said to the other brothers, “The money I paid for the grain has been put back. Here it is in my sack!”
GEN.42.28	The brothers were very frightened. They said to each other, “What has God done to us?”
GEN.42.29	The brothers went to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan and told him everything that had happened. 
GEN.42.30	They said, “The master of that land spoke unkindly to us. He accused us of spying on his country, 
GEN.42.31	but we told him that we were honest men, not spies. 
GEN.42.32	We told him that we were ten of twelve brothers—sons of one father. We said that one of our brothers was gone and that our youngest brother was with our father in Canaan.
GEN.42.33	“Then the master of the land said to us, ‘Here is a way I can know you are honest men: Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain to feed your hungry families, and go. 
GEN.42.34	And bring your youngest brother to me so I will know you are not spies but honest men. Then I will give you back your brother whom you leave with me, and you can move about freely in our land.’ ”
GEN.42.35	As the brothers emptied their sacks, each of them found his money in his sack. When they and their father saw it, they were afraid.
GEN.42.36	Their father Jacob said to them, “You are robbing me of all my children. Joseph is gone, Simeon is gone, and now you want to take Benjamin away, too. Everything is against me.”
GEN.42.37	Then Reuben said to his father, “You may put my two sons to death if I don’t bring Benjamin back to you. Trust him to my care, and I will bring him back to you.”
GEN.42.38	But Jacob said, “I will not allow Benjamin to go with you. His brother is dead, and he is the only son left from my wife Rachel. I am afraid something terrible might happen to him during the trip to Egypt. Then I would be sad until the day I die.”
GEN.43.1	Still no food grew in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.43.2	When Jacob’s family had eaten all the grain they had brought from Egypt, Jacob said to them, “Go to Egypt again and buy a little more grain for us to eat.”
GEN.43.3	But Judah said to Jacob, “The governor of that country strongly warned us, ‘If you don’t bring your brother back with you, you will not be allowed to see me.’ 
GEN.43.4	If you will send Benjamin with us, we will go down and buy food for you. 
GEN.43.5	But if you refuse to send Benjamin, we will not go. The governor of that country warned us that we would not see him if we didn’t bring Benjamin with us.”
GEN.43.6	Israel said, “Why did you tell the man you had another brother? You have caused me a lot of trouble.”
GEN.43.7	The brothers answered, “He questioned us carefully about ourselves and our family. He asked us, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ We just answered his questions. How could we know he would ask us to bring our other brother to him?”
GEN.43.8	Then Judah said to his father Jacob, “Send Benjamin with me, and we will go at once so that we, you, and our children may live and not die. 
GEN.43.9	I will guarantee you that he will be safe, and I will be personally responsible for him. If I don’t bring him back to you, you can blame me all my life. 
GEN.43.10	If we had not wasted all this time, we could have already made two trips.”
GEN.43.11	Then their father Jacob said to them, “If it has to be that way, then do this: Take some of the best foods in our land in your packs. Give them to the man as a gift: some balm, some honey, spices, myrrh, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 
GEN.43.12	Take twice as much money with you this time, and take back the money that was returned to you in your sacks last time. Maybe it was a mistake. 
GEN.43.13	And take Benjamin with you. Now leave and go to the man. 
GEN.43.14	I pray that God Almighty will cause the governor to be merciful to you and that he will allow Simeon and Benjamin to come back with you. If I am robbed of my children, then I am robbed of them!”
GEN.43.15	So the brothers took the gifts. They also took twice as much money as they had taken the first time, and they took Benjamin. They hurried down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.
GEN.43.16	When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the servant in charge of his house, “Bring those men into my house. Kill an animal and prepare a meal. Those men will eat with me today at noon.” 
GEN.43.17	The servant did as Joseph told him and brought the men to Joseph’s house.
GEN.43.18	The brothers were afraid when they were brought to Joseph’s house and thought, “We were brought here because of the money that was put in our sacks on the first trip. He wants to attack us, make us slaves, and take our donkeys.” 
GEN.43.19	So the brothers went to the servant in charge of Joseph’s house and spoke to him at the door of the house. 
GEN.43.20	They said, “Master, we came here once before to buy food. 
GEN.43.21	While we were going home, we stopped for the night and when we opened our sacks each of us found all his money in his sack. We brought that money with us to give it back to you. 
GEN.43.22	And we have brought more money to pay for the food we want to buy this time. We don’t know who put that money in our sacks.”
GEN.43.23	But the servant answered, “It’s all right. Don’t be afraid. Your God, the God of your father, must have put the money in your sacks. I got the money you paid me for the grain last time.” Then the servant brought Simeon out to them.
GEN.43.24	The servant led the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed their feet. Then he gave their donkeys food to eat. 
GEN.43.25	The men prepared their gift to give to Joseph when he arrived at noon, because they had heard they were going to eat with him there.
GEN.43.26	When Joseph came home, the brothers gave him the gift they had brought into the house and bowed down to the ground in front of him. 
GEN.43.27	Joseph asked them how they were doing. He said, “How is your aged father you told me about? Is he still alive?”
GEN.43.28	The brothers answered, “Your servant, our father, is well. He is still alive.” And they bowed low before Joseph to show him respect.
GEN.43.29	When Joseph saw his brother Benjamin, who had the same mother as he, Joseph asked, “Is this your youngest brother you told me about?” Then he said to Benjamin, “God be good to you, my son!” 
GEN.43.30	Then Joseph hurried off because he had to hold back the tears when he saw his brother Benjamin. So Joseph went into his room and cried there. 
GEN.43.31	Then he washed his face and came out. He controlled himself and said, “Serve the meal.”
GEN.43.32	So they served Joseph at one table, his brothers at another table, and the Egyptians who ate with him at another table. This was because Egyptians did not like Hebrews and never ate with them. 
GEN.43.33	Joseph’s brothers were seated in front of him in order of their ages, from oldest to youngest. They looked at each other because they were so amazed. 
GEN.43.34	Food from Joseph’s table was taken to them, but Benjamin was given five times more food than the others. Joseph’s brothers ate and drank freely with him.
GEN.44.1	Then Joseph gave a command to the servant in charge of his house. He said, “Fill the men’s sacks with as much grain as they can carry, and put each man’s money into his sack with the grain. 
GEN.44.2	Put my silver cup in the sack of the youngest brother, along with his money for the grain.” The servant did what Joseph told him.
GEN.44.3	At dawn the brothers were sent away with their donkeys. 
GEN.44.4	They were not far from the city when Joseph said to the servant in charge of his house, “Go after the men. When you catch up with them, say, ‘Why have you paid back evil for good? 
GEN.44.5	The cup you have stolen is the one my master uses for drinking and for explaining dreams. You have done a very wicked thing!’ ”
GEN.44.6	So the servant caught up with the brothers and said to them what Joseph had told him to say.
GEN.44.7	But the brothers said to the servant, “Why do you say these things? We would not do anything like that! 
GEN.44.8	We brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money we found in our sacks. So surely we would not steal silver or gold from your master’s house. 
GEN.44.9	If you find that silver cup in the sack of one of us, then let him die, and we will be your slaves.”
GEN.44.10	The servant said, “We will do as you say, but only the man who has taken the cup will become my slave. The rest of you may go free.”
GEN.44.11	Then every brother quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it. 
GEN.44.12	The servant searched the sacks, going from the oldest brother to the youngest, and found the cup in Benjamin’s sack. 
GEN.44.13	The brothers tore their clothes to show they were afraid. Then they put their sacks back on the donkeys and returned to the city.
GEN.44.14	When Judah and his brothers went back to Joseph’s house, Joseph was still there, so the brothers bowed facedown on the ground before him. 
GEN.44.15	Joseph said to them, “What have you done? Didn’t you know that a man like me can learn things by signs and dreams?”
GEN.44.16	Judah said, “Master, what can we say? And how can we show we are not guilty? God has uncovered our guilt, so all of us will be your slaves, not just Benjamin.”
GEN.44.17	But Joseph said, “I will not make you all slaves! Only the man who stole the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may go back safely to your father.”
GEN.44.18	Then Judah went to Joseph and said, “Master, please let me speak plainly to you, and please don’t be angry with me. I know that you are as powerful as the king of Egypt himself. 
GEN.44.19	When we were here before, you asked us, ‘Do you have a father or a brother?’ 
GEN.44.20	And we answered you, ‘We have an old father. And we have a younger brother, who was born when our father was old. This youngest son’s brother is dead, so he is the only one of his mother’s children left alive, and our father loves him very much.’ 
GEN.44.21	Then you said to us, ‘Bring that brother to me. I want to see him.’ 
GEN.44.22	And we said to you, ‘That young boy cannot leave his father, because if he leaves him, his father would die.’ 
GEN.44.23	But you said to us, ‘If you don’t bring your youngest brother, you will not be allowed to see me again.’ 
GEN.44.24	So we went back to our father and told him what you had said.
GEN.44.25	“Later, our father said, ‘Go again and buy us a little more food.’ 
GEN.44.26	We said to our father, ‘We cannot go without our youngest brother. Without our youngest brother, we will not be allowed to see the governor.’ 
GEN.44.27	Then my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife Rachel gave me two sons. 
GEN.44.28	When one son left me, I thought, “Surely he has been torn apart by a wild animal,” and I haven’t seen him since. 
GEN.44.29	Now you want to take this son away from me also. But something terrible might happen to him, and I would be miserable until the day I die.’ 
GEN.44.30	Now what will happen if we go home to our father without our youngest brother? He is so important in our father’s life that 
GEN.44.31	when our father sees the young boy is not with us, he will die. And it will be our fault. We will cause the great sorrow that kills our father.
GEN.44.32	“I gave my father a guarantee that the young boy would be safe. I said to my father, ‘If I don’t bring him back to you, you can blame me all my life.’ 
GEN.44.33	So now, please allow me to stay here and be your slave, and let the young boy go back home with his brothers. 
GEN.44.34	I cannot go back to my father if the boy is not with me. I couldn’t stand to see my father that sad.”
GEN.45.1	Joseph could not control himself in front of his servants any longer, so he cried out, “Have everyone leave me.” When only the brothers were left with Joseph, he told them who he was. 
GEN.45.2	Joseph cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, and the people in the king’s palace heard about it. 
GEN.45.3	He said to his brothers, “I am Joseph. Is my father still alive?” But the brothers could not answer him, because they were very afraid of him.
GEN.45.4	So Joseph said to them, “Come close to me.” When the brothers came close to him, he said to them, “I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold as a slave to go to Egypt. 
GEN.45.5	Now don’t be worried or angry with yourselves because you sold me here. God sent me here ahead of you to save people’s lives. 
GEN.45.6	No food has grown on the land for two years now, and there will be five more years without planting or harvest. 
GEN.45.7	So God sent me here ahead of you to make sure you have some descendants left on earth and to keep you alive in an amazing way. 
GEN.45.8	So it was not you who sent me here, but God. God has made me the highest officer of the king of Egypt. I am in charge of his palace, and I am the master of all the land of Egypt.
GEN.45.9	“So leave quickly and go to my father. Tell him, ‘Your son Joseph says: God has made me master over all Egypt. Come down to me quickly. 
GEN.45.10	Live in the land of Goshen where you will be near me. Your children, your grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and all that you have will also be near me. 
GEN.45.11	I will care for you during the next five years of hunger so that you and your family and all that you have will not starve.’
GEN.45.12	“Now you can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that the one speaking to you is really Joseph. 
GEN.45.13	So tell my father about how powerful I have become in Egypt. Tell him about everything you have seen. Now hurry and bring him back to me.” 
GEN.45.14	Then Joseph hugged his brother Benjamin and cried, and Benjamin cried also. 
GEN.45.15	And Joseph kissed all his brothers and cried as he hugged them. After this, his brothers talked with him.
GEN.45.16	When the king of Egypt and his officers learned that Joseph’s brothers had come, they were very happy. 
GEN.45.17	So the king said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers to load their animals and go back to the land of Canaan 
GEN.45.18	and bring their father and their families back here to me. I will give them the best land in Egypt, and they will eat the best food we have here. 
GEN.45.19	Tell them to take some wagons from Egypt for their children and their wives and to bring their father back also. 
GEN.45.20	Tell them not to worry about bringing any of their things with them, because we will give them the best of what we have in Egypt.”
GEN.45.21	So the sons of Israel did this. Joseph gave them wagons as the king had ordered and food for their trip. 
GEN.45.22	He gave each brother a change of clothes, but he gave Benjamin five changes of clothes and about seven and one-half pounds of silver. 
GEN.45.23	Joseph also sent his father ten donkeys loaded with the best things from Egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and other food for his father on his trip back. 
GEN.45.24	Then Joseph told his brothers to go. As they were leaving, he said to them, “Don’t quarrel on the way home.”
GEN.45.25	So the brothers left Egypt and went to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan. 
GEN.45.26	They told him, “Joseph is still alive and is the ruler over all the land of Egypt.” Their father was shocked and did not believe them. 
GEN.45.27	But when the brothers told him everything Joseph had said, and when Jacob saw the wagons Joseph had sent to carry him back to Egypt, he felt better. 
GEN.45.28	Israel said, “Now I believe you. My son Joseph is still alive, and I will go and see him before I die.”
GEN.46.1	So Israel took all he had and started his trip. He went to Beersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
GEN.46.2	During the night God spoke to Israel in a vision and said, “Jacob, Jacob.”
GEN.46.2	And Jacob answered, “Here I am.”
GEN.46.3	Then God said, “I am God, the God of your father. Don’t be afraid to go to Egypt, because I will make your descendants a great nation there. 
GEN.46.4	I will go to Egypt with you, and I will bring you out of Egypt again. Joseph’s own hands will close your eyes when you die.”
GEN.46.5	Then Jacob left Beersheba. The sons of Israel loaded their father, their children, and their wives in the wagons the king of Egypt had sent. 
GEN.46.6	They also took their farm animals and everything they had gotten in Canaan. So Jacob went to Egypt with all his descendants— 
GEN.46.7	his sons and grandsons, his daughters and granddaughters. He took all his family to Egypt with him.
GEN.46.8	Now these are the names of the children of Israel who went into Egypt (Jacob and his descendants).
GEN.46.8	Reuben was Jacob’s first son. 
GEN.46.9	Reuben’s sons were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
GEN.46.10	Simeon’s sons were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul (Simeon’s son by a Canaanite woman).
GEN.46.11	Levi’s sons were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
GEN.46.12	Judah’s sons were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (but Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). Perez’s sons were Hezron and Hamul.
GEN.46.13	Issachar’s sons were Tola, Puah, Jashub, and Shimron.
GEN.46.14	Zebulun’s sons were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
GEN.46.15	These are the sons of Leah and Jacob born in Northwest Mesopotamia, in addition to his daughter Dinah. There were thirty-three persons in this part of Jacob’s family.
GEN.46.16	Gad’s sons were Zephon, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli.
GEN.46.17	Asher’s sons were Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah, and their sister was Serah. Beriah’s sons were Heber and Malkiel.
GEN.46.18	These are Jacob’s sons by Zilpah, the slave girl whom Laban gave to his daughter Leah. There were sixteen persons in this part of Jacob’s family.
GEN.46.19	The sons of Jacob’s wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin. 
GEN.46.20	In Egypt, Joseph became the father of Manasseh and Ephraim by his wife Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On.
GEN.46.21	Benjamin’s sons were Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
GEN.46.22	These are the sons of Jacob by his wife Rachel. There were fourteen persons in this part of Jacob’s family.
GEN.46.23	Dan’s son was Hushim.
GEN.46.24	Naphtali’s sons were Jahziel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
GEN.46.25	These are Jacob’s sons by Bilhah, the slave girl whom Laban gave to his daughter Rachel. There were seven persons in this part of Jacob’s family.
GEN.46.26	So the total number of Jacob’s direct descendants who went to Egypt was sixty-six, not counting the wives of Jacob’s sons. 
GEN.46.27	Joseph had two sons born in Egypt, so the total number in the family of Jacob in Egypt was seventy.
GEN.46.28	Jacob sent Judah ahead of him to see Joseph in Goshen. When Jacob and his people came into the land of Goshen, 
GEN.46.29	Joseph prepared his chariot and went to meet his father Israel in Goshen. As soon as Joseph saw his father, he hugged him, and cried there for a long time.
GEN.46.30	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Now I am ready to die, because I have seen your face and I know you are still alive.”
GEN.46.31	Joseph said to his brothers and his father’s family, “I will go and tell the king you are here. I will say, ‘My brothers and my father’s family have left the land of Canaan and have come here to me. 
GEN.46.32	They are shepherds and take care of farm animals, and they have brought their flocks and their herds and everything they own with them.’ 
GEN.46.33	When the king calls you, he will ask, ‘What work do you do?’ 
GEN.46.34	This is what you should tell him: ‘We, your servants, have taken care of farm animals all our lives. Our ancestors did the same thing.’ Then the king will allow you to settle in the land of Goshen, away from the Egyptians, because they don’t like to be near shepherds.”
GEN.47.1	Joseph went in to the king and said, “My father and my brothers have arrived from Canaan with their flocks and herds and everything they own. They are now in the land of Goshen.” 
GEN.47.2	Joseph chose five of his brothers to introduce to the king.
GEN.47.3	The king said to the brothers, “What work do you do?”
GEN.47.3	And they said to him, “We, your servants, are shepherds, just as our ancestors were.” 
GEN.47.4	They said to the king, “We have come to live in this land, because there is no grass in the land of Canaan for our animals to eat, and the hunger is terrible there. So please allow us to live in the land of Goshen.”
GEN.47.5	Then the king said to Joseph, “Your father and your brothers have come to you, 
GEN.47.6	and you may choose any place in Egypt for them to live. Give your father and your brothers the best land; let them live in the land of Goshen. And if any of them are skilled shepherds, put them in charge of my sheep and cattle.”
GEN.47.7	Then Joseph brought in his father Jacob and introduced him to the king, and Jacob blessed the king.
GEN.47.8	Then the king said to Jacob, “How old are you?”
GEN.47.9	Jacob said to him, “My life has been spent wandering from place to place. It has been short and filled with trouble—only one hundred thirty years. My ancestors lived much longer than I.” 
GEN.47.10	Then Jacob blessed the king and left.
GEN.47.11	Joseph obeyed the king and gave his father and brothers the best land in Egypt, near the city of Rameses. 
GEN.47.12	And Joseph gave his father, his brothers, and everyone who lived with them the food they needed.
GEN.47.13	The hunger became worse, and since there was no food anywhere in the land, Egypt and Canaan became very poor. 
GEN.47.14	Joseph collected all the money that was to be found in Egypt and Canaan. People paid for the grain they were buying, and he brought that money to the king’s palace. 
GEN.47.15	After some time, when the people in Egypt and Canaan had no money left, they went to Joseph and said, “Please give us food. Our money is gone, and if we don’t eat, we will die here in front of you.”
GEN.47.16	Joseph answered, “Since you have no money, give me your farm animals, and I will give you food in return.” 
GEN.47.17	So people brought their farm animals to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for their horses, sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys. And he kept them alive by trading food for their farm animals that year.
GEN.47.18	The next year the people came to Joseph and said, “You know we have no money left, and all our animals belong to you. We have nothing left except our bodies and our land. 
GEN.47.19	Surely both we and our land will die here in front of you. Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we will be slaves to the king, together with our land. Give us seed to plant so that we will live and not die, and the land will not become a desert.”
GEN.47.20	So Joseph bought all the land in Egypt for the king. Every Egyptian sold Joseph his field, because the hunger was very great. So the land became the king’s, 
GEN.47.21	and Joseph made the people slaves from one end of Egypt to the other. 
GEN.47.22	The only land he did not buy was the land the priests owned. They did not need to sell their land because the king paid them for their work. So they had money to buy food.
GEN.47.23	Joseph said to the people, “Now I have bought you and your land for the king, so I will give you seed and you can plant your fields. 
GEN.47.24	At harvest time you must give one-fifth to the king. You may keep four-fifths for yourselves to use as seed for the field and as food for yourselves, your families, and your children.”
GEN.47.25	The people said, “You have saved our lives. If you like, we will become slaves of the king.”
GEN.47.26	So Joseph made a law in Egypt, which continues today: One-fifth of everything from the land belongs to the king. The only land the king did not get was the priests’ land.
GEN.47.27	The Israelites continued to live in the land of Goshen in Egypt. There they got possessions and had many children and grew in number.
GEN.47.28	Jacob lived in Egypt seventeen years, so he lived to be one hundred forty-seven years old. 
GEN.47.29	When Israel knew he soon would die, he called his son Joseph to him and said to him, “If you love me, put your hand under my leg. Promise me you will not bury me in Egypt. 
GEN.47.30	When I die, carry me out of Egypt, and bury me where my ancestors are buried.”
GEN.47.30	Joseph answered, “I will do as you say.”
GEN.47.31	Then Jacob said, “Promise me.” And Joseph promised him that he would do this. Then Israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his walking stick.
GEN.48.1	Some time later Joseph learned that his father was very sick, so he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim and went to his father. 
GEN.48.2	When Joseph arrived, someone told Jacob, “Your son Joseph has come to see you.” Jacob was weak, so he used all his strength and sat up on his bed.
GEN.48.3	Then Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me there. 
GEN.48.4	He said to me, ‘I will give you many children. I will make you the father of many peoples, and I will give your descendants this land forever.’ 
GEN.48.5	Your two sons, who were born here in Egypt before I came, will be counted as my own sons. Ephraim and Manasseh will be my sons just as Reuben and Simeon are my sons. 
GEN.48.6	But if you have other children, they will be your own, and their land will be part of the land given to Ephraim and Manasseh. 
GEN.48.7	When I came from Northwest Mesopotamia, Rachel died in the land of Canaan, as we were traveling toward Ephrath. This made me very sad, and I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath.” (Today Ephrath is Bethlehem.)
GEN.48.8	Then Israel saw Joseph’s sons and said, “Who are these boys?”
GEN.48.9	Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons that God has given me here in Egypt.”
GEN.48.9	Israel said, “Bring your sons to me so I may bless them.”
GEN.48.10	At this time Israel’s eyesight was bad because he was old. So Joseph brought the boys close to him, and Israel kissed the boys and put his arms around them. 
GEN.48.11	He said to Joseph, “I thought I would never see you alive again, and now God has let me see you and also your children.” 
GEN.48.12	Then Joseph moved his sons off Israel’s lap and bowed facedown to the ground. 
GEN.48.13	He put Ephraim on his right side and Manasseh on his left. (So Ephraim was near Israel’s left hand, and Manasseh was near Israel’s right hand.) Joseph brought the boys close to Israel. 
GEN.48.14	But Israel crossed his arms and put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, who was younger. He put his left hand on the head of Manasseh, the firstborn son. 
GEN.48.15	And Israel blessed Joseph and said,
GEN.48.15	“My ancestors Abraham and Isaac served our God,
GEN.48.15	and like a shepherd God has led me all my life.
GEN.48.16	He was the Angel who saved me from all my troubles.
GEN.48.16	Now I pray that he will bless these boys. 
GEN.48.16	May my name be known through these boys,
GEN.48.16	and may the names of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac be known through them.
GEN.48.16	May they have many descendants
GEN.48.16	on the earth.”
GEN.48.17	When Joseph saw that his father put his right hand on Ephraim’s head, he didn’t like it. So he took hold of his father’s hand, wanting to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 
GEN.48.18	Joseph said to his father, “You are doing it wrong, Father. Manasseh is the firstborn son. Put your right hand on his head.”
GEN.48.19	But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. Manasseh will be great and have many descendants. But his younger brother will be greater, and his descendants will be enough to make a nation.”
GEN.48.20	So Israel blessed them that day and said,
GEN.48.20	“When a blessing is given in Israel, they will say:
GEN.48.20	‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’ ”
GEN.48.20	In this way he made Ephraim greater than Manasseh.
GEN.48.21	Then Israel said to Joseph, “Look at me; I am about to die. But God will be with you and will take you back to the land of your fathers. 
GEN.48.22	I have given you something that I did not give your brothers—the land of Shechem that I took from the Amorite people with my sword and my bow.”
GEN.49.1	Then Jacob called his sons to him. He said, “Come here to me, and I will tell you what will happen to you in the future.
GEN.49.2	“Come together and listen, sons of Jacob.
GEN.49.2	Listen to Israel, your father.”
GEN.49.3	“Reuben, my first son, you are my strength.
GEN.49.3	Your birth showed I could be a father.
GEN.49.3	You have the highest position among my sons,
GEN.49.3	and you are the most powerful.
GEN.49.4	But you are uncontrolled like water,
GEN.49.4	so you will no longer lead your brothers.
GEN.49.4	This is because you got into your father’s bed
GEN.49.4	and shamed me by having sexual relations with my slave girl.
GEN.49.5	“Simeon and Levi are brothers
GEN.49.5	who used their swords to do violence.
GEN.49.6	I will not join their secret talks,
GEN.49.6	and I will not meet with them to plan evil.
GEN.49.6	They killed men because they were angry,
GEN.49.6	and they crippled oxen just for fun.
GEN.49.7	May their anger be cursed, because it is too violent.
GEN.49.7	May their violence be cursed, because it is too cruel.
GEN.49.7	I will divide them up among the tribes of Jacob
GEN.49.7	and scatter them through all the tribes of Israel.
GEN.49.8	“Judah, your brothers will praise you.
GEN.49.8	You will grab your enemies by the neck,
GEN.49.8	and your brothers will bow down to you.
GEN.49.9	Judah is like a young lion.
GEN.49.9	You have returned from killing, my son.
GEN.49.9	Like a lion, he stretches out and lies down to rest,
GEN.49.9	and no one is brave enough to wake him.
GEN.49.10	Kings will come from Judah’s family;
GEN.49.10	someone from Judah will always be on the throne.
GEN.49.10	Judah will rule until Shiloh comes,
GEN.49.10	and the nations will obey him.
GEN.49.11	He ties his donkey to a grapevine,
GEN.49.11	his young donkey to the best branch.
GEN.49.11	He can afford to use wine to wash his clothes
GEN.49.11	and the best wine to wash his robes.
GEN.49.12	His eyes are dark like the color of wine,
GEN.49.12	and his teeth are as white as the color of milk.
GEN.49.13	“Zebulun will live near the sea.
GEN.49.13	His shore will be a safe place for ships,
GEN.49.13	and his land will reach as far as Sidon.
GEN.49.14	“Issachar is like a strong donkey
GEN.49.14	who lies down while carrying his load.
GEN.49.15	When he sees his resting place is good
GEN.49.15	and how pleasant his land is,
GEN.49.15	he will put his back to the load
GEN.49.15	and become a slave.
GEN.49.16	“Dan will rule his own people
GEN.49.16	like the other tribes in Israel.
GEN.49.17	Dan will be like a snake by the side of the road,
GEN.49.17	a dangerous snake lying near the path.
GEN.49.17	That snake bites a horse’s leg,
GEN.49.17	and the rider is thrown off backward.

GEN.49.25	and many young ones born to your animals.
GEN.49.26	The blessings of your father are greater
GEN.49.26	than the blessings of the oldest mountains,
GEN.49.26	greater than the good things of the long-lasting hills.
GEN.49.26	May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph,
GEN.49.26	on the forehead of the one who was separated from his brothers.
GEN.49.27	“Benjamin is like a hungry wolf.
GEN.49.27	In the morning he eats what he has caught,
GEN.49.27	and in the evening he divides what he has taken.”
GEN.49.28	These are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them. He gave each son the blessing that was right for him. 
GEN.49.29	Then Israel gave them a command and said, “I am about to die. Bury me with my ancestors in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite. 
GEN.49.30	That cave is in the field of Machpelah east of Mamre in the land of Canaan. Abraham bought the field and cave from Ephron the Hittite for a burying place. 
GEN.49.31	Abraham and Sarah his wife are buried there. Isaac and Rebekah his wife are buried there, and I buried my wife Leah there. 
GEN.49.32	The field and the cave in it were bought from the Hittite people.” 
GEN.49.33	After Jacob finished talking to his sons, he lay down. He put his feet back on the bed, took his last breath, and died.
GEN.50.1	When Jacob died, Joseph hugged his father and cried over him and kissed him. 
GEN.50.2	He commanded the doctors who served him to prepare his father’s body, so the doctors prepared Jacob’s body to be buried. 
GEN.50.3	It took the doctors forty days to prepare his body (the usual time it took). And the Egyptians had a time of sorrow for Jacob that lasted seventy days.
GEN.50.4	When this time of sorrow had ended, Joseph spoke to the king’s officers and said, “If you think well of me, please tell this to the king: 
GEN.50.5	‘When my father was near death, I made a promise to him that I would bury him in a cave in the land of Canaan, in a burial place that he cut out for himself. So please let me go and bury my father, and then I will return.’ ”
GEN.50.6	The king answered, “Keep your promise. Go and bury your father.”
GEN.50.7	So Joseph went to bury his father. All the king’s officers, the elders of his court, and all the elders of Egypt went with Joseph. 
GEN.50.8	Everyone who lived with Joseph and his brothers went with him, as well as everyone who lived with his father. They left only their children, their flocks, and their herds in the land of Goshen. 
GEN.50.9	They went with Joseph in chariots and on horses. It was a very large group.
GEN.50.10	When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan River, they cried loudly and bitterly for his father. Joseph’s time of sorrow continued for seven days. 
GEN.50.11	The people that lived in Canaan saw the sadness at the threshing floor of Atad and said, “Those Egyptians are showing great sorrow!” So now that place is named Sorrow of the Egyptians.
GEN.50.12	So Jacob’s sons did as their father commanded. 
GEN.50.13	They carried his body to the land of Canaan and buried it in the cave in the field of Machpelah near Mamre. Abraham had bought this cave and field from Ephron the Hittite to use as a burial place. 
GEN.50.14	After Joseph buried his father, he returned to Egypt, along with his brothers and everyone who had gone with him to bury his father.
GEN.50.15	After Jacob died, Joseph’s brothers said, “What if Joseph is still angry with us? We did many wrong things to him. What if he plans to pay us back?” 
GEN.50.16	So they sent a message to Joseph that said, “Your father gave this command before he died. 
GEN.50.17	He said to us, ‘You have done wrong and have sinned and done evil to Joseph. Tell Joseph to forgive you, his brothers.’ So now, Joseph, we beg you to forgive our wrong. We are the servants of the God of your father.” When Joseph received the message, he cried.
GEN.50.18	And his brothers went to him and bowed low before him and said, “We are your slaves.”
GEN.50.19	Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t be afraid. Can I do what only God can do? 
GEN.50.20	You meant to hurt me, but God turned your evil into good to save the lives of many people, which is being done. 
GEN.50.21	So don’t be afraid. I will take care of you and your children.” So Joseph comforted his brothers and spoke kind words to them.
GEN.50.22	Joseph continued to live in Egypt with all his father’s family. He died when he was one hundred ten years old. 
GEN.50.23	During Joseph’s life Ephraim had children and grandchildren, and Joseph’s son Manasseh had a son named Makir. Joseph accepted Makir’s children as his own.
GEN.50.24	Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will take care of you. He will lead you out of this land to the land he promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.” 
GEN.50.25	Then Joseph had the sons of Israel make a promise. He said, “Promise me that you will carry my bones with you out of Egypt.”
GEN.50.26	Joseph died when he was one hundred ten years old. Doctors prepared his body for burial, and then they put him in a coffin in Egypt.
EXO.1.1	When Jacob went to Egypt, he took his sons, and each son took his own family with him. These are the names of the sons of Israel: 
EXO.1.2	Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 
EXO.1.3	Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin, 
EXO.1.4	Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
EXO.1.5	There was a total of seventy people who were descendants of Jacob. Jacob’s son Joseph was already in Egypt.
EXO.1.6	Some time later, Joseph and his brothers died, along with all the people who had lived at that same time. 
EXO.1.7	But the people of Israel had many children, and their number grew greatly. They became very strong, and the country of Egypt was filled with them.
EXO.1.8	Then a new king began to rule Egypt, who did not know who Joseph was. 
EXO.1.9	This king said to his people, “Look! The people of Israel are too many and too strong for us to handle! 
EXO.1.10	If we don’t make plans against them, the number of their people will grow even more. Then if there is a war, they might join our enemies and fight us and escape from the country!”
EXO.1.11	So the Egyptians made life hard for the Israelites. They put slave masters over them, who forced the Israelites to build the cities Pithom and Rameses as supply centers for the king. 
EXO.1.12	But the harder the Egyptians forced the Israelites to work, the more the Israelites grew in number and spread out. So the Egyptians became very afraid of them 
EXO.1.13	and demanded even more of them. 
EXO.1.14	They made their lives bitter. They forced the Israelites to work hard to make bricks and mortar and to do all kinds of work in the fields. The Egyptians were not merciful to them in all their painful work.
EXO.1.15	Two Hebrew nurses, named Shiphrah and Puah, helped the Israelite women give birth to their babies. The king of Egypt said to the nurses, 
EXO.1.16	“When you are helping the Hebrew women give birth to their babies, watch! If the baby is a girl, let her live, but if it is a boy, kill him!” 
EXO.1.17	But the nurses feared God, so they did not do as the king told them; they let all the boy babies live. 
EXO.1.18	Then the king of Egypt sent for the nurses and said, “Why did you do this? Why did you let the boys live?”
EXO.1.19	The nurses said to him, “The Hebrew women are much stronger than the Egyptian women. They give birth to their babies before we can get there.” 
EXO.1.20	God was good to the nurses. And the Hebrew people continued to grow in number, so they became even stronger. 
EXO.1.21	Because the nurses feared God, he gave them families of their own.
EXO.1.22	So the king commanded all his people, “Every time a boy is born to the Hebrews, you must throw him into the Nile River, but let all the girl babies live.”
EXO.2.1	Now a man from the family of Levi married a woman who was also from the family of Levi. 
EXO.2.2	She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. When she saw how wonderful the baby was, she hid him for three months. 
EXO.2.3	But after three months she was not able to hide the baby any longer, so she got a basket made of reeds and covered it with tar so that it would float. She put the baby in the basket. Then she put the basket among the tall stalks of grass at the edge of the Nile River. 
EXO.2.4	The baby’s sister stood a short distance away to see what would happen to him.
EXO.2.5	Then the daughter of the king of Egypt came to the river to take a bath, and her servant girls were walking beside the river. When she saw the basket in the tall grass, she sent her slave girl to get it. 
EXO.2.6	The king’s daughter opened the basket and saw the baby boy. He was crying, so she felt sorry for him and said, “This is one of the Hebrew babies.”
EXO.2.7	Then the baby’s sister asked the king’s daughter, “Would you like me to go and find a Hebrew woman to nurse the baby for you?”
EXO.2.8	The king’s daughter said, “Go!” So the girl went and got the baby’s own mother.
EXO.2.9	The king’s daughter said to the woman, “Take this baby and nurse him for me, and I will pay you.” So the woman took her baby and nursed him. 
EXO.2.10	When the child grew older, the woman took him to the king’s daughter, and she adopted the baby as her own son. The king’s daughter named him Moses, because she had pulled him out of the water.
EXO.2.11	Moses grew and became a man. One day he visited his people and saw that they were forced to work very hard. He saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew man, one of Moses’ own people. 
EXO.2.12	Moses looked all around and saw that no one was watching, so he killed the Egyptian and hid his body in the sand.
EXO.2.13	The next day Moses returned and saw two Hebrew men fighting each other. He said to the one that was in the wrong, “Why are you hitting one of your own people?”
EXO.2.14	The man answered, “Who made you our ruler and judge? Are you going to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?”
EXO.2.14	Moses was afraid and thought, “Now everyone knows what I did.”
EXO.2.15	When the king heard what Moses had done, he tried to kill him. But Moses ran away from the king and went to live in the land of Midian. There he sat down near a well.
EXO.2.16	There was a priest in Midian who had seven daughters. His daughters went to that well to get water to fill the water troughs for their father’s flock. 
EXO.2.17	Some shepherds came and chased the girls away, but Moses defended the girls and watered their flock.
EXO.2.18	When they went back to their father Reuel, he asked them, “Why have you come home early today?”
EXO.2.19	The girls answered, “The shepherds chased us away, but an Egyptian defended us. He got water for us and watered our flock.”
EXO.2.20	He asked his daughters, “Where is this man? Why did you leave him? Invite him to eat with us.”
EXO.2.21	Moses agreed to stay with Jethro, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses to be his wife. 
EXO.2.22	Zipporah gave birth to a son. Moses named him Gershom, because Moses was a stranger in a land that was not his own.
EXO.2.23	After a long time, the king of Egypt died. The people of Israel groaned, because they were forced to work very hard. When they cried for help, God heard them. 
EXO.2.24	God heard their cries, and he remembered the agreement he had made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
EXO.2.25	He saw the troubles of the people of Israel, and he was concerned about them.
EXO.3.1	One day Moses was taking care of Jethro’s flock. (Jethro was the priest of Midian and also Moses’ father-in-law.) When Moses led the flock to the west side of the desert, he came to Sinai, the mountain of God. 
EXO.3.2	There the angel of the L
EXO.3.3	So he said, “I will go closer to this strange thing. How can a bush continue burning without burning up?”
EXO.3.4	When the L
EXO.3.4	And Moses said, “Here I am.”
EXO.3.5	Then God said, “Do not come any closer. Take off your sandals, because you are standing on holy ground. 
EXO.3.6	I am the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Moses covered his face because he was afraid to look at God.
EXO.3.7	The L
EXO.3.8	and I have come down to save them from the Egyptians. I will bring them out of that land and lead them to a good land with lots of room—a fertile land. It is the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
EXO.3.9	I have heard the cries of the people of Israel, and I have seen the way the Egyptians have made life hard for them. 
EXO.3.10	So now I am sending you to the king of Egypt. Go! Bring my people, the Israelites, out of Egypt!”
EXO.3.11	But Moses said to God, “I am not a great man! How can I go to the king and lead the Israelites out of Egypt?”
EXO.3.12	God said, “I will be with you. This will be the proof that I am sending you: After you lead the people out of Egypt, all of you will worship me on this mountain.”
EXO.3.13	Moses said to God, “When I go to the Israelites, I will say to them, ‘The God of your ancestors sent me to you.’ What if the people say, ‘What is his name?’ What should I tell them?”
EXO.3.14	Then God said to Moses, “I 
EXO.3.15	God also said to Moses, “This is what you should tell the people: ‘The L
EXO.3.16	“Go and gather the elders and tell them this: ‘The L
EXO.3.17	I promised I would take you out of your troubles in Egypt. I will lead you to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites—a fertile land.’
EXO.3.18	“The elders will listen to you. And then you and the elders of Israel will go to the king of Egypt and tell him, ‘The L
EXO.3.19	“But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go. Only a great power will force him to let you go, 
EXO.3.20	so I will use my great power against Egypt. I will strike Egypt with all the miracles that will happen in that land. After I do that, he will let you go. 
EXO.3.21	I will cause the Egyptians to think well of the Israelites. So when you leave, they will give gifts to your people. 
EXO.3.22	Each woman should ask her Egyptian neighbor and any Egyptian woman living in her house for gifts—silver, gold, and clothing. You should put those gifts on your children when you leave Egypt. In this way you will take with you the riches of the Egyptians.”
EXO.4.1	Then Moses answered, “What if the people of Israel do not believe me or listen to me? What if they say, ‘The L
EXO.4.2	The L
EXO.4.2	Moses answered, “It is my walking stick.”
EXO.4.3	The L
EXO.4.3	So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a snake. Moses ran from the snake, 
EXO.4.4	but the L
EXO.4.5	The L
EXO.4.6	Then the L
EXO.4.7	Then he said, “Now put your hand inside your coat again.” So Moses put his hand inside his coat again. When he took it out, his hand was healthy again, like the rest of his skin.
EXO.4.8	Then the L
EXO.4.9	After these two miracles, if they still do not believe or listen to you, take some water from the Nile River and pour it on the dry ground. The water will become blood when it touches the ground.”
EXO.4.10	But Moses said to the L
EXO.4.11	Then the L
EXO.4.12	Now go! I will help you speak, and I will teach you what to say.”
EXO.4.13	But Moses said, “Please, Lord, send someone else.”
EXO.4.14	The L
EXO.4.15	You will speak to Aaron and tell him what to say. I will help both of you to speak and will teach you what to do. 
EXO.4.16	Aaron will speak to the people for you. You will tell him what God says, and he will speak for you. 
EXO.4.17	Take your walking stick with you, and use it to do the miracles.”
EXO.4.18	Moses went back to Jethro, his father-in-law, and said to him, “Let me go back to my people in Egypt. I want to see if they are still alive.”
EXO.4.18	Jethro said to Moses, “Go! I wish you well.”
EXO.4.19	While Moses was still in Midian, the L
EXO.4.20	So Moses took his wife and his sons, put them on a donkey, and started back to Egypt. He took with him the walking stick of God.
EXO.4.21	The L
EXO.4.22	Then say to the king, ‘This is what the L
EXO.4.23	I told you to let my son go so he may worship me. But you refused to let Israel go, so I will kill your firstborn son.’ ”
EXO.4.24	As Moses was on his way to Egypt, he stopped at a resting place for the night. The L
EXO.4.25	But Zipporah took a flint knife and circumcised her son. Taking the skin, she touched Moses’ feet with it and said to him, “You are a bridegroom of blood to me.” 
EXO.4.26	She said, “You are a bridegroom of blood,” because she had to circumcise her son. So the L
EXO.4.27	Meanwhile the L
EXO.4.28	Moses told Aaron everything the L
EXO.4.29	Moses and Aaron gathered all the elders of the Israelites, 
EXO.4.30	and Aaron told them everything that the L
EXO.4.31	and the Israelites believed. When they heard that the L
EXO.5.1	After Moses and Aaron talked to the people, they went to the king of Egypt and said, “This is what the L
EXO.5.2	But the king of Egypt said, “Who is the L
EXO.5.3	Then Aaron and Moses said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Now let us travel three days into the desert to offer sacrifices to the L
EXO.5.4	But the king said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why are you taking the people away from their work? Go back to your jobs! 
EXO.5.5	There are very many Hebrews, and now you want them to quit working!”
EXO.5.6	That same day the king gave a command to the slave masters and foremen. 
EXO.5.7	He said, “Don’t give the people straw to make bricks as you used to do. Let them gather their own straw. 
EXO.5.8	But they must still make the same number of bricks as they did before. Do not accept fewer. They have become lazy, and that is why they are asking me, ‘Let us go to offer sacrifices to our God.’ 
EXO.5.9	Make these people work harder and keep them busy; then they will not have time to listen to the lies of Moses.”
EXO.5.10	So the slave masters and foremen went to the Israelites and said, “This is what the king says: I will no longer give you straw. 
EXO.5.11	Go and get your own straw wherever you can find it. But you must make as many bricks as you made before.” 
EXO.5.12	So the people went everywhere in Egypt looking for dry stalks to use for straw. 
EXO.5.13	The slave masters kept forcing the people to work harder. They said, “You must make just as many bricks as you did when you were given straw.” 
EXO.5.14	The king’s slave masters had made the Israelite foremen responsible for the work the people did. The Egyptian slave masters beat these men and asked them, “Why aren’t you making as many bricks as you made in the past?”
EXO.5.15	Then the Israelite foremen went to the king and complained, “Why are you treating us, your servants, this way? 
EXO.5.16	You give us no straw, but we are commanded to make bricks. Our slave masters beat us, but it is your own people’s fault.”
EXO.5.17	The king answered, “You are lazy! You don’t want to work! That is why you ask to leave here and make sacrifices to the L
EXO.5.18	Now, go back to work! We will not give you any straw, but you must make just as many bricks as you did before.”
EXO.5.19	The Israelite foremen knew they were in trouble, because the king had told them, “You must make just as many bricks each day as you did before.” 
EXO.5.20	As they were leaving the meeting with the king, they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them. 
EXO.5.21	So they said to Moses and Aaron, “May the L
EXO.5.22	Then Moses returned to the L
EXO.5.23	I went to the king and said what you told me to say, but ever since that time he has made the people suffer. And you have done nothing to save them.”
EXO.6.1	Then the L
EXO.6.2	Then God said to Moses, “I am the L
EXO.6.3	I appeared to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by the name God Almighty, but they did not know me by my name, the L
EXO.6.4	I also made my agreement with them to give them the land of Canaan. They lived in that land, but it was not their own. 
EXO.6.5	Now I have heard the cries of the Israelites, whom the Egyptians are treating as slaves, and I remember my agreement. 
EXO.6.6	So tell the people of Israel that I say to them, ‘I am the L
EXO.6.7	I will make you my own people, and I will be your God. You will know that I am the L
EXO.6.8	I will lead you to the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and I will give you that land to own. I am the L
EXO.6.9	So Moses told this to the Israelites, but they would not listen to him. They were discouraged, and their slavery was hard.
EXO.6.10	Then the L
EXO.6.11	“Go tell the king of Egypt that he must let the Israelites leave his land.”
EXO.6.12	But Moses answered, “The Israelites will not listen to me, so surely the king will not listen to me either. I am not a good speaker.”
EXO.6.13	But the L
EXO.6.14	These are the leaders of the families of Israel:
EXO.6.14	Israel’s first son, Reuben, had four sons: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. These are the family groups of Reuben.
EXO.6.15	Simeon’s sons were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman. These are the family groups of Simeon.
EXO.6.16	Levi lived one hundred thirty-seven years. These are the names of his sons according to their family history: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
EXO.6.17	Gershon had two sons, Libni and Shimei, with their families.
EXO.6.18	Kohath lived one hundred thirty-three years. The sons of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
EXO.6.19	The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi.
EXO.6.19	These are the family groups of Levi, according to their family history.
EXO.6.20	Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, who gave birth to Aaron and Moses. Amram lived one hundred thirty-seven years.
EXO.6.21	Izhar’s sons were Korah, Nepheg, and Zicri.
EXO.6.22	Uzziel’s sons were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
EXO.6.23	Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon. Elisheba gave birth to Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
EXO.6.24	The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the family groups of the Korahites.
EXO.6.25	Eleazar son of Aaron married a daughter of Putiel, and she gave birth to Phinehas.
EXO.6.25	These are the leaders of the family groups of the Levites.
EXO.6.26	This was the Aaron and Moses to whom the L
EXO.6.27	Aaron and Moses are the ones who talked to the king of Egypt and told him to let the Israelites leave Egypt.
EXO.6.28	The L
EXO.6.29	and said, “I am the L
EXO.6.30	But Moses answered, “I am not a good speaker. The king will not listen to me.”
EXO.7.1	The L
EXO.7.2	Tell Aaron your brother everything that I command you, and let him tell the king of Egypt to let the Israelites leave his country. 
EXO.7.3	But I will make the king stubborn. I will do many miracles in Egypt, 
EXO.7.4	but he will still refuse to listen. So then I will punish Egypt terribly, and I will lead my divisions, my people the Israelites, out of that land. 
EXO.7.5	I will punish Egypt with my power, and I will bring the Israelites out of that land. Then they will know I am the L
EXO.7.6	Moses and Aaron did just as the L
EXO.7.7	Moses was eighty years old and Aaron was eighty-three when they spoke to the king.
EXO.7.8	The L
EXO.7.9	“Moses, when the king asks you to do a miracle, tell Aaron to throw his walking stick down in front of the king, and it will become a snake.”
EXO.7.10	So Moses and Aaron went to the king as the L
EXO.7.11	So the king called in his wise men and his magicians, and with their tricks the Egyptian magicians were able to do the same thing. 
EXO.7.12	They threw their walking sticks on the ground, and their sticks became snakes. But Aaron’s stick swallowed theirs. 
EXO.7.13	Still the king was stubborn and refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the L
EXO.7.14	Then the L
EXO.7.15	In the morning the king will go out to the Nile River. Go meet him by the edge of the river, and take with you the walking stick that became a snake. 
EXO.7.16	Tell him: The L
EXO.7.17	This is what the L
EXO.7.18	Then the fish in the Nile will die, and the river will begin to stink. The Egyptians will not be able to drink the water from the Nile.’ ”
EXO.7.19	The L
EXO.7.20	So Moses and Aaron did just as the L
EXO.7.21	The fish in the Nile died, and the river began to stink, so the Egyptians could not drink water from it. Blood was everywhere in the land of Egypt.
EXO.7.22	Using their tricks, the magicians of Egypt did the same thing. So the king was stubborn and refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the L
EXO.7.23	The king turned and went into his palace and ignored what Moses and Aaron had done. 
EXO.7.24	The Egyptians could not drink the water from the Nile, so all of them dug along the bank of the river, looking for water to drink.
EXO.7.25	Seven days passed after the L
EXO.8.1	Then the L
EXO.8.2	If you refuse, I will punish Egypt with frogs. 
EXO.8.3	The Nile River will be filled with frogs. They will come up into your palace, into your bedroom, on your bed, into the houses of your officers, and onto your people. They will come into your ovens and into your baking pans. 
EXO.8.4	The frogs will jump all over you, your people, and your officers.’ ”
EXO.8.5	Then the L
EXO.8.6	So Aaron held his hand over all the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up out of the water and covered the land of Egypt. 
EXO.8.7	The magicians used their tricks to do the same thing, so even more frogs came up onto the land of Egypt.
EXO.8.8	The king called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Pray to the L
EXO.8.9	Moses said to the king, “Please set the time when I should pray for you, your people, and your officers. Then the frogs will leave you and your houses and will remain only in the Nile.”
EXO.8.10	The king answered, “Tomorrow.”
EXO.8.10	Moses said, “What you want will happen. By this you will know that there is no one like the L
EXO.8.11	The frogs will leave you, your houses, your officers, and your people. They will remain only in the Nile.”
EXO.8.12	After Moses and Aaron left the king, Moses asked the L
EXO.8.13	And the L
EXO.8.14	The Egyptians put them in piles, and the whole country began to stink. 
EXO.8.15	But when the king saw that they were free of the frogs, he became stubborn again. He did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the L
EXO.8.16	Then the L
EXO.8.17	They did this, and when Aaron raised the walking stick that was in his hand and struck the dust on the ground, everywhere in Egypt the dust changed into gnats. The gnats got on the people and animals. 
EXO.8.18	Using their tricks, the magicians tried to do the same thing, but they could not make the dust change into gnats. The gnats remained on the people and animals. 
EXO.8.19	So the magicians told the king that the power of God had done this. But the king was stubborn and refused to listen to them, just as the L
EXO.8.20	The L
EXO.8.21	If you don’t let them go, I will send swarms of flies into your houses. The flies will be on you, your officers, and your people. The houses of Egypt will be full of flies, and they will be all over the ground, too. 
EXO.8.22	But I will not treat the Israelites the same as the Egyptian people. There will not be any flies in the land of Goshen, where my people live. By this you will know that I, the L
EXO.8.23	I will treat my people differently from your people. This miracle will happen tomorrow.’ ”
EXO.8.24	So the L
EXO.8.25	The king called for Moses and Aaron and told them, “Offer sacrifices to your God here in this country.”
EXO.8.26	But Moses said, “It wouldn’t be right to do that, because the Egyptians hate the sacrifices we offer to the L
EXO.8.27	Let us make a three-day journey into the desert. We must offer sacrifices to the L
EXO.8.28	The king said, “I will let you go so that you may offer sacrifices to the L
EXO.8.29	Moses said, “I will leave and pray to the L
EXO.8.30	So Moses left the king and prayed to the L
EXO.8.31	and the L
EXO.8.32	But the king became stubborn again and did not let the people go.
EXO.9.1	Then the L
EXO.9.2	If you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them, 
EXO.9.3	the L
EXO.9.4	But the L
EXO.9.5	The L
EXO.9.6	The next day the L
EXO.9.7	The king sent people to see what had happened to the animals of Israel, and they found that not one of them had died. But the king was still stubborn and did not let the people go.
EXO.9.8	The L
EXO.9.9	The ashes will spread like dust through all the land of Egypt. They will cause boils to break out and become sores on the skin of people and animals everywhere in the land.”
EXO.9.10	So Moses and Aaron took ashes from a furnace and went and stood before the king. Moses threw ashes into the air, which caused boils to break out and become sores on people and animals. 
EXO.9.11	The magicians could not stand before Moses, because all the Egyptians had boils, even the magicians. 
EXO.9.12	But the L
EXO.9.13	Then the L
EXO.9.14	If you don’t, this time I will punish you, your officers, and your people, with all my power. Then you will know there is no one in the whole land like me. 
EXO.9.15	By now I could have used my power and caused a terrible disease that would have destroyed you and your people from the earth. 
EXO.9.16	But I have let you live for this reason: to show you my power so that my name will be talked about in all the earth. 
EXO.9.17	You are still against my people and do not want to let them go. 
EXO.9.18	So at this time tomorrow, I will send a terrible hailstorm, the worst in Egypt since it became a nation. 
EXO.9.19	Now send for your animals and whatever you have in the fields, and bring them into a safe place. The hail will fall on every person or animal that is still in the fields. If they have not been brought in, they will die.’ ” 
EXO.9.20	Some of the king’s officers respected the word of the L
EXO.9.21	But others ignored the L
EXO.9.22	The L
EXO.9.23	When Moses raised his walking stick toward the sky, the L
EXO.9.24	There was hail, and lightning flashed as it hailed—the worst hailstorm in Egypt since it had become a nation. 
EXO.9.25	The hail destroyed all the people and animals that were in the fields in all the land of Egypt. It also destroyed everything that grew in the fields and broke all the trees in the fields. 
EXO.9.26	The only place it did not hail was in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites lived.
EXO.9.27	The king sent for Moses and Aaron and told them, “This time I have sinned. The L
EXO.9.28	Pray to the L
EXO.9.29	Moses told the king, “When I leave the city, I will raise my hands to the L
EXO.9.30	But I know that you and your officers do not yet fear the L
EXO.9.31	The flax was in bloom, and the barley had ripened, so these crops were destroyed. 
EXO.9.32	But both wheat crops ripen later, so they were not destroyed.
EXO.9.33	Moses left the king and went outside the city. He raised his hands to the L
EXO.9.34	When the king saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, he sinned again, and he and his officers became stubborn. 
EXO.9.35	So the king became stubborn and refused to let the Israelites go, just as the L
EXO.10.1	The L
EXO.10.2	I also did this so you could tell your children and your grandchildren how I was hard on the Egyptians. Tell them about the miracles I did among them so that all of you will know that I am the L
EXO.10.3	So Moses and Aaron went to the king and told him, “This is what the L
EXO.10.4	If you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I will bring locusts into your country. 
EXO.10.5	They will cover the land so that no one will be able to see the ground. They will eat anything that was left from the hailstorm and the leaves from every tree growing in the field. 
EXO.10.6	They will fill your palaces and all your officers’ houses, as well as the houses of all the Egyptians. There will be more locusts than your fathers or ancestors have ever seen—more than there have been since people began living in Egypt.’ ” Then Moses turned and walked away from the king.
EXO.10.7	The king’s officers asked him, “How long will this man make trouble for us? Let the Israelites go to worship the L
EXO.10.8	So Moses and Aaron were brought back to the king. He said to them, “Go and worship the L
EXO.10.9	Moses answered, “We will go with our young and old people, our sons and daughters, and our flocks and herds, because we are going to have a feast to honor the L
EXO.10.10	The king said to them, “The L
EXO.10.11	No! Only the men may go and worship the L
EXO.10.12	The L
EXO.10.13	So Moses raised his walking stick over the land of Egypt, and the L
EXO.10.14	Swarms of locusts covered all the land of Egypt and settled everywhere. There were more locusts than ever before or after, 
EXO.10.15	and they covered the whole land so that it was black. They ate everything that was left after the hail—every plant in the field and all the fruit on the trees. Nothing green was left on any tree or plant anywhere in Egypt.
EXO.10.16	The king quickly called for Moses and Aaron. He said, “I have sinned against the L
EXO.10.17	Now forgive my sin this time. Pray to the L
EXO.10.18	Moses left the king and prayed to the L
EXO.10.19	So the L
EXO.10.20	But the L
EXO.10.21	Then the L
EXO.10.22	Moses raised his hand toward the sky, and total darkness was everywhere in Egypt for three days. 
EXO.10.23	No one could see anyone else, and no one could go anywhere for three days. But the Israelites had light where they lived.
EXO.10.24	Again the king of Egypt called for Moses. He said, “All of you may go and worship the L
EXO.10.25	Moses said, “You must let us have animals to use as sacrifices and burnt offerings, because we have to offer them to the L
EXO.10.26	So we must take our animals with us; not a hoof will be left behind. We have to use some of the animals to worship the L
EXO.10.27	But the L
EXO.10.28	Then he told Moses, “Get out of here, and don’t come again! The next time you see me, you will die.”
EXO.10.29	Then Moses told the king, “I’ll do what you say. I will not come to see you again.”
EXO.11.1	Now the L
EXO.11.2	Tell the men and women of Israel to ask their neighbors for things made of silver and gold.” 
EXO.11.3	The L
EXO.11.4	So Moses said to the king, “This is what the L
EXO.11.5	Every firstborn son in the land of Egypt will die—from the firstborn son of the king, who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl grinding grain. Also the firstborn farm animals will die. 
EXO.11.6	There will be loud outcries everywhere in Egypt, worse than any time before or after this. 
EXO.11.7	But not even a dog will bark at the Israelites or their animals.’ Then you will know that the L
EXO.11.8	All your officers will come to me. They will bow facedown to the ground before me and say, ‘Leave and take all your people with you.’ After that, I will leave.” Then Moses very angrily left the king.
EXO.11.9	The L
EXO.11.10	Moses and Aaron did all these great miracles in front of the king. But the L
EXO.12.1	The L
EXO.12.2	“This month will be the beginning of months, the first month of the year for you. 
EXO.12.3	Tell the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each man must get one lamb for the people in his house. 
EXO.12.4	If there are not enough people in his house to eat a whole lamb, he must share it with his closest neighbor, considering the number of people. There must be enough lamb for everyone to eat. 
EXO.12.5	The lamb must be a one-year-old male that has nothing wrong with it. This animal can be either a young sheep or a young goat. 
EXO.12.6	Take care of the animals until the fourteenth day of the month. On that day all the people of the community of Israel will kill them in the evening before dark. 
EXO.12.7	The people must take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs. 
EXO.12.8	On this night they must roast the lamb over a fire. They must eat it with bitter herbs and bread made without yeast. 
EXO.12.9	Do not eat the lamb raw or boiled in water. Roast the whole lamb over a fire—with its head, legs, and inner organs. 
EXO.12.10	You must not leave any of it until morning, but if any of it is left over until morning, you must burn it with fire.
EXO.12.11	“This is the way you must eat it: You must be fully dressed as if you were going on a trip. You must have your sandals on and your walking stick in your hand. You must eat it in a hurry; this is the L
EXO.12.12	“That night I will go through the land of Egypt and kill all the firstborn animals and people in the land of Egypt. I will also punish all the gods of Egypt. I am the L
EXO.12.13	But the blood will be a sign on the houses where you are. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. Nothing terrible will hurt you when I punish the land of Egypt.
EXO.12.14	“You are always to remember this day and celebrate it with a feast to the L
EXO.12.15	For this feast you must eat bread made without yeast for seven days. On the first day, you are to remove all the yeast from your houses. No one should eat any yeast for the full seven days of the feast, or that person will be cut off from Israel. 
EXO.12.16	You are to have holy meetings on the first and last days of the feast. You must not do any work on these days; the only work you may do is to prepare your meals. 
EXO.12.17	You must celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought your divisions of people out of Egypt. So all of your descendants must celebrate this day. This is a law that will last from now on. 
EXO.12.18	In the first month of the year you are to eat bread made without yeast, from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty-first day. 
EXO.12.19	For seven days there must not be any yeast in your houses. Anybody who eats yeast during this time, either an Israelite or non-Israelite, must be cut off from the community of Israel. 
EXO.12.20	During this feast you must not eat anything made with yeast. You must eat only bread made without yeast wherever you live.”
EXO.12.21	Then Moses called all the elders of Israel together and told them, “Get the animals for your families and kill the lamb for the Passover. 
EXO.12.22	Take a branch of the hyssop plant, dip it into the bowl filled with blood, and then wipe the blood on the sides and tops of the doorframes. No one may leave that house until morning. 
EXO.12.23	When the L
EXO.12.24	“You must keep this command as a law for you and your descendants from now on. 
EXO.12.25	Do this when you go to the land the L
EXO.12.26	When your children ask you, ‘Why are we doing these things?’ 
EXO.12.27	you will say, ‘This is the Passover sacrifice to honor the L
EXO.12.28	They did just as the L
EXO.12.29	At midnight the L
EXO.12.30	The king, his officers, and all the Egyptians got up during the night because someone had died in every house. So there was a loud outcry everywhere in Egypt.
EXO.12.31	During the night the king called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Get up and leave my people. You and your people may do as you have asked; go and worship the L
EXO.12.32	Take all of your flocks and herds as you have asked, and go. And also bless me.” 
EXO.12.33	The Egyptians also asked the Israelites to hurry and leave, saying, “If you don’t leave, we will all die!”
EXO.12.34	So the people took their dough before the yeast was added. They wrapped the bowls for making dough in clothing and carried them on their shoulders. 
EXO.12.35	The Israelites did what Moses told them to do and asked their Egyptian neighbors for things made of silver and gold and for clothing. 
EXO.12.36	The L
EXO.12.37	The Israelites traveled from Rameses to Succoth. There were about six hundred thousand men walking, not including the women and children. 
EXO.12.38	Many other people who were not Israelites went with them, as well as a large number of sheep, goats, and cattle. 
EXO.12.39	The Israelites used the dough they had brought out of Egypt to bake loaves of bread without yeast. The dough had no yeast in it, because they had been rushed out of Egypt and had no time to get food ready for their trip.
EXO.12.40	The people of Israel had lived in Egypt for four hundred thirty years; 
EXO.12.41	on the very day the four hundred thirty years ended, the L
EXO.12.42	That night the L
EXO.12.43	The L
EXO.12.44	If someone buys a slave and circumcises him, the slave may eat the Passover. 
EXO.12.45	But neither a person who lives for a short time in your country nor a hired worker may eat it.
EXO.12.46	“The meal must be eaten inside a house; take none of the meat outside the house. Don’t break any of the bones. 
EXO.12.47	The whole community of Israel must take part in this feast. 
EXO.12.48	A foreigner who lives with you may share in the L
EXO.12.49	The same rules apply to an Israelite born in the country or to a foreigner living there.”
EXO.12.50	So all the Israelites did just as the L
EXO.12.51	On that same day the L
EXO.13.1	Then the L
EXO.13.2	“Give every firstborn male to me. Every firstborn male among the Israelites belongs to me, whether human or animal.”
EXO.13.3	Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, the day you left Egypt. You were slaves in that land, but the L
EXO.13.4	Today, in the month of Abib, you are leaving Egypt. 
EXO.13.5	The L
EXO.13.6	For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast, and on the seventh day there will be a feast to honor the L
EXO.13.7	So for seven days you must not eat any bread made with yeast. There must be no bread made with yeast anywhere in your land. 
EXO.13.8	On that day you should tell your son: ‘We are having this feast because of what the L
EXO.13.9	This feast will help you remember, like a mark on your hand or a reminder on your forehead. This feast will remind you to speak the L
EXO.13.10	So celebrate this feast every year at the right time.
EXO.13.11	“And when the L
EXO.13.12	you must give him every firstborn male. Also every firstborn male animal must be given to the L
EXO.13.13	Buy back every firstborn donkey by offering a lamb. But if you don’t want to buy the donkey back, then break its neck. You must buy back from the L
EXO.13.14	“From now on when your son asks you, ‘What does this mean?’ you will answer, ‘With his great power, the L
EXO.13.15	The king of Egypt was stubborn and refused to let us leave. But the L
EXO.13.16	This feast is like a mark on your hand and a reminder on your forehead to help you remember that the L
EXO.13.17	When the king sent the people out of Egypt, God did not lead them on the road through the Philistine country, though that was the shortest way. God said, “If they have to fight, they might change their minds and go back to Egypt.” 
EXO.13.18	So God led them through the desert toward the Red Sea. The Israelites were dressed for fighting when they left the land of Egypt.
EXO.13.19	Moses carried the bones of Joseph with him, because before Joseph died, he had made the Israelites promise to do this. He had said, “When God saves you, remember to carry my bones with you out of Egypt.”
EXO.13.20	The Israelites left Succoth and camped at Etham, on the edge of the desert. 
EXO.13.21	The L
EXO.13.22	The pillar of cloud was always with them during the day, and the pillar of fire was always with them at night.
EXO.14.1	Then the L
EXO.14.2	“Tell the Israelites to turn back to Pi Hahiroth and to camp between Migdol and the Red Sea. Camp across from Baal Zephon, on the shore of the sea. 
EXO.14.3	The king will think, ‘The Israelites are lost, trapped by the desert.’ 
EXO.14.4	I will make the king stubborn again so he will chase after them, but I will defeat the king and his army. This will bring honor to me, and the Egyptians will know that I am the L
EXO.14.5	When the king of Egypt was told that the Israelites had left, he and his officers changed their minds about them. They said, “What have we done? We have let the Israelites leave. We have lost our slaves!” 
EXO.14.6	So the king prepared his war chariot and took his army with him. 
EXO.14.7	He took six hundred of his best chariots, together with all the other chariots of Egypt, each with an officer in it. 
EXO.14.8	The L
EXO.14.9	The Egyptians—with all the king’s horses, chariot drivers, and army—chased the Israelites. They caught up with them while they were camped by the Red Sea, near Pi Hahiroth and Baal Zephon.
EXO.14.10	When the Israelites saw the king and his army coming after them, they were very frightened and cried to the L
EXO.14.11	They said to Moses, “What have you done to us? Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in the desert? There were plenty of graves for us in Egypt. 
EXO.14.12	We told you in Egypt, ‘Let us alone; we will stay and serve the Egyptians.’ Now we will die in the desert.”
EXO.14.13	But Moses answered, “Don’t be afraid! Stand still and you will see the L
EXO.14.14	You only need to remain calm; the L
EXO.14.15	Then the L
EXO.14.16	Raise your walking stick and hold it over the sea so that the sea will split and the people can cross it on dry land. 
EXO.14.17	I will make the Egyptians stubborn so they will chase the Israelites, but I will be honored when I defeat the king and all of his chariot drivers and chariots. 
EXO.14.18	When I defeat the king, his chariot drivers, and chariots, the Egyptians will know that I am the L
EXO.14.19	Now the angel of God that usually traveled in front of Israel’s army moved behind them. Also, the pillar of cloud moved from in front of the people and stood behind them. 
EXO.14.20	So the cloud came between the Egyptians and the Israelites. This made it dark for the Egyptians but gave light to the Israelites. So the cloud kept the two armies apart all night.
EXO.14.21	Then Moses held his hand over the sea. All that night the L
EXO.14.22	and the Israelites went through the sea on dry land, with a wall of water on their right and on their left.
EXO.14.23	Then all the king’s horses, chariots, and chariot drivers followed them into the sea. 
EXO.14.24	When morning came, the L
EXO.14.25	He kept the wheels of the chariots from turning, making it hard to drive the chariots. The Egyptians shouted, “Let’s get away from the Israelites! The L
EXO.14.26	Then the L
EXO.14.27	So Moses raised his hand over the sea, and at dawn the sea returned to its place. The Egyptians tried to run from it, but the L
EXO.14.28	The water returned, covering the chariots, chariot drivers, and all the king’s army that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.
EXO.14.29	But the Israelites crossed the sea on dry land, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. 
EXO.14.30	So that day the L
EXO.14.31	When the Israelites saw the great power the L
EXO.15.1	Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the L
EXO.15.1	“I will sing to the L
EXO.15.1	because he is worthy of great honor.
EXO.15.1	He has thrown the horse and its rider
EXO.15.1	into the sea.
EXO.15.2	The L
EXO.15.2	he has saved me.
EXO.15.2	He is my God,

EXO.15.2	He is the God of my ancestors,

EXO.15.3	The L
EXO.15.3	the L
EXO.15.4	The chariots and soldiers of the king of Egypt
EXO.15.4	he has thrown into the sea.
EXO.15.4	The king’s best officers
EXO.15.4	are drowned in the Red Sea.
EXO.15.5	The deep waters covered them,
EXO.15.5	and they sank to the bottom like a rock.
EXO.15.6	Your right hand, L
EXO.15.6	is amazingly strong.
EXO.15.6	L
EXO.15.6	broke the enemy to pieces.
EXO.15.7	In your great victory
EXO.15.7	you destroyed those who were against you.
EXO.15.7	Your anger destroyed them,
EXO.15.7	like fire burning straw.
EXO.15.8	Just a blast of your breath,
EXO.15.8	and the waters piled up.
EXO.15.8	The moving water stood like a wall;
EXO.15.8	the deep waters became solid in the middle of the sea.
EXO.15.9	“The enemy bragged,
EXO.15.9	‘I’ll chase them and catch them.
EXO.15.9	I’ll take all their riches;
EXO.15.9	I’ll take all I want.
EXO.15.9	I’ll pull out my sword,
EXO.15.9	and my hand will destroy them.’
EXO.15.10	But you blew on them with your breath
EXO.15.10	and covered them with the sea.
EXO.15.10	They sank like lead
EXO.15.10	in the raging water.
EXO.15.11	“Are there any gods like you, L
EXO.15.11	There are no gods like you.
EXO.15.11	You are wonderfully holy,
EXO.15.11	amazingly powerful,
EXO.15.11	a worker of miracles.
EXO.15.12	You reached out with your right hand,
EXO.15.12	and the earth swallowed our enemies.
EXO.15.13	You keep your loving promise
EXO.15.13	and lead the people you have saved.

EXO.15.14	“The other nations will hear this and tremble with fear;
EXO.15.14	terror will take hold of the Philistines.
EXO.15.15	The leaders of the tribes of Edom will be very frightened;
EXO.15.15	the powerful men of Moab will shake with fear;
EXO.15.15	the people of Canaan will lose all their courage.
EXO.15.16	Terror and horror will fall on them.
EXO.15.16	When they see your strength,
EXO.15.16	they will be as still as a rock.
EXO.15.16	They will be still until your people pass by, L
EXO.15.16	They will be still until the people you have taken as your own pass by.
EXO.15.17	You will lead your people and place them
EXO.15.17	on your very own mountain,
EXO.15.17	the place that you, L
EXO.15.17	the temple, Lord, that your hands have made.
EXO.15.18	The L
EXO.15.19	The horses, chariot drivers, and chariots of the king of Egypt went into the sea, and the L
EXO.15.20	Then Aaron’s sister Miriam, a prophetess, took a tambourine in her hand. All the women followed her, playing tambourines and dancing. 
EXO.15.21	Miriam told them:
EXO.15.21	“Sing to the L
EXO.15.21	because he is worthy of great honor;
EXO.15.21	he has thrown the horse and its rider
EXO.15.21	into the sea.”
EXO.15.22	Moses led the Israelites away from the Red Sea into the Desert of Shur. They traveled for three days in the desert but found no water. 
EXO.15.23	Then they came to Marah, where there was water, but they could not drink it because it was too bitter. (That is why the place was named Marah.) 
EXO.15.24	The people grumbled to Moses and asked, “What will we drink?”
EXO.15.25	So Moses cried out to the L
EXO.15.25	There the L
EXO.15.26	He said, “You must obey the L
EXO.15.27	Then the people traveled to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees. So the people camped there near the water.
EXO.16.1	The whole Israelite community left Elim and came to the Desert of Sin, which was between Elim and Sinai; they arrived there on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had left Egypt. 
EXO.16.2	Then the whole Israelite community grumbled to Moses and Aaron in the desert. 
EXO.16.3	They said to them, “It would have been better if the L
EXO.16.4	Then the L
EXO.16.5	On the sixth day of each week, they are to gather twice as much as they gather on other days. Then they are to prepare it.”
EXO.16.6	So Moses and Aaron said to all the Israelites: “This evening you will know that the L
EXO.16.7	Tomorrow morning you will see the glory of the L
EXO.16.8	And Moses said, “Each evening the L
EXO.16.9	Then Moses said to Aaron, “Speak to the whole community of the Israelites, and say to them, ‘Meet together in the presence of the L
EXO.16.10	While Aaron was speaking to the whole community of the Israelites, they looked toward the desert. There the glory of the L
EXO.16.11	The L
EXO.16.12	“I have heard the grumblings of the people of Israel. So tell them, ‘At twilight you will eat meat, and every morning you will eat all the bread you want. Then you will know I am the L
EXO.16.13	That evening quail came and covered the camp, and in the morning dew lay around the camp. 
EXO.16.14	When the dew was gone, thin flakes like frost were on the desert ground. 
EXO.16.15	When the Israelites saw it, they asked each other, “What is it?” because they did not know what it was.
EXO.16.15	So Moses told them, “This is the bread the L
EXO.16.16	The L
EXO.16.17	So the people of Israel did this; some people gathered much, and some gathered little. 
EXO.16.18	Then they measured it. The person who gathered more did not have too much, nor did the person who gathered less have too little. Each person gathered just as much as he needed.
EXO.16.19	Moses said to them, “Don’t keep any of it to eat the next day.” 
EXO.16.20	But some of the people did not listen to Moses and kept part of it to eat the next morning. It became full of worms and began to stink, so Moses was angry with those people.
EXO.16.21	Every morning each person gathered as much food as he needed, but when the sun became hot, it melted away.
EXO.16.22	On the sixth day the people gathered twice as much food—four quarts for every person. When all the leaders of the community came and told this to Moses, 
EXO.16.23	he said to them, “This is what the L
EXO.16.24	So the people saved it until the next morning, as Moses had commanded, and none of it began to stink or have worms in it. 
EXO.16.25	Moses told the people, “Eat the food you gathered yesterday. Today is a Sabbath, the L
EXO.16.26	You should gather the food for six days, but the seventh day is a Sabbath day. On that day there will not be any food on the ground.”
EXO.16.27	On the seventh day some of the people went out to gather food, but they couldn’t find any. 
EXO.16.28	Then the L
EXO.16.29	Look, the L
EXO.16.30	So the people rested on the seventh day.
EXO.16.31	The people of Israel called the food manna. It was like small white seeds and tasted like wafers made with honey.
EXO.16.32	Then Moses said, “The L
EXO.16.33	Moses told Aaron, “Take a jar and fill it with two quarts of manna. Then place it before the L
EXO.16.34	So Aaron did what the L
EXO.16.35	The Israelites ate manna for forty years, until they came to the land where they settled—the edge of the land of Canaan. 
EXO.16.36	The measure they used for the manna was two quarts, or one-tenth of an ephah.
EXO.17.1	The whole Israelite community left the Desert of Sin and traveled from place to place, as the L
EXO.17.2	So they quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water to drink.”
EXO.17.2	Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why are you testing the L
EXO.17.3	But the people were very thirsty for water, so they grumbled against Moses. They said, “Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Was it to kill us, our children, and our farm animals with thirst?”
EXO.17.4	So Moses cried to the L
EXO.17.5	The L
EXO.17.6	I will stand in front of you on a rock at Mount Sinai. Hit that rock with the stick, and water will come out of it so that the people can drink.” Moses did these things as the elders of Israel watched. 
EXO.17.7	He named that place Massah, because the Israelites tested the L
EXO.17.8	At Rephidim the Amalekites came and fought the Israelites. 
EXO.17.9	So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose some men and go and fight the Amalekites. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill, holding the walking stick of God in my hands.”
EXO.17.10	Joshua obeyed Moses and went to fight the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went to the top of the hill. 
EXO.17.11	As long as Moses held his hands up, the Israelites would win the fight, but when Moses put his hands down, the Amalekites would win. 
EXO.17.12	Later, when Moses’ arms became tired, the men put a large rock under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur held up Moses’ hands—Aaron on one side and Hur on the other. They kept his hands steady until the sun went down. 
EXO.17.13	So Joshua defeated the Amalekites in this battle.
EXO.17.14	Then the L
EXO.17.15	Then Moses built an altar and named it The L
EXO.17.16	Moses said, “I lifted my hands toward the L
EXO.18.1	Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, was the priest of Midian. He heard about everything that God had done for Moses and his people, the Israelites, and how the L
EXO.18.2	Now Moses had sent his wife Zipporah to Jethro, his father-in-law, 
EXO.18.3	along with his two sons. The first son was named Gershom, because when he was born, Moses said, “I am a stranger in a foreign country.” 
EXO.18.4	The other son was named Eliezer, because when he was born, Moses said, “The God of my father is my help. He saved me from the king of Egypt.”
EXO.18.5	So Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Moses’ wife and his two sons and went to Moses. He was camped in the desert near the mountain of God. 
EXO.18.6	Jethro had sent a message ahead to Moses that said, “I, Jethro, your father-in-law, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons.”
EXO.18.7	So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law and bowed down and kissed him. After the two men asked about each other’s health, they went into Moses’ tent. 
EXO.18.8	Moses told his father-in-law everything the L
EXO.18.9	Jethro was very happy to hear all the good things the L
EXO.18.10	He said, “Praise the L
EXO.18.11	Now I know the L
EXO.18.12	Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, gave a whole burnt offering and other sacrifices to God. Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to Moses’ father-in-law to eat the holy meal together before God.
EXO.18.13	The next day Moses solved disagreements among the people, and the people stood around him from morning until night. 
EXO.18.14	When Moses’ father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he asked, “What is all this you are doing for the people? Why are you the only one to solve disagreements? All the people are standing around you from morning until night!”
EXO.18.15	Then Moses said to his father-in-law, “It is because the people come to me for God’s help in solving their disagreements. 
EXO.18.16	When people have a disagreement, they come to me, and I decide who is right. I tell them God’s laws and teachings.”
EXO.18.17	Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “You are not doing this right. 
EXO.18.18	You and the people who come to you will get too tired. This is too much work for you; you can’t do it by yourself. 
EXO.18.19	Now listen to me, and I will give you some advice. I want God to be with you. You must speak to God for the people and tell him about their disagreements. 
EXO.18.20	Warn them about the laws and teachings, and teach them the right way to live and what they should do. 
EXO.18.21	But choose some capable men from among the people—men who respect God, who can be trusted, and who will not change their decisions for money. Make these men officers over the people, to rule over groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 
EXO.18.22	Let these officers solve the disagreements among the people all the time. They can bring the hard cases to you, but they can decide the simple cases themselves. That will make it easier for you, because they will share the work with you. 
EXO.18.23	If you do this as God commands you, then you will be able to do your job, and all the people will go home with their disagreements solved.”
EXO.18.24	So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 
EXO.18.25	He chose capable men from all the Israelites and made them leaders over the people; they were officers over groups of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 
EXO.18.26	These officers solved disagreements among the people all the time. They brought the hard cases to Moses, but they decided the simple cases themselves.
EXO.18.27	So Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and Jethro went back to his own home.
EXO.19.1	Exactly three months after the Israelites had left Egypt, they reached the Desert of Sinai. 
EXO.19.2	When they left Rephidim, they came to the Desert of Sinai and camped in the desert in front of the mountain. 
EXO.19.3	Then Moses went up on the mountain to God. The L
EXO.19.4	‘Every one of you has seen what I did to the people of Egypt. You saw how I carried you out of Egypt, as if on eagle’s wings. And I brought you here to me. 
EXO.19.5	So now if you obey me and keep my agreement, you will be my own possession, chosen from all nations. Even though the whole earth is mine, 
EXO.19.6	you will be my kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ You must tell the Israelites these words.”
EXO.19.7	So Moses went down and called the elders of the people together. He told them all the words the L
EXO.19.8	All the people answered together, “We will do everything he has said.” Then Moses took their answer back to the L
EXO.19.9	And the L
EXO.19.10	The L
EXO.19.11	and be ready by the day after tomorrow. On that day I, the L
EXO.19.12	But you must set a limit around the mountain that the people are not to cross. Tell them not to go up on the mountain and not to touch the foot of it. Anyone who touches the mountain must be put to death 
EXO.19.13	with stones or shot with arrows. No one is allowed to touch him. Whether it is a person or an animal, he will not live. But the trumpet will make a long blast, and only then may the people go up on the mountain.”
EXO.19.14	After Moses went down from the mountain to the people, he made them prepare themselves for service to God, and they washed their clothes. 
EXO.19.15	Then Moses said to the people, “Be ready in three days. Do not have sexual relations during this time.”
EXO.19.16	On the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning with a thick cloud on the mountain. There was a very loud blast from a trumpet, and all the people in the camp trembled. 
EXO.19.17	Then Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain. 
EXO.19.18	Mount Sinai was covered with smoke, because the L
EXO.19.19	The sound from the trumpet became louder. Then Moses spoke, and the voice of God answered him.
EXO.19.20	When the L
EXO.19.21	The L
EXO.19.22	Even the priests, who may come near me, must first prepare themselves. If they don’t, I, the L
EXO.19.23	Moses told the L
EXO.19.24	The L
EXO.19.25	So Moses went down to the people and told them these things.
EXO.20.1	Then God spoke all these words:
EXO.20.2	“I am the L
EXO.20.3	“You must not have any other gods except me.
EXO.20.4	“You must not make for yourselves an idol that looks like anything in the sky above or on the earth below or in the water below the land. 
EXO.20.5	You must not worship or serve any idol, because I, the L
EXO.20.6	But I show kindness to thousands who love me and obey my commands.
EXO.20.7	“You must not use the name of the L
EXO.20.8	“Remember to keep the Sabbath holy. 
EXO.20.9	Work and get everything done during six days each week, 
EXO.20.10	but the seventh day is a day of rest to honor the L
EXO.20.11	The reason is that in six days the L
EXO.20.12	“Honor your father and your mother so that you will live a long time in the land that the L
EXO.20.13	“You must not murder anyone.
EXO.20.14	“You must not be guilty of adultery.
EXO.20.15	“You must not steal.
EXO.20.16	“You must not tell lies about your neighbor.
EXO.20.17	“You must not want to take your neighbor’s house. You must not want his wife or his male or female slaves, or his ox or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
EXO.20.18	When the people heard the thunder and the trumpet, and when they saw the lightning and the smoke rising from the mountain, they shook with fear and stood far away from the mountain. 
EXO.20.19	Then they said to Moses, “Speak to us yourself, and we will listen. But don’t let God speak to us, or we will die.”
EXO.20.20	Then Moses said to the people, “Don’t be afraid, because God has come to test you. He wants you to respect him so you will not sin.”
EXO.20.21	The people stood far away from the mountain while Moses went near the dark cloud where God was. 
EXO.20.22	Then the L
EXO.20.23	You must not use gold or silver to make idols for yourselves; do not worship these gods in addition to me.
EXO.20.24	“Make an altar of dirt for me, and sacrifice on it your whole burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, your sheep and your cattle. Worship me in every place that I choose, and I will come and bless you. 
EXO.20.25	If you use stones to make an altar for me, don’t use stones that you have shaped with tools. When you use any tools on them, you make them unsuitable for use in worship. 
EXO.20.26	And you must not go up to my altar on steps, or people will be able to see under your clothes.”
EXO.21.1	Then God said to Moses, “These are the laws for living that you will give to the Israelites:
EXO.21.2	“If you buy a Hebrew slave, he will serve you for six years. In the seventh year you are to set him free, and he will have to pay nothing. 
EXO.21.3	If he is not married when he becomes your slave, he must leave without a wife. But if he is married when he becomes your slave, he may take his wife with him. 
EXO.21.4	If the slave’s master gives him a wife, and she gives birth to sons or daughters, the woman and her children will belong to the master. When the slave is set free, only he may leave.
EXO.21.5	“But if the slave says, ‘I love my master, my wife and my children, and I don’t want to go free,’ 
EXO.21.6	then the slave’s master must take him to God. The master is to take him to a door or doorframe and punch a hole through the slave’s ear using a sharp tool. Then the slave will serve that master all his life.
EXO.21.7	“If a man sells his daughter as a slave, the rules for setting her free are different from the rules for setting the male slaves free. 
EXO.21.8	If the master wanted to marry her but then decided he was not pleased with her, he must let one of her close relatives buy her back. He has no right to sell her to foreigners, because he has treated her unfairly. 
EXO.21.9	If the man who bought her promises to let the woman marry his son, he must treat her as a daughter. 
EXO.21.10	If the man who bought her marries another woman, he must not keep his first wife from having food or clothing or sexual relations. 
EXO.21.11	If he does not give her these three things, she may go free, and she owes him no money.
EXO.21.12	“Anyone who hits a person and kills him must be put to death. 
EXO.21.13	But if a person kills someone accidentally, God allowed that to happen, so the person must go to a place I will choose. 
EXO.21.14	But if someone plans and murders another person on purpose, put him to death, even if he has run to my altar for safety.
EXO.21.15	“Anyone who hits his father or his mother must be put to death.
EXO.21.16	“Anyone who kidnaps someone and either sells him as a slave or still has him when he is caught must be put to death.
EXO.21.17	“Anyone who says cruel things to his father or mother must be put to death.
EXO.21.18	“If two men argue, and one hits the other with a rock or with his fist, the one who is hurt but not killed might have to stay in bed. 
EXO.21.19	Later if he is able to get up and walk around outside with his walking stick, the one who hit him is not to be punished. But he must pay the injured man for the loss of his time, and he must support the injured man until he is completely healed.
EXO.21.20	“If a man beats his male or female slave with a stick, and the slave dies on the spot, the owner must be punished. 
EXO.21.21	But if the slave gets well after a day or two, the owner will not be punished since the slave belongs to him.
EXO.21.22	“Suppose two men are fighting and hit a pregnant woman, causing the baby to come out. If there is no further injury, the man who caused the accident must pay money—whatever amount the woman’s husband says and the court allows. 
EXO.21.23	But if there is further injury, then the punishment that must be paid is life for life, 
EXO.21.24	eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 
EXO.21.25	burn for burn, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise.
EXO.21.26	“If a man hits his male or female slave in the eye, and the eye is blinded, the man is to free the slave to pay for the eye. 
EXO.21.27	If a master knocks out a tooth of his male or female slave, the man is to free the slave to pay for the tooth.
EXO.21.28	“If a man’s bull kills a man or woman, you must kill that bull by throwing stones at it, and you should not eat the bull. But the owner of the bull is not guilty. 
EXO.21.29	However, suppose the bull has hurt people in the past and the owner, though warned, did not keep it in a pen. Then if it kills a man or woman, the bull must be stoned to death, and the owner must also be put to death. 
EXO.21.30	But if the family of the dead person accepts money, the one who owned the bull may buy back his life, but he must pay whatever is demanded. 
EXO.21.31	Use this same law if the bull kills a person’s son or daughter. 
EXO.21.32	If the bull kills a male or female slave, the owner must pay the master the price for a new slave, or twelve ounces of silver, and the bull must also be stoned to death.
EXO.21.33	“If a man takes the cover off a pit, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and another man’s ox or donkey comes and falls into it, 
EXO.21.34	the owner of the pit must pay the owner of the animal for the loss. The dead animal will belong to the one who pays.
EXO.21.35	“If a man’s bull kills another man’s bull, they must sell the bull that is alive. Both men will get half of the money and half of the bull that was killed. 
EXO.21.36	But if a person’s bull has hurt other animals in the past and the owner did not keep it in a pen, that owner must pay bull for bull, and the dead animal is his.
EXO.22.1	“If a man steals a bull or a sheep and kills or sells it, he must pay back five bulls for the one bull he stole and four sheep for the one sheep he stole.
EXO.22.2+EXO.22.3+EXO.22.4	“The robber who is caught must pay back what he stole. If he owns nothing, he must be sold as a slave to pay for what he stole. If the stolen animal is found alive with the robber, he must give the owner two animals for every animal he stole, whether it was a bull, donkey, or sheep.
EXO.22.2+EXO.22.3+EXO.22.4	“If a thief is killed while breaking into a house at night, the one who killed him is not guilty of murder. But if this happens during the day, he is guilty of murder.
EXO.22.5	“If a man lets his farm animal graze in his field or vineyard, and it wanders into another man’s field or vineyard, the owner of the animal must pay back the loss from the best of his crop.
EXO.22.6	“Suppose a man starts a fire that spreads through the thornbushes to his neighbor’s field. If the fire burns his neighbor’s growing grain or grain that has been stacked, or if it burns his whole field, the person who started the fire must pay for what was burned.
EXO.22.7	“Suppose a man gives his neighbor money or other things to keep for him and those things are stolen from the neighbor’s house. If the thief is caught, he must pay back twice as much as he stole. 
EXO.22.8	But if the thief is never found, the owner of the house must make a promise before God that he has not stolen his neighbor’s things.
EXO.22.9	“Suppose two men disagree about who owns something—whether ox, donkey, sheep, clothing, or something else that is lost. If each says, ‘This is mine,’ each man must bring his case to God. God’s judges will decide who is guilty, and that person must pay the other man twice as much as the object is worth.
EXO.22.10	“Suppose a man asks his neighbor to keep his donkey, ox, sheep, or some other animal for him, and that animal dies, gets hurt, or is taken away, without anyone seeing what happened. 
EXO.22.11	That neighbor must promise before the L
EXO.22.12	But if the animal was stolen from the neighbor, he must pay the owner for it. 
EXO.22.13	If wild animals killed it, the neighbor must bring the body as proof, and he will not have to pay for the animal that was killed.
EXO.22.14	“If a man borrows an animal from his neighbor, and it gets hurt or dies while the owner is not there, the one who borrowed it must pay the owner for the animal. 
EXO.22.15	But if the owner is with the animal, the one who borrowed it does not have to pay. If the animal was rented, the rental price covers the loss.
EXO.22.16	“Suppose a man finds a woman who is not pledged to be married and has never had sexual relations with a man. If he tricks her into having sexual relations with him, he must give her family the payment to marry her, and she will become his wife. 
EXO.22.17	But if her father refuses to allow his daughter to marry him, the man must still give the usual payment for a bride who has never had sexual relations.
EXO.22.18	“Put to death any woman who does evil magic.
EXO.22.19	“Put to death anyone who has sexual relations with an animal.
EXO.22.20	“Destroy completely any person who makes a sacrifice to any god except the L
EXO.22.21	“Do not cheat or hurt a foreigner, because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.
EXO.22.22	“Do not cheat a widow or an orphan. 
EXO.22.23	If you do, and they cry out to me for help, I certainly will hear their cry. 
EXO.22.24	And I will be very angry and kill you in war. Then your wives will become widows, and your children will become orphans.
EXO.22.25	“If you lend money to one of my people who is poor, do not treat him as a moneylender would. Charge him nothing for using your money. 
EXO.22.26	If your neighbor gives you his coat as a promise for the money he owes you, you must give it back to him by sunset, 
EXO.22.27	because it is the only cover to keep his body warm. He has nothing else to sleep in. If he cries out to me for help, I will listen, because I am merciful.
EXO.22.28	“You must not speak against God or curse a leader of your people.
EXO.22.29	“Do not hold back your offering from the first of your harvest and the first wine that you make. Also, you must give me your firstborn sons. 
EXO.22.30	You must do the same with your bulls and your sheep. Let the firstborn males stay with their mothers for seven days, and on the eighth day you must give them to me.
EXO.22.31	“You are to be my holy people. You must not eat the meat of any animal that has been killed by wild animals. Instead, give it to the dogs.
EXO.23.1	“You must not tell lies. If you are a witness in court, don’t help a wicked person by telling lies.
EXO.23.2	“You must not do wrong just because everyone else is doing it. If you are a witness in court, you must not ruin a fair trial. You must not tell lies just because everyone else is. 
EXO.23.3	If a poor person is in court, you must not take his side just because he is poor.
EXO.23.4	“If you see your enemy’s ox or donkey wandering away, you must return it to him. 
EXO.23.5	If you see that your enemy’s donkey has fallen because its load is too heavy, do not leave it there. You must help your enemy get the donkey back on its feet.
EXO.23.6	“You must not be unfair to a poor person when he is in court. 
EXO.23.7	You must not lie when you accuse someone in court. Never allow an innocent or honest person to be put to death as punishment, because I will not treat guilty people as if they were innocent.
EXO.23.8	“You must not accept money from a person who wants you to lie in court, because such money will not let you see what is right. Such money makes good people tell lies.
EXO.23.9	“You must not mistreat a foreigner. You know how it feels to be a foreigner, because you were foreigners in Egypt.
EXO.23.10	“For six years you are to plant and harvest crops on your land. 
EXO.23.11	Then during the seventh year, do not plow or plant your land. If any food grows there, allow the poor people to have it, and let the wild animals eat what is left. You should do the same with your vineyards and your orchards of olive trees.
EXO.23.12	“You should work six days a week, but on the seventh day you must rest. This lets your ox and your donkey rest, and it also lets the slave born in your house and the foreigner be refreshed.
EXO.23.13	“Be sure to do all that I have said to you. You must not even say the names of other gods; those names must not come out of your mouth.
EXO.23.14	“Three times each year you must hold a feast to honor me. 
EXO.23.15	You must celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread in the way I commanded you. For seven days you must eat bread that is made without yeast at the set time during the month of Abib, the month when you came out of Egypt. No one is to come to worship me without bringing an offering.
EXO.23.16	“You must celebrate the Feast of Weeks. Offer to God the first things you harvest from the crops you planted in your fields.

EXO.23.21	Pay attention to the angel and obey him. Do not turn against him; he will not forgive such turning against him because my power is in him. 
EXO.23.22	If you listen carefully to all he says and do everything that I tell you, I will be an enemy to your enemies. I will fight all who fight against you. 
EXO.23.23	My angel will go ahead of you and take you into the land of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hivites, and Jebusites, and I will destroy them.

EXO.23.28	I will send terror ahead of you that will force the Hivites, Canaanites, and Hittites out of your way. 
EXO.23.29	But I will not force all those people out in only one year. If I did, the land would become a desert and the wild animals would become too many for you. 
EXO.23.30	Instead, I will force those people out slowly, until there are enough of you to take over the land.
EXO.23.31	“I will give you the land from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea, and from the desert to the Euphrates River. I will give you power over the people who now live in the land, and you will force them out ahead of you. 
EXO.23.32	You must not make an agreement with those people or with their gods.

EXO.30.32	Do not pour it on the bodies of ordinary people, and do not make perfume the same way you make this oil. It is holy, and you must treat it as holy. 
EXO.30.33	If anyone makes perfume like it or puts it on someone who is not a priest, that person must be cut off from his people.’ ”
EXO.30.34	Then the L
EXO.30.35	Make incense as a person who makes perfume would do. Add salt to it to keep it pure and holy. 
EXO.30.36	Beat some of the incense into a fine powder, and put it in front of the Ark of the Agreement in the Meeting Tent, where I will meet with you. You must use this incense powder only for its very special purpose. 
EXO.30.37	Do not make incense for yourselves the same way you make this incense. Treat it as holy to the L
EXO.30.38	Whoever makes incense like this to use as perfume must be cut off from his people.”
EXO.31.1	Then the L
EXO.31.2	“See, I have chosen Bezalel son of Uri from the tribe of Judah. (Uri was the son of Hur.) 
EXO.31.3	I have filled Bezalel with the Spirit of God and have given him the skill, ability, and knowledge to do all kinds of work. 
EXO.31.4	He is able to design pieces to be made from gold, silver, and bronze, 
EXO.31.5	to cut jewels and put them in metal, to carve wood, and to do all kinds of work. 
EXO.31.6	I have also chosen Oholiab son of Ahisamach from the tribe of Dan to work with Bezalel. I have given skills to all the craftsmen, and they will be able to make all these things I have commanded you: 
EXO.31.7	the Meeting Tent, the Ark of the Agreement, the lid that covers the Ark, and everything in the Tent. 
EXO.31.8	This includes the table and everything on it, the pure gold lampstand and everything with it, the altar of incense, 
EXO.31.9	the altar for burnt offerings and everything used with it, and the bowl and the stand under it. 
EXO.31.10	They will make the woven clothes and the holy clothes for Aaron and the clothes for his sons to wear when they serve as priests. 
EXO.31.11	They will also make the special olive oil used in appointing people and things to the service of the L
EXO.31.11	“These workers will make all these things just as I have commanded you.”
EXO.31.12	Then the L
EXO.31.13	“Tell the Israelites, ‘You must keep the rules about my Sabbaths, because they will be a sign between you and me from now on. In this way you will know that I, the L

EXO.31.16	The Israelites must remember the Sabbath day as an agreement between them and me that will continue from now on. 
EXO.31.17	The Sabbath day will be a sign between me and the Israelites forever, because in six days I, the L
EXO.31.18	When the L
EXO.32.1	The people saw that a long time had passed and Moses had not come down from the mountain. So they gathered around Aaron and said, “Moses led us out of Egypt, but we don’t know what has happened to him. Make us gods who will lead us.”
EXO.32.2	Aaron said to the people, “Take off the gold earrings that your wives, sons, and daughters are wearing, and bring them to me.” 
EXO.32.3	So all the people took their gold earrings and brought them to Aaron. 
EXO.32.4	He took the gold from the people and formed it with a tool and made a statue of a calf. Then the people said, “Israel, these are your gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt!”
EXO.32.5	When Aaron saw all this, he built an altar before the calf and announced, “Tomorrow there will be a special feast to honor the L
EXO.32.6	The people got up early the next morning and offered whole burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. They sat down to eat and drink, and then they got up and sinned sexually.
EXO.32.7	Then the L
EXO.32.8	They have quickly turned away from the things I commanded them to do. They have made for themselves a calf covered with gold, and they have worshiped it and offered sacrifices to it. They have said, ‘Israel, these are your gods who brought you out of Egypt.’ ”
EXO.32.9	The L
EXO.32.10	So now do not stop me. I am so angry with them that I am going to destroy them. Then I will make you and your descendants a great nation.”
EXO.32.11	But Moses begged the L
EXO.32.12	Don’t let the people of Egypt say, ‘The L
EXO.32.13	Remember the men who served you—Abraham, Isaac, and Israel. You promised with an oath to them and said, ‘I will make your descendants as many as the stars in the sky. I will give your descendants all this land that I have promised them, and it will be theirs forever.’ ” 
EXO.32.14	So the L
EXO.32.15	Then Moses went down the mountain, and in his hands he had the two stone tablets with the Agreement on them. The commands were written on both sides of each stone, front and back. 
EXO.32.16	God himself had made the tablets, and God himself had written the commands on the tablets.
EXO.32.17	When Joshua heard the sound of the people shouting, he said to Moses, “It sounds like war down in the camp.”
EXO.32.18	Moses answered:
EXO.32.18	“It is not a shout of victory;
EXO.32.18	it is not a cry of defeat.
EXO.32.18	It is the sound of singing that I hear.”
EXO.32.19	When Moses came close to the camp, he saw the gold calf and the dancing, and he became very angry. He threw down the stone tablets that he was carrying and broke them at the bottom of the mountain. 
EXO.32.20	Then he took the calf that the people had made and melted it in the fire. He ground it into powder. Then he threw the powder into the water and forced the Israelites to drink it.
EXO.32.21	Moses said to Aaron, “What did these people do to you? Why did you cause them to do such a terrible sin?”
EXO.32.22	Aaron answered, “Don’t be angry, master. You know that these people are always ready to do wrong. 
EXO.32.23	The people said to me, ‘Moses led us out of Egypt, but we don’t know what has happened to him. Make us gods who will lead us.’ 
EXO.32.24	So I told the people, ‘Take off your gold jewelry.’ When they gave me the gold, I threw it into the fire and out came this calf!”
EXO.32.25	Moses saw that the people were acting wildly. Aaron had let them get out of control and become fools in front of their enemies. 
EXO.32.26	So Moses stood at the entrance to the camp and said, “Let anyone who wants to follow the L
EXO.32.27	Then Moses said to them, “The L
EXO.32.28	The people from the family of Levi obeyed Moses, and that day about three thousand of the Israelites died. 
EXO.32.29	Then Moses said, “Today you have been given for service to the L
EXO.32.30	The next day Moses told the people, “You have done a terrible sin. But now I will go up to the L
EXO.32.31	So Moses went back to the L
EXO.32.32	Now, please forgive them of this sin. If you will not, then erase my name from the book in which you have written the names of your people.”
EXO.32.33	But the L
EXO.32.34	So now, go. Lead the people where I have told you, and my angel will lead you. When the time comes to punish, I will punish them for their sin.”
EXO.32.35	So the L
EXO.33.1	Then the L
EXO.33.2	I will send an angel to lead you, and I will force these people out of the land: the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
EXO.33.3	Go up to a fertile land. But I will not go with you, because I might destroy you on the way, since you are such a stubborn people.”
EXO.33.4	When the people heard this bad news, they became very sad, and none of them put on jewelry. 
EXO.33.5	This was because the L
EXO.33.6	So the people of Israel took off their jewelry at Mount Sinai.
EXO.33.7	Moses used to take a tent and set it up a long way outside the camp; he called it the “Meeting Tent.” Anyone who wanted to ask the L
EXO.33.8	Whenever Moses went out to the Tent, all the people would rise and stand at the entrances of their tents, watching him until he entered the Meeting Tent. 
EXO.33.9	When Moses went into the Tent, the pillar of cloud would always come down and stay at the entrance of the Tent while the L
EXO.33.10	Whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud at the entrance of the Tent, they stood and worshiped, each person at the entrance of his own tent.
EXO.33.11	The L
EXO.33.12	Moses said to the L
EXO.33.13	If I have truly pleased you, show me your plans so that I may know you and continue to please you. Remember that this nation is your people.”
EXO.33.14	The L
EXO.33.15	Then Moses said to him, “If you yourself don’t go with us, then don’t send us away from this place. 
EXO.33.16	If you don’t go with us, no one will know that you are pleased with me and with your people. These people and I will be no different from any other people on earth.”
EXO.33.17	Then the L
EXO.33.18	Then Moses said, “Now, please show me your glory.”
EXO.33.19	The L
EXO.33.20	But you cannot see my face, because no one can see me and live.
EXO.33.21	“There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock. 
EXO.33.22	When my glory passes that place, I will put you in a large crack in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. 
EXO.33.23	Then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back. But my face must not be seen.”
EXO.34.1	The L
EXO.34.2	Be ready tomorrow morning, and then come up on Mount Sinai. Stand before me there on the top of the mountain. 
EXO.34.3	No one may come with you or even be seen any place on the mountain. Not even the flocks or herds may eat grass near that mountain.”
EXO.34.4	So Moses cut two stone tablets like the first ones. Then early the next morning he went up Mount Sinai, just as the L
EXO.34.5	Then the L
EXO.34.6	The L
EXO.34.7	and is kind to thousands of people. The L
EXO.34.8	Then Moses quickly bowed to the ground and worshiped. 
EXO.34.9	He said, “Lord, if you are pleased with me, please go with us. I know that these are stubborn people, but forgive our evil and our sin. Take us as your own people.”
EXO.34.10	Then the L
EXO.34.11	Obey the things I command you today, and I will force out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites ahead of you. 
EXO.34.12	Be careful that you don’t make an agreement with the people who live in the land where you are going, because it will bring you trouble. 
EXO.34.13	Destroy their altars, break their stone pillars, and cut down their Asherah idols. 
EXO.34.14	Don’t worship any other god, because I, the L
EXO.34.15	“Be careful that you don’t make an agreement with the people who live in that land. When they worship their gods, they will invite you to join them. Then you will eat their sacrifices. 
EXO.34.16	If you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters worship gods, they will lead your sons to do the same thing.
EXO.34.17	“Do not make gods of melted metal.
EXO.34.18	“Celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days you must eat bread made without yeast as I commanded you. Do this during the month I have chosen, the month of Abib, because in that month you came out of Egypt.
EXO.34.19	“The firstborn of every mother belongs to me, including every firstborn male animal that is born in your flocks and herds. 
EXO.34.20	You may buy back a donkey by paying for it with a lamb, but if you don’t want to buy back a donkey, you must break its neck. You must buy back all your firstborn sons.
EXO.34.20	“No one is to come before me without a gift.
EXO.34.21	“You must work for six days, but on the seventh day you must rest—even during the planting season and the harvest season.
EXO.34.22	“Celebrate the Feast of Weeks when you gather the first grain of the wheat harvest. And celebrate the Feast of Shelters in the fall.
EXO.34.23	“Three times each year all your males must come before the Lord G
EXO.34.24	I will force out nations ahead of you and expand the borders of your land. You will go before the L
EXO.34.25	“Do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me with anything containing yeast, and do not leave any of the sacrifice of the Feast of Passover until the next morning.
EXO.34.26	“Bring the best first crops that you harvest from your ground to the Tent of the L
EXO.34.26	“You must not cook a young goat in its mother’s milk.”
EXO.34.27	Then the L
EXO.34.28	Moses stayed there with the L
EXO.34.29	Then Moses came down from Mount Sinai, carrying the two stone tablets of the Agreement in his hands. But he did not know that his face was shining because he had talked with the L
EXO.34.30	When Aaron and all the people of Israel saw that Moses’ face was shining, they were afraid to go near him. 
EXO.34.31	But Moses called to them, so Aaron and all the leaders of the people returned to Moses, and he talked with them. 
EXO.34.32	After that, all the people of Israel came near him, and he gave them all the commands that the L
EXO.34.33	When Moses finished speaking to the people, he put a covering over his face. 
EXO.34.34	Anytime Moses went before the L
EXO.34.35	They would see that Moses’ face was shining. So he would cover his face again until the next time he went in to speak with the L
EXO.35.1	Moses gathered all the Israelite community together and said to them, “These are the things the L
EXO.35.2	You are to work for six days, but the seventh day will be a holy day, a Sabbath of rest to honor the L
EXO.35.3	On the Sabbath day you must not light a fire in any of your houses.”
EXO.35.4	Moses said to all the Israelites, “This is what the L
EXO.35.5	From what you have, take an offering for the L
EXO.35.6	blue, purple and red thread, and fine linen, goat hair 
EXO.35.7	and male sheepskins that are colored red. They may also bring fine leather, acacia wood, 
EXO.35.8	olive oil for the lamps, spices for the special olive oil used for appointing priests and for the sweet-smelling incense, 
EXO.35.9	onyx stones, and other jewels to be put on the holy vest and chest covering of the priests.
EXO.35.10	“Let all the skilled workers come and make everything the L
EXO.35.11	the Holy Tent, its outer tent and its covering, the hooks, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases; 
EXO.35.12	the Ark of the Agreement, its poles, lid, and the curtain in front of it; 
EXO.35.13	the table, and its poles, all the things that go with the table, and the bread that shows we are in God’s presence; 
EXO.35.14	the lampstand for the light and all the things that go with it, the lamps, and olive oil for the light; 
EXO.35.15	the altar of incense and its poles, the special oil and the sweet-smelling incense, the curtain for the entrance of the Meeting Tent; 
EXO.35.16	the altar of burnt offering and its bronze screen, its poles and all its tools, the bronze bowl and its base; 
EXO.35.17	the curtains around the courtyard, their posts and bases, and the curtain at the entry to the courtyard; 
EXO.35.18	the pegs of the Holy Tent and of the courtyard and their ropes; 
EXO.35.19	the special clothes that the priest will wear in the Holy Place. These are the holy clothes for Aaron the priest and his sons to wear when they serve as priests.”
EXO.35.20	Then all the people of Israel went away from Moses. 
EXO.35.21	Everyone who wanted to give came and brought a gift to the L
EXO.35.22	All the men and women who wanted to give brought gold jewelry of all kinds—pins, earrings, rings, and bracelets. They all presented their gold to the L
EXO.35.23	Everyone who had blue, purple, and red thread, and fine linen, and anyone who had goat hair or male sheepskins colored red or fine leather brought them to the L
EXO.35.24	Everyone who could give silver or bronze brought that as a gift to the L
EXO.35.25	Every skilled woman used her hands to make the blue, purple, and red thread, and fine linen, and they brought what they had made. 
EXO.35.26	All the women who were skilled and wanted to help made thread of the goat hair. 
EXO.35.27	The leaders brought onyx stones and other jewels to put on the holy vest and chest covering for the priest. 
EXO.35.28	They also brought spices and olive oil for the sweet-smelling incense, the special oil, and the oil to burn in the lamps. 
EXO.35.29	All the men and women of Israel who wanted to help brought gifts to the L
EXO.35.30	Then Moses said to the Israelites, “Look, the L
EXO.35.31	The L
EXO.35.32	He is able to design pieces to be made of gold, silver, and bronze, 
EXO.35.33	to cut stones and jewels and put them in metal, to carve wood, and to do all kinds of work. 
EXO.35.34	Also, the L
EXO.35.35	The L
EXO.36.1	So Bezalel, Oholiab, and every skilled person will do the work the L
EXO.36.2	Then Moses called Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the other skilled people to whom the L
EXO.36.3	They received from Moses everything the people of Israel had brought as gifts to build the Holy Tent. The people continued to bring gifts each morning because they wanted to. 
EXO.36.4	So all the skilled workers left the work they were doing on the Holy Tent, 
EXO.36.5	and they said to Moses, “The people are bringing more than we need to do the work the L
EXO.36.6	Then Moses sent this command throughout the camp: “No man or woman should make anything else as a gift for the Holy Tent.” So the people were kept from giving more, 
EXO.36.7	because what they had was already more than enough to do all the work.
EXO.36.8	Then the skilled workers made the Holy Tent. They made the ten curtains of blue, purple, and red cloth, and they sewed designs of creatures with wings on the curtains. 
EXO.36.9	Each curtain was the same size—forty-two feet long and six feet wide. 
EXO.36.10	Five of the curtains were fastened together to make one set, and the other five were fastened together to make another set. 
EXO.36.11	Then they made loops of blue cloth along the edge of the end curtain on the first set of five, and they did the same thing with the other set of five. 
EXO.36.12	There were fifty loops on one curtain and fifty loops on the other curtain, with the loops opposite each other. 
EXO.36.13	They made fifty gold hooks to join the two curtains together so that the Holy Tent was joined together as one piece.
EXO.36.14	Then the workers made another tent of eleven curtains made of goat hair, to put over the Holy Tent. 
EXO.36.15	All eleven curtains were the same size—forty-five feet long and six feet wide. 
EXO.36.16	The workers sewed five curtains together into one set and six together into another set. 
EXO.36.17	They made fifty loops along the edge of the outside curtain of one set and fifty loops along the edge of the outside curtain of the other set. 
EXO.36.18	Then they made fifty bronze rings to join the two sets of cloth together and make the tent one piece. 
EXO.36.19	They made two more coverings for the outer tent—one made of male sheepskins colored red and the other made of fine leather.
EXO.36.20	Then they made upright frames of acacia wood for the Holy Tent. 
EXO.36.21	Each frame was fifteen feet tall and twenty-seven inches wide, 
EXO.36.22	and there were two pegs side by side on each one. Every frame of the Holy Tent was made this same way. 
EXO.36.23	They made twenty frames for the south side of the Tent, 
EXO.36.24	and they made forty silver bases that went under the twenty frames. There were two bases for every frame—one for each peg of each frame. 
EXO.36.25	They also made twenty frames for the north side of the Holy Tent 
EXO.36.26	and forty silver bases—two to go under each frame. 
EXO.36.27	They made six frames for the rear or west end of the Holy Tent 
EXO.36.28	and two frames for the corners at the rear of the Holy Tent. 
EXO.36.29	These two frames were doubled at the bottom and joined at the top with a metal ring. They did this for each of these corners. 
EXO.36.30	So there were eight frames and sixteen silver bases—two bases under each frame.
EXO.36.31	Then they made crossbars of acacia wood to connect the upright frames of the Holy Tent. Five crossbars held the frames together on one side of the Tent, 
EXO.36.32	and five held the frames together on the other side. Also, five crossbars held the frames together on the west end, at the rear of the Tent. 
EXO.36.33	They made the middle crossbar run along the entire length of each side and rear of the Tent. It was set halfway up the frames. 
EXO.36.34	They made gold rings on the sides of the frames to hold the crossbars, and they covered the frames and the crossbars with gold.
EXO.36.35	Then they made the curtain of blue, purple, and red thread, and fine linen. A skilled craftsman sewed designs of creatures with wings on it. 
EXO.36.36	They made four posts of acacia wood for it and covered them with gold. Then they made gold hooks for the posts, as well as four silver bases in which to set the posts. 
EXO.36.37	For the entrance to the Tent, they made a curtain of blue, purple, and red thread, and fine linen. A person who sewed well sewed designs on it. 
EXO.36.38	Then they made five posts and hooks for it. They covered the tops of the posts and their bands with gold, and they made five bronze bases for the posts.
EXO.37.1	Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood; it was forty-five inches long, twenty-seven inches wide, and twenty-seven inches high. 
EXO.37.2	He covered it, both inside and out, with pure gold, and he put a gold strip around it. 
EXO.37.3	He made four gold rings for it and attached them to its four feet, with two rings on each side. 
EXO.37.4	Then he made poles of acacia wood and covered them with gold. 
EXO.37.5	He put the poles through the rings on each side of the Ark to carry it. 
EXO.37.6	Then he made a lid of pure gold that was forty-five inches long and twenty-seven inches wide. 
EXO.37.7	Then Bezalel hammered gold to make two creatures with wings and attached them to each end of the lid. 
EXO.37.8	He made one creature on one end of the lid and the other creature on the other end. He attached them to the lid so that it would be one piece. 
EXO.37.9	The creatures’ wings were spread upward, covering the lid, and the creatures faced each other across the lid.
EXO.37.10	Then he made the table of acacia wood; it was thirty-six inches long, eighteen inches wide, and twenty-seven inches high. 
EXO.37.11	He covered it with pure gold and put a gold strip around it. 
EXO.37.12	He made a frame three inches high that stood up all around the edge, and he put a gold strip around it. 
EXO.37.13	Then he made four gold rings for the table and attached them to the four corners of the table where the four legs were. 
EXO.37.14	The rings were put close to the frame around the top of the table, because they held the poles for carrying it. 
EXO.37.15	The poles for carrying the table were made of acacia wood and were covered with gold. 
EXO.37.16	He made of pure gold all the things that were used on the table: the plates, bowls, cups, and jars used for pouring the drink offerings.
EXO.37.17	Then he made the lampstand of pure gold, hammering out its base and stand. Its flower-like cups, buds, and petals were joined together in one piece with the base and stand. 
EXO.37.18	Six branches went out from the sides of the lampstand—three on one side and three on the other. 
EXO.37.19	Each branch had three cups shaped like almond flowers, and each cup had a bud and a petal. Each of the six branches going out from the lampstand was the same. 
EXO.37.20	There were four more cups shaped like almond flowers on the lampstand itself, each with its buds and petals. 
EXO.37.21	Three pairs of branches went out from the lampstand. A bud was under the place where each pair was attached to the lampstand. Each of the six branches going out from the lampstand was the same. 
EXO.37.22	The buds, branches, and lampstand were all one piece of pure, hammered gold. 
EXO.37.23	He made seven pure gold lamps for this lampstand, and he made pure gold wick trimmers and trays. 
EXO.37.24	He used about seventy-five pounds of pure gold to make the lampstand and all the things that go with it.
EXO.37.25	Then he made the altar of incense out of acacia wood. It was square—eighteen inches long and eighteen inches wide—and it was thirty-six inches high. Each corner that stuck out like a horn was joined into one piece with the altar. 
EXO.37.26	He covered the top and all the sides and the corners with pure gold, and he put gold trim around the altar. 
EXO.37.27	He made two gold rings and put them below the trim on opposite sides of the altar; these rings held the poles for carrying it. 
EXO.37.28	He made the poles of acacia wood and covered them with gold.
EXO.37.29	Then he made the holy olive oil for appointing the priests and the pure, sweet-smelling incense. He made them like a person who mixes perfumes.
EXO.38.1	Then he built the altar for burnt offerings out of acacia wood. The altar was square—seven and one-half feet long and seven and one-half feet wide—and it was four and one-half feet high. 
EXO.38.2	He made each corner stick out like a horn so that the horns and the altar were joined together in one piece. Then he covered the altar with bronze. 
EXO.38.3	He made all the tools of bronze to use on the altar: the pots, shovels, bowls for sprinkling blood, meat forks, and pans for carrying the fire. 
EXO.38.4	He made a large bronze screen to hold the burning wood for the altar and put it inside the altar, under its rim, halfway up from the bottom. 
EXO.38.5	He made bronze rings to hold the poles for carrying the altar, and he put them at the four corners of the screen. 
EXO.38.6	Then he made poles of acacia wood and covered them with bronze. 
EXO.38.7	He put the poles through the rings on both sides of the altar, to carry it. He made the altar of boards and left the inside hollow.
EXO.38.8	He made the bronze bowl for washing, and he built it on a bronze stand. He used the bronze from mirrors that belonged to the women who served at the entrance to the Meeting Tent.
EXO.38.9	Then he made a wall of curtains to form a courtyard around the Holy Tent. On the south side the curtains were one hundred fifty feet long and were made of fine linen. 
EXO.38.10	The curtains hung on silver hooks and bands, placed on twenty bronze posts with twenty bronze bases. 
EXO.38.11	On the north side the wall of curtains was also one hundred fifty feet long, and it hung on silver hooks and bands on twenty posts with twenty bronze bases.
EXO.38.12	On the west side of the courtyard, the wall of curtains was seventy-five feet long. It was held up by silver hooks and bands on ten posts with ten bases. 
EXO.38.13	The east side was also seventy-five feet long. 
EXO.38.14	On one side of the entry there was a wall of curtains twenty-two and one-half feet long, held up by three posts and three bases. 
EXO.38.15	On the other side of the entry there was also a wall of curtains twenty-two and one-half feet long, held up by three posts and three bases. 
EXO.38.16	All the curtains around the courtyard were made of fine linen. 
EXO.38.17	The bases for the posts were made of bronze. The hooks and the bands on the posts were made of silver, and the tops of the posts were covered with silver also. All the posts in the courtyard had silver bands.
EXO.38.18	The curtain for the entry of the courtyard was made of blue, purple, and red thread, and fine linen, sewn by a person who could sew well. The curtain was thirty feet long and seven and one-half feet high, the same height as the curtains around the courtyard.

NUM.12.15	So Miriam was put outside of the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until she came back.

NUM.13.2	“Send men to explore the land of Canaan, which I will give to the Israelites. Send one leader from each tribe.”
NUM.13.3	So Moses obeyed the L
NUM.13.4	These are their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua son of Zaccur; 
NUM.13.5	from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat son of Hori; 
NUM.13.6	from the tribe of Judah, Caleb son of Jephunneh; 
NUM.13.7	from the tribe of Issachar, Igal son of Joseph; 
NUM.13.8	from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea son of Nun; 
NUM.13.9	from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti son of Raphu; 
NUM.13.10	from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel son of Sodi; 
NUM.13.11	from the tribe of Manasseh (a tribe of Joseph), Gaddi son of Susi; 
NUM.13.12	from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel son of Gemalli; 
NUM.13.13	from the tribe of Asher, Sethur son of Michael; 
NUM.13.14	from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi son of Vophsi; 
NUM.13.15	from the tribe of Gad, Geuel son of Maki.
NUM.13.16	These are the names of the men Moses sent to explore the land. (Moses gave Hoshea son of Nun the new name Joshua.)
NUM.13.17	Moses sent them to explore Canaan and said, “Go through southern Canaan and then into the mountains. 
NUM.13.18	See what the land looks like. Are the people who live there strong or weak? Are there a few or many? 
NUM.13.19	What kind of land do they live in? Is it good or bad? What about the towns they live in—are they open like camps, or do they have walls? 
NUM.13.20	What about the soil? Is it fertile or poor? Are there trees there? Try to bring back some of the fruit from that land.” (It was the season for the first grapes.)
NUM.13.21	So they went up and explored the land, from the Desert of Zin all the way to Rehob by Lebo Hamath. 
NUM.13.22	They went through the southern area to Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak lived. (The city of Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) 
NUM.13.23	In the Valley of Eshcol, they cut off a branch of a grapevine that had one bunch of grapes on it and carried that branch on a pole between two of them. They also got some pomegranates and figs. 
NUM.13.24	That place was called the Valley of Eshcol, because the Israelites cut off the bunch of grapes there. 
NUM.13.25	After forty days of exploring the land, the men returned to the camp.
NUM.13.26	They came back to Moses and Aaron and all the Israelites at Kadesh, in the Desert of Paran. The men reported to them and showed everybody the fruit from the land. 
NUM.13.27	They told Moses, “We went to the land where you sent us, and it is a fertile land! Here is some of its fruit. 
NUM.13.28	But the people who live there are strong. Their cities are walled and very large. We even saw some Anakites there. 
NUM.13.29	The Amalekites live in the southern area; the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the mountains; and the Canaanites live near the sea and along the Jordan River.”
NUM.13.30	Then Caleb told the people near Moses to be quiet, and he said, “We should certainly go up and take the land for ourselves. We can certainly do it.”
NUM.13.31	But the men who had gone with him said, “We can’t attack those people; they are stronger than we are.” 
NUM.13.32	And those men gave the Israelites a bad report about the land they explored, saying, “The land that we explored is too large to conquer. All the people we saw are very tall. 
NUM.13.33	We saw the Nephilim people there. (The Anakites come from the Nephilim people.) We felt like grasshoppers, and we looked like grasshoppers to them.”
NUM.14.1	That night all the people in the camp began crying loudly. 
NUM.14.2	All the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron, and all the people said to them, “We wish we had died in Egypt or in this desert. 
NUM.14.3	Why is the L
NUM.14.4	They said to each other, “Let’s choose a leader and go back to Egypt.”
NUM.14.5	Then Moses and Aaron bowed facedown in front of all the Israelites gathered there. 
NUM.14.6	Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, who had explored the land, tore their clothes. 
NUM.14.7	They said to all of the Israelites, “The land we explored is very good.

NUM.14.24	But my servant Caleb thinks differently and follows me completely. So I will bring him into the land he has already seen, and his children will own that land.

NUM.20.17	Please let us pass through your country. We will not touch any fields of grain or vineyards, and will not drink water from the wells. We will travel only along the king’s road, not turning right or left until we have passed through your country.”
NUM.20.18	But the king of Edom answered: “You may not pass through here. If you try, I will come and meet you with swords.”
NUM.20.19	The Israelites answered: “We will go along the main road, and if we or our animals drink any of your water, we will pay for it. We only want to walk through. That’s all.”
NUM.20.20	But he answered: “You may not pass through here.”
NUM.20.20	Then the Edomites went out to meet the Israelites with a large and powerful army. 
NUM.20.21	The Edomites refused to let them pass through their country, so the Israelites turned back.
NUM.20.22	All the Israelites moved from Kadesh to Mount Hor,

NUM.20.27	Moses obeyed the L
NUM.20.28	Moses took off Aaron’s clothes and put them on Aaron’s son Eleazar. Then Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Moses and Eleazar came back down the mountain, 
NUM.20.29	and when all the people learned that Aaron was dead, everyone in Israel cried for him for thirty days.
NUM.21.1	The Canaanite king of Arad lived in the southern area. When he heard that the Israelites were coming on the road to Atharim, he attacked them and captured some of them. 
NUM.21.2	Then the Israelites made this promise to the L

NUM.21.4	The Israelites left Mount Hor and went on the road toward the Red Sea, in order to go around the country of Edom. But the people became impatient on the way

NUM.21.8	The L
NUM.21.9	So Moses made a bronze snake and put it on a pole. Then when a snake bit anyone, that person looked at the bronze snake and lived.
NUM.21.10	The Israelites went and camped at Oboth. 
NUM.21.11	They went from Oboth to Iye Abarim, in the desert east of Moab. 
NUM.21.12	From there they went and camped in the Zered Valley. 
NUM.21.13	From there they went and camped across the Arnon, in the desert just inside the Amorite country. The Arnon is the border between the Moabites and the Amorites. 
NUM.21.14	That is why the Book of the Wars of the L

NUM.21.16	The Israelites went from there to Beer; a well is there where the L
NUM.21.17	Then the Israelites sang this song:
NUM.21.17	“Pour out water, well!
NUM.21.17	Sing about it.
NUM.21.18	Princes dug this well.
NUM.21.18	Important men made it.
NUM.21.18	With their scepters and poles, they dug it.”
NUM.21.18	The people went from the desert to Mattanah. 
NUM.21.19	From Mattanah they went to Nahaliel and on to Bamoth. 
NUM.21.20	From Bamoth they went to the valley of Moab where the top of Mount Pisgah looks over the desert.
NUM.21.21	The Israelites sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying, 
NUM.21.22	“Let us pass through your country. We will not go through any fields of grain or vineyards, or drink water from the wells. We will travel only along the king’s road until we have passed through your country.”
NUM.21.23	But King Sihon would not let the Israelites pass through his country. He gathered his whole army together, and they marched out to meet Israel in the desert. At Jahaz they fought the Israelites. 
NUM.21.24	Israel killed the king and captured his land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River. They took the land as far as the Ammonite border, which was strongly defended. 
NUM.21.25	Israel captured all the Amorite cities and lived in them, taking Heshbon and all the towns around it. 
NUM.21.26	Heshbon was the city where Sihon, the Amorite king, lived. In the past he had fought with the king of Moab and had taken all the land as far as the Arnon.
NUM.21.27	That is why the poets say:
NUM.21.27	“Come to Heshbon
NUM.21.27	and rebuild it;
NUM.21.27	rebuild Sihon’s city.
NUM.21.28	A fire began in Heshbon;
NUM.21.28	flames came from Sihon’s city.
NUM.21.28	It destroyed Ar in Moab,
NUM.21.28	and it burned the Arnon highlands.
NUM.21.29	How terrible for you, Moab!
NUM.21.29	The people of Chemosh are ruined.
NUM.21.29	His sons ran away
NUM.21.29	and his daughters were captured
NUM.21.29	by Sihon, king of the Amorites.
NUM.21.30	But we defeated those Amorites.
NUM.21.30	We ruined their towns from Heshbon to Dibon,
NUM.21.30	and we destroyed them as far as Nophah, near Medeba.”
NUM.21.31	So Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.
NUM.21.32	After Moses sent spies to the town of Jazer, they captured the towns around it, forcing out the Amorites who lived there.
NUM.21.33	Then the Israelites went up the road toward Bashan. Og king of Bashan and his whole army marched out to meet the Israelites, and they fought at Edrei.
NUM.21.34	The L
NUM.21.35	So the Israelites killed Og and his sons and all his army; no one was left alive. And they took his land.
NUM.22.1	Then the people of Israel went to the plains of Moab, and they camped near the Jordan River across from Jericho.
NUM.22.2	Balak son of Zippor saw everything the Israelites had done to the Amorites. 
NUM.22.3	And Moab was scared of so many Israelites; truly, Moab was terrified by them.
NUM.22.4	The Moabites said to the elders of Midian, “These people will take everything around us like an ox eating grass.”
NUM.22.4	Balak son of Zippor was the king of Moab at this time. 
NUM.22.5	He sent messengers to Balaam son of Beor at Pethor, near the Euphrates River in his native land. Balak said, “A nation has come out of Egypt that covers the land. They have camped next to me, 
NUM.22.6	and they are too powerful for me. So come and put a curse on them. Maybe then I can defeat them and make them leave the area. I know that if you bless someone, the blessings happen, and if you put a curse on someone, it happens.”
NUM.22.7	The elders of Moab and Midian went with payment in their hands. When they found Balaam, they told him what Balak had said.
NUM.22.8	Balaam said to them, “Stay here for the night, and I will tell you what the L
NUM.22.9	God came to Balaam and asked, “Who are these men with you?”
NUM.22.10	Balaam said to God, “The king of Moab, Balak son of Zippor, sent them to me with this message: 
NUM.22.11	‘A nation has come out of Egypt that covers the land. So come and put a curse on them, and maybe I can fight them and force them out of my land.’ ”
NUM.22.12	But God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them. Don’t put a curse on those people, because I have blessed them.”
NUM.22.13	The next morning Balaam awoke and said to Balak’s leaders, “Go back to your own country; the L
NUM.22.14	So the Moabite leaders went back to Balak and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”
NUM.22.15	So Balak sent other leaders—this time there were more of them, and they were more important. 
NUM.22.16	They went to Balaam and said, “Balak son of Zippor says this: Please don’t let anything stop you from coming to me. 
NUM.22.17	I will pay you very well, and I will do what you say. Come and put a curse on these people for me.”
NUM.22.18	But Balaam answered Balak’s servants, “King Balak could give me his palace full of silver and gold, but I cannot disobey the L
NUM.22.19	You stay here tonight as the other men did, and I will find out what more the L
NUM.22.20	That night God came to Balaam and said, “These men have come to ask you to go with them. Go, but only do what I tell you.”
NUM.22.21	Balaam got up the next morning and put a saddle on his donkey. Then he went with the Moabite leaders. 
NUM.22.22	But God became angry because Balaam went, so the angel of the L

NUM.22.30	But the donkey said to Balaam, “I am your very own donkey, which you have ridden for years. Have I ever done this to you before?”
NUM.22.30	“No,” Balaam said.
NUM.22.31	Then the L
NUM.22.32	The angel of the L
NUM.22.33	The donkey saw me and turned away from me three times. If she had not turned away, I would have killed you by now, but I would have let her live.”

NUM.22.36	When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at Ar in Moab, which was beside the Arnon, at the edge of his country. 
NUM.22.37	Balak said to Balaam, “I had asked you before to come quickly. Why didn’t you come to me? I am able to reward you well.”
NUM.22.38	But Balaam answered, “I have come to you now, but I can’t say just anything. I can only say what God tells me to say.”
NUM.22.39	Then Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath Huzoth. 
NUM.22.40	Balak offered cattle and sheep as a sacrifice and gave some meat to Balaam and the leaders with him.
NUM.22.41	The next morning Balak took Balaam to Bamoth Baal; from there he could see the edge of the Israelite camp.
NUM.23.1	Balaam said to Balak, “Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven bulls and seven male sheep for me.” 
NUM.23.2	Balak did what Balaam asked, and they offered a bull and a male sheep on each of the altars.
NUM.23.3	Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here beside your burnt offering and I will go. If the L

NUM.23.6	So Balaam went back to Balak. Balak and all the leaders of Moab were still standing beside his burnt offering 
NUM.23.7	when Balaam gave them this message:
NUM.23.7	“Balak brought me here from Aram;
NUM.23.7	the king of Moab brought me from the eastern mountains.
NUM.23.7	Balak said, ‘Come, put a curse on the people of Jacob for me.
NUM.23.7	Come, call down evil on the people of Israel.’
NUM.23.8	But God has not cursed them,
NUM.23.8	so I cannot curse them.
NUM.23.8	The L
NUM.23.8	so I cannot call down evil on them.
NUM.23.9	I see them from the top of the mountains;
NUM.23.9	I see them from the hills.
NUM.23.9	I see a people who live alone,
NUM.23.9	who think they are different from other nations.
NUM.23.10	No one can number the many people of Jacob,
NUM.23.10	and no one can count a fourth of Israel.
NUM.23.10	Let me die like good men,
NUM.23.10	and let me end up like them!”
NUM.23.11	Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you here to curse my enemies, but you have only blessed them!”
NUM.23.12	But Balaam answered, “I must say what the L
NUM.23.13	Then Balak said to him, “Come with me to another place, where you can also see the people. But you can only see part of them, not all of them. Curse them for me from there.” 
NUM.23.14	So Balak took Balaam to the field of Zophim, on top of Mount Pisgah. There Balak built seven altars and offered a bull and a male sheep on each altar.
NUM.23.15	So Balaam said to Balak, “Stay here by your burnt offering, and I will meet with God over there.”
NUM.23.16	So the L
NUM.23.17	So Balaam went to Balak, where he and the leaders of Moab were standing beside his burnt offering. Balak asked him, “What did the L
NUM.23.18	Then Balaam gave this message:
NUM.23.18	“Stand up, Balak, and listen.

NUM.23.19	He is not a human, and he does not change his mind.
NUM.23.19	What he says he will do, he does.
NUM.23.19	What he promises, he makes come true.
NUM.23.20	He told me to bless them,
NUM.23.20	so I cannot change the blessing.

NUM.23.21	and they praise their King.
NUM.23.22	God brought them out of Egypt;

NUM.23.23	No tricks will work on the people of Jacob,
NUM.23.23	and no magic will work against Israel.
NUM.23.23	People now say about them,
NUM.23.23	‘Look what God has done for Israel!’
NUM.23.24	The people rise up like a lioness;
NUM.23.24	they get up like a lion.
NUM.23.24	Lions don’t rest until they have eaten,
NUM.23.24	until they have drunk their enemies’ blood.”
NUM.23.25	Then Balak said to Balaam, “You haven’t cursed these people, so at least don’t bless them!”
NUM.23.26	Balaam answered Balak, “I told you before that I can only do what the L
NUM.23.27	Then Balak said to Balaam, “Come, I will take you to another place. Maybe God will be pleased to let you curse them from there.” 
NUM.23.28	So Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, the mountain that looks over the desert.
NUM.23.29	Balaam told Balak, “Build me seven altars here and prepare for me seven bulls and seven male sheep.” 
NUM.23.30	Balak did what Balaam asked, and he offered a bull and a male sheep on each altar.
NUM.24.1	Balaam saw that the L
NUM.24.2	When Balaam saw the Israelites camped in their tribes, the Spirit of God took control of him, 
NUM.24.3	and he gave this message:
NUM.24.3	“This is the message of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.3	the message of a man who sees clearly;
NUM.24.4	this is the message of a man who hears the words of God.
NUM.24.4	I see a vision from the Almighty,
NUM.24.4	and my eyes are open as I fall before him.
NUM.24.5	Your tents are beautiful, people of Jacob!
NUM.24.5	So are your homes, Israel!
NUM.24.6	Your tents spread out like valleys,
NUM.24.6	like gardens beside a river.

NUM.24.6	like cedar trees growing by the water.
NUM.24.7	Israel’s water buckets will always be full,
NUM.24.7	and their crops will have plenty of water.
NUM.24.7	Their king will be greater than Agag;
NUM.24.7	their kingdom will be very great.
NUM.24.8	God brought them out of Egypt;
NUM.24.8	they are as strong as a wild ox.
NUM.24.8	They will defeat their enemies
NUM.24.8	and break their enemies’ bones;
NUM.24.8	they will shoot them with arrows.
NUM.24.9	Like a lion, they lie waiting to attack;
NUM.24.9	like a lioness, no one would be brave enough to wake them.
NUM.24.9	Anyone who blesses you will be blessed,
NUM.24.9	and anyone who curses you will be cursed.”
NUM.24.10	Then Balak was angry with Balaam, and he pounded his fist. He said to Balaam, “I called you here to curse my enemies, but you have continued to bless them three times. 
NUM.24.11	Now go home! I said I would pay you well, but the L
NUM.24.12	Balaam said to Balak, “When you sent messengers to me, I told them,

NUM.24.14	Now I am going back to my own people, but I will tell you what these people will do to your people in the future.”
NUM.24.15	Then Balaam gave this message:
NUM.24.15	“This is the message of Balaam son of Beor,
NUM.24.15	the message of a man who sees clearly;
NUM.24.16	this is the message of a man who hears the words of God.

NUM.24.17	A star will come from Jacob;
NUM.24.17	a ruler will rise from Israel.
NUM.24.17	He will crush the heads of the Moabites
NUM.24.17	and smash the skulls of the sons of Sheth.

NUM.24.18	but Israel will grow wealthy.
NUM.24.19	A ruler will come from the descendants of Jacob
NUM.24.19	and will destroy those left in the city.”
NUM.24.20	Then Balaam saw Amalek and gave this message:
NUM.24.20	“Amalek was the most important nation,
NUM.24.20	but Amalek will be destroyed at last.”
NUM.24.21	Then Balaam saw the Kenites and gave this message:
NUM.24.21	“Your home is safe,
NUM.24.21	like a nest on a cliff.
NUM.24.22	But you Kenites will be burned up;
NUM.24.22	Assyria will keep you captive.”
NUM.24.23	Then Balaam gave this message:
NUM.24.23	“No one can live when God does this.
NUM.24.24	Ships will sail from the shores of Cyprus
NUM.24.24	and defeat Assyria and Eber,
NUM.24.24	but they will also be destroyed.”
NUM.24.25	Then Balaam got up and returned home, and Balak also went on his way.
NUM.25.1	While the people of Israel were still camped at Acacia, the men began sinning sexually with Moabite women. 
NUM.25.2	The women invited them to their sacrifices to their gods, and the Israelites ate food there and worshiped these gods. 
NUM.25.3	So the Israelites began to worship Baal of Peor, and the L

NUM.25.5	So Moses said to Israel’s judges, “Each of you must put to death your people who have become worshipers of Baal of Peor.”
NUM.25.6	Moses and the Israelites were gathered at the entrance to the Meeting Tent, crying there. Then an Israelite man brought a Midianite woman to his brothers in plain sight of Moses and all the people. 
NUM.25.7	Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, so he left the meeting and got his spear. 
NUM.25.8	He followed the Israelite into his tent and drove his spear through both the Israelite man and the Midianite woman. Then the terrible sickness among the Israelites stopped.
NUM.25.9	This sickness had killed twenty-four thousand people.

NUM.25.11	“Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has saved the Israelites from my anger. He hates sin as much as I do. Since he tried to save my honor among them, I will not kill them. 
NUM.25.12	So tell Phinehas that I am making my peace agreement with him. 
NUM.25.13	He and his descendants will always be priests, because he had great concern for the honor of his God. He removed the sins of the Israelites so they would belong to God.”
NUM.25.14	The Israelite man who was killed with the Midianite woman was named Zimri son of Salu. He was the leader of a family in the tribe of Simeon.

DEU.1.1	This is the message Moses gave to all the people of Israel in the desert east of the Jordan River. They were in the desert area near Suph, between Paran and the towns of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab.
DEU.1.2	(The trip from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea on the Mount Seir road takes eleven days.) 
DEU.1.3	Forty years after the Israelites had left Egypt, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses told the people of Israel everything the L
DEU.1.4	This was after the L
DEU.1.5	Now the Israelites were east of the Jordan River in the land of Moab, and there Moses began to explain what God had commanded. He said:
DEU.1.6	The L
DEU.1.7	Get ready, and go to the mountain country of the Amorites, and to all the places around there—the Jordan Valley, the mountains, the western hills, the southern area, the seacoast, the land of Canaan, and Lebanon. Go as far as the great river, the Euphrates. 
DEU.1.8	See, I have given you this land, so go in and take it for yourselves. The L
DEU.1.9	At that time I said, “I am not able to take care of you by myself. 
DEU.1.10	The L
DEU.1.11	I pray that the L
DEU.1.12	But I cannot take care of your problems, your troubles, and your arguments by myself. 
DEU.1.13	So choose some men from each tribe—wise men who have understanding and experience—and I will make them leaders over you.”
DEU.1.14	And you said, “That’s a good thing to do.”
DEU.1.15	So I took the wise and experienced leaders of your tribes, and I made them your leaders. I appointed commanders over a thousand people, over a hundred people, over fifty people, and over ten people and made them officers over your tribes. 
DEU.1.16	Then I told your leaders, “Listen to the arguments between your people. Judge fairly between two Israelites or between an Israelite and a foreigner. 
DEU.1.17	When you judge, be fair to everyone; don’t act as if one person is more important than another, and don’t be afraid of anyone, because your decision comes from God. Bring the hard cases to me, and I will judge them.” 
DEU.1.18	At that time I told you everything you must do.
DEU.1.19	Then, as the L
DEU.1.20	I said to you, “You have now come to the mountain country of the Amorites, to the land the L
DEU.1.21	Look, here it is! Go up and take it. The L
DEU.1.22	Then all of you came to me and said, “Let’s send men before us to spy out the land. They can come back and tell us about the way we should go and the cities we will find.”
DEU.1.23	I thought that was a good idea, so I chose twelve of your men, one for each tribe. 
DEU.1.24	They left and went up to the mountains, and when they came to the Valley of Eshcol they explored it. 
DEU.1.25	They took some of the fruit from that land and brought it down to us, saying, “It is a good land that the L
DEU.1.26	But you refused to go. You would not obey the command of the L

DEU.1.35	“I promised a good land to your ancestors, but none of you evil people will see it.

DEU.1.37	Because of you, the L

DEU.1.39	“Your little children that you said would be captured, who do not know right from wrong at this time, will go into the land. I will give the land to them, and they will take it for their own. 
DEU.1.40	But you must turn around and follow the desert road toward the Red Sea.”
DEU.1.41	Then you said to me, “We have sinned against the L
DEU.1.42	But the L
DEU.1.43	So I told you, but you would not listen. You would not obey the L
DEU.1.44	and the Amorites who lived in those mountains came out and fought you. They chased you like bees and defeated you from Edom to Hormah. 
DEU.1.45	So you came back and cried before the L

DEU.2.3	“You have traveled through these mountains long enough. Turn north 
DEU.2.4	and give the people this command: ‘You will soon go through the land that belongs to your relatives, the descendants of Esau who live in Edom. They will be afraid of you, but be very careful. 
DEU.2.5	Do not go to war against them. I will not give you any of their land—not even a foot of it, because I have given the mountains of Edom to Esau as his own. 
DEU.2.6	You must pay them in silver for any food you eat or water you drink.’ ”
DEU.2.7	The L
DEU.2.8	So we passed by our relatives, the descendants of Esau who lived in Edom. We turned off the Jordan Valley road that comes from the towns of Elath and Ezion Geber and traveled along the desert road to Moab.
DEU.2.9	Then the L
DEU.2.10	(The Emites, who lived in Ar before, were strong people, and there were many of them. They were very tall, like the Anakites. 
DEU.2.11	The Emites were thought to be Rephaites, like the Anakites, but the Moabite people called them Emites. 
DEU.2.12	The Horites also lived in Edom before, but the descendants of Esau forced them out and destroyed them, taking their place as Israel did in the land the L
DEU.2.13	And the L

DEU.2.18	“Today you will pass by Ar, on the border of Moab. 
DEU.2.19	When you come near the people of Ammon, don’t bother them or go to war against them, because I will not give you any of their land as your own. I have given it to the descendants of Lot for their own.”
DEU.2.20	(That land was also thought to be a land of the Rephaites, because those people used to live there, but the Ammonites called them Zamzummites. 
DEU.2.21	They were strong people, and there were many of them; they were very tall, like the Anakites. The L
DEU.2.22	The L
DEU.2.23	The Cretan people came from Crete and destroyed the Avvites, who lived in towns all the way to Gaza; the Cretans destroyed them and took their place.)

DEU.2.25	Today I will begin to make all the people in the world afraid of you. When they hear reports about you, they will shake with fear, and they will be terrified of you.”
DEU.2.26	I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon. They offered him peace, saying, 
DEU.2.27	“If you let us pass through your country, we will stay on the road and not turn right or left. 
DEU.2.28	We will pay you in silver for any food we eat or water we drink. We only want to walk through your country. 
DEU.2.29	The descendants of Esau in Edom let us go through their land, and so did the Moabites in Ar. We want to cross the Jordan River into the land the L
DEU.2.30	But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass, because the L
DEU.2.31	The L
DEU.2.32	Then Sihon and all his army came out and fought us at Jahaz, 
DEU.2.33	but the L
DEU.2.34	We captured all his cities at that time and completely destroyed them, as well as the men, women, and children. We left no one alive. 
DEU.2.35	But we kept the cattle and valuable things from the cities for ourselves. 
DEU.2.36	We defeated Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Ravine, and we defeated the town in the ravine, and even as far as Gilead. No town was too strong for us; the L
DEU.2.37	But you did not go near the land of the Ammonites, on the shores of the Jabbok River, or the towns in the mountains, as the L
DEU.3.1	When we turned and went up the road toward Bashan, Og king of Bashan and all his army came out to fight us at Edrei. 
DEU.3.2	The L
DEU.3.3	So the L
DEU.3.4	Then we captured all of Og’s cities, all sixty of them, and took the whole area of Argob, Og’s kingdom in Bashan. 
DEU.3.5	All these were strong cities, with high walls and gates with bars. And there were also many small towns with no walls. 
DEU.3.6	We completely destroyed them, just like the cities of Sihon king of Heshbon. We killed all the men, women, and children, 
DEU.3.7	but we kept all the cattle and valuable things from the cities for ourselves.
DEU.3.8	So at that time we took the land east of the Jordan River, from the Arnon Ravine to Mount Hermon, from these two Amorite kings. 
DEU.3.9	(Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonian people, but the Amorites call it Senir.) 
DEU.3.10	We captured all the cities on the high plain and all of Gilead, and we took all of Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, towns in Og’s kingdom of Bashan. 
DEU.3.11	(Only Og king of Bashan was left of the few Rephaites. His bed was made of iron, and it was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide! It is still in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.)
DEU.3.12	At that time we took this land to be our own. I gave the people of Reuben and Gad the land from Aroer by the Arnon Ravine, as well as half of the mountain country of Gilead and the cities in it. 
DEU.3.13	To the people of East Manasseh I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og. (The area of Argob in Bashan was called the land of the Rephaites. 
DEU.3.14	Jair, a descendant of Manasseh, took the whole area of Argob, all the way to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. So that land was named for Jair, and even today Bashan is called the Towns of Jair.) 
DEU.3.15	I gave Gilead to Makir. 
DEU.3.16	I gave the Reubenites and the Gadites the land that begins at Gilead and goes from the Arnon Ravine (the middle of the Arnon is the border) to the Jabbok River, which is the Ammonite border. 
DEU.3.17	The border on the west was the Jordan River in the Jordan Valley, and it goes from Lake Galilee to the Dead Sea west of Mount Pisgah.
DEU.3.18	At that time I gave you this command: “The L
DEU.3.19	Your wives, your young children, and your cattle may stay here. I know you have many cattle, and they may stay here in the cities I have given you, 
DEU.3.20	until the L
DEU.3.21	Then I gave this command to Joshua: “You have seen for yourself all that the L
DEU.3.22	Don’t be afraid of them, because the L
DEU.3.23	Then I begged the L
DEU.3.24	“Lord G
DEU.3.25	Please let me cross the Jordan River so that I may see the good land by the Jordan. I want to see the beautiful mountains and Lebanon.”
DEU.3.26	But the L
DEU.3.27	Climb to the top of Mount Pisgah and look west, north, south, and east. You can look at the land, but you will not cross the Jordan River. 
DEU.3.28	Appoint Joshua and help him be brave and strong. He will lead the people across the river and give them the land that they are to inherit, but you can only look at it.” 
DEU.3.29	So we stayed in the valley opposite Beth Peor.
DEU.4.1	Now, Israel, listen to the laws and commands I will teach you. Obey them so that you will live and so that you will go over and take the land the L
DEU.4.2	Don’t add to these commands, and don’t leave anything out, but obey the commands of the L

DEU.4.7	No other nation is as great as we are. Their gods do not come near them, but the L
DEU.4.8	And no other nation has such good teachings and commands as those I am giving to you today.
DEU.4.9	But be careful! Watch out and don’t forget the things you have seen. Don’t forget them as long as you live, but teach them to your children and grandchildren. 
DEU.4.10	Remember the day you stood before the L

DEU.4.43	These were the cities: Bezer in the desert high plain was for the Reubenites; Ramoth in Gilead was for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan was for the Manassites.
DEU.4.44	These are the teachings Moses gave to the people of Israel. 
DEU.4.45	They are the rules, commands, and laws he gave them when they came out of Egypt. 
DEU.4.46	They were in the valley near Beth Peor, east of the Jordan River, in the land of Sihon. Sihon king of the Amorites ruled in Heshbon and was defeated by Moses and the Israelites as they came out of Egypt. 
DEU.4.47	The Israelites took his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River. 
DEU.4.48	This land went from Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon Ravine, to Mount Hermon. 
DEU.4.49	It included all the Jordan Valley east of the Jordan River, and it went as far as the Dead Sea below Mount Pisgah.
DEU.5.1	Moses called all the people of Israel together and said: Listen, Israel, to the commands and laws I am giving you today. Learn them and obey them carefully. 
DEU.5.2	The L
DEU.5.3	He did not make this Agreement with our ancestors, but he made it with us, with all of us who are alive here today. 
DEU.5.4	The L
DEU.5.5	(At that time I stood between you and the L
DEU.5.6	“I am the L
DEU.5.7	“You must not have any other gods except me.
DEU.5.8	“You must not make for yourselves any idols or anything to worship that looks like something in the sky above or on the earth below or in the water below the land. 
DEU.5.9	You must not worship or serve any idol, because I, the L
DEU.5.10	But I will be very kind for a thousand lifetimes to those who love me and obey my commands.
DEU.5.11	“You must not use the name of the L
DEU.5.12	“Keep the Sabbath as a holy day, as the L
DEU.5.13	You may work and get everything done during six days each week, 
DEU.5.14	but the seventh day is a day of rest to honor the L
DEU.5.15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the L
DEU.5.16	“Honor your father and your mother as the L
DEU.5.17	“You must not murder anyone.
DEU.5.18	“You must not be guilty of adultery.
DEU.5.19	“You must not steal.
DEU.5.20	“You must not tell lies about your neighbor.
DEU.5.21	“You must not want to take your neighbor’s wife. You must not want to take your neighbor’s house or land, his male or female slaves, his ox or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”
DEU.5.22	The L
DEU.5.23	When you heard the voice from the darkness, as the mountain was blazing with fire, all the leaders of your tribes and your elders came to me. 
DEU.5.24	And you said, “The L
DEU.5.25	But now, we will die! This great fire will burn us up, and we will die if we hear the L
DEU.5.26	No human being has ever heard the living God speaking from a fire and still lived, but we have. 
DEU.5.27	Moses, you go near and listen to everything the L
DEU.5.28	The L
DEU.5.29	I wish their hearts would always respect me and that they would always obey my commands so that things would go well for them and their children forever!
DEU.5.30	“Go and tell the people to return to their tents, 
DEU.5.31	but you stay here with me so that I may give you all the commands, rules, and laws that you must teach the people to obey in the land I am giving them as their own.”
DEU.5.32	So be careful to do what the L
DEU.5.33	Live the way the L
DEU.6.1	These are the commands, rules, and laws that the L
DEU.6.2	You, your children, and your grandchildren must respect the L
DEU.6.3	Listen, Israel, and carefully obey these laws. Then all will go well for you, and you will become a great nation in a fertile land, just as the L
DEU.6.4	Listen, people of Israel! The L
DEU.6.5	Love the L
DEU.6.6	Always remember these commands I give you today. 
DEU.6.7	Teach them to your children, and talk about them when you sit at home and walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 
DEU.6.8	Write them down and tie them to your hands as a sign. Tie them on your forehead to remind you, 
DEU.6.9	and write them on your doors and gates.
DEU.6.10	The L
DEU.6.11	houses full of good things you did not buy, wells you did not dig, and vineyards and olive trees you did not plant. You will eat as much as you want. 
DEU.6.12	But be careful! Do not forget the L
DEU.6.13	Respect the L
DEU.6.14	Do not worship other gods as the people around you do, 
DEU.6.15	because the L
DEU.6.16	Do not test the L
DEU.6.17	Be sure to obey the commands of the L
DEU.6.18	Do what the L
DEU.6.19	He will force all your enemies out as you go in, as the L
DEU.6.20	In the future when your children ask you, “What is the meaning of the laws, commands, and rules the L
DEU.6.21	tell them, “We were slaves to the king of Egypt, but the L
DEU.6.22	The L
DEU.6.23	The L
DEU.6.24	The L
DEU.6.25	The right thing for us to do is this: Obey all these rules in the presence of the L
DEU.7.1	The L
DEU.7.2	The L
DEU.7.3	Do not marry any of them, or let your daughters marry their sons, or let your sons marry their daughters. 
DEU.7.4	If you do, those people will turn your children away from me, to begin serving other gods. Then the L
DEU.7.5	This is what you must do to those people: Tear down their altars, smash their holy stone pillars, cut down their Asherah idols, and burn their idols in the fire. 
DEU.7.6	You are holy people who belong to the L
DEU.7.7	The L
DEU.7.8	But the L
DEU.7.9	So know that the L
DEU.7.10	But he will pay back those people who hate him. He will destroy them, and he will not be slow to pay back those who hate him. 
DEU.7.11	So be careful to obey the commands, rules, and laws I give you today.
DEU.7.12	If you pay attention to these laws and obey them carefully, the L
DEU.7.13	He will love and bless you. He will make the number of your people grow; he will bless you with children. He will bless your fields with good crops and will give you grain, new wine, and oil. He will bless your herds with calves and your flocks with lambs in the land he promised your ancestors he would give you. 
DEU.7.14	You will be blessed more than any other people. Every husband and wife will have children, and all your cattle will have calves. 
DEU.7.15	The L
DEU.7.16	You must destroy all the people the L
DEU.7.17	You might say to yourselves, “Because these nations are stronger than we are, we can’t force them out.” 
DEU.7.18	But don’t be afraid of them. Remember what the L
DEU.7.19	You saw for yourselves the troubles, signs, and miracles he did, how the L
DEU.7.20	The L
DEU.7.21	Don’t be afraid of them, because the L
DEU.7.22	When the L
DEU.7.23	But the L
DEU.7.24	The L
DEU.7.25	Burn up their idols in the fire. Do not wish for the silver and gold they have, and don’t take it for yourselves, or you will be trapped by it. The L
DEU.7.26	Do not bring one of those hateful things into your house, or you will be completely destroyed along with it. Hate and reject those things; they must be completely destroyed.
DEU.8.1	Carefully obey every command I give you today. Then you will live and grow in number, and you will enter and take the land the L
DEU.8.2	Remember how the L
DEU.8.3	He took away your pride when he let you get hungry, and then he fed you with manna, which neither you nor your ancestors had ever seen. This was to teach you that a person does not live on bread alone, but by everything the L
DEU.8.4	During these forty years, your clothes did not wear out, and your feet did not swell. 
DEU.8.5	Know in your heart that the L
DEU.8.6	Obey the commands of the L
DEU.8.7	The L
DEU.8.8	a land that has wheat and barley, vines, fig trees, pomegranates, olive oil, and honey. 
DEU.8.9	It is a land where you will have plenty of food, where you will have everything you need, where the rocks are iron, and where you can dig copper out of the hills.
DEU.8.10	When you have all you want to eat, then praise the L
DEU.8.11	Be careful not to forget the L
DEU.8.12	When you eat all you want and build nice houses and live in them, 
DEU.8.13	when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase, when you have more of everything, 
DEU.8.14	then your heart will become proud. You will forget the L
DEU.8.15	He led you through the large and terrible desert that was dry and had no water, and that had poisonous snakes and stinging insects. He gave you water from a solid rock 
DEU.8.16	and manna to eat in the desert. Manna was something your ancestors had never seen. He did this to take away your pride and to test you, so things would go well for you in the end. 
DEU.8.17	You might say to yourself, “I am rich because of my own power and strength,” 
DEU.8.18	but remember the L
DEU.8.19	If you ever forget the L
DEU.8.20	Just as the L
DEU.9.1	Listen, Israel. You will soon cross the Jordan River to go in and force out nations that are bigger and stronger than you. They have large cities with walls up to the sky. 
DEU.9.2	The people there are Anakites, who are strong and tall. You know about them, and you have heard it said: “No one can stop the Anakites.” 
DEU.9.3	But today remember that the L
DEU.9.4	After the L
DEU.9.5	You are going in to take the land, not because you are good and honest, but because these nations are evil. That is why the L
DEU.9.6	The L
DEU.9.7	Remember this and do not forget it: You made the L
DEU.9.8	At Mount Sinai you made the L
DEU.9.9	When I went up on the mountain to receive the stone tablets, the tablets with the Agreement the L
DEU.9.10	The L
DEU.9.11	When the forty days and forty nights were over, the L
DEU.9.12	Then the L
DEU.9.13	The L
DEU.9.14	Get away so that I may destroy them and make the whole world forget who they are. Then I will make another nation from you that will be bigger and stronger than they are.”
DEU.9.15	So I turned and came down the mountain that was burning with fire, and the two stone tablets with the Agreement were in my hands. 
DEU.9.16	When I looked, I saw you had sinned against the L
DEU.9.17	So I took the two stone tablets and threw them down, breaking them into pieces right in front of you.
DEU.9.18	Then I again bowed facedown on the ground before the L
DEU.9.19	I was afraid of the L
DEU.9.20	And the L
DEU.9.21	I took that sinful calf idol you had made and burned it in the fire. I crushed it into a powder like dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain.
DEU.9.22	You also made the L
DEU.9.23	Then the L
DEU.9.24	You have refused to obey the L
DEU.9.25	The L
DEU.9.26	I prayed to the L
DEU.9.27	Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don’t look at how stubborn these people are, and don’t look at their sin and evil. 
DEU.9.28	Otherwise, Egypt will say, ‘It was because the L
DEU.9.29	But they are your people, L
DEU.10.1	At that time the L
DEU.10.2	I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the first tablets, which you broke, and you will put the new tablets in the Ark.”
DEU.10.3	So I made the Ark out of acacia wood, and I cut out two stone tablets like the first ones. Then I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. 
DEU.10.4	The L
DEU.10.5	Then I turned and came down the mountain; I put the tablets in the Ark I had made, as the L
DEU.10.6	(The people of Israel went from the wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah. Aaron died there and was buried; his son Eleazar became priest in his place. 
DEU.10.7	From Moserah they went to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah they went to Jotbathah, a place with streams of water. 
DEU.10.8	At that time the L
DEU.10.9	That is why the Levites did not receive any land of their own; instead, they received the L
DEU.10.10	I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights just like the first time, and the L
DEU.10.11	The L
DEU.10.12	Now, Israel, this is what the L
DEU.10.13	and obey the L
DEU.10.14	The L
DEU.10.15	But the L
DEU.10.16	Give yourselves completely to serving him, and do not be stubborn any longer. 
DEU.10.17	The L
DEU.10.18	He helps orphans and widows, and he loves foreigners and gives them food and clothes. 
DEU.10.19	You also must love foreigners, because you were foreigners in Egypt. 
DEU.10.20	Respect the L
DEU.10.21	He is the one you should praise; he is your God, who has done great and wonderful things for you, which you have seen with your own eyes. 
DEU.10.22	There were only seventy of your ancestors when they went down to Egypt, and now the L
DEU.11.1	Love the L
DEU.11.2	Remember today it was not your children who saw and felt the correction of the L
DEU.11.3	or his signs and the things he did in Egypt to the king and his whole country. 
DEU.11.4	They did not see what he did to the Egyptian army, its horses and chariots, when he drowned them in the Red Sea as they were chasing you. The L
DEU.11.5	They did not see what he did for you in the desert until you arrived here. 
DEU.11.6	They did not see what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab the Reubenite, when the ground opened up and swallowed them, their families, their tents, and everyone who stood with them in Israel. 
DEU.11.7	It was you who saw all these great things the L
DEU.11.8	So obey all the commands I am giving you today so that you will be strong and can go in and take the land you are going to take as your own. 
DEU.11.9	Then you will live a long time in the land that the L
DEU.11.10	The land you are going to take is not like Egypt, where you were. There you had to plant your seed and water it, like a vegetable garden, by using your feet. 
DEU.11.11	But the land that you will soon cross the Jordan River to take is a land of hills and valleys, a land that drinks rain from heaven. 
DEU.11.12	It is a land the L
DEU.11.13	If you carefully obey the commands I am giving you today and love the L
DEU.11.14	then he will send rain on your land at the right time, in the fall and spring, and you will be able to gather your grain, new wine, and oil. 
DEU.11.15	He will put grass in the fields for your cattle, and you will have plenty to eat.
DEU.11.16	Be careful, or you will be fooled and will turn away to serve and worship other gods. 
DEU.11.17	If you do, the L
DEU.11.18	Remember my words with your whole being. Write them down and tie them to your hands as a sign; tie them on your foreheads to remind you. 
DEU.11.19	Teach them well to your children, talking about them when you sit at home and walk along the road, when you lie down and when you get up. 
DEU.11.20	Write them on your doors and gates 
DEU.11.21	so that both you and your children will live a long time in the land the L
DEU.11.22	If you are careful to obey every command I am giving you to follow, and love the L
DEU.11.23	then the L
DEU.11.24	Everywhere you step will be yours. Your land will go from the desert to Lebanon and from the Euphrates River to the Mediterranean Sea. 
DEU.11.25	No one will be able to stop you. The L
DEU.11.26	See, today I am letting you choose a blessing or a curse. 
DEU.11.27	You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the L
DEU.11.28	But you will be cursed if you disobey the commands of the L
DEU.11.29	When the L
DEU.11.30	(These mountains are on the other side of the Jordan River, to the west, toward the sunset. They are near the great trees of Moreh in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Jordan Valley opposite Gilgal.) 
DEU.11.31	You will soon cross the Jordan River to enter and take the land the L
DEU.11.32	be careful to obey all the commands and laws I am giving you today.
DEU.12.1	These are the commands and laws you must carefully obey in the land the L
DEU.12.2	When you inherit the lands of these nations, you must completely destroy all the places where they serve their gods, on high mountains and hills and under every green tree. 
DEU.12.3	Tear down their altars, smash their holy stone pillars, and burn their Asherah idols in the fire. Cut down their idols and destroy their names from those places.
DEU.12.4	Don’t worship the L
DEU.12.5	but look for the place the L
DEU.12.6	and bring to that place your burnt offerings and sacrifices; bring a tenth of what you gain and your special gifts; bring what you have promised and the special gifts you want to give the L
DEU.12.7	There you will be together with the L
DEU.12.8	Do not worship the way we have been doing today, each person doing what he thinks is right. 
DEU.12.9	You have not yet come to a resting place, to the land the L
DEU.12.10	But soon you will cross the Jordan River to live in the land the L
DEU.12.11	Then the L
DEU.12.12	There rejoice before the L
DEU.12.13	Be careful that you don’t sacrifice your burnt offerings just anywhere you please. 
DEU.12.14	Offer them only in the place the L
DEU.12.15	But you may kill your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want, as if it were a deer or a gazelle; this is the blessing the L
DEU.12.16	but do not eat the blood. Pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.17	Do not eat in your own towns what belongs to the L
DEU.12.18	Eat these things when you are together with the L
DEU.12.19	Be careful not to forget the Levites as long as you live in the land.
DEU.12.20	When the L
DEU.12.21	If the L
DEU.12.22	as you would eat gazelle or deer meat. Both clean and unclean people may eat this meat, 
DEU.12.23	but be sure you don’t eat the blood, because the life is in the blood. Don’t eat the life with the meat. 
DEU.12.24	Don’t eat the blood, but pour it out on the ground like water. 
DEU.12.25	If you don’t eat it, things will go well for you and your children, because you will be doing what the L
DEU.12.26	Take your holy things and the things you have promised to give, and go to the place the L
DEU.12.27	Present your burnt offerings on the altar of the L
DEU.12.28	Be careful to obey all the rules I am giving you so that things will always go well for you and your children, and you will be doing what the L
DEU.12.29	You will enter the land and take it away from the nations that the L
DEU.12.30	they will be destroyed for you, but be careful not to be trapped by asking about their gods. Don’t say, “How do these nations worship? I will do the same.” 
DEU.12.31	Don’t worship the L
DEU.12.32	Be sure to do everything I have commanded you. Do not add anything to it, and do not take anything away from it.
DEU.13.1	Prophets or those who tell the future with dreams might come to you and say they will show you a miracle or a sign. 
DEU.13.2	The miracle or sign might even happen, and then they might say, “Let’s serve other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let’s worship them.” 
DEU.13.3	But you must not listen to those prophets or dreamers. The L
DEU.13.4	Serve only the L
DEU.13.5	The prophets or dreamers must be killed, because they said you should turn against the L
DEU.13.6	Someone might try to lead you to serve other gods—it might be your brother, your son or daughter, the wife you love, or a close friend. The person might say, “Let’s go and worship other gods.” (These are gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, 
DEU.13.7	gods of the people who live around you, either nearby or far away, from one end of the land to the other.) 
DEU.13.8	Do not give in to such people. Do not listen or feel sorry for them, and do not let them go free or protect them. 
DEU.13.9	You must put them to death. You must be the first one to start to kill them, and then everyone else must join in. 
DEU.13.10	You must throw stones at them until they die, because they tried to turn you away from the L
DEU.13.11	Then everyone in Israel will hear about this and be afraid, and no one among you will ever do such an evil thing again.
DEU.13.12	The L
DEU.13.13	that evil people have moved in among you. And they might lead the people of that city away from God, saying, “Let’s go and worship other gods.” (These are gods you have not known.) 
DEU.13.14	Then you must ask about it, looking into the matter and checking carefully whether it is true. If it is proved that a hateful thing has happened among you, 
DEU.13.15	you must kill with a sword everyone who lives in that city. Destroy the city completely and kill everyone in it, as well as the animals, with a sword. 
DEU.13.16	Gather up everything those people owned, and put it in the middle of the city square. Then completely burn the city and everything they owned as a burnt offering to the L
DEU.13.17	Don’t keep for yourselves any of the things found in that city, so the L
DEU.13.18	You will have obeyed the L
DEU.14.1	You are the children of the L
DEU.14.2	You are holy people, who belong to the L
DEU.14.3	Do not eat anything the L
DEU.14.4	These are the animals you may eat: oxen, sheep, goats, 
DEU.14.5	deer, gazelle, roe deer, wild goats, ibex, antelope, and mountain sheep. 
DEU.14.6	You may eat any animal that has a split hoof and chews the cud, 
DEU.14.7	but you may not eat camels, rabbits, or rock badgers. These animals chew the cud, but they do not have split hoofs, so they are unclean for you. 
DEU.14.8	Pigs are also unclean for you; they have split hoofs, but they do not chew the cud. Do not eat their meat or touch their dead bodies.
DEU.14.9	There are many things that live in the water. You may eat anything that has fins and scales, 
DEU.14.10	but do not eat anything that does not have fins and scales. It is unclean for you.
DEU.14.11	You may eat any clean bird. 
DEU.14.12	But do not eat these birds: eagles, vultures, black vultures, 
DEU.14.13	red kites, falcons, any kind of kite, 
DEU.14.14	any kind of raven, 
DEU.14.15	horned owls, screech owls, sea gulls, any kind of hawk, 
DEU.14.16	little owls, great owls, white owls, 
DEU.14.17	desert owls, ospreys, cormorants, 
DEU.14.18	storks, any kind of heron, the hoopoes, or bats.
DEU.14.19	All insects with wings are unclean for you; do not eat them. 
DEU.14.20	Other things with wings are clean, and you may eat them.
DEU.14.21	Do not eat anything you find that is already dead. You may give it to a foreigner living in your town, and he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner. But you are holy people, who belong to the L
DEU.14.21	Do not cook a baby goat in its mother’s milk.
DEU.14.22	Be sure to save one-tenth of all your crops each year. 
DEU.14.23	Take it to the place the L
DEU.14.24	But if the place the L
DEU.14.25	exchange your one-tenth for silver. Then take the silver with you to the place the L
DEU.14.26	Use the silver to buy anything you wish—cattle, sheep, wine, beer, or anything you wish. Then you and your family will eat and celebrate there before the L
DEU.14.27	Do not forget the Levites in your town, because they have no land of their own among you.
DEU.14.28	At the end of every third year, everyone should bring one-tenth of that year’s crop and store it in your towns. 
DEU.14.29	This is for the Levites so they may eat and be full. (They have no land of their own among you.) It is also for strangers, orphans, and widows who live in your towns so that all of them may eat and be full. Then the L
DEU.15.1	At the end of every seven years, you must tell those who owe you anything that they do not have to pay you back. 
DEU.15.2	This is how you must do it: Everyone who has loaned money must cancel the loan and not make a neighbor or relative pay it back. This is the L
DEU.15.3	You may make a foreigner pay what is owed to you, but you must not collect what another Israelite owes you. 
DEU.15.4	But there should be no poor people among you, because the L
DEU.15.5	He will bless you if you obey the L
DEU.15.6	The L
DEU.15.7	If there are poor among you, in one of the towns of the land the L
DEU.15.8	But give freely to them, and freely lend them whatever they need. 
DEU.15.9	Beware of evil thoughts. Don’t think, “The seventh year is near, the year to cancel what people owe.” You might be mean to the needy and not give them anything. Then they will complain to the L
DEU.15.10	Give freely to the poor person, and do not wish that you didn’t have to give. The L
DEU.15.11	There will always be poor people in the land, so I command you to give freely to your neighbors and to the poor and needy in your land.
DEU.15.12	If one of your own people sells himself to you as a slave, whether it is a Hebrew man or woman, that person will serve you for six years. But in the seventh year you must let the slave go free. 
DEU.15.13	When you let slaves go, don’t send them away without anything. 
DEU.15.14	Give them some of your flock, your grain, and your wine, giving to them as the L
DEU.15.15	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and the L
DEU.15.16	But if your slave says to you, “I don’t want to leave you,” because he loves you and your family and has a good life with you, 
DEU.15.17	stick an awl through his ear into the door; he will be your slave for life. Also do this to a female slave.
DEU.15.18	Do not think of it as a hard thing when you let your slaves go free. After all, they served you six years and did twice the work of a hired person. The L

DEU.17.18	When he becomes king, he should write a copy of the teachings on a scroll for himself, a copy taken from the priests and Levites.

DEU.19.4	This is the rule for someone who kills another person and runs to one of these cities in order to save his life. But the person must have killed a neighbor without meaning to, not out of hatred. 
DEU.19.5	For example, suppose someone goes into the forest with a neighbor to cut wood and swings an ax to cut down a tree. If the ax head flies off the handle, hitting and killing the neighbor, the one who killed him may run to one of these cities to save his life. 
DEU.19.6	Otherwise, the dead person’s relative who has the duty of punishing a murderer might be angry and chase him. If the city is far away, the relative might catch and kill the person, even though he should not be killed because there was no intent to kill his neighbor. 
DEU.19.7	This is why I command you to choose these three cities.

DEU.19.11	But if a person hates his neighbor and, after hiding and waiting, attacks and kills him and then runs to one of these cities for safety, 
DEU.19.12	the elders of his own city should send for the murderer. They should bring the person back from the city of safety and hand him over to the relative who has the duty of punishing the murderer. 
DEU.19.13	Show no mercy. You must remove from Israel the guilt of murdering innocent people so that things will go well for you.
DEU.19.14	Do not move the stone that marks the border of your neighbor’s land, which people long ago set in place. It marks what you inherit in the land the L
DEU.19.15	One witness is not enough to accuse a person of a crime or sin. A case must be proved by two or three witnesses.

DEU.19.18	The judges must check the matter carefully. The witness who is a liar, lying about a fellow Israelite, 
DEU.19.19	must be punished. He must be punished in the same way the other person would have been punished. You must get rid of the evil among you. 
DEU.19.20	The rest of the people will hear about this and be afraid, and no one among you will ever do such an evil thing again. 
DEU.19.21	Show no mercy. A life must be paid for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot.
DEU.20.1	When you go to war against your enemies and you see horses and chariots and an army that is bigger than yours, don’t be afraid of them. The L
DEU.20.2	The priest must come and speak to the army before you go into battle. 
DEU.20.3	He will say, “Listen, Israel! Today you are going into battle against your enemies. Don’t lose your courage or be afraid. Don’t panic or be frightened, 
DEU.20.4	because the L
DEU.20.5	The officers should say to the army, “Has anyone built a new house but not given it to God? He may go home, because he might die in battle and someone else would get to give his house to God. 
DEU.20.6	Has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it? He may go home, because he might die in battle and someone else would enjoy his vineyard. 
DEU.20.7	Is any man engaged to a woman and not yet married to her? He may go home, because he might die in battle and someone else would marry her.” 
DEU.20.8	Then the officers should also say, “Is anyone here afraid? Has anyone lost his courage? He may go home so that he will not cause others to lose their courage, too.” 
DEU.20.9	When the officers finish speaking to the army, they should appoint commanders to lead it.
DEU.20.10	When you march up to attack a city, first make them an offer of peace. 
DEU.20.11	If they accept your offer and open their gates to you, all the people of that city will become your slaves and work for you. 
DEU.20.12	But if they do not make peace with you and fight you in battle, you should surround that city.

DEU.20.19	If you surround and attack a city for a long time, trying to capture it, do not destroy its trees with an ax. You can eat the fruit from the trees, but do not cut them down. These trees are not the enemy, so don’t make war against them. 
DEU.20.20	But you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build devices to attack the city walls, until the city is captured.
DEU.21.1	Suppose someone is found murdered, lying in a field in the land the L
DEU.21.2	Your elders and judges should go to where the body was found, and they should measure how far it is to the nearby cities. 
DEU.21.3	The elders of the city nearest the body must take a young cow that has never worked or worn a yoke, 
DEU.21.4	and they must lead her down to a valley that has never been plowed or planted, with a stream flowing through it. There they must break the young cow’s neck. 
DEU.21.5	The priests, the sons of Levi, should come forward, because they have been chosen by the L
DEU.21.6	Then all the elders of the city nearest the murdered person should wash their hands over the young cow whose neck was broken in the valley. 
DEU.21.7	They should declare: “We did not kill this person, and we did not see it happen.

DEU.21.11	If you see a beautiful woman among the captives and are attracted to her, you may take her as your wife. 
DEU.21.12	Bring her into your home, where she must shave her head and cut her nails 
DEU.21.13	and change the clothes she was wearing when you captured her. After she has lived in your house and cried for her parents for a month, you may marry her. You will be her husband, and she will be your wife. 
DEU.21.14	But if you are not pleased with her, you must let her go anywhere she wants. You must not sell her for money or make her a slave, because you have taken away her honor.
DEU.21.15	A man might have two wives, one he loves and one he doesn’t. Both wives might have sons by him. If the older son belongs to the wife he does not love, 
DEU.21.16	when that man wills his property to his sons he must not give the son of the wife he loves what belongs to the older son, the son of the wife he does not love. 
DEU.21.17	He must agree to give the older son two shares of everything he owns, even though the older son is from the wife he does not love. That son was the first to prove his father could have children, so he has the rights that belong to the older son.
DEU.21.18	If someone has a son who is stubborn, who turns against his father and mother and doesn’t obey them or listen when they correct him, 
DEU.21.19	his parents must take him to the elders at the city gate. 
DEU.21.20	They will say to the elders, “Our son is stubborn and turns against us. He will not obey us. He eats too much, and he is always drunk.” 
DEU.21.21	Then all the men in his town must throw stones at him until he dies. Get rid of the evil among you, because then all the people of Israel will hear about this and be afraid.
DEU.21.22	If someone is guilty of a sin worthy of death, he must be put to death and his body displayed on a tree. 
DEU.21.23	But don’t leave his body hanging on the tree overnight; be sure to bury him that same day, because anyone whose body is displayed on a tree is cursed by God. You must not ruin the land the L
DEU.22.1	If you see your fellow Israelite’s ox or sheep wandering away, don’t ignore it. Take it back to its owner. 
DEU.22.2	If the owner does not live close to you, or if you do not know who the owner is, take the animal home with you. Keep it until the owner comes looking for it; then give it back. 
DEU.22.3	Do the same thing if you find a donkey or coat or anything someone lost. Don’t just ignore it.
DEU.22.4	If you see your fellow Israelite’s donkey or ox fallen on the road, don’t ignore it. Help the owner get it up.
DEU.22.5	A woman must not wear men’s clothes, and a man must not wear women’s clothes. The L
DEU.22.6	If you find a bird’s nest by the road, either in a tree or on the ground, and the mother bird is sitting on the young birds or eggs, do not take the mother bird with the young birds. 
DEU.22.7	You may take the young birds, but you must let the mother bird go free. Then things will go well for you, and you will live a long time.
DEU.22.8	When you build a new house, build a low wall around the edge of the roof so you will not be guilty if someone falls off the roof.
DEU.22.9	Don’t plant two different kinds of seeds in your vineyard. Otherwise, both crops will be ruined.
DEU.22.10	Don’t plow with an ox and a donkey tied together.
DEU.22.11	Don’t wear clothes made of wool and linen woven together.
DEU.22.12	Tie several pieces of thread together; then put these tassels on the four corners of your coat.
DEU.22.13	If a man marries a girl and has sexual relations with her but then decides he does not like her, 
DEU.22.14	he might talk badly about her and give her a bad name. He might say, “I married this woman, but when I had sexual relations with her, I did not find that she was a virgin.” 
DEU.22.15	Then the girl’s parents must bring proof that she was a virgin to the elders at the city gate. 
DEU.22.16	The girl’s father will say to the elders, “I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife, but now he does not want her. 
DEU.22.17	This man has told lies about my daughter. He has said, ‘I did not find your daughter to be a virgin,’ but here is the proof that my daughter was a virgin.” Then her parents are to show the sheet to the elders of the city, 
DEU.22.18	and the elders must take the man and punish him. 
DEU.22.19	They must make him pay about two and one-half pounds of silver to the girl’s father, because the man has given an Israelite virgin a bad name. The girl will continue to be the man’s wife, and he may not divorce her as long as he lives.
DEU.22.20	But if the things the husband said about his wife are true, and there is no proof that she was a virgin, 
DEU.22.21	the girl must be brought to the door of her father’s house. Then the men of the town must put her to death by throwing stones at her. She has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by having sexual relations before she was married. You must get rid of the evil among you.
DEU.22.22	If a man is found having sexual relations with another man’s wife, both the woman and the man who had sexual relations with her must die. Get rid of this evil from Israel.
DEU.22.23	If a man meets a virgin in a city and has sexual relations with her, but she is engaged to another man, 
DEU.22.24	you must take both of them to the city gate and put them to death by throwing stones at them. Kill the girl, because she was in a city and did not scream for help. And kill the man for having sexual relations with another man’s wife. You must get rid of the evil among you.
DEU.22.25	But if a man meets an engaged girl out in the country and forces her to have sexual relations with him, only the man who had sexual relations with her must be put to death. 
DEU.22.26	Don’t do anything to the girl, because she has not done a sin worthy of death. This is like the person who attacks and murders a neighbor; 
DEU.22.27	the man found the engaged girl in the country and she screamed, but no one was there to save her.
DEU.22.28	If a man meets a virgin who is not engaged to be married and forces her to have sexual relations with him and people find out about it, 
DEU.22.29	the man must pay the girl’s father about one and one-fourth pounds of silver. He must also marry the girl, because he has dishonored her, and he may never divorce her for as long as he lives.
DEU.22.30	A man must not marry his father’s wife; he must not dishonor his father in this way.

DEU.23.12	Choose a place outside the camp where people may go to relieve themselves.

DEU.23.25	If you go into your neighbor’s grainfield, you may pick grain with your hands, but you must not cut down your neighbor’s grain with your sickle.
DEU.24.1	A man might marry a woman but later decide she doesn’t please him because he has found something bad about her. He writes out divorce papers for her, gives them to her, and sends her away from his house. 
DEU.24.2	After she leaves his house, she goes and marries another man, 
DEU.24.3	but her second husband does not like her either. So he writes out divorce papers for her, gives them to her, and sends her away from his house. Or the second husband might die. 
DEU.24.4	In either case, her first husband who divorced her must not marry her again, because she has become unclean. The L
DEU.24.5	A man who has just married must not be sent to war or be given any other duty. He should be free to stay home for a year to make his new wife happy.
DEU.24.6	If someone owes you something, do not take his two stones for grinding grain—not even the upper one—in place of what he owes, because this is how the person makes a living.
DEU.24.7	If someone kidnaps a fellow Israelite, either to make him a slave or sell him, the kidnapper must be killed. You must get rid of the evil among you.

DEU.24.16	Parents must not be put to death if their children do wrong, and children must not be put to death if their parents do wrong. Each person must die for his own sin.

DEU.24.22	Remember that you were slaves in Egypt; that is why I am commanding you to do this.
DEU.25.1	If two people have an argument and go to court, the judges will decide the case. They will declare one person right and the other guilty. 
DEU.25.2	If the guilty person has to be punished with a beating, the judge will make that person lie down and be beaten in front of him. The number of lashes should match the crime. 
DEU.25.3	But don’t hit a person more than forty times, because more than that would disgrace him before others.
DEU.25.4	When an ox is working in the grain, do not cover its mouth to keep it from eating.
DEU.25.5	If two brothers are living together, and one of them dies without having a son, his widow must not marry someone outside her husband’s family. Her husband’s brother must marry her, which is his duty to her as a brother-in-law. 
DEU.25.6	The first son she has counts as the son of the dead brother so that his name will not be forgotten in Israel.
DEU.25.7	But if a man does not want to marry his brother’s widow, she should go to the elders at the town gate. She should say, “My brother-in-law will not carry on his brother’s name in Israel. He refuses to do his duty for me.”
DEU.25.8	Then the elders of the town must call for the man and talk to him. But if he is stubborn and says, “I don’t want to marry her,” 
DEU.25.9	the woman must go up to him in front of the leaders. She must take off one of his sandals and spit in his face and say, “This is for the man who won’t continue his brother’s family!” 
DEU.25.10	Then that man’s family shall be known in Israel as the Family of the Unsandaled.

DEU.27.13	And these tribes must stand on Mount Ebal to announce the curses: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

DEU.30.11	This command I give you today is not too hard for you; it is not beyond what you can do. 
DEU.30.12	It is not up in heaven. You do not have to ask, “Who will go up to heaven and get it for us so we can obey it and keep it?” 
DEU.30.13	It is not on the other side of the sea. You do not have to ask, “Who will go across the sea and get it? Who will tell it to us so we can keep it?” 
DEU.30.14	No, the word is very near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it.
DEU.30.15	Look, today I offer you life and success, death and destruction.

DEU.31.10+DEU.31.11	Then Moses commanded them: “Read these teachings for all Israel to hear at the end of every seven years, which is the year to cancel what people owe. Do it during the Feast of Shelters, when all the Israelites will come to appear before the L
DEU.31.12	Gather all the people: the men, women, children, and foreigners living in your towns so that they can listen and learn to respect the L
DEU.31.13	Since their children do not know this law, they must hear it. They must learn to respect the L
DEU.31.14	The L
DEU.31.15	The L
DEU.31.16	And the L
DEU.31.17	Then I will become very angry at them, and I will leave them. I will turn away from them, and they will be destroyed. Many terrible things will happen to them. Then they will say, ‘It is because God is not with us that these terrible things are happening.’ 
DEU.31.18	I will surely turn away from them then, because they have done wrong and have turned to other gods.
DEU.31.19	“Now write down this song and teach it to the Israelites. Then have them sing it, because it will be my witness against them. 
DEU.31.20	When I bring them into the land I promised to their ancestors, a fertile land, they will eat as much as they want and get fat. Then they will turn to other gods and serve them. They will reject me and break my Agreement. 
DEU.31.21	Then when many troubles and terrible things happen to them, this song will testify against them, because the song will not be forgotten by their descendants. I know what they plan to do, even before I take them into the land I promised them.” 
DEU.31.22	So Moses wrote down the song that day, and he taught it to the Israelites.
DEU.31.23	Then the L
DEU.31.24	After Moses finished writing all the words of the teachings in a book,

DEU.32.4	who is right and fair.
DEU.32.5	They have done evil against him.
DEU.32.5	To their shame they are no longer his children;
DEU.32.5	they are an evil and lying people.
DEU.32.6	This is not the way to repay the L
DEU.32.6	you foolish and unwise people.
DEU.32.6	He is your Father and Maker,
DEU.32.6	who made you and formed you.
DEU.32.7	Remember the old days.
DEU.32.7	Think of the years already passed.
DEU.32.7	Ask your father and he will tell you;
DEU.32.7	ask your elders and they will inform you.
DEU.32.8	God Most High gave the nations their lands,
DEU.32.8	dividing up the human race.

DEU.32.10	guarding them as those he loved very much.
DEU.32.11	He was like an eagle building its nest
DEU.32.11	that flutters over its young.

DEU.32.13	He gave them honey from the rocks,
DEU.32.13	bringing oil from the solid rock.
DEU.32.14	There were milk curds from the cows and milk from the flock;
DEU.32.14	there were fat sheep and goats.
DEU.32.14	There were sheep and goats from Bashan
DEU.32.14	and the best of the wheat.
DEU.32.14	You drank the juice of grapes.
DEU.32.15	Israel grew fat and kicked;
DEU.32.15	they were fat and full and firm.
DEU.32.15	They left the God who made them
DEU.32.15	and rejected the Rock who saved them.
DEU.32.16	They made God jealous with foreign gods
DEU.32.16	and angry with hateful idols.
DEU.32.17	They made sacrifices to demons, not God,
DEU.32.17	to gods they had never known,
DEU.32.17	new gods from nearby,
DEU.32.17	gods your ancestors did not fear.
DEU.32.18	You left God who is the Rock, your Father,
DEU.32.18	and you forgot the God who gave you birth.
DEU.32.19	The L
DEU.32.19	his sons and daughters had made him angry.
DEU.32.20	He said, “I will turn away from them
DEU.32.20	and see what will happen to them.
DEU.32.20	They are evil people,
DEU.32.20	unfaithful children.
DEU.32.21	They used things that are not gods to make me jealous
DEU.32.21	and worthless idols to make me angry.
DEU.32.21	So I will use those who are not a nation to make them jealous;
DEU.32.21	I will use a nation that does not understand to make them angry.
DEU.32.22	My anger has started a fire
DEU.32.22	that burns down to the place of the dead.

DEU.32.40	I raise my hand toward heaven and make this promise:
DEU.32.40	As surely as I live forever,
DEU.32.41	I will sharpen my flashing sword,
DEU.32.41	and I will take it in my hand to judge.
DEU.32.41	I will punish my enemies
DEU.32.41	and pay back those who hate me.
DEU.32.42	My arrows will be covered with their blood;
DEU.32.42	my sword will eat their flesh.
DEU.32.42	The blood will flow from those who are killed and the captives.
DEU.32.42	The heads of the enemy leaders will be cut off.”
DEU.32.43	Be happy, nations, with his people,
DEU.32.43	because he will repay you for the blood of his servants.
DEU.32.43	He will punish his enemies,
DEU.32.43	and he will remove the sin of his land and people.
DEU.32.44	Moses came with Joshua son of Nun, and they spoke all the words of this song for the people to hear. 
DEU.32.45	When Moses finished speaking these words to all Israel, 
DEU.32.46	he said to them: “Pay careful attention to all the words I have said to you today, and command your children to obey carefully everything in these teachings. 
DEU.32.47	These should not be unimportant words for you, but rather they mean life for you! By these words you will live a long time in the land you are crossing the Jordan River to take as your own.”
DEU.32.48	The L
DEU.32.49	“Go up the Abarim Mountains, to Mount Nebo in the country of Moab, across from Jericho. Look at the land of Canaan that I am giving to the Israelites as their own. 
DEU.32.50	On that mountain that you climb, you will die and join your ancestors, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and joined his ancestors. 
DEU.32.51	You both sinned against me at the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the Desert of Zin, and you did not honor me as holy there among the Israelites. 
DEU.32.52	So now you will only look at the land from far away. You will not enter the land I am giving the people of Israel.”
DEU.33.1	Moses, the man of God, gave this blessing to the Israelites before he died. 
DEU.33.2	He said:
DEU.33.2	“The L

DEU.33.3	and takes care of all those who belong to him.
DEU.33.3	They bow down at his feet,
DEU.33.3	and they are taught by him.
DEU.33.4	Moses gave us the teachings
DEU.33.4	that belong to the people of Jacob.
DEU.33.5	The L
DEU.33.5	when the leaders of the people gathered,
DEU.33.5	when the tribes of Israel came together.
DEU.33.6	“Let the people of Reuben live and not die,
DEU.33.6	but let the people be few.”
DEU.33.7	Moses said this about the people of Judah:
DEU.33.7	“L
DEU.33.7	bring them back to their people.
DEU.33.7	They defend themselves with their hands.
DEU.33.7	Help them fight their enemies!”
DEU.33.8	Moses said this about the people of Levi:
DEU.33.8	“L
DEU.33.8	to Levi, whom you love.
DEU.33.8	L
DEU.33.8	and argued with him at the waters of Meribah.
DEU.33.9	He said about his father and mother,
DEU.33.9	‘I don’t care about them.’
DEU.33.9	He did not treat his brothers as favorites
DEU.33.9	or give special favors to his children,
DEU.33.9	but he protected your word
DEU.33.9	and guarded your agreement.
DEU.33.10	He teaches your laws to the people of Jacob
DEU.33.10	and your teachings to the people of Israel.
DEU.33.10	He burns incense before you
DEU.33.10	and makes whole burnt offerings on your altar.
DEU.33.11	L
DEU.33.11	be pleased with the work they do.
DEU.33.11	Defeat those who attack them,
DEU.33.11	and don’t let their enemies rise up again.”
DEU.33.12	Moses said this about the people of Benjamin:
DEU.33.12	“The L
DEU.33.12	because he protects them all day long.
DEU.33.12	The ones he loves rest with him.”
DEU.33.13	Moses said this about the people of Joseph:
DEU.33.13	“May the L

DEU.33.14	with the best fruits that the sun brings,
DEU.33.14	and with the best fruits that the moon brings.
DEU.33.15	Let the old mountains give the finest crops,
DEU.33.15	and let the everlasting hills give the best fruits.
DEU.33.16	Let the full earth give the best fruits,
DEU.33.16	and let the L
DEU.33.16	May these blessings rest on the head of Joseph,
DEU.33.16	on the forehead of the one who was blessed among his brothers.
DEU.33.17	Joseph has the majesty of a firstborn bull;
DEU.33.17	he is as strong as a wild ox.
DEU.33.17	He will stab other nations,
DEU.33.17	even those nations far away.
DEU.33.17	These are the ten thousands of Ephraim,
DEU.33.17	and these are the thousands of Manasseh.”
DEU.33.18	Moses said this about the people of Zebulun:
DEU.33.18	“Be happy when you go out, Zebulun,
DEU.33.18	and be happy in your tents, Issachar.
DEU.33.19	They will call the people to the mountain,
DEU.33.19	and there they will offer the right sacrifices.
DEU.33.19	They will do well from all that is in the sea,
DEU.33.19	and they will do well from the treasures hidden in the sand on the shore.”
DEU.33.20	Moses said this about the people of Gad:
DEU.33.20	“Praise God who gives Gad more land!
DEU.33.20	Gad lives there like a lion,
DEU.33.20	who tears off arms and heads.
DEU.33.21	They chose the best land for themselves.
DEU.33.21	They received a large share, like that given to an officer.
DEU.33.21	When the leaders of the people gathered,
DEU.33.21	the people of Gad did what the L
DEU.33.21	and they judged Israel fairly.”
DEU.33.22	Moses said this about the people of Dan:
DEU.33.22	“Dan is like a lion’s cub,
DEU.33.22	who jumps out of Bashan.”
DEU.33.23	Moses said this about the people of Naphtali:
DEU.33.23	“Naphtali enjoys special kindnesses,
DEU.33.23	and they are full of the L
DEU.33.23	Take as your own the west and south.”
DEU.33.24	Moses said this about the people of Asher:
DEU.33.24	“Asher is the most blessed of the sons;
DEU.33.24	let him be his brothers’ favorite.
DEU.33.24	Let him bathe his feet in olive oil.
DEU.33.25	Your gates will have locks of iron and bronze,
DEU.33.25	and you will be strong as long as you live.
DEU.33.26	“There is no one like the God of Israel,
DEU.33.26	who rides through the skies to help you,
DEU.33.26	who rides on the clouds in his majesty.
DEU.33.27	The everlasting God is your place of safety,
DEU.33.27	and his arms will hold you up forever.
DEU.33.27	He will force your enemy out ahead of you,
DEU.33.27	saying, ‘Destroy the enemy!’
DEU.33.28	The people of Israel will lie down in safety.
DEU.33.28	Jacob’s spring is theirs alone.
DEU.33.28	Theirs is a land full of grain and new wine,
DEU.33.28	where the skies drop their dew.
DEU.33.29	Israel, you are blessed!
DEU.33.29	No one else is like you,
DEU.33.29	because you are a people saved by the L
DEU.33.29	He is your shield and helper,
DEU.33.29	your glorious sword.
DEU.33.29	Your enemies will be afraid of you,
DEU.33.29	and you will walk all over their holy places.”
DEU.34.1	Then Moses climbed Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab to the top of Mount Pisgah, across from Jericho. From there the L
DEU.34.2	all of Naphtali and the lands of Ephraim and Manasseh, all the land of Judah as far as the Mediterranean Sea, 
DEU.34.3	as well as the southern desert and the whole Valley of Jericho up to Zoar. (Jericho is called the city of palm trees.) 
DEU.34.4	Then the L
DEU.34.5	Then Moses, the servant of the L
DEU.34.6	He buried Moses in Moab in the valley opposite Beth Peor, but even today no one knows where his grave is. 
DEU.34.7	Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died. His eyes were not weak, and he was still strong. 
DEU.34.8	The Israelites cried for Moses for thirty days, staying in the plains of Moab until the time of sadness was over.
DEU.34.9	Joshua son of Nun was then filled with wisdom, because Moses had put his hands on him. So the Israelites listened to Joshua, and they did what the L
DEU.34.10	There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses. The L
DEU.34.11	and sent him to do signs and miracles in Egypt—to the king, to all his officers, and to the whole land of Egypt. 
DEU.34.12	Moses had great power, and he did great and wonderful things for all the Israelites to see. 
JOS.1.1	After Moses, the servant of the L
JOS.1.2	The L
JOS.1.3	I promised Moses I would give you this land, so I will give you every place you go in the land. 
JOS.1.4	All the land from the desert in the south to Lebanon in the north will be yours. All the land from the great river, the Euphrates, in the east, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west will be yours, too, including the land of the Hittites. 
JOS.1.5	No one will be able to defeat you all your life. Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you. I will not leave you or forget you.
JOS.1.6	“Joshua, be strong and brave! You must lead these people so they can take the land that I promised their fathers I would give them. 
JOS.1.7	Be strong and brave. Be sure to obey all the teachings my servant Moses gave you. If you follow them exactly, you will be successful in everything you do. 
JOS.1.8	Always remember what is written in the Book of the Teachings. Study it day and night to be sure to obey everything that is written there. If you do this, you will be wise and successful in everything. 
JOS.1.9	Remember that I commanded you to be strong and brave. Don’t be afraid, because the L

JOS.1.11	“Go through the camp and tell the people, ‘Get your supplies ready. Three days from now you will cross the Jordan River and take the land the L
JOS.1.12	Then Joshua said to the people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh, 
JOS.1.13	“Remember what Moses, the servant of the L

JOS.1.16	Then the people answered Joshua, “Anything you command us to do, we will do. Any place you send us, we will go. 
JOS.1.17	Just as we fully obeyed Moses, we will obey you. We ask only that the L
JOS.1.18	Whoever refuses to obey your commands or turns against you will be put to death. Just be strong and brave!”
JOS.2.1	Joshua son of Nun secretly sent out two spies from Acacia and said to them, “Go and look at the land, particularly at the city of Jericho.”
JOS.2.1	So the men went to Jericho and stayed at the house of a prostitute named Rahab.
JOS.2.2	Someone told the king of Jericho, “Some men from Israel have come here tonight to spy out the land.”
JOS.2.3	So the king of Jericho sent this message to Rahab: “Bring out the men who came to you and entered your house. They have come to spy out our whole land.”
JOS.2.4	But the woman had hidden the two men. She said, “They did come here, but I didn’t know where they came from. 
JOS.2.5	In the evening, when it was time to close the city gate, they left. I don’t know where they went, but if you go quickly, maybe you can catch them.” 
JOS.2.6	(The woman had taken the men up to the roof and had hidden them there under stalks of flax that she had spread out.) 
JOS.2.7	So the king’s men went out looking for the spies on the road that leads to the crossings of the Jordan River. The city gate was closed just after the king’s men left the city.
JOS.2.8	Before the spies went to sleep for the night, Rahab went up to the roof. 
JOS.2.9	She said to them, “I know the L
JOS.2.10	because we have heard how the L
JOS.2.11	When we heard this, we were very frightened. Now our men are afraid to fight you because the L
JOS.2.12	So now, promise me before the L
JOS.2.13	Allow my father, mother, brothers, sisters, and all of their families to live. Save us from death.”
JOS.2.14	The men agreed and said, “It will be our lives for your lives if you don’t tell anyone what we are doing. When the L
JOS.2.15	The house Rahab lived in was built on the city wall, so she used a rope to let the men down through a window. 
JOS.2.16	She said to them, “Go into the hills so the king’s men will not find you. Hide there for three days. After the king’s men return, you may go on your way.”
JOS.2.17	The men said to her, “You must do as we say. If not, we cannot be responsible for keeping this oath you have made us swear. 
JOS.2.18	When we return to this land, you must tie this red rope in the window through which you let us down. Bring your father, mother, brothers, and all your family into your house. 
JOS.2.19	If anyone leaves your house and is killed, it is his own fault. We cannot be responsible for him. If anyone in your house is hurt, we will be responsible. 
JOS.2.20	But if you tell anyone about this, we will be free from the oath you made us swear.”
JOS.2.21	Rahab answered, “I agree to this.” So she sent them away, and they left. Then she tied the red rope in the window.
JOS.2.22	The men left and went into the hills where they stayed for three days. The king’s men looked for them all along the road, but after three days, they returned to the city without finding them. 
JOS.2.23	Then the two men started back. They left the hills and crossed the river and came to Joshua son of Nun and told him everything that had happened to them. 
JOS.2.24	They said, “The L
JOS.3.1	Early the next morning Joshua and all the Israelites left Acacia. They traveled to the Jordan River and camped there before crossing it. 
JOS.3.2	After three days the officers went through the camp 
JOS.3.3	and gave orders to the people: “When you see the priests and Levites carrying the Ark of the Agreement with the L
JOS.3.4	That way you will know which way to go since you have never been here before. But do not follow too closely. Stay about a thousand yards behind the Ark.”
JOS.3.5	Then Joshua told the people, “Make yourselves holy, because tomorrow the L
JOS.3.6	Joshua said to the priests, “Take the Ark of the Agreement and go ahead of the people.” So the priests lifted the Ark and carried it ahead of the people.
JOS.3.7	Then the L
JOS.3.8	Tell the priests who carry the Ark of the Agreement to go to the edge of the Jordan River and stand in the water.”
JOS.3.9	Then Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here and listen to the words of the L
JOS.3.10	Here is proof that the living God is with you and that he will force out the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites. 
JOS.3.11	The Ark of the Agreement with the Lord of the whole world will go ahead of you into the Jordan River. 
JOS.3.12	Now choose twelve men from among you, one from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
JOS.3.13	The priests will carry the Ark of the L
JOS.3.14	So the people left the place where they had camped, and they followed the priests who carried the Ark of the Agreement across the Jordan River. 
JOS.3.15	During harvest the Jordan overflows its banks. When the priests carrying the Ark came to the edge of the river and stepped into the water, 
JOS.3.16	the water upstream stopped flowing. It stood up in a heap a great distance away at Adam, a town near Zarethan. The water flowing down to the Sea of Arabah (the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed the river near Jericho. 
JOS.3.17	The priests carried the Ark of the Agreement with the L
JOS.4.1	After all the people had finished crossing the Jordan, the L
JOS.4.2	“Choose twelve men from among the people, one from each tribe. 
JOS.4.3	Tell them to get twelve rocks from the middle of the river, from where the priests stood. Carry the rocks and put them down where you stay tonight.”
JOS.4.4	So Joshua chose one man from each tribe. Then he called the twelve men together 
JOS.4.5	and said to them, “Go out into the river where the Ark of the L
JOS.4.6	They will be a sign among you. In the future your children will ask you, ‘What do these rocks mean?’ 
JOS.4.7	Tell them the water stopped flowing in the Jordan when the Ark of the Agreement with the L
JOS.4.8	So the Israelites obeyed Joshua and carried twelve rocks from the middle of the Jordan River, one rock for each of the twelve tribes of Israel, just as the L
JOS.4.9	Joshua also put twelve rocks in the middle of the Jordan River where the priests had stood while carrying the Ark of the Agreement. These rocks are still there today.
JOS.4.10	The priests carrying the Ark continued standing in the middle of the river until everything was done that the L
JOS.4.11	After they finished crossing the river, the priests carried the Ark of the L
JOS.4.12	The men from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh obeyed what Moses had told them. They were dressed for war, and they crossed the river ahead of the other people. 
JOS.4.13	About forty thousand soldiers prepared for war passed before the L
JOS.4.14	That day the L
JOS.4.15	Then the L
JOS.4.16	“Command the priests to bring the Ark of the Agreement out of the river.”
JOS.4.17	So Joshua commanded the priests, “Come up out of the Jordan.”
JOS.4.18	Then the priests carried the Ark of the Agreement with the L
JOS.4.19	The people crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal, east of Jericho. 
JOS.4.20	They carried with them the twelve rocks taken from the Jordan, and Joshua set them up at Gilgal. 
JOS.4.21	Then he spoke to the Israelites: “In the future your children will ask you, ‘What do these rocks mean?’ 
JOS.4.22	Tell them, ‘Israel crossed the Jordan River on dry land. 
JOS.4.23	The L
JOS.4.24	The L
JOS.5.1	All the kings of the Amorites west of the Jordan and the Canaanite kings living by the Mediterranean Sea heard that the L
JOS.5.2	At that time the L
JOS.5.3	So Joshua made knives from flint stones and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath Haaraloth.
JOS.5.4	This is why Joshua circumcised the men: After the Israelites left Egypt, all the men old enough to serve in the army died in the desert on the way out of Egypt. 
JOS.5.5	The men who had come out of Egypt had been circumcised, but none of those who were born in the desert on the trip from Egypt had been circumcised. 
JOS.5.6	The Israelites had moved about in the desert for forty years. During that time all the fighting men who had left Egypt had died because they had not obeyed the L
JOS.5.7	Their sons took their places. But none of the sons born on the trip from Egypt had been circumcised, so Joshua circumcised them. 
JOS.5.8	After all the Israelites had been circumcised, they stayed in camp until they were healed.
JOS.5.9	Then the L
JOS.5.10	The people of Israel were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho. It was there, on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month, they celebrated the Passover Feast. 
JOS.5.11	The day after the Passover, the people ate food grown on that land: bread made without yeast and roasted grain. 
JOS.5.12	The day they ate this food, the manna stopped coming. The Israelites no longer got the manna from heaven. They ate the food grown in the land of Canaan that year.
JOS.5.13	Joshua was near Jericho when he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a sword in his hand. Joshua went to him and asked, “Are you a friend or an enemy?”
JOS.5.14	The man answered, “I am neither. I have come as the commander of the L
JOS.5.14	Then Joshua bowed facedown on the ground and asked, “Does my master have a command for me, his servant?”
JOS.5.15	The commander of the L
JOS.6.1	The people of Jericho were afraid because the Israelites were near. They closed the city gates and guarded them. No one went into the city, and no one came out.
JOS.6.2	Then the L
JOS.6.3	March around the city with your army once a day for six days. 
JOS.6.4	Have seven priests carry trumpets made from horns of male sheep and have them march in front of the Ark. On the seventh day march around the city seven times and have the priests blow the trumpets as they march. 
JOS.6.5	They will make one long blast on the trumpets. When you hear that sound, have all the people give a loud shout. Then the walls of the city will fall so the people can go straight into the city.”
JOS.6.6	So Joshua son of Nun called the priests together and said to them, “Carry the Ark of the Agreement. Tell seven priests to carry trumpets and march in front of it.” 
JOS.6.7	Then Joshua ordered the people, “Now go! March around the city. The soldiers with weapons should march in front of the Ark of the Agreement with the L
JOS.6.8	When Joshua finished speaking to the people, the seven priests began marching before the L
JOS.6.9	Soldiers with weapons marched in front of the priests, and armed men walked behind the Ark. The priests were blowing their trumpets. 
JOS.6.10	But Joshua had told the people not to give a war cry. He said, “Don’t shout. Don’t say a word until the day I tell you. Then shout.” 
JOS.6.11	So Joshua had the Ark of the L
JOS.6.12	Early the next morning Joshua got up, and the priests carried the Ark of the L
JOS.6.13	The seven priests carried the seven trumpets and marched in front of the Ark of the L
JOS.6.14	So on the second day they marched around the city one time and then went back to camp. They did this every day for six days.
JOS.6.15	On the seventh day they got up at dawn and marched around the city, just as they had on the days before. But on that day they marched around the city seven times. 
JOS.6.16	The seventh time around the priests blew their trumpets. Then Joshua gave the command: “Now, shout! The L
JOS.6.17	The city and everything in it are to be destroyed as an offering to the L
JOS.6.18	Don’t take any of the things that are to be destroyed as an offering to the L
JOS.6.19	All the silver and gold and things made from bronze and iron belong to the L
JOS.6.20	When the priests blew the trumpets, the people shouted. At the sound of the trumpets and the people’s shout, the walls fell, and everyone ran straight into the city. So the Israelites defeated that city. 
JOS.6.21	They completely destroyed with the sword every living thing in the city—men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, and donkeys.
JOS.6.22	Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house. Bring her out and bring out those who are with her, because of the promise you made to her.” 
JOS.6.23	So the two men went into the house and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, and all those with her. They put all of her family in a safe place outside the camp of Israel.
JOS.6.24	Then Israel burned the whole city and everything in it, but they did not burn the things made from silver, gold, bronze, and iron. These were saved for the L
JOS.6.25	Joshua saved Rahab the prostitute, her family, and all who were with her, because Rahab had helped the men he had sent to spy out Jericho. Rahab still lives among the Israelites today.
JOS.6.26	Then Joshua made this oath:
JOS.6.26	“Anyone who tries to rebuild this city of Jericho
JOS.6.26	will be cursed by the L
JOS.6.26	The one who lays the foundation of this city
JOS.6.26	will lose his oldest son,
JOS.6.26	and the one who sets up the gates
JOS.6.26	will lose his youngest son.”
JOS.6.27	So the L
JOS.7.1	But the Israelites did not obey the L
JOS.7.2	Joshua sent some men from Jericho to Ai, which was near Beth Aven, east of Bethel. He told them, “Go to Ai and spy out the area.” So the men went to spy on Ai.
JOS.7.3	Later they came back to Joshua and said, “There are only a few people in Ai, so we will not need all our people to defeat them. Send only two or three thousand men to fight. There is no need to send all of our people.” 
JOS.7.4	So about three thousand men went up to Ai, but the people of Ai beat them badly. 
JOS.7.5	The people of Ai killed about thirty-six Israelites and then chased the rest from the city gate all the way down to the canyon, killing them as they went down the hill. When the Israelites saw this, they lost their courage.
JOS.7.6	Then Joshua tore his clothes in sorrow. He bowed facedown on the ground before the Ark of the L
JOS.7.7	Then Joshua said, “Lord G
JOS.7.8	Lord, there is nothing I can say now. Israel has been beaten by the enemy. 
JOS.7.9	The Canaanites and all the other people in this country will hear about this and will surround and kill us all! Then what will you do for your own great name?”
JOS.7.10	The L
JOS.7.11	The Israelites have sinned; they have broken the agreement I commanded them to obey. They took some of the things I commanded them to destroy. They have stolen and lied and have taken those things for themselves. 
JOS.7.12	That is why the Israelites cannot face their enemies. They turn away from the fight and run, because I have commanded that they be destroyed. I will not help you anymore unless you destroy everything as I commanded you.
JOS.7.13	“Now go! Make the people holy. Tell them, ‘Set yourselves apart to the L
JOS.7.14	“ ‘Tomorrow morning you must be present with your tribes. The L
JOS.7.15	The one who is keeping what should have been destroyed will himself be destroyed by fire. Everything he owns will be destroyed with him. He has broken the agreement with the L
JOS.7.16	Early the next morning Joshua led all of Israel to present themselves in their tribes, and the L
JOS.7.17	So the family groups of Judah presented themselves, and the L
JOS.7.18	And Joshua told all the men in that family to present themselves. The L
JOS.7.19	Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, tell the truth. Confess to the L
JOS.7.20	Achan answered, “It is true! I have sinned against the L
JOS.7.21	Among the things I saw was a beautiful coat from Babylonia and about five pounds of silver and more than one and one-fourth pounds of gold. I wanted these things very much for myself, so I took them. You will find them buried in the ground under my tent, with the silver underneath.”
JOS.7.22	So Joshua sent men who ran to the tent and found the things hidden there, with the silver. 
JOS.7.23	The men brought them out of the tent, took them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and spread them out on the ground before the L
JOS.7.24	Then Joshua and all the people led Achan son of Zerah to the Valley of Trouble. They also took the silver, the coat, the gold, Achan’s sons, daughters, cattle, donkeys, sheep, tent, and everything he owned. 
JOS.7.25	Joshua said, “I don’t know why you caused so much trouble for us, but now the L
JOS.7.26	They piled rocks over Achan’s body, and they are still there today. That is why it is called the Valley of Trouble. After this the L
JOS.8.1	Then the L
JOS.8.2	You will do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho and its king. Only this time you may take all the wealth and keep it for yourselves. Now tell some of your soldiers to set up an ambush behind the city.”
JOS.8.3	So Joshua led his whole army toward Ai. Then he chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night. 
JOS.8.4	Joshua gave them these orders: “Listen carefully. You must set up an ambush behind the city. Don’t go far from it, but continue to watch and be ready. 
JOS.8.5	I and the men who are with me will march toward the city, and the men in the city will come out to fight us, just as they did before. Then we will turn and run away from them. 
JOS.8.6	They will chase us away from the city, thinking we are running away from them as we did before. When we run away, 
JOS.8.7	come out from your ambush and take the city. The L
JOS.8.8	After you take the city, burn it. See to it! You have your orders.”
JOS.8.9	Then Joshua sent them to wait in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. But Joshua stayed the night with his people.
JOS.8.10	Early the next morning Joshua gathered his men together. He and the older leaders of Israel led them up to Ai. 
JOS.8.11	All of the soldiers who were with Joshua marched up to Ai and stopped in front of the city and made camp north of it. There was a valley between them and the city. 
JOS.8.12	Then Joshua chose about five thousand men and set them in ambush in the area west of the city between Bethel and Ai. 
JOS.8.13	So the people took their positions; the main camp was north of the city, and the other men were hiding to the west. That night Joshua went down into the valley.
JOS.8.14	Now when the king of Ai saw the army of Israel, he and his people got up early the next morning and hurried out to fight them. They went out to a place east of the city, but the king did not know soldiers were waiting in ambush behind the city. 
JOS.8.15	Joshua and all the men of Israel let the army of Ai push them back. Then they ran toward the desert. 
JOS.8.16	The men in Ai were called to chase Joshua and his men, so they left the city and went after them. 
JOS.8.17	All the men of Ai and Bethel chased the army of Israel. The city was left open; not a man stayed to protect it.
JOS.8.18	Then the L
JOS.8.19	When the Israelites who were in ambush saw this, they quickly came out of their hiding place and hurried toward the city. They entered the city, took control of it, and quickly set it on fire.
JOS.8.20	When the men of Ai looked back, they saw smoke rising from their city. At the same time the Israelites stopped running and turned against the men of Ai, who could not escape in any direction. 
JOS.8.21	When Joshua and all his men saw that the army had taken control of the city and saw the smoke rising from it, they stopped running and turned to fight the men of Ai. 
JOS.8.22	The men who were in ambush also came out of the city to help with the fight. So the men of Ai were caught between the armies of Israel. None of the enemy escaped. The Israelites fought until not one of the men of Ai was left alive, except 
JOS.8.23	the king of Ai, and they brought him to Joshua.
JOS.8.24	During the fighting the army of Israel chased the men of Ai into the fields and desert and killed all of them. Then they went back to Ai and killed everyone there. 
JOS.8.25	All the people of Ai died that day, twelve thousand men and women. 
JOS.8.26	Joshua had held his spear toward Ai, as a sign to destroy the city, and did not draw it back until all the people of Ai were destroyed. 
JOS.8.27	The people of Israel kept for themselves the animals and the other things the people of Ai had owned, as the L
JOS.8.28	Then Joshua burned the city of Ai and made it a pile of ruins. And it is still like that today. 
JOS.8.29	Joshua hanged the king of Ai on a tree and left him there until evening. At sunset Joshua told his men to take the king’s body down from the tree and to throw it down at the city gate. Then they covered it with a pile of rocks, which is still there today.
JOS.8.30	Joshua built an altar for the L
JOS.8.31	Moses, the L
JOS.8.32	There Joshua wrote the teachings of Moses on stones for all the people of Israel to see. 
JOS.8.33	The elders, officers, judges, and all the Israelites were there; Israelites and non-Israelites were all standing around the Ark of the Agreement with the L
JOS.8.34	Then Joshua read all the words of the teachings, the blessings and the curses, exactly as they were written in the Book of the Teachings. 
JOS.8.35	All the Israelites were gathered together—men, women, and children—along with the non-Israelites who lived among them. Joshua read every command that Moses had given.
JOS.9.1	All the kings west of the Jordan River heard about these things: the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. They lived in the mountains and on the western hills and along the whole Mediterranean Sea coast. 
JOS.9.2	So all these kings gathered to fight Joshua and the Israelites.
JOS.9.3	When the people of Gibeon heard how Joshua had defeated Jericho and Ai, 
JOS.9.4	they decided to trick the Israelites. They gathered old sacks and old leather wine bags that were cracked and mended, and they put them on the backs of their donkeys. 
JOS.9.5	They put old sandals on their feet and wore old clothes, and they took some dry, moldy bread. 
JOS.9.6	Then they went to Joshua in the camp near Gilgal.
JOS.9.6	The men said to Joshua and the Israelites, “We have traveled from a faraway country. Make a peace agreement with us.”
JOS.9.7	The Israelites said to these Hivites, “Maybe you live near us. How can we make a peace agreement with you?”
JOS.9.8	The Hivites said to Joshua, “We are your servants.”
JOS.9.8	But Joshua asked, “Who are you? Where do you come from?”
JOS.9.9	The men answered, “We are your servants who have come from a far country, because we heard of the fame of the L
JOS.9.10	We heard that he defeated the two kings of the Amorites from the east side of the Jordan River—Sihon king of Heshbon and Og king of Bashan who ruled in Ashtaroth. 
JOS.9.11	So our elders and our people said to us, ‘Take food for your journey and go and meet the Israelites. Tell them, “We are your servants. Make a peace agreement with us.” ’
JOS.9.12	“Look at our bread. On the day we left home to come to you it was warm and fresh, but now it is dry and moldy. 
JOS.9.13	Look at our leather wine bags. They were new and filled with wine, but now they are cracked and old. Our clothes and sandals are worn out from the long journey.”
JOS.9.14	The men of Israel tasted the bread, but they did not ask the L
JOS.9.15	So Joshua agreed to make peace with the Gibeonites and to let them live. And the leaders of the Israelites swore an oath to keep the agreement.
JOS.9.16	Three days after they had made the agreement, the Israelites learned that the Gibeonites lived nearby. 
JOS.9.17	So the Israelites went to where they lived and on the third day came to their cities: Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim. 
JOS.9.18	But the Israelites did not attack those cities, because they had made a promise to them before the L
JOS.9.18	All the Israelites grumbled against the leaders. 
JOS.9.19	But the leaders answered, “We have given our promise before the L
JOS.9.20	This is what we must do. We must let them live. Otherwise, God’s anger will be against us for breaking the oath we swore to them. 
JOS.9.21	So let them live, but they will cut wood and carry water for our people.” So the leaders kept their promise to them.
JOS.9.22	Joshua called for the Gibeonites and asked, “Why did you lie to us? Your land was near our camp, but you told us you were from a far country. 
JOS.9.23	Now, you will be placed under a curse to be our slaves. You will have to cut wood and carry water for the house of my God.”
JOS.9.24	The Gibeonites answered Joshua, “We lied to you because we were afraid you would kill us. We heard that the L
JOS.9.25	Now you can decide what to do with us, whatever you think is right.”
JOS.9.26	So Joshua saved their lives by not allowing the Israelites to kill them, 
JOS.9.27	but he made the Gibeonites slaves. They cut wood and carried water for the Israelites, and they did it for the altar of the L
JOS.10.1	At this time Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had defeated Ai and completely destroyed it, as he had also done to Jericho and its king. The king also learned that the Gibeonites had made a peace agreement with Israel and that they lived nearby. 
JOS.10.2	Adoni-Zedek and his people were very afraid because of this. Gibeon was not a little town like Ai; it was a large city, as big as a city that had a king, and all its men were good fighters. 
JOS.10.3	So Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent a message to Hoham king of Hebron, Piram king of Jarmuth, Japhia king of Lachish, and Debir king of Eglon. He begged them, 
JOS.10.4	“Come with me and help me attack Gibeon, which has made a peace agreement with Joshua and the Israelites.”
JOS.10.5	Then these five Amorite kings—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon—gathered their armies, went to Gibeon, surrounded it, and attacked it.
JOS.10.6	The Gibeonites sent this message to Joshua in his camp at Gilgal: “Don’t let us, your servants, be destroyed. Come quickly and help us! Save us! All the Amorite kings from the mountains have joined their armies and are fighting against us.”
JOS.10.7	So Joshua marched out of Gilgal with his whole army, including his best fighting men. 
JOS.10.8	The L
JOS.10.9	Joshua and his army marched all night from Gilgal for a surprise attack. 
JOS.10.10	The L
JOS.10.11	As they chased the enemy down the Beth Horon Pass to Azekah, the L
JOS.10.12	On the day that the L
JOS.10.12	“Sun, stand still over Gibeon.
JOS.10.12	Moon, stand still over the Valley of Aijalon.”
JOS.10.13	So the sun stood still,
JOS.10.13	and the moon stopped
JOS.10.13	until the people defeated their enemies.
JOS.10.13	These words are written in the Book of Jashar.
JOS.10.13	The sun stopped in the middle of the sky and waited to go down for a full day. 
JOS.10.14	That has never happened at any time before that day or since. That was the day the L
JOS.10.15	After this, Joshua and his army went back to the camp at Gilgal.
JOS.10.16	During the fight the five kings ran away and hid in a cave near Makkedah, 
JOS.10.17	but someone found them hiding in the cave at Makkedah and told Joshua. 
JOS.10.18	So he said, “Cover the opening of the cave with large rocks. Put some men there to guard it, 
JOS.10.19	but don’t stay there yourselves. Continue chasing the enemy and attacking them from behind. Don’t let them get to their cities, because the L
JOS.10.20	So Joshua and the Israelites killed the enemy, but a few were able to get back to their strong, walled cities. 
JOS.10.21	After the fighting, Joshua’s men came back safely to him at Makkedah. No one was brave enough to say a word against the Israelites.
JOS.10.22	Joshua said, “Move the rocks that are covering the opening of the cave and bring those five kings out to me.” 
JOS.10.23	So Joshua’s men brought the five kings out of the cave—the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon. 
JOS.10.24	When they brought the five kings out to Joshua, he called for all his men. He said to the commanders of his army, “Come here! Put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came close and put their feet on their necks.
JOS.10.25	Joshua said to his men, “Be strong and brave! Don’t be afraid, because I will show you what the L
JOS.10.26	Then Joshua killed the five kings and hung their bodies on five trees, where he left them until evening.
JOS.10.27	At sunset Joshua told his men to take the bodies down from the trees. Then they threw them into the same cave where they had been hiding and covered the opening of the cave with large rocks, which are still there today.
JOS.10.28	That day Joshua defeated Makkedah. He killed the king and completely destroyed all the people in that city as an offering to the L
JOS.10.29	Joshua and all the Israelites traveled from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it. 
JOS.10.30	The L
JOS.10.31	Then Joshua and all the Israelites left Libnah and went to Lachish, which they surrounded and attacked. 
JOS.10.32	The L
JOS.10.33	During this same time Horam king of Gezer came to help Lachish, but Joshua also defeated him and his army; no one was left alive.
JOS.10.34	Then Joshua and all the Israelites went from Lachish to Eglon. They surrounded Eglon, attacked it, and 
JOS.10.35	captured it the same day. They killed all its people and completely destroyed everything in it as an offering to the L
JOS.10.36	Then Joshua and the Israelites went from Eglon to Hebron and attacked it, 
JOS.10.37	capturing it and all the little towns near it. The Israelites killed everyone in Hebron; no one was left alive there. Just as they had done to Eglon, they completely destroyed the city and all its people as an offering to the L
JOS.10.38	Then Joshua and the Israelites went back to Debir and attacked it. 
JOS.10.39	They captured that city, its king, and all the little towns near it, completely destroying everyone in Debir as an offering to the L
JOS.10.40	So Joshua defeated all the kings of the cities of these areas: the mountains, southern Canaan, the western hills, and the slopes. The L
JOS.10.41	Joshua captured all the cities from Kadesh Barnea to Gaza, and from Goshen to Gibeon. 
JOS.10.42	He captured all these cities and their kings on one trip, because the L
JOS.10.43	Then Joshua and all the Israelites returned to their camp at Gilgal.
JOS.11.1	When Jabin king of Hazor heard about all that had happened, he sent messages to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Acshaph. 
JOS.11.2	He sent messages to the kings in the northern mountains and also to the kings in the Jordan Valley south of Lake Galilee and in the western hills. He sent a message to the king of Naphoth Dor in the west 
JOS.11.3	and to the kings of the Canaanites in the east and in the west. He sent messages to the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, and Jebusites in the mountains. Jabin also sent one to the Hivites, who lived below Mount Hermon in the area of Mizpah. 
JOS.11.4	So the armies of all these kings came together with their horses and chariots. There were as many soldiers as grains of sand on the seashore.
JOS.11.5	All of these kings met together at the waters of Merom, joined their armies together into one camp, and made plans to fight against the Israelites.
JOS.11.6	Then the L
JOS.11.7	So Joshua and his whole army surprised the enemy by attacking them at the waters of Merom. 
JOS.11.8	The L
JOS.11.9	Joshua did what the L
JOS.11.10	Then Joshua went back and captured the city of Hazor and killed its king. (Hazor had been the leader of all the kingdoms that fought against Israel.) 
JOS.11.11	Israel killed everyone in Hazor, completely destroying them; no one was left alive. Then they burned Hazor itself.
JOS.11.12	Joshua captured all of these cities, killed all of their kings, and completely destroyed everything in these cities. He did this just as Moses, the servant of the L
JOS.11.13	But the Israelites did not burn any cities that were built on their mounds, except Hazor; only that city was burned by Joshua. 
JOS.11.14	The people of Israel kept for themselves everything they found in the cities, including all the animals. But they killed all the people there; they left no one alive. 
JOS.11.15	Long ago the L
JOS.11.16	So Joshua defeated all the people in the land. He had control of the mountains and the area of southern Canaan, all the areas of Goshen, the western hills, and the Jordan Valley. He controlled the mountains of Israel and all the hills near them. 
JOS.11.17	Joshua controlled all the land from Mount Halak near Edom to Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon, below Mount Hermon. Joshua also captured all the kings in the land and killed them. 
JOS.11.18	He fought against them for many years. 
JOS.11.19	The people of only one city in all the land had made a peace agreement with Israel—the Hivites living in Gibeon. All the other cities were defeated in war. 
JOS.11.20	The L
JOS.11.21	Now Joshua fought the Anakites who lived in the mountains of Hebron, Debir, Anab, Judah, and Israel, and he completely destroyed them and their towns. 
JOS.11.22	There were no Anakites left living in the land of the Israelites and only a few were left in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. 
JOS.11.23	Joshua took control of all the land of Israel as the L
JOS.12.1	The Israelites took control of the land east of the Jordan River from the Arnon Ravine to Mount Hermon and all the land along the eastern side of the Jordan Valley. These lands belonged to the kings whom the Israelites defeated.
JOS.12.2	Sihon king of the Amorites lived in the city of Heshbon and ruled the land from Aroer at the Arnon Ravine to the Jabbok River. His land started in the middle of the ravine, which was their border with the Ammonites. Sihon ruled over half the land of Gilead 
JOS.12.3	and over the eastern side of the Jordan Valley from Lake Galilee to the Dead Sea. And he ruled from Beth Jeshimoth south to the slopes of Pisgah.
JOS.12.4	Og king of Bashan was one of the last of the Rephaites. He ruled the land in Ashtaroth and Edrei. 
JOS.12.5	He ruled over Mount Hermon, Salecah, and all the area of Bashan up to where the people of Geshur and Maacah lived. Og also ruled half the land of Gilead up to the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.
JOS.12.6	The L
JOS.12.7	Joshua and the Israelites also defeated kings in the land west of the Jordan River. He gave the people the land and divided it among the twelve tribes to be their own. It was between Baal Gad in the Valley of Lebanon and Mount Halak near Edom. 
JOS.12.8	This included the mountains, the western hills, the Jordan Valley, the slopes, the desert, and southern Canaan. This was the land where the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites had lived. The Israelites defeated the king of each of the following cities: 
JOS.12.9	Jericho, Ai (near Bethel), 
JOS.12.10	Jerusalem, Hebron, 
JOS.12.11	Jarmuth, Lachish, 
JOS.12.12	Eglon, Gezer, 
JOS.12.13	Debir, Geder, 
JOS.12.14	Hormah, Arad, 
JOS.12.15	Libnah, Adullam, 
JOS.12.16	Makkedah, Bethel, 
JOS.12.17	Tappuah, Hepher, 
JOS.12.18	Aphek, Lasharon, 
JOS.12.19	Madon, Hazor, 
JOS.12.20	Shimron Meron, Acshaph, 
JOS.12.21	Taanach, Megiddo, 
JOS.12.22	Kedesh, Jokneam in Carmel, 
JOS.12.23	Dor (in Naphoth Dor), Goyim in Gilgal, and 
JOS.12.24	Tirzah.
JOS.12.24	The total number of kings was thirty-one.
JOS.13.1	When Joshua was very old, the L
JOS.13.2	This is what is left: the regions of Geshur and of the Philistines; 
JOS.13.3	the area from the Shihor River at the border of Egypt to Ekron in the north, which belongs to the Canaanites; the five Philistine leaders at Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron; the Avvites, 
JOS.13.4	who live south of the Canaanite land; 
JOS.13.5	the Gebalites, and the area of Lebanon east of Baal Gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo Hamath.
JOS.13.6	“The Sidonians are living in the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth Maim, but I will force all of them out ahead of the Israelites. Be sure to remember this land when you divide the land among the Israelites, as I told you.
JOS.13.7	“Now divide the land among the nine tribes and West Manasseh.”
JOS.13.8	East Manasseh and the tribes of Reuben and Gad had received their land. The L
JOS.13.9	Their land started at Aroer at the Arnon Ravine and continued to the town in the middle of the ravine, and it included the whole plain from Medeba to Dibon. 
JOS.13.10	All the towns ruled by Sihon king of the Amorites, who ruled in the city of Heshbon, were in that land. The land continued to the area where the Ammonites lived. 
JOS.13.11	Gilead was also there, as well as the area where the people of Geshur and Maacah lived, and all of Mount Hermon and Bashan as far as Salecah. 
JOS.13.12	All the kingdom of Og king of Bashan was in the land. Og was one of the last of the Rephaites, and in the past he ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei. Moses had defeated them and had taken their land. 
JOS.13.13	Because the Israelites did not force out the people of Geshur and Maacah, they still live among the Israelites today.
JOS.13.14	The tribe of Levi was the only one that did not get any land. Instead, they were given all the burned sacrifices made to the L
JOS.13.15	Moses had given each family group from the tribe of Reuben some land: 
JOS.13.16	Theirs was the land from Aroer near the Arnon Ravine to the town of Medeba, including the whole plain and the town in the middle of the ravine; 
JOS.13.17	Heshbon and all the towns on the plain: Dibon, Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon, 
JOS.13.18	Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
JOS.13.19	Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley, 
JOS.13.20	Beth Peor, the hills of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth. 
JOS.13.21	So that land included all the towns on the plain and all the area that Sihon king of the Amorites had ruled from the town of Heshbon. Moses had defeated him along with the leaders of the Midianites, including Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. All these leaders fought together with Sihon and lived in that country. 
JOS.13.22	The Israelites killed many people during the fighting, including Balaam of Beor, who tried to use magic to tell the future. 
JOS.13.23	The land given to Reuben stopped at the shore of the Jordan River. So the land given to the family groups of Reuben included all these towns and their villages that were listed.
JOS.13.24	This is the land Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to all its family groups: 
JOS.13.25	the land of Jazer and all the towns of Gilead; half the land of the Ammonites that went as far as Aroer near Rabbah; 
JOS.13.26	the area from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpah and Betonim; the area from Mahanaim to the land of Debir; 
JOS.13.27	in the valley, Beth Haram, Beth Nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the other land Sihon king of Heshbon had ruled east of the Jordan River and continuing to the end of Lake Galilee. 
JOS.13.28	All this land went to the family groups of Gad, including all these towns and their villages.
JOS.13.29	This is the land Moses had given to East Manasseh. Half of all the family groups in the tribe of Manasseh were given this land: 
JOS.13.30	The land started at Mahanaim and included all of Bashan and the land ruled by Og king of Bashan; all the towns of Jair in Bashan, sixty cities in all; 
JOS.13.31	half of Gilead, Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities where Og king of Bashan had ruled. All this went to the family of Makir son of Manasseh, and half of all his sons were given this land.
JOS.13.32	Moses had given this land to these tribes on the plains of Moab across the Jordan River east of Jericho. 
JOS.13.33	But Moses had given no land to the tribe of Levi because the L
JOS.14.1	Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of all the tribes of Israel decided what land to give to the people in the land of Canaan. 
JOS.14.2	The L
JOS.14.3	Moses had already given the two-and-a-half tribes their land east of the Jordan River. But the tribe of Levi was not given any land like the others. 
JOS.14.4	The sons of Joseph had divided into two tribes—Manasseh and Ephraim. The tribe of Levi was not given any land. It was given only some towns in which to live and pastures for its animals. 
JOS.14.5	The L
JOS.14.6	One day some men from the tribe of Judah went to Joshua at Gilgal. Among them was Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite. He said to Joshua, “You remember what the L
JOS.14.7	Moses, the L
JOS.14.8	The other men who went with me frightened the people, but I fully believed the L
JOS.14.9	So that day Moses promised me, ‘The land where you went will become your land, and your children will own it forever. I will give you that land because you fully believed in the L
JOS.14.10	“Now then, the L
JOS.14.11	I am still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me out, and I am just as ready to fight now as I was then. 
JOS.14.12	So give me the mountain country the L
JOS.14.13	Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him the city of Hebron as his own. 
JOS.14.14	Hebron still belongs to the family of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite because he had faith and obeyed the L
JOS.14.15	(In the past it was called Kiriath Arba, named for Arba, the greatest man among the Anakites.)
JOS.14.15	After this there was peace in the land.
JOS.15.1	The land that was given to the tribe of Judah was divided among all the family groups. It went all the way to the Desert of Zin in the far south, at the border of Edom.
JOS.15.2	The southern border of Judah’s land started at the south end of the Dead Sea 
JOS.15.3	and went south of Scorpion Pass to Zin. From there it passed to the south of Kadesh Barnea and continued past Hezron to Addar. From Addar it turned and went to Karka. 
JOS.15.4	It continued to Azmon, the brook of Egypt, and then to the Mediterranean Sea. This was the southern border.
JOS.15.5	The eastern border was the shore of the Dead Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan River.
JOS.15.5	The northern border started at the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan River. 
JOS.15.6	Then it went to Beth Hoglah and continued north of Beth Arabah to the stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
JOS.15.7	Then the northern border went through the Valley of Achor to Debir where it turned toward the north and went to Gilgal. Gilgal is across from the road that goes through Adummim Pass, on the south side of the ravine. The border continued to the waters of En Shemesh and stopped at En Rogel. 
JOS.15.8	Then it went through the Valley of Ben Hinnom, next to the southern side of the Jebusite city (which is called Jerusalem). There the border went to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley, at the northern end of the Valley of Giants. 
JOS.15.9	From there it went to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and then it went to the cities near Mount Ephron. There it turned and went toward Baalah, which is called Kiriath Jearim. 
JOS.15.10	At Baalah the border turned west and went toward Mount Seir. It continued along the north side of Mount Jearim (also called Kesalon) and came to Beth Shemesh. From there it went past Timnah 
JOS.15.11	to the hill north of Ekron. Then it turned toward Shikkeron and went past Mount Baalah and continued on to Jabneel, ending at the sea.
JOS.15.12	The Mediterranean Sea was the western border. Inside these borders lived the family groups of Judah.
JOS.15.13	The L
JOS.15.14	Caleb forced out the three Anakite families living in Hebron: Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak. 
JOS.15.15	Then he left there and went to fight against the people living in Debir. (In the past Debir had been called Kiriath Sepher.) 
JOS.15.16	Caleb said, “I will give Acsah, my daughter, as a wife to the man who attacks and captures the city of Kiriath Sepher.” 
JOS.15.17	Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, captured the city, so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to Othniel to be his wife. 
JOS.15.18	When Acsah came to Othniel, she told him to ask her father for a field.
JOS.15.18	So Acsah went to her father. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?”
JOS.15.19	Acsah answered, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in southern Canaan, also give me springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JOS.15.20	The tribe of Judah got the land God had promised them. Each family group got part of the land.
JOS.15.21	The tribe of Judah got all these towns in the southern part of Canaan near the border of Edom: Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
JOS.15.22	Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
JOS.15.23	Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 
JOS.15.24	Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, 
JOS.15.25	Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (also called Hazor), 
JOS.15.26	Amam, Shema, Moladah, 
JOS.15.27	Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Beth Pelet, 
JOS.15.28	Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, 
JOS.15.29	Baalah, Iim, Ezem, 
JOS.15.30	Eltolad, Kesil, Hormah, 
JOS.15.31	Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 
JOS.15.32	Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon. There were twenty-nine towns and their villages.
JOS.15.33	The tribe of Judah got these towns in the western hills: Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 
JOS.15.34	Zanoah, En Gannim, Tappuah, Enam, 
JOS.15.35	Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, 
JOS.15.36	Shaaraim, Adithaim, and Gederah (also called Gederothaim). There were fourteen towns and their villages.
JOS.15.37	Judah was also given these towns in the western hills: Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal Gad, 
JOS.15.38	Dilean, Mizpah, Joktheel, 
JOS.15.39	Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, 
JOS.15.40	Cabbon, Lahmas, Kitlish, 
JOS.15.41	Gederoth, Beth Dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah. There were sixteen towns and their villages.
JOS.15.42	Judah was also given these towns in the western hills: Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
JOS.15.43	Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
JOS.15.44	Keilah, Aczib, and Mareshah. There were nine towns and their villages.
JOS.15.45	The tribe of Judah was also given these towns: Ekron and all the small towns and villages near it; 
JOS.15.46	the area west of Ekron and all the villages and small towns near Ashdod; 
JOS.15.47	Ashdod and the small towns and villages around it; the villages and small towns around Gaza as far as the brook of Egypt and along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
JOS.15.48	The tribe of Judah was also given these towns in the mountains: Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 
JOS.15.49	Dannah, Kiriath Sannah (also called Debir), 
JOS.15.50	Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, 
JOS.15.51	Goshen, Holon, and Giloh. There were eleven towns and their villages.
JOS.15.52	They were also given these towns in the mountains: Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 
JOS.15.53	Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah, 
JOS.15.54	Humtah, Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron), and Zior. There were nine towns and their villages.
JOS.15.55	Judah was also given these towns in the mountains: Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, 
JOS.15.56	Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
JOS.15.57	Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah. There were ten towns and their villages.
JOS.15.58	They were also given these towns in the mountains: Halhul, Beth Zur, Gedor, 
JOS.15.59	Maarath, Beth Anoth, and Eltekon. There were six towns and their villages.
JOS.15.60	The people of Judah were also given the two towns of Rabbah and Kiriath Baal (also called Kiriath Jearim) and their villages.
JOS.15.61	Judah was given these towns in the desert: Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
JOS.15.62	Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En Gedi. There were six towns and all their villages.
JOS.15.63	The army of Judah was not able to force out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites still live among the people of Judah to this day.
JOS.16.1	This is the land the tribe of Joseph received. It started at the Jordan River near Jericho and continued to the waters of Jericho, just east of the city. The border went up from Jericho to the mountains of Bethel. 
JOS.16.2	Then it continued from Bethel (also called Luz) to the Arkite border at Ataroth. 
JOS.16.3	From there it went west to the border of the Japhletites and continued to the area of the Lower Beth Horon. Then it went to Gezer and ended at the sea.
JOS.16.4	So Manasseh and Ephraim, sons of Joseph, received their land.
JOS.16.5	This is the land that was given to the family groups of Ephraim: Their border started at Ataroth Addar in the east, went to Upper Beth Horon, 
JOS.16.6	and then to the sea. From Micmethath it turned eastward toward Taanath Shiloh and continued eastward to Janoah. 
JOS.16.7	Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah. It continued until it touched Jericho and stopped at the Jordan River. 
JOS.16.8	The border went from Tappuah west to Kanah Ravine and ended at the sea. This is all the land that was given to each family group in the tribe of the Ephraimites. 
JOS.16.9	Many of the towns were actually within Manasseh’s borders, but the people of Ephraim got those towns and their villages. 
JOS.16.10	The Ephraimites could not force the Canaanites to leave Gezer, so the Canaanites still live among the Ephraimites today, but they became slaves of the Ephraimites.
JOS.17.1	Then land was given to the tribe of Manasseh, Joseph’s first son. Manasseh’s first son was Makir, the father of Gilead. Makir was a great soldier, so the lands of Gilead and Bashan were given to his family. 
JOS.17.2	Land was also given to the other family groups of Manasseh—Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were all the other sons of Manasseh son of Joseph.
JOS.17.3	Zelophehad was the son of Hepher, who was the son of Gilead, who was the son of Makir, who was the son of Manasseh. Zelophehad had no sons, but he had five daughters, named Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
JOS.17.4	They went to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua son of Nun and all the leaders. They said, “The L
JOS.17.5	So the tribe of Manasseh had ten sections of land west of the Jordan River and two more sections, Gilead and Bashan, on the east side of the Jordan River. 
JOS.17.6	The daughters of Manasseh received land just as the sons did. Gilead was given to the rest of the families of Manasseh.
JOS.17.7	The lands of Manasseh were in the area between Asher and Micmethath, near Shechem. The border went south to the En Tappuah area, 
JOS.17.8	which belonged to Manasseh, except for the town of Tappuah. It was along the border of Manasseh’s land and belonged to the sons of Ephraim. 
JOS.17.9	The border of Manasseh continued south to Kanah Ravine. The cities in this area of Manasseh belonged to Ephraim. Manasseh’s border was on the north side of the ravine and went to the sea. 
JOS.17.10	The land to the south belonged to Ephraim, and the land to the north belonged to Manasseh. The Mediterranean Sea was the western border. The border touched Asher’s land on the north and Issachar’s land on the east.
JOS.17.11	In the areas of Issachar and Asher, the people of Manasseh owned these towns: Beth Shan and its small towns; Ibleam and its small towns; the people who lived in Dor and its small towns; the people in Naphoth Dor and its small towns; the people who lived in Taanach and its small towns; the people in Megiddo and its small towns. 
JOS.17.12	Manasseh was not able to defeat those cities, so the Canaanites continued to live there. 
JOS.17.13	When the Israelites grew strong, they forced the Canaanites to work for them, although they did not force them to leave the land.
JOS.17.14	The people from the tribes of Joseph said to Joshua, “You gave us only one area of land, but we are many people. Why did you give us only one part of all the land the L
JOS.17.15	And Joshua answered them, “If you have too many people, go up to the forest and make a place for yourselves to live there in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaites. The mountain country of Ephraim is too small for you.”
JOS.17.16	The people of Joseph said, “It is true. The mountain country of Ephraim is not enough for us, but the land where the Canaanites live is dangerous. They are skilled fighters. They have powerful weapons in Beth Shan and all the small towns in that area, and they are also in the Valley of Jezreel.”
JOS.17.17	Then Joshua said to the people of Joseph—to Ephraim and Manasseh, “There are many of you, and you have great power. You should be given more than one share of land. 
JOS.17.18	You also will have the mountain country. It is a forest, but you can cut down the trees and make it a good place to live. You will own all of it because you will force the Canaanites to leave the land even though they have powerful weapons and are strong.”
JOS.18.1	All of the Israelites gathered together at Shiloh where they set up the Meeting Tent. The land was now under their control. 
JOS.18.2	But there were still seven tribes of Israel that had not yet received their land.
JOS.18.3	So Joshua said to the Israelites: “Why do you wait so long to take your land? The L
JOS.18.4	Choose three men from each tribe, and I will send them out to study the land. They will describe in writing the land their tribe wants as its share, and then they will come back to me. 
JOS.18.5	They will divide the land into seven parts. The people of Judah will keep their land in the south, and the people of Joseph will keep their land in the north. 
JOS.18.6	You should describe the seven parts of land in writing and bring what you have written to me. Then I will throw lots in the presence of the L
JOS.18.7	But the Levites do not get any part of these lands, because they are priests, and their work is to serve the L
JOS.18.8	So the men who were chosen to map the land started out. Joshua told them, “Go and study the land and describe it in writing. Then come back to me, and I will throw lots in the presence of the L
JOS.18.9	So the men left and went into the land. They described in a scroll each town in the seven parts of the land. Then they came back to Joshua, who was still at the camp at Shiloh. 
JOS.18.10	There Joshua threw lots in the presence of the L
JOS.18.11	The first part of the land was given to the tribe of Benjamin. Each family group received some land between the land of Judah and the land of Joseph. This is the land chosen for Benjamin: 
JOS.18.12	The northern border started at the Jordan River and went along the northern edge of Jericho, and then it went west into the mountains. That boundary continued until it was just east of Beth Aven. 
JOS.18.13	From there it went south to Luz (also called Bethel) and then down to Ataroth Addar, which is on the hill south of Lower Beth Horon.
JOS.18.14	At the hill to the south of Beth Horon, the border turned and went south near the western side of the hill. It went to Kiriath Baal (also called Kiriath Jearim), a town where people of Judah lived. This was the western border.
JOS.18.15	The southern border started near Kiriath Jearim and went west to the waters of Nephtoah. 
JOS.18.16	Then it went down to the bottom of the hill, which was near the Valley of Ben Hinnom, on the north side of the Valley of Rephaim. The border continued down the Hinnom Valley just south of the Jebusite city to En Rogel. 
JOS.18.17	There it turned north and went to En Shemesh. It continued to Geliloth near the Adummim Pass. Then it went down to the great Stone of Bohan son of Reuben. 
JOS.18.18	The border continued to the northern part of Beth Arabah and went down into the Jordan Valley. 
JOS.18.19	From there it went to the northern part of Beth Hoglah and ended at the north shore of the Dead Sea, where the Jordan River flows into the sea. This was the southern border.
JOS.18.20	The Jordan River was the border on the eastern side. So this was the land given to the family groups of Benjamin with the borders on all sides.
JOS.18.21	The family groups of Benjamin received these cities: Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, 
JOS.18.22	Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
JOS.18.23	Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
JOS.18.24	Kephar Ammoni, Ophni, and Geba. There were twelve towns and all their villages.
JOS.18.25	The tribe of Benjamin also received Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 
JOS.18.26	Mizpah, Kephirah, Mozah, 
JOS.18.27	Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
JOS.18.28	Zelah, Haeleph, the Jebusite city (Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath. There were fourteen towns and their villages. All these areas are the lands the family groups of Benjamin were given.
JOS.19.1	The second part of the land was given to the tribe of Simeon. Each family group received some of the land inside the area of Judah. 
JOS.19.2	They received Beersheba (also called Sheba), Moladah, 
JOS.19.3	Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem, 
JOS.19.4	Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
JOS.19.5	Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah, 
JOS.19.6	Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen. There were thirteen towns and their villages.
JOS.19.7	They received the towns of Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan, four towns and their villages. 
JOS.19.8	They also received all the very small areas with people living in them as far as Baalath Beer (this is the same as Ramah in southern Canaan). So these were the lands given to the family groups in the tribe of Simeon. 
JOS.19.9	The land of the Simeonites was taken from part of the land of Judah. Since Judah had much more land than they needed, the Simeonites received part of their land.
JOS.19.10	The third part of the land was given to the tribe of Zebulun. Each family group of Zebulun received some of the land. The border of Zebulun went as far as Sarid. 
JOS.19.11	Then it went west to Maralah and came near Dabbesheth and then near Jokneam. 
JOS.19.12	Then it turned to the east. It went from Sarid to the area of Kisloth Tabor and on to Daberath and to Japhia. 
JOS.19.13	It continued eastward to Gath Hepher and Eth Kazin, ending at Rimmon. There the border turned and went toward Neah. 
JOS.19.14	At Neah it turned again and went to the north to Hannathon and continued to the Valley of Iphtah El. 
JOS.19.15	Inside this border were the cities of Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem. There were twelve towns and their villages.
JOS.19.16	So these are the towns and the villages that were given to the family groups of Zebulun.
JOS.19.17	The fourth part of the land was given to the tribe of Issachar. Each family group of Issachar received some of the land. 
JOS.19.18	Their land included Jezreel, Kesulloth, Shunem, 
JOS.19.19	Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 
JOS.19.20	Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 
JOS.19.21	Remeth, En Gannim, En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez.
JOS.19.22	The border of their land touched the area called Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh and stopped at the Jordan River. There were sixteen towns and their villages.
JOS.19.23	These cities and towns were part of the land that was given to the family groups of Issachar.
JOS.19.24	The fifth part of the land was given to the tribe of Asher. Each family group of Asher received some of the land. 
JOS.19.25	Their land included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Acshaph, 
JOS.19.26	Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal.
JOS.19.26	The western border touched Mount Carmel and Shihor Libnath. 
JOS.19.27	Then it turned east and went to Beth Dagon, touching Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtah El. Then it went north of Beth Emek and Neiel and passed north to Cabul. 
JOS.19.28	From there it went to Abdon, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah and continued to Greater Sidon. 
JOS.19.29	Then the border went back south toward Ramah and continued to the strong, walled city of Tyre. There it turned and went toward Hosah, ending at the sea. This was in the area of Aczib, 
JOS.19.30	Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob. There were twenty-two towns and their villages.
JOS.19.31	These cities and their villages were part of the land that was given to the family groups of Asher.
JOS.19.32	The sixth part of the land was given to the tribe of Naphtali. Each family group of Naphtali received some of the land. 
JOS.19.33	The border of their land started at the large tree in Zaanannim, which is near Heleph. Then it went through Adami Nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan River. 
JOS.19.34	Then it went to the west through Aznoth Tabor and stopped at Hukkok. It went to the area of Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and Judah, at the Jordan River, on the east. 
JOS.19.35	The strong, walled cities inside these borders were called Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth, 
JOS.19.36	Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
JOS.19.37	Kedesh, Edrei, En Hazor, 
JOS.19.38	Iron, Migdal El, Horem, Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh. There were nineteen towns and all their villages.
JOS.19.39	The towns and the villages around them were in the land that was given to the family groups of Naphtali.
JOS.19.40	The seventh part of the land was given to the tribe of Dan. Each family group of Dan received some of the land. 
JOS.19.41	Their land included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir Shemesh, 
JOS.19.42	Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
JOS.19.43	Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
JOS.19.44	Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
JOS.19.45	Jehud, Bene Berak, Gath Rimmon, 
JOS.19.46	Me Jarkon, Rakkon, and the area near Joppa.
JOS.19.47	(But the Danites had trouble taking their land. They went and fought against Leshem, defeated it, and killed the people who lived there. So the Danites moved into the town of Leshem and changed its name to Dan, because he was the father of their tribe.) 
JOS.19.48	All of these towns and villages were given to the family groups of Dan.
JOS.19.49	After the leaders finished dividing the land and giving it to the different tribes, the Israelites gave Joshua son of Nun his land also. 
JOS.19.50	They gave Joshua the town he asked for, Timnath Serah in the mountains of Ephraim, just as the L
JOS.19.51	So these lands were given to the different tribes of Israel. Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of each tribe divided up the land by lots at Shiloh. They met in the presence of the L
JOS.20.1	Then the L
JOS.20.2	“Tell the Israelites to choose the special cities of safety, as I had Moses command you to do. 
JOS.20.3	If a person kills someone accidentally and without meaning to kill him, that person may go to a city of safety to hide. There the killer will be safe from the relative who has the duty of punishing a murderer.
JOS.20.4	“When the killer runs to one of those cities, he must stop at the entrance gate, stand there, and tell the leaders of the people what happened. Then that person will be allowed to enter the city and will be given a place to live among them. 
JOS.20.5	But if the one who is chasing him follows him to that city, the leaders of the city must not hand over the killer. It was an accident. He did not hate him beforehand or kill him on purpose. 
JOS.20.6	The killer must stay in the city until a court comes to a decision and until the high priest dies. Then he may go back home to the town from which he ran away.”
JOS.20.7	So the Israelites chose these cities to be cities of safety: Kedesh in Galilee in the mountains of Naphtali; Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim; Kiriath Arba (also called Hebron) in the mountains of Judah; 
JOS.20.8	Bezer on the east side of the Jordan River near Jericho in the desert in the land of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead in the land of Gad; and Golan in Bashan in the land of Manasseh. 
JOS.20.9	Any Israelite or anyone living among them who killed someone accidentally was to be allowed to run to one of these cities of safety. There he would not be killed, before he was judged, by the relative who had the duty of punishing a murderer.
JOS.21.1	The heads of the Levite families went to talk to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of all the tribes of Israel. 
JOS.21.2	At Shiloh in the land of Canaan, the heads of the Levite families said to them, “The L
JOS.21.3	So the Israelites obeyed this command of the L
JOS.21.4	The Kohath family groups were part of the tribe of Levi. Some of the Levites in the Kohath family groups were from the family of Aaron the priest. To these Levites were given thirteen towns in the areas of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 
JOS.21.5	The other family groups of Kohath were given ten towns in the areas of Ephraim, Dan, and West Manasseh.
JOS.21.6	The people from the Gershon family groups were given thirteen towns in the land of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the East Manasseh in Bashan.
JOS.21.7	The family groups of Merari were given twelve towns in the areas of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
JOS.21.8	So the Israelites gave the Levites these towns and the pastures around them, just as the L
JOS.21.9	These are the names of the towns that came from the lands of Judah and Simeon. 
JOS.21.10	The first choice of towns was given to the Kohath family groups of the Levites. 
JOS.21.11	They gave them Kiriath Arba, also called Hebron, and all its pastures in the mountains of Judah. (Arba was the father of Anak.) 
JOS.21.12	But the fields and the villages around Kiriath Arba had been given to Caleb son of Jephunneh.
JOS.21.13	So they gave the city of Hebron to the descendants of Aaron (Hebron was a city of safety). They also gave them the towns of Libnah, 
JOS.21.14	Jattir, Eshtemoa, 
JOS.21.15	Holon, Debir, 
JOS.21.16	Ain, Juttah, and Beth Shemesh, and all the pastures around them. Nine towns were given from these two tribes.
JOS.21.17	They also gave the people of Aaron these cities that belonged to the tribe of Benjamin: Gibeon, Geba, 
JOS.21.18	Anathoth, and Almon. They gave them these four towns and the pastures around them.
JOS.21.19	So these thirteen towns with their pastures were given to the priests, who were from the family of Aaron.
JOS.21.20	The other Kohathite family groups of the Levites were given these towns from the tribe of Ephraim: 
JOS.21.21	Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim (which was a city of safety), Gezer, 
JOS.21.22	Kibzaim, and Beth Horon. There were four towns and their pastures.
JOS.21.23	The tribe of Dan gave them Eltekeh, Gibbethon, 
JOS.21.24	Aijalon, and Gath Rimmon. There were four towns and their pastures.
JOS.21.25	West Manasseh gave them Taanach and Gath Rimmon and the pastures around these two towns.
JOS.21.26	So these ten towns and the pastures around them were given to the rest of the Kohathite family groups.
JOS.21.27	The Gershonite family groups of the Levite tribe were given these towns: East Manasseh gave them Golan in Bashan, which was a city of safety, and Be Eshtarah, and the pastures around these two towns.
JOS.21.28	The tribe of Issachar gave them Kishion, Daberath, 
JOS.21.29	Jarmuth, and En Gannim, and the pastures around these four towns.
JOS.21.30	The tribe of Asher gave them Mishal, Abdon, 
JOS.21.31	Helkath, and Rehob, and the pastures around these four towns.
JOS.21.32	The tribe of Naphtali gave them Kedesh in Galilee (a city of safety), Hammoth Dor, and Kartan, and the pastures around these three towns.
JOS.21.33	So the Gershonite family groups received thirteen towns and the pastures around them.
JOS.21.34	The Merarite family groups (the rest of the Levites) were given these towns: The tribe of Zebulun gave them Jokneam, Kartah, 
JOS.21.35	Dimnah, and Nahalal, and the pastures around these four towns.
JOS.21.36	The tribe of Reuben gave them Bezer, Jahaz, 
JOS.21.37	Kedemoth, and Mephaath, along with the pastures around these four towns.
JOS.21.38	The tribe of Gad gave them Ramoth in Gilead (a city of safety), Mahanaim, 
JOS.21.39	Heshbon, and Jazer, and the pastures around these four towns.
JOS.21.40	So the total number of towns given to the Merarite family groups was twelve.
JOS.21.41	A total of forty-eight towns with their pastures in the land of Israel were given to the Levites. 
JOS.21.42	Each town had pastures around it.
JOS.21.43	So the L

JOS.21.45	He kept every promise he had made to the Israelites; each one came true.
JOS.22.1	Then Joshua called a meeting of all the people from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh. 
JOS.22.2	He said to them, “You have done everything Moses, the L
JOS.22.3	For a long time you have supported the other Israelites. You have been careful to obey the commands the L

JOS.22.5	But be careful to obey the teachings and laws Moses, the L
JOS.22.6	Then Joshua said good-bye to them, and they left and went away to their homes. 
JOS.22.7	Moses had given the land of Bashan to East Manasseh. Joshua gave land on the west side of the Jordan River to West Manasseh. And he sent them to their homes and he blessed them. 
JOS.22.8	He said, “Go back to your homes and your riches. You have many animals, silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and many beautiful clothes. Also, you have taken many things from your enemies that you should divide among yourselves.”
JOS.22.9	So the people from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh left the other Israelites at Shiloh in Canaan and went back to Gilead. It was their own land, given to them by Moses as the L
JOS.22.10	The people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh went to Geliloth, near the Jordan River in the land of Canaan. There they built a beautiful altar. 
JOS.22.11	The other Israelites still at Shiloh heard about the altar these three tribes built at the border of Canaan at Geliloth, near the Jordan River on Israel’s side. 
JOS.22.12	All the Israelites became very angry at these three tribes, so they met together and decided to fight them.
JOS.22.13	The Israelites sent Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest to Gilead to talk to the people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh. 
JOS.22.14	They also sent one leader from each of the ten tribes at Shiloh. Each of them was a leader of his family group of Israelites.
JOS.22.15	These leaders went to Gilead to talk to the people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh. They said: 
JOS.22.16	“All the Israelites ask you: ‘Why did you turn against the God of Israel by building an altar for yourselves? You know that this is against God’s law. 
JOS.22.17	Remember what happened at Peor? We still suffer today because of that sin, for which God made many Israelites very sick.

JOS.22.21	The people from Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh answered, 
JOS.22.22	“The L

JOS.22.31	So Phinehas, son of Eleazar the priest, said, “Now we know the L
JOS.22.32	Then Phinehas and the leaders left the people of Reuben and Gad in Gilead and went back to Canaan where they told the Israelites what had happened. 
JOS.22.33	They were pleased and thanked God. So they decided not to fight the people of Reuben and Gad and destroy those lands.
JOS.22.34	And the people of Reuben and Gad named the altar Proof That We Believe the L

JOS.24.1	Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem. He called the elders, heads of families, judges, and officers of Israel to stand before God.
JOS.24.2	Then Joshua said to all the people, “Here’s what the L
JOS.24.3	But I, the L
JOS.24.4	I gave Isaac two sons named Jacob and Esau. I gave the land around the mountains of Edom to Esau, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. 
JOS.24.5	Then I sent Moses and Aaron to Egypt, where I brought many disasters on the Egyptians. Afterwards I brought you out. 
JOS.24.6	When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, they came to the Red Sea, and the Egyptians chased them with chariots and men on horses. 
JOS.24.7	So the people called out to the L
JOS.24.8	“ ‘Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, east of the Jordan River. They fought against you, but I handed them over to you. I destroyed them before you, and you took control of that land. 
JOS.24.9	But the king of Moab, Balak son of Zippor, prepared to fight against the Israelites. The king sent for Balaam son of Beor to curse you, 
JOS.24.10	but I refused to listen to Balaam. So he asked for good things to happen to you! I saved you and brought you out of his power.
JOS.24.11	“ ‘Then you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho, where the people of Jericho fought against you. Also, the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and Jebusites fought against you. But I handed them over to you. 
JOS.24.12	I sent terror ahead of you to force out two Amorite kings. You took the land without using swords and bows. 
JOS.24.13	I gave you that land where you did not have to work. I gave you cities that you did not have to build. And now you live in that land and in those cities, and you eat from vineyards and olive trees that you did not plant.’ ”
JOS.24.14	Then Joshua said to the people, “Now respect the L
JOS.24.15	But if you don’t want to serve the L
JOS.24.16	Then the people answered, “We will never stop following the L

JOS.24.21	But the people said to Joshua, “No! We will serve the L
JOS.24.22	Then Joshua said, “You are your own witnesses that you have chosen to serve the L
JOS.24.22	The people said, “Yes, we are.”
JOS.24.23	Then Joshua said, “Now throw away the gods that you have. Love the L
JOS.24.24	Then the people said to Joshua, “We will serve the L
JOS.24.25	On that day at Shechem Joshua made an agreement for the people. He made rules and laws for them to follow. 
JOS.24.26	Joshua wrote these things in the Book of the Teachings of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up under the oak tree near the L
JOS.24.27	Joshua said to all the people, “See this stone! It will remind you of what we did today. It was here the L
JOS.24.28	Then Joshua sent the people back to their land.
JOS.24.29	After that, Joshua son of Nun died at the age of one hundred ten. 
JOS.24.30	They buried him in his own land at Timnath Serah, in the mountains of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
JOS.24.31	The Israelites served the L
JOS.24.32	When the Israelites left Egypt, they carried the bones of Joseph with them. They buried them at Shechem, in the land Jacob had bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of Hamor (Hamor was the father of Shechem). This land now belonged to Joseph’s children.
JOS.24.33	And Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah in the mountains of Ephraim, which had been given to Eleazar’s son Phinehas. 
JDG.1.1	After Joshua died, the Israelites asked the L
JDG.1.2	The L
JDG.1.3	The men of Judah said to the men of Simeon, their relatives, “Come and help us fight the Canaanites for our land. If you do, we will go and help you fight for your land.” So the men of Simeon went with them.
JDG.1.4	When Judah attacked, the L
JDG.1.5	There they found Adoni-Bezek, the ruler of the city, and fought him. The men of Judah defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites, 
JDG.1.6	but Adoni-Bezek ran away. The men of Judah chased him, and when they caught him, they cut off his thumbs and big toes.
JDG.1.7	Adoni-Bezek said, “Seventy kings whose thumbs and big toes had been cut off used to eat scraps that fell from my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them.” The men of Judah took Adoni-Bezek to Jerusalem, and he died there.
JDG.1.8	Then the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it. They attacked with their swords and burned the city.
JDG.1.9	Later, they went down to fight the Canaanites who lived in the mountains, in the dry country to the south, and in the western hills. 
JDG.1.10	The men of Judah went to fight against the Canaanites in the city of Hebron (which used to be called Kiriath Arba). And they defeated Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
JDG.1.11	Then they left there and went to fight against the people living in Debir. (In the past Debir had been called Kiriath Sepher.) 
JDG.1.12	Before attacking the city, Caleb said, “I will give Acsah, my daughter, as a wife to the man who attacks and captures the city of Kiriath Sepher.” 
JDG.1.13	Othniel son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured the city, so Caleb gave his daughter Acsah to Othniel to be his wife. 
JDG.1.14	When Acsah came to Othniel, she told him to ask her father for a field. When she got down from her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What do you want?”
JDG.1.15	Acsah answered him, “Do me a special favor. Since you have given me land in southern Canaan, also give me springs of water.” So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
JDG.1.16	The Kenite people, who were from the family of Moses’ father-in-law, left Jericho, the city of palm trees. They went with the men of Judah to the Desert of Judah to live with them there in southern Judah near the city of Arad.
JDG.1.17	The men of Judah and the men of Simeon, their relatives, defeated the Canaanites who lived in Zephath. They completely destroyed the city, so they called it Hormah. 
JDG.1.18	The men of Judah captured Gaza, Ashkelon, Ekron, and the lands around them.
JDG.1.19	The L
JDG.1.20	As Moses had promised, Hebron was given to Caleb, and Caleb forced out the three sons of Anak. 
JDG.1.21	But the people of Benjamin could not make the Jebusite people leave Jerusalem. Since that time the Jebusites have lived with the Benjaminites in Jerusalem.
JDG.1.22	The men of Joseph went to fight against the city of Bethel, and the L
JDG.1.23	They sent some spies to Bethel (which used to be called Luz). 
JDG.1.24	The spies saw a man coming out of the city and said to him, “Show us a way into the city, and we will be kind to you.” 
JDG.1.25	So the man showed them the way into the city. The men of Joseph attacked with swords the people in Bethel, but they let the man and his family go free. 
JDG.1.26	He went to the land where the Hittites lived and built a city. He named it Luz, which it is called even today.
JDG.1.27	There were Canaanites living in the cities of Beth Shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and the small towns around them. The people of Manasseh did not force those people out of their towns, because the Canaanites were determined to stay there. 
JDG.1.28	Later, the Israelites grew strong and forced the Canaanites to work as slaves, but they did not make all the Canaanites leave their land. 
JDG.1.29	The people of Ephraim did not force out all of the Canaanites living in Gezer. So the Canaanites continued to live in Gezer with the people of Ephraim. 
JDG.1.30	The people of Zebulun did not force out the Canaanites living in the cities of Kitron and Nahalol. They stayed and lived with the people of Zebulun, but Zebulun made them work as slaves.
JDG.1.31	The people of Asher did not force the Canaanites from the cities of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphek, and Rehob. 
JDG.1.32	Since the people of Asher did not force them out, the Canaanites continued to live with them. 
JDG.1.33	The people of Naphtali did not force out the people of the cities of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath. So they continued to live with the Canaanites in those cities, and the Canaanites worked as slaves. 
JDG.1.34	The Amorites forced the Danites back into the mountains and would not let them come down to live in the plain. 
JDG.1.35	The Amorites were determined to stay in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim. But when the Israelites grew stronger, they made the Amorites work as slaves. 
JDG.1.36	The land of the Amorites was from Scorpion Pass to Sela and beyond.
JDG.2.1	The angel of the L
JDG.2.2	But you must not make an agreement with the people who live in this land. You must destroy their altars.’ But you did not obey me. How could you do this? 
JDG.2.3	Now I tell you, ‘I will not force out the people in this land. They will be your enemies, and their gods will be a trap for you.’ ”
JDG.2.4	After the angel gave Israel this message from the L
JDG.2.5	So they named the place Bokim. There they offered sacrifices to the L
JDG.2.6	Then Joshua sent the people back to their land. 
JDG.2.7	The people served the L
JDG.2.8	Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the L
JDG.2.9	They buried him in his own land at Timnath Serah in the mountains of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
JDG.2.10	After those people had died, their children grew up and did not know the L
JDG.2.11	So they did what the L
JDG.2.12	They quit following the L
JDG.2.13	The Israelites quit following the L
JDG.2.14	The L
JDG.2.15	When the Israelites went out to fight, they always lost, because the L
JDG.2.16	Then the L
JDG.2.17	But the Israelites did not listen to their judges. They were not faithful to God but worshiped other gods instead. Their ancestors had obeyed the L
JDG.2.18	When their enemies hurt them, the Israelites cried for help. So the L
JDG.2.19	But when the judges died, the Israelites again sinned and worshiped other gods. They became worse than their ancestors. The Israelites were very stubborn and refused to change their evil ways.
JDG.2.20	So the L
JDG.2.21	I will no longer defeat the nations who were left when Joshua died. 
JDG.2.22	I will use them to test Israel, to see if Israel will keep the L
JDG.2.23	In the past the L
JDG.3.1	These are the nations the L
JDG.3.2	(The only reason the L
JDG.3.3	These are the nations: the five rulers of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the people of Sidon, and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanon mountains from Mount Baal Hermon to Lebo Hamath. 
JDG.3.4	Those nations were in the land to test the Israelites—to see if they would obey the commands the L
JDG.3.5	The people of Israel lived with the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
JDG.3.6	The Israelites began to marry the daughters of those people, and they allowed their daughters to marry the sons of those people. Israel also served their gods.
JDG.3.7	The Israelites did what the L
JDG.3.8	So the L
JDG.3.9	When Israel cried to the L
JDG.3.10	The Spirit of the L
JDG.3.11	So the land was at peace for forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.
JDG.3.12	Again the people of Israel did what the L
JDG.3.13	Eglon got the Ammonites and the Amalekites to join him. Then he attacked Israel and took Jericho, the city of palm trees. 
JDG.3.14	So the people of Israel were ruled by Eglon king of Moab for eighteen years.
JDG.3.15	When the people cried to the L
JDG.3.16	Ehud made himself a sword with two edges, about eighteen inches long, and he tied it to his right hip under his clothes. 
JDG.3.17	Ehud gave Eglon king of Moab the payment he demanded. Now Eglon was a very fat man. 
JDG.3.18	After he had given Eglon the payment, Ehud sent away the people who had carried it. 
JDG.3.19	When he passed the statues near Gilgal, he turned around and said to Eglon, “I have a secret message for you, King Eglon.”
JDG.3.19	The king said, “Be quiet!” Then he sent all of his servants out of the room. 
JDG.3.20	Ehud went to King Eglon, as he was sitting alone in the room above his summer palace.
JDG.3.20	Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” As the king stood up from his chair, 
JDG.3.21	Ehud reached with his left hand and took out the sword that was tied to his right hip. Then he stabbed the sword deep into the king’s belly! 
JDG.3.22	Even the handle sank in, and the blade came out his back. The king’s fat covered the whole sword, so Ehud left the sword in Eglon. 
JDG.3.23	Then he went out of the room and closed and locked the doors behind him.
JDG.3.24	When the servants returned just after Ehud left, they found the doors to the room locked. So they thought the king was relieving himself. 
JDG.3.25	They waited for a long time. Finally they became worried because he still had not opened the doors. So they got the key and unlocked them and saw their king lying dead on the floor!
JDG.3.26	While the servants were waiting, Ehud had escaped. He passed by the statues and went to Seirah. 
JDG.3.27	When he reached the mountains of Ephraim he blew the trumpet. The people of Israel heard it and went down from the hills with Ehud leading them.
JDG.3.28	He said to them, “Follow me! The L
JDG.3.29	Israel killed about ten thousand strong and able men from Moab; not one escaped. 
JDG.3.30	So that day Moab was forced to be under the rule of Israel, and there was peace in the land for eighty years.
JDG.3.31	After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath saved Israel. Shamgar killed six hundred Philistines with a sharp stick used to guide oxen.
JDG.4.1	After Ehud died, the Israelites again did what the L
JDG.4.2	So he let Jabin, a king of Canaan who ruled in the city of Hazor, defeat Israel. Sisera, who lived in Harosheth Haggoyim, was the commander of Jabin’s army. 
JDG.4.3	Because he had nine hundred iron chariots and was very cruel to the people of Israel for twenty years, they cried to the L
JDG.4.4	A prophetess named Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was judge of Israel at that time. 
JDG.4.5	Deborah would sit under the Palm Tree of Deborah, which was between the cities of Ramah and Bethel, in the mountains of Ephraim. And the people of Israel would come to her to settle their arguments.
JDG.4.6	Deborah sent a message to Barak son of Abinoam. Barak lived in the city of Kedesh, which is in the area of Naphtali. Deborah said to Barak, “The L
JDG.4.7	I will make Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, and his chariots, and his army meet you at the Kishon River. I will hand Sisera over to you.’ ”
JDG.4.8	Then Barak said to Deborah, “I will go if you will go with me, but if you won’t go with me, I won’t go.”
JDG.4.9	“Of course I will go with you,” Deborah answered, “but you will not get credit for the victory. The L
JDG.4.10	At Kedesh, Barak called the people of Zebulun and Naphtali together. From them, he gathered ten thousand men to follow him, and Deborah went with him also.
JDG.4.11	Now Heber the Kenite had left the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, Moses’ brother-in-law. Heber had put up his tent by the great tree in Zaanannim, near Kedesh.
JDG.4.12	When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone to Mount Tabor, 
JDG.4.13	Sisera gathered his nine hundred iron chariots and all the men with him, from Harosheth Haggoyim to the Kishon River.
JDG.4.14	Then Deborah said to Barak, “Get up! Today is the day the L
JDG.4.15	As Barak approached, the L
JDG.4.16	Barak and his men chased Sisera’s chariots and army to Harosheth Haggoyim. With their swords they killed all of Sisera’s men; not one of them was left alive.
JDG.4.17	But Sisera himself ran away to the tent where Jael lived. She was the wife of Heber, one of the Kenite family groups. Heber’s family was at peace with Jabin king of Hazor. 
JDG.4.18	Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, “Come into my tent, master! Come in. Don’t be afraid.” So Sisera went into Jael’s tent, and she covered him with a rug.
JDG.4.19	Sisera said to Jael, “I am thirsty. Please give me some water to drink.” So she opened a leather bag of milk and gave him a drink. Then she covered him up.
JDG.4.20	He said to her, “Go stand at the entrance to the tent. If anyone comes and asks you, ‘Is anyone here?’ say, ‘No.’ ”
JDG.4.21	But Jael, the wife of Heber, took a tent peg and a hammer and quietly went to Sisera. Since he was very tired, he was in a deep sleep. She hammered the tent peg through the side of Sisera’s head and into the ground. And so Sisera died.
JDG.4.22	At that very moment Barak came by Jael’s tent, chasing Sisera. Jael went out to meet him and said, “Come. I will show you the man you are looking for.” So Barak entered her tent, and there Sisera lay dead, with the tent peg in his head.
JDG.4.23	On that day God defeated Jabin king of Canaan in the sight of Israel.
JDG.4.24	Israel became stronger and stronger against Jabin king of Canaan until finally they destroyed him.
JDG.5.1	On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:
JDG.5.2	“The leaders led Israel.
JDG.5.2	The people volunteered to go to battle.
JDG.5.2	Praise the L

JDG.5.7	There were no warriors in Israel
JDG.5.7	until I, Deborah, arose,
JDG.5.7	until I arose to be a mother to Israel.
JDG.5.8	At that time they chose to follow new gods.
JDG.5.8	Because of this, enemies fought us at our city gates.
JDG.5.8	No one could find a shield or a spear
JDG.5.8	among the forty thousand people of Israel.
JDG.5.9	My heart is with the commanders of Israel.
JDG.5.9	They volunteered freely from among the people.
JDG.5.9	Praise the L

JDG.5.13	“Then those who were left came down to the important leaders.
JDG.5.13	The L
JDG.5.14	They came from Ephraim in the mountains of Amalek.
JDG.5.14	Benjamin was among the people who followed you.
JDG.5.14	From the family group of Makir, the commanders came down.
JDG.5.14	And from Zebulun came those who lead.
JDG.5.15	The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.
JDG.5.15	The people of Issachar were loyal to Barak
JDG.5.15	and followed him into the valley.
JDG.5.15	The Reubenites thought hard
JDG.5.15	about what they would do.
JDG.5.16	Why did you stay by the sheepfold?
JDG.5.16	Was it to hear the music played for your sheep?
JDG.5.16	The Reubenites thought hard
JDG.5.16	about what they would do.
JDG.5.17	The people of Gilead stayed east of the Jordan River.
JDG.5.17	People of Dan, why did you stay by the ships?
JDG.5.17	The people of Asher stayed at the seashore,
JDG.5.17	at their safe harbors.
JDG.5.18	But the people of Zebulun risked their lives,
JDG.5.18	as did the people of Naphtali on the battlefield.
JDG.5.19	“The kings came, and they fought.
JDG.5.19	At that time the kings of Canaan fought
JDG.5.19	at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo.
JDG.5.19	But they took away no silver or possessions of Israel.
JDG.5.20	The stars fought from heaven;
JDG.5.20	from their paths, they fought Sisera.
JDG.5.21	The Kishon River swept Sisera’s men away,
JDG.5.21	that old river, the Kishon River.
JDG.5.21	March on, my soul, with strength!
JDG.5.22	Then the horses’ hoofs beat the ground.
JDG.5.22	Galloping, galloping go Sisera’s mighty horses.
JDG.5.23	‘May the town of Meroz be cursed,’ said the angel of the L
JDG.5.23	‘Bitterly curse its people,
JDG.5.23	because they did not come to help the L

JDG.5.24	“May Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite,
JDG.5.24	be blessed above all women who live in tents.
JDG.5.25	Sisera asked for water,
JDG.5.25	but Jael gave him milk.
JDG.5.25	In a bowl fit for a ruler,
JDG.5.25	she brought him cream.
JDG.5.26	Jael reached out and took the tent peg.
JDG.5.26	Her right hand reached for the workman’s hammer.
JDG.5.26	She hit Sisera! She smashed his head!
JDG.5.26	She crushed and pierced the side of his head!
JDG.5.27	At Jael’s feet he sank.
JDG.5.27	He fell, and he lay there.
JDG.5.27	At her feet he sank. He fell.
JDG.5.27	Where Sisera sank, there he fell, dead!
JDG.5.28	“Sisera’s mother looked out through the window.
JDG.5.28	She looked through the curtains and cried out,
JDG.5.28	‘Why is Sisera’s chariot so late in coming?
JDG.5.28	Why are sounds of his chariots’ horses delayed?’
JDG.5.29	The wisest of her servant ladies answer her,
JDG.5.29	and Sisera’s mother says to herself,
JDG.5.30	‘Surely they are robbing the people they defeated!
JDG.5.30	Surely they are dividing those things among themselves!
JDG.5.30	Each soldier is given a girl or two.
JDG.5.30	Maybe Sisera is taking pieces of dyed cloth.
JDG.5.30	Maybe they are even taking
JDG.5.30	pieces of dyed, embroidered cloth for the necks of the victors!’
JDG.5.31	“Let all your enemies die this way, L
JDG.5.31	But let all the people who love you
JDG.5.31	be as strong as the rising sun!”
JDG.5.31	Then there was peace in the land for forty years.
JDG.6.1	Again the Israelites did what the L
JDG.6.2	Because the Midianites were very powerful and were cruel to Israel, the Israelites made hiding places in the mountains, in caves, and in safe places. 
JDG.6.3	Whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites, Amalekites, and other peoples from the east would come and attack them. 
JDG.6.4	They camped in the land and destroyed the crops that the Israelites had planted as far away as Gaza. They left nothing for Israel to eat, and no sheep, cattle, or donkeys. 
JDG.6.5	The Midianites came with their tents and their animals like swarms of locusts to ruin the land. There were so many people and camels they could not be counted. 
JDG.6.6	Israel became very poor because of the Midianites, so they cried out to the L
JDG.6.7	When the Israelites cried out to the L
JDG.6.8	the L
JDG.6.9	I saved you from the Egyptians and from all those who were against you. I forced the Canaanites out of their land and gave it to you. 
JDG.6.10	Then I said to you, ‘I am the L
JDG.6.11	The angel of the L
JDG.6.12	The angel of the L
JDG.6.13	Then Gideon said, “Sir, if the L
JDG.6.14	The L
JDG.6.15	But Gideon answered, “Lord, how can I save Israel? My family group is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least important member of my family.”
JDG.6.16	The L
JDG.6.17	Then Gideon said to the L
JDG.6.18	Please wait here until I come back to you. Let me bring my offering and set it in front of you.”
JDG.6.18	And the L
JDG.6.19	So Gideon went in and cooked a young goat, and with twenty quarts of flour, made bread without yeast. Then he put the meat into a basket and the broth into a pot. He brought them out and gave them to the angel under the oak tree.
JDG.6.20	The angel of God said to Gideon, “Put the meat and the bread without yeast on that rock over there. Then pour the broth on them.” And Gideon did as he was told. 
JDG.6.21	The angel of the L
JDG.6.22	Then Gideon understood he had been talking to the angel of the L
JDG.6.23	But the L
JDG.6.24	So Gideon built an altar there to worship the L
JDG.6.25	That same night the L
JDG.6.26	Then build an altar to the L
JDG.6.27	So Gideon got ten of his servants and did what the L
JDG.6.28	When the men of the city got up the next morning, they saw that the altar for Baal had been destroyed and that the Asherah idol beside it had been cut down! They also saw the altar Gideon had built and the second bull that had been sacrificed on it. 
JDG.6.29	The men of the city asked each other, “Who did this?”
JDG.6.29	After they asked many questions, someone told them, “Gideon son of Joash did this.”
JDG.6.30	So they said to Joash, “Bring your son out. He has pulled down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah idol beside it. He must die!”
JDG.6.31	But Joash said to the angry crowd around him, “Are you going to take Baal’s side? Are you going to defend him? Anyone who takes Baal’s side will be killed by morning! If Baal is a god, let him fight for himself. It’s his altar that has been pulled down.” 
JDG.6.32	So on that day Gideon got the name Jerub-Baal, which means “let Baal fight against him,” because Gideon pulled down Baal’s altar.
JDG.6.33	All the Midianites, the Amalekites, and other peoples from the east joined together and came across the Jordan River and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 
JDG.6.34	But the Spirit of the L
JDG.6.35	He sent messengers to all of Manasseh, calling them to follow him. He also sent messengers to the people of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali. So they also went up to meet Gideon and his men.
JDG.6.36	Then Gideon said to God, “You said you would help me save Israel. 
JDG.6.37	I will put some wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the wool but all of the ground is dry, then I will know that you will use me to save Israel, as you said.” 
JDG.6.38	And that is just what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning and squeezed the wool, he got a full bowl of water from it.
JDG.6.39	Then Gideon said to God, “Don’t be angry with me if I ask just one more thing. Please let me make one more test. Let only the wool be dry while the ground around it gets wet with dew.” 
JDG.6.40	That night God did that very thing. Just the wool was dry, but the ground around it was wet with dew.
JDG.7.1	Early in the morning Jerub-Baal (also called Gideon) and all his men set up their camp at the spring of Harod. The Midianites were camped north of them in the valley at the bottom of the hill called Moreh. 
JDG.7.2	Then the L
JDG.7.3	So now, announce to the people, ‘Anyone who is afraid may leave Mount Gilead and go back home.’ ” So twenty-two thousand men returned home, but ten thousand remained.
JDG.7.4	Then the L
JDG.7.5	So Gideon led the men down to the water. There the L
JDG.7.6	There were three hundred men who used their hands to bring water to their mouths, lapping it as a dog does. All the rest got down on their knees to drink.
JDG.7.7	Then the L
JDG.7.8	So Gideon sent the rest of Israel to their homes. But he kept three hundred men and took the jars and the trumpets of those who left.
JDG.7.8	Now the camp of Midian was in the valley below Gideon. 
JDG.7.9	That night the L
JDG.7.10	But if you are afraid to go down, take your servant Purah with you. 
JDG.7.11	When you come to the camp of Midian, you will hear what they are saying. Then you will not be afraid to attack the camp.”
JDG.7.11	So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the edge of the enemy camp. 
JDG.7.12	The Midianites, the Amalekites, and all the peoples from the east were camped in that valley. There were so many of them they seemed like locusts. Their camels could not be counted because they were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore!
JDG.7.13	When Gideon came to the enemy camp, he heard a man telling his friend about a dream. He was saying, “I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into the camp of Midian. It hit the tent so hard that the tent turned over and fell flat!”
JDG.7.14	The man’s friend said, “Your dream is about the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel. God will hand Midian and the whole army over to him!”
JDG.7.15	When Gideon heard about the dream and what it meant, he worshiped God. Then Gideon went back to the camp of Israel and called out to them, “Get up! The L
JDG.7.16	Gideon divided the three hundred men into three groups. He gave each man a trumpet and an empty jar with a burning torch inside.
JDG.7.17	Gideon told the men, “Watch me and do what I do. When I get to the edge of the camp, do what I do. 
JDG.7.18	Surround the enemy camp. When I and everyone with me blow our trumpets, you blow your trumpets, too. Then shout, ‘For the L
JDG.7.19	So Gideon and the one hundred men with him came to the edge of the enemy camp just after they had changed guards. It was during the middle watch of the night. Then Gideon and his men blew their trumpets and smashed their jars. 
JDG.7.20	All three groups of Gideon’s men blew their trumpets and smashed their jars. They held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands. Then they shouted, “A sword for the L
JDG.7.21	Each of Gideon’s men stayed in his place around the camp, but the Midianites began shouting and running to escape.
JDG.7.22	When Gideon’s three hundred men blew their trumpets, the L
JDG.7.23	Then men of Israel from Naphtali, Asher, and all of Manasseh were called out to chase the Midianites. 
JDG.7.24	Gideon sent messengers through all the mountains of Ephraim, saying, “Come down and attack the Midianites. Take control of the Jordan River as far as Beth Barah before the Midianites can get to it.”
JDG.7.24	So they called out all the men of Ephraim, who took control of the Jordan River as far as Beth Barah. 
JDG.7.25	The men of Ephraim captured two princes of Midian named Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb, and they continued chasing the Midianites. They brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was east of the Jordan River.
JDG.8.1	The men of Ephraim asked Gideon, “Why did you treat us this way? Why didn’t you call us when you went to fight against Midian?” They argued angrily with Gideon.
JDG.8.2	But he answered them, “I have not done as well as you! The small part you did was better than all that my people of Abiezer did. 
JDG.8.3	God let you capture Oreb and Zeeb, the princes of Midian. How can I compare what I did with what you did?” When the men of Ephraim heard Gideon’s answer, they were not as angry anymore.
JDG.8.4	When Gideon and his three hundred men came to the Jordan River, they were tired, but they chased the enemy across to the other side. 
JDG.8.5	Gideon said to the men of Succoth, “Please give my soldiers some bread because they are very tired. I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.”
JDG.8.6	But the leaders of Succoth said, “Why should we give your soldiers bread? You haven’t caught Zebah and Zalmunna yet.”
JDG.8.7	Then Gideon said, “The L
JDG.8.8	Gideon left Succoth and went to the city of Peniel and asked them for food. But the people of Peniel gave him the same answer as the people of Succoth. 
JDG.8.9	So Gideon said to the men of Peniel, “After I win the victory, I will return and pull down this tower.”
JDG.8.10	Zebah and Zalmunna and their army were in the city of Karkor. About fifteen thousand men were left of the armies of the peoples of the east. Already one hundred twenty thousand soldiers had been killed. 
JDG.8.11	Gideon went up the road of those who live in tents east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked the enemy army when they did not expect it. 
JDG.8.12	Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian, ran away, but Gideon chased and captured them and frightened away their army.
JDG.8.13	Then Gideon son of Joash returned from the battle by the Pass of Heres. 
JDG.8.14	Gideon captured a young man from Succoth and asked him some questions. So the young man wrote down for Gideon the names of seventy-seven officers and elders of Succoth.
JDG.8.15	When Gideon came to Succoth, he said to the people of that city, “Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. You made fun of me by saying, ‘Why should we give bread to your tired men? You have not caught Zebah and Zalmunna yet.’ ” 
JDG.8.16	So Gideon took the elders of the city and punished them with thorns and briers from the desert. 
JDG.8.17	He also pulled down the tower of Peniel and killed the people in that city.
JDG.8.18	Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna, “What were the men like that you killed on Mount Tabor?”
JDG.8.18	They answered, “They were like you. Each one of them looked like a prince.”
JDG.8.19	Gideon said, “Those were my brothers, my mother’s sons. As surely as the L
JDG.8.20	Then Gideon said to Jether, his oldest son, “Kill them.” But Jether was only a boy and was afraid, so he did not take out his sword.
JDG.8.21	Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, “Come on. Kill us yourself. As the saying goes, ‘It takes a man to do a man’s job.’ ” So Gideon got up and killed Zebah and Zalmunna and took the decorations off their camels’ necks.
JDG.8.22	The people of Israel said to Gideon, “You saved us from the Midianites. Now, we want you and your son and your grandson to rule over us.”
JDG.8.23	But Gideon told them, “The L
JDG.8.24	He said, “I want you to do this one thing for me. I want each of you to give me a gold earring from the things you took in the fighting.” (The Ishmaelites wore gold earrings.)
JDG.8.25	They said, “We will gladly give you what you want.” So they spread out a coat, and everyone threw down an earring from what he had taken. 
JDG.8.26	The gold earrings weighed about forty-three pounds. This did not count the decorations, necklaces, and purple robes worn by the kings of Midian, nor the chains from the camels’ necks. 
JDG.8.27	Gideon used the gold to make a holy vest, which he put in his hometown of Ophrah. But all the Israelites were unfaithful to God and worshiped it, so it became a trap for Gideon and his family.
JDG.8.28	So Midian was under the rule of Israel; they did not cause trouble anymore. And the land had peace for forty years, as long as Gideon was alive.
JDG.8.29	Gideon son of Joash went to his home to live. 
JDG.8.30	He had seventy sons of his own, because he had many wives. 
JDG.8.31	He had a slave woman who lived in Shechem, and he had a son by her, whom he named Abimelech. 
JDG.8.32	So Gideon son of Joash died at a good old age. He was buried in the tomb of Joash, his father, in Ophrah, where the Abiezrites live.
JDG.8.33	As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel were again unfaithful to God and followed the Baals. They made Baal-Berith their god. 
JDG.8.34	The Israelites did not remember the L
JDG.8.35	And they were not kind to the family of Jerub-Baal, also called Gideon, for all the good he had done for Israel.
JDG.9.1	Abimelech son of Gideon went to his uncles in the city of Shechem. He said to his uncles and all of his mother’s family group, 
JDG.9.2	“Ask the leaders of Shechem, ‘Is it better for the seventy sons of Gideon to rule over you or for one man to rule?’ Remember, I am your relative.”
JDG.9.3	Abimelech’s uncles spoke to all the leaders of Shechem about this. And they decided to follow Abimelech, because they said, “He is our relative.” 
JDG.9.4	So the leaders of Shechem gave Abimelech about one and three-quarter pounds of silver from the temple of the god Baal-Berith. Abimelech used the silver to hire some worthless, reckless men, who followed him wherever he went. 
JDG.9.5	He went to Ophrah, the hometown of his father, and murdered his seventy brothers, the sons of Gideon. He killed them all on one stone. But Gideon’s youngest son, Jotham, hid from Abimelech and escaped. 
JDG.9.6	Then all of the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo gathered beside the great tree standing in Shechem. There they made Abimelech their king.
JDG.9.7	When Jotham heard this, he went and stood on the top of Mount Gerizim. He shouted to the people: “Listen to me, you leaders of Shechem, so that God will listen to you! 
JDG.9.8	One day the trees decided to appoint a king to rule over them. They said to the olive tree, ‘You be king over us!’
JDG.9.9	“But the olive tree said, ‘Men and gods are honored by my oil. Should I stop making it and go and sway over the other trees?’
JDG.9.10	“Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘Come and be king over us!’
JDG.9.11	“But the fig tree answered, ‘Should I stop making my sweet and good fruit and go and sway over the other trees?’
JDG.9.12	“Then the trees said to the vine, ‘Come and be king over us!’
JDG.9.13	“But the vine answered, ‘My new wine makes men and gods happy. Should I stop making it and go and sway over the trees?’
JDG.9.14	“Then all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘Come and be king over us.’
JDG.9.15	“But the thornbush said to the trees, ‘If you really want to appoint me king over you, come and find shelter in my shade! But if not, let fire come out of the thornbush and burn up the cedars of Lebanon!’
JDG.9.16	“Now, were you completely honest and sincere when you made Abimelech king? Have you been fair to Gideon and his family? Have you treated Gideon as you should? 
JDG.9.17	Remember, my father fought for you and risked his life to save you from the power of the Midianites. 
JDG.9.18	But now you have turned against my father’s family and have killed his seventy sons on one stone. You have made Abimelech, the son of my father’s slave girl, king over the leaders of Shechem just because he is your relative! 
JDG.9.19	So then, if you have been honest and sincere to Gideon and his family today, be happy with Abimelech as your king. And may he be happy with you! 
JDG.9.20	But if not, may fire come out of Abimelech and completely burn you leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo! Also may fire come out of the leaders of Shechem and Beth Millo and burn up Abimelech!”
JDG.9.21	Then Jotham ran away and escaped to the city of Beer. He lived there because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech.
JDG.9.22	Abimelech ruled Israel for three years. 
JDG.9.23	Then God sent an evil spirit to make trouble between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem so that the leaders of Shechem turned against him. 
JDG.9.24	Abimelech had killed Gideon’s seventy sons, his own brothers, and the leaders of Shechem had helped him. So God sent the evil spirit to punish them. 
JDG.9.25	The leaders of Shechem were against Abimelech then. They put men on the hilltops in ambush who robbed everyone going by. And Abimelech was told.
JDG.9.26	A man named Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers moved into Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem trusted him. 
JDG.9.27	They went out to the vineyards to pick grapes, and they squeezed the grapes. Then they had a feast in the temple of their god, where they ate and drank and cursed Abimelech. 
JDG.9.28	Gaal son of Ebed said, “We are the men of Shechem. Who is Abimelech that we should serve him? Isn’t he one of Gideon’s sons, and isn’t Zebul his officer? We should serve the men of Hamor, Shechem’s father. Why should we serve Abimelech? 
JDG.9.29	If you made me commander of these people, I would get rid of Abimelech. I would say to him, ‘Get your army ready and come out to battle.’ ”
JDG.9.30	Now when Zebul, the ruler of Shechem, heard what Gaal son of Ebed said, he was very angry. 
JDG.9.31	He sent secret messengers to Abimelech, saying, “Gaal son of Ebed and Gaal’s brothers have come to Shechem, and they are turning the city against you! 
JDG.9.32	You and your men should get up during the night and hide in the fields outside the city. 
JDG.9.33	As soon as the sun comes up in the morning, attack the city. When Gaal and his men come out to fight you, do what you can to them.”
JDG.9.34	So Abimelech and all his soldiers got up during the night and hid near Shechem in four groups. 
JDG.9.35	Gaal son of Ebed went out and was standing at the entrance to the city gate. As he was standing there, Abimelech and his soldiers came out of their hiding places.
JDG.9.36	When Gaal saw the soldiers, he said to Zebul, “Look! There are people coming down from the mountains!”
JDG.9.36	But Zebul said, “You are seeing the shadows of the mountains. The shadows just look like people.”
JDG.9.37	But again Gaal said, “Look, there are people coming down from the center of the land, and there is a group coming from the fortune-tellers’ tree!”
JDG.9.38	Zebul said to Gaal, “Where is your bragging now? You said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ You made fun of these men. Now go out and fight them.”
JDG.9.39	So Gaal led the men of Shechem out to fight Abimelech. 
JDG.9.40	Abimelech and his men chased them, and many of Gaal’s men were killed before they could get back to the city gate. 
JDG.9.41	While Abimelech stayed at Arumah, Zebul forced Gaal and his brothers to leave Shechem.
JDG.9.42	The next day the people of Shechem went out to the fields. When Abimelech was told about it, 
JDG.9.43	he separated his men into three groups and hid them in the fields. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he jumped up and attacked them. 
JDG.9.44	Abimelech and his group ran to the entrance gate to the city. The other two groups ran out to the people in the fields and struck them down. 
JDG.9.45	Abimelech and his men fought the city of Shechem all day until they captured it and killed its people. Then he tore it down and threw salt over the ruins.
JDG.9.46	When the leaders who were in the Tower of Shechem heard what had happened to Shechem, they gathered in the safest room of the temple of El Berith. 
JDG.9.47	Abimelech heard that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem had gathered there. 
JDG.9.48	So he and all his men went up Mount Zalmon, near Shechem. Abimelech took an ax and cut some branches and put them on his shoulders. He said to all those with him, “Hurry! Do what I have done!” 
JDG.9.49	So all those men cut branches and followed Abimelech and piled them against the safest room of the temple. Then they set them on fire and burned the people inside. So all the people who were at the Tower of Shechem also died—about a thousand men and women.
JDG.9.50	Then Abimelech went to the city of Thebez. He surrounded the city, attacked it, and captured it. 
JDG.9.51	But inside the city was a strong tower, so all the men, women, and leaders of that city ran to the tower. When they got inside, they locked the door behind them. Then they climbed up to the roof of the tower. 
JDG.9.52	Abimelech came to the tower to attack it. He approached the door of the tower to set it on fire, 
JDG.9.53	but as he came near, a woman dropped a grinding stone on his head, crushing his skull.
JDG.9.54	He quickly called to the officer who carried his armor and said, “Take out your sword and kill me. I don’t want people to say, ‘A woman killed Abimelech.’ ” So the officer stabbed Abimelech, and he died. 
JDG.9.55	When the people of Israel saw Abimelech was dead, they all returned home.
JDG.9.56	In that way God punished Abimelech for all the evil he had done to his father by killing his seventy brothers. 
JDG.9.57	God also punished the men of Shechem for the evil they had done. So the curse spoken by Jotham, the youngest son of Gideon, came true.
JDG.10.1	After Abimelech died, another judge came to save Israel. He was Tola son of Puah, the son of Dodo. Tola was from the people of Issachar and lived in the city of Shamir in the mountains of Ephraim. 
JDG.10.2	Tola was a judge for Israel for twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried in Shamir.
JDG.10.3	After Tola died, Jair from the region of Gilead became judge. He was a judge for Israel for twenty-two years. 
JDG.10.4	Jair had thirty sons, who rode thirty donkeys. These thirty sons controlled thirty towns in Gilead, which are called the Towns of Jair to this day. 
JDG.10.5	Jair died and was buried in the city of Kamon.
JDG.10.6	Again the Israelites did what the L
JDG.10.7	So the L
JDG.10.8	In the same year those people destroyed the Israelites who lived east of the Jordan River in the region of Gilead, where the Amorites lived. So the Israelites suffered for eighteen years. 
JDG.10.9	The Ammonites then crossed the Jordan River to fight the people of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim, causing much trouble to the people of Israel. 
JDG.10.10	So the Israelites cried out to the L
JDG.10.11	The L
JDG.10.12	Sidonians, Amalekites, and Maonites were cruel to you, you cried out to me, and I saved you. 
JDG.10.13	But now you have left me again and have worshiped other gods. So I refuse to save you again. 
JDG.10.14	You have chosen those gods. So go call to them for help. Let them save you when you are in trouble.”
JDG.10.15	But the people of Israel said to the L
JDG.10.16	Then the Israelites threw away the foreign gods among them, and they worshiped the L
JDG.10.17	The Ammonites gathered for war and camped in Gilead. The Israelites gathered and camped at Mizpah. 
JDG.10.18	The leaders of the people of Gilead said, “Who will lead us to attack the Ammonites? He will become the head of all those who live in Gilead.”
JDG.11.1	Jephthah was a strong soldier from Gilead. His father was named Gilead, and his mother was a prostitute. 
JDG.11.2	Gilead’s wife had several sons. When they grew up, they forced Jephthah to leave his home, saying to him, “You will not get any of our father’s property, because you are the son of another woman.” 
JDG.11.3	So Jephthah ran away from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. There some worthless men began to follow him.
JDG.11.4	After a time the Ammonites fought against Israel. 
JDG.11.5	When the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to Jephthah to bring him back from Tob. 
JDG.11.6	They said to him, “Come and lead our army so we can fight the Ammonites.”
JDG.11.7	But Jephthah said to them, “Didn’t you hate me? You forced me to leave my father’s house. Why are you coming to me now that you are in trouble?”
JDG.11.8	The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “It is because of those troubles that we come to you now. Please come with us and fight against the Ammonites. You will be the ruler over everyone who lives in Gilead.”
JDG.11.9	Then Jephthah answered, “If you take me back to Gilead to fight the Ammonites and the L
JDG.11.10	The elders of Gilead said to him, “The L
JDG.11.11	So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their leader and commander of their army. Jephthah repeated all of his words in front of the L
JDG.11.12	Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, asking, “What have you got against Israel? Why have you come to attack our land?”
JDG.11.13	The king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, “We are fighting Israel because you took our land when you came up from Egypt. You took our land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River to the Jordan River. Now give our land back to us peacefully.”
JDG.11.14	Jephthah sent the messengers to the Ammonite king again. 
JDG.11.15	They said:
JDG.11.15	“This is what Jephthah says: Israel did not take the land of the people of Moab or Ammon. 
JDG.11.16	When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they went into the desert to the Red Sea and then to Kadesh. 
JDG.11.17	Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Let the people of Israel go across your land.’ But the king of Edom refused. We sent the same message to the king of Moab, but he also refused. So the Israelites stayed at Kadesh.
JDG.11.18	“Then the Israelites went into the desert around the borders of the lands of Edom and Moab. Israel went east of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon River, the border of Moab. They did not cross it to go into the land of Moab.
JDG.11.19	“Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of the city of Heshbon, asking, ‘Let the people of Israel pass through your land to go to our land.’ 
JDG.11.20	But Sihon did not trust the Israelites to cross his land. So he gathered all of his people and camped at Jahaz and fought with Israel.
JDG.11.21	“But the L
JDG.11.22	So Israel took all the land of the Amorites from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River, from the desert to the Jordan River.
JDG.11.23	“It was the L

JDG.11.25	“Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever quarrel or fight with the people of Israel? 
JDG.11.26	For three hundred years the Israelites have lived in Heshbon and Aroer and the towns around them and in all the cities along the Arnon River. Why have you not taken these cities back in all that time? 
JDG.11.27	I have not sinned against you, but you are sinning against me by making war on me. May the L
JDG.11.28	But the king of the Ammonites ignored this message from Jephthah.

JDG.11.31	I will give you as a burnt offering the first thing that comes out of my house to meet me when I return from the victory. It will be the L
JDG.11.32	Then Jephthah went over to fight the Ammonites, and the L
JDG.11.33	In a great defeat Jephthah struck them down from the city of Aroer to the area of Minnith, and twenty cities as far as the city of Abel Keramim. So the Ammonites were defeated by the Israelites.
JDG.11.34	When Jephthah returned to his home in Mizpah, his daughter was the first one to come out to meet him, playing a tambourine and dancing. She was his only child; he had no other sons or daughters. 
JDG.11.35	When Jephthah saw his daughter, he tore his clothes to show his sorrow. He said, “My daughter! You have made me so sad because I made a promise to the L
JDG.11.36	Then his daughter said, “Father, you made a promise to the L
JDG.11.37	She also said, “But let me do one thing. Let me be alone for two months to go to the mountains. Since I will never marry, let me and my friends go and cry together.”
JDG.11.38	Jephthah said, “Go.” So he sent her away for two months. She and her friends stayed in the mountains and cried for her because she would never marry. 
JDG.11.39	After two months she returned to her father, and Jephthah did to her what he had promised. Jephthah’s daughter never had a husband.
JDG.11.39	From this came a custom in Israel that 
JDG.11.40	every year the young women of Israel would go out for four days to remember the daughter of Jephthah from Gilead.
JDG.12.1	The men of Ephraim called all their soldiers together and crossed the river to the town of Zaphon. They said to Jephthah, “Why didn’t you call us to help you fight the Ammonites? We will burn your house down with you in it.”
JDG.12.2	Jephthah answered them, “My people and I fought a great battle against the Ammonites. I called you, but you didn’t come to help me. 
JDG.12.3	When I saw that you would not help me, I risked my own life and went against the Ammonites. The L
JDG.12.4	Then Jephthah called the men of Gilead together and fought the men of Ephraim. The men of Gilead struck them down because the Ephraimites had said, “You men of Gilead are nothing but deserters from Ephraim—living between Ephraim and Manasseh.” 
JDG.12.5	The men of Gilead captured the crossings of the Jordan River that led to the country of Ephraim. A person from Ephraim trying to escape would say, “Let me cross the river.” Then the men of Gilead would ask him, “Are you from Ephraim?” If he replied no, 
JDG.12.6	they would say to him, “Say the word ‘Shibboleth.’ ” The men of Ephraim could not say that word correctly. So if the person from Ephraim said, “Sibboleth,” the men of Gilead would kill him at the crossing. So forty-two thousand people from Ephraim were killed at that time.
JDG.12.7	Jephthah was a judge for Israel for six years. Then Jephthah, the man from Gilead, died and was buried in a town in Gilead.
JDG.12.8	After Jephthah died, Ibzan from Bethlehem was a judge for Israel. 
JDG.12.9	He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He let his daughters marry men who were not in his family group, and he brought thirty women who were not in his tribe to be wives for his sons. Ibzan judged Israel for seven years. 
JDG.12.10	Then he died and was buried in Bethlehem.
JDG.12.11	After Ibzan died, Elon from the tribe of Zebulun was a judge for Israel. He judged Israel for ten years. 
JDG.12.12	Then Elon, the man of Zebulun, died and was buried in the city of Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.
JDG.12.13	After Elon died, Abdon son of Hillel from the city of Pirathon was a judge for Israel. 
JDG.12.14	He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years. 
JDG.12.15	Then Abdon son of Hillel died and was buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mountains where the Amalekites lived.
JDG.13.1	Again the people of Israel did what the L
JDG.13.2	There was a man named Manoah from the tribe of Dan, who lived in the city of Zorah. He had a wife, but she could not have children. 
JDG.13.3	The angel of the L
JDG.13.4	Be careful not to drink wine or beer or eat anything that is unclean, 
JDG.13.5	because you will become pregnant and have a son. You must never cut his hair, because he will be a Nazirite, given to God from birth. He will begin to save Israel from the power of the Philistines.”
JDG.13.6	Then Manoah’s wife went to him and told him what had happened. She said, “A man from God came to me. He looked like an angel from God; his appearance was frightening. I didn’t ask him where he was from, and he didn’t tell me his name. 
JDG.13.7	But he said to me, ‘You will become pregnant and will have a son. Don’t drink wine or beer or eat anything that is unclean, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from his birth until the day of his death.’ ”
JDG.13.8	Then Manoah prayed to the L
JDG.13.9	God heard Manoah’s prayer, and the angel of God came to Manoah’s wife again while she was sitting in the field. But her husband Manoah was not with her. 
JDG.13.10	So she ran to tell him, “He is here! The man who appeared to me the other day is here!”
JDG.13.11	Manoah got up and followed his wife. When he came to the man, he said, “Are you the man who spoke to my wife?”
JDG.13.11	The man said, “I am.”
JDG.13.12	So Manoah asked, “When what you say happens, what kind of life should the boy live? What should he do?”
JDG.13.13	The angel of the L
JDG.13.14	She must not eat anything that grows on a grapevine, or drink any wine or beer, or eat anything that is unclean. She must do everything I have commanded her.”
JDG.13.15	Manoah said to the angel of the L
JDG.13.16	The angel of the L
JDG.13.17	Then Manoah asked the angel of the L
JDG.13.18	The angel of the L
JDG.13.19	So Manoah sacrificed a young goat on a rock and offered some grain as a gift to the L

JDG.13.22	Manoah said, “We have seen God, so we will surely die.”
JDG.13.23	But his wife said to him, “If the L

JDG.13.25	The Spirit of the L
JDG.14.1	Samson went down to the city of Timnah where he saw a Philistine woman. 
JDG.14.2	When he returned home, he said to his father and mother, “I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah. I want you to get her for me so I can marry her.”
JDG.14.3	His father and mother answered, “Surely there is a woman from Israel you can marry. Do you have to marry a woman from the Philistines, who are not circumcised?”
JDG.14.3	But Samson said, “Get that woman for me! She is the one I want!” 
JDG.14.4	(Samson’s parents did not know that the L
JDG.14.5	Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, as far as the vineyard near there. Suddenly, a young lion came roaring toward Samson! 
JDG.14.6	The Spirit of the L
JDG.14.7	Then he went down to the city and talked to the Philistine woman, and he liked her.
JDG.14.8	Several days later Samson went back to marry her. On his way he went over to look at the body of the dead lion and found a swarm of bees and honey in it. 
JDG.14.9	Samson got some of the honey with his hands and walked along eating it. When he came to his parents, he gave some to them. They ate it, too, but Samson did not tell them he had taken the honey from the body of the dead lion.
JDG.14.10	Samson’s father went down to see the Philistine woman. And Samson gave a feast, as was the custom for the bridegroom. 
JDG.14.11	When the people saw him, they sent thirty friends to be with him.
JDG.14.12	Samson said to them, “Let me tell you a riddle. Try to find the answer during the seven days of the feast. If you can, I will give you thirty linen shirts and thirty changes of clothes. 
JDG.14.13	But if you can’t, you must give me thirty linen shirts and thirty changes of clothes.”
JDG.14.13	So they said, “Tell us your riddle so we can hear it.”
JDG.14.14	Samson said,
JDG.14.14	“Out of the eater comes something to eat.
JDG.14.14	Out of the strong comes something sweet.”
JDG.14.14	After three days, they had not found the answer.
JDG.14.15	On the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Did you invite us here to make us poor? Trick your husband into telling us the answer to the riddle. If you don’t, we will burn you and everyone in your father’s house.”
JDG.14.16	So Samson’s wife went to him, crying, and said, “You hate me! You don’t really love me! You told my people a riddle, but you won’t tell me the answer.”
JDG.14.16	Samson said, “I haven’t even told my father or mother. Why should I tell you?”
JDG.14.17	Samson’s wife cried for the rest of the seven days of the feast. So he finally gave her the answer on the seventh day, because she kept bothering him. Then she told her people the answer to the riddle.
JDG.14.18	Before sunset on the seventh day of the feast, the Philistine men had the answer. They came to Samson and said,
JDG.14.18	“What is sweeter than honey?
JDG.14.18	What is stronger than a lion?”
JDG.14.18	Then Samson said to them,
JDG.14.18	“If you had not plowed with my young cow,
JDG.14.18	you would not have solved my riddle!”
JDG.14.19	Then the Spirit of the L
JDG.14.20	And Samson’s wife was given to his best man.
JDG.15.1	At the time of the wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife, taking a young goat with him. He said, “I’m going to my wife’s room,” but her father would not let him go in.
JDG.15.2	He said to Samson, “I thought you really hated your wife, so I gave her to your best man. Her younger sister is more beautiful. Take her instead.”
JDG.15.3	But Samson said to them, “This time no one will blame me for hurting you Philistines!” 
JDG.15.4	So Samson went out and caught three hundred foxes. He took two foxes at a time, tied their tails together, and then tied a torch to the tails of each pair of foxes. 
JDG.15.5	After he lit the torches, he let the foxes loose in the grainfields of the Philistines so that he burned up their standing grain, the piles of grain, their vineyards, and their olive trees.
JDG.15.6	The Philistines asked, “Who did this?”
JDG.15.6	Someone told them, “Samson, the son-in-law of the man from Timnah, did because his father-in-law gave his wife to his best man.”
JDG.15.6	So the Philistines burned Samson’s wife and her father to death. 
JDG.15.7	Then Samson said to the Philistines, “Since you did this, I won’t stop until I pay you back!” 
JDG.15.8	Samson attacked the Philistines and killed many of them. Then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of Etam.
JDG.15.9	The Philistines went up and camped in the land of Judah, near a place named Lehi. 
JDG.15.10	The men of Judah asked them, “Why have you come here to fight us?”
JDG.15.10	They answered, “We have come to make Samson our prisoner, to pay him back for what he did to our people.”
JDG.15.11	Then three thousand men of Judah went to the cave in the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “What have you done to us? Don’t you know that the Philistines rule over us?”
JDG.15.11	Samson answered, “I only paid them back for what they did to me.”
JDG.15.12	Then they said to him, “We have come to tie you up and to hand you over to the Philistines.”
JDG.15.12	Samson said to them, “Promise me you will not hurt me yourselves.”
JDG.15.13	The men from Judah said, “We agree. We will just tie you up and give you to the Philistines. We will not kill you.” So they tied Samson with two new ropes and led him up from the cave in the rock. 
JDG.15.14	When Samson came to the place named Lehi, the Philistines came to meet him, shouting for joy. Then the Spirit of the L
JDG.15.15	Samson found the jawbone of a dead donkey, took it, and killed a thousand men with it!
JDG.15.16	Then Samson said,
JDG.15.16	“With a donkey’s jawbone
JDG.15.16	I made donkeys out of them.
JDG.15.16	With a donkey’s jawbone
JDG.15.16	I killed a thousand men!”
JDG.15.17	When he finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone. So that place was named Ramath Lehi.
JDG.15.18	Samson was very thirsty, so he cried out to the L
JDG.15.19	Then God opened up a hole in the ground at Lehi, and water came out. When Samson drank, he felt better; he felt strong again. So he named that spring Caller’s Spring, which is still in Lehi.
JDG.15.20	Samson judged Israel for twenty years in the days of the Philistines.
JDG.16.1	One day Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute there. He went in to spend the night with her. 
JDG.16.2	When the people of Gaza heard, “Samson has come here!” they surrounded the place and waited for him near the city gate all night. They whispered to each other, “When dawn comes, we will kill Samson!”
JDG.16.3	But Samson only stayed with the prostitute until midnight. Then he got up and took hold of the doors and the two posts of the city gate and tore them loose, along with the bar. He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces the city of Hebron.
JDG.16.4	After this, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the Valley of Sorek. 
JDG.16.5	The Philistine rulers went to Delilah and said, “Find out what makes Samson so strong. Trick him into telling you how we can overpower him and capture him and tie him up. If you do this, each one of us will give you twenty-eight pounds of silver.”
JDG.16.6	So Delilah said to Samson, “Tell me why you are so strong. How can someone tie you up and capture you?”
JDG.16.7	Samson answered, “Someone would have to tie me up with seven new bowstrings that have not been dried. Then I would be as weak as any other man.”
JDG.16.8	The Philistine rulers brought Delilah seven new bowstrings that had not been dried, and she tied Samson with them. 
JDG.16.9	Some men were hiding in another room. Delilah said to him, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” But Samson broke the bowstrings like pieces of burned string. So the Philistines did not find out the secret of Samson’s strength.
JDG.16.10	Then Delilah said to Samson, “You made a fool of me. You lied to me. Now tell me how someone can tie you up.”
JDG.16.11	Samson said, “They would have to tie me with new ropes that have not been used before. Then I would become as weak as any other man.”
JDG.16.12	So Delilah took new ropes and tied Samson. Some men were hiding in another room. She called out to him, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” But he broke the ropes as easily as if they were threads.
JDG.16.13	Then Delilah said to Samson, “Again you have made a fool of me. You lied to me. Tell me how someone can tie you up.”
JDG.16.13	He said, “Using the loom, weave the seven braids of my hair into the cloth, and tighten it with a pin. Then I will be as weak as any other man.”
JDG.16.13	While Samson slept, Delilah wove the seven braids of his hair into the cloth. 
JDG.16.14	Then she fastened it with a pin.
JDG.16.14	Again she said to him, “Samson, the Philistines are here!” Samson woke up and pulled out the pin and the loom with the cloth.
JDG.16.15	Then Delilah said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when you don’t even trust me? This is the third time you have made a fool of me. You haven’t told me the secret of your great strength.” 
JDG.16.16	She kept bothering Samson about his secret day after day until he felt he was going to die!
JDG.16.17	So he told her everything. He said, “I have never had my hair cut, because I have been set apart to God as a Nazirite since I was born. If someone shaved my head, I would lose my strength and be as weak as any other man.”
JDG.16.18	When Delilah saw that he had told her everything sincerely, she sent a message to the Philistine rulers. She said, “Come back one more time, because he has told me everything.” So the Philistine rulers came back to Delilah and brought the silver with them. 
JDG.16.19	Delilah got Samson to sleep, lying in her lap. Then she called in a man to shave off the seven braids of Samson’s hair. In this way she began to make him weak, and his strength left him.
JDG.16.20	Then she said, “Samson, the Philistines are here!”
JDG.16.20	He woke up and thought, “I’ll leave as I did before and shake myself free.” But he did not know that the L
JDG.16.21	Then the Philistines captured Samson and tore out his eyes. They took him down to Gaza, where they put bronze chains on him and made him grind grain in the prison. 
JDG.16.22	But his hair began to grow again.
JDG.16.23	The Philistine rulers gathered to celebrate and to offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They said, “Our god has handed Samson our enemy over to us.” 
JDG.16.24	When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying,
JDG.16.24	“This man destroyed our country.
JDG.16.24	He killed many of us!
JDG.16.24	But our god handed over
JDG.16.24	our enemy to us.”
JDG.16.25	While the people were enjoying the celebration, they said, “Bring Samson out to perform for us.” So they brought Samson from the prison, and he performed for them. They made him stand between the pillars. 
JDG.16.26	Samson said to the servant holding his hand, “Let me feel the pillars that hold up the temple so I can lean against them.” 
JDG.16.27	Now the temple was full of men and women. All the Philistine rulers were there, and about three thousand men and women were on the roof watching Samson perform. 
JDG.16.28	Then Samson prayed to the L
JDG.16.29	Then Samson turned to the two center pillars that supported the whole temple. He braced himself between the two pillars, with his right hand on one and his left hand on the other. 
JDG.16.30	Samson said, “Let me die with these Philistines!” Then he pushed as hard as he could, causing the temple to fall on the rulers and all the people in it. So Samson killed more of the Philistines when he died than when he was alive.
JDG.16.31	Samson’s brothers and his whole family went down to get his body. They brought him back and buried him in the tomb of Manoah, his father, between the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol. Samson was a judge for the people of Israel for twenty years.
JDG.17.1	There was a man named Micah who lived in the mountains of Ephraim. 
JDG.17.2	He said to his mother, “I heard you speak a curse about the twenty-eight pounds of silver that were taken from you. I have the silver with me; I took it.”
JDG.17.2	His mother said, “The L
JDG.17.3	Micah gave the twenty-eight pounds of silver to his mother. Then she said, “I will give this silver to the L
JDG.17.4	When he gave the silver back to his mother, she took about five pounds and gave it to a silversmith. With it he made an idol and a statue, which stood in Micah’s house. 
JDG.17.5	Micah had a special holy place, and he made a holy vest and some household idols. Then Micah chose one of his sons to be his priest. 
JDG.17.6	At that time Israel did not have a king, so everyone did what seemed right.
JDG.17.7	There was a young man who was a Levite from the city of Bethlehem in Judah who was from the people of Judah. 
JDG.17.8	He left Bethlehem to look for another place to live, and on his way he came to Micah’s house in the mountains of Ephraim. 
JDG.17.9	Micah asked him, “Where are you from?”
JDG.17.9	He answered, “I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I’m looking for a place to live.”
JDG.17.10	Micah said to him, “Live with me and be my father and my priest. I will give you four ounces of silver each year and clothes and food.” So the Levite went in. 
JDG.17.11	He agreed to live with Micah and became like one of Micah’s own sons. 
JDG.17.12	Micah made him a priest, and he lived in Micah’s house. 
JDG.17.13	Then Micah said, “Now I know the L
JDG.18.1	At that time Israel did not have a king. And at that time the tribe of Dan was still looking for a land where they could live, a land of their own. The Danites had not yet been given their own land among the tribes of Israel. 
JDG.18.2	So, from their family groups, they chose five soldiers from the cities of Zorah and Eshtaol to spy out and explore the land. They were told, “Go, explore the land.”
JDG.18.2	They came to the mountains of Ephraim, to Micah’s house, where they spent the night. 
JDG.18.3	When they came near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. So they stopped there and asked him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing here? Why are you here?”
JDG.18.4	He told them what Micah had done for him, saying, “He hired me. I am his priest.”
JDG.18.5	They said to him, “Please ask God if our journey will be successful.”
JDG.18.6	The priest said to them, “Go in peace. The L
JDG.18.7	So the five men left. When they came to the city of Laish, they saw that the people there lived in safety, like the people of Sidon. They thought they were safe and had plenty of everything. They lived a long way from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone else.
JDG.18.8	When the five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their relatives asked them, “What did you find?”
JDG.18.9	They answered, “We have seen the land, and it is very good. We should attack them. Aren’t you going to do something? Don’t wait! Let’s go and take that land! 
JDG.18.10	When you go, you will see there is plenty of land—plenty of everything! The people are not expecting an attack. Surely God has handed that land over to us!”
JDG.18.11	So six hundred Danites left Zorah and Eshtaol ready for war. 
JDG.18.12	On their way they set up camp near the city of Kiriath Jearim in Judah. That is why the place west of Kiriath Jearim is named Mahaneh Dan to this day. 
JDG.18.13	From there they traveled on to the mountains of Ephraim. Then they came to Micah’s house.
JDG.18.14	The five men who had explored the land around Laish said to their relatives, “Do you know in one of these houses there are a holy vest, household gods, an idol, and a statue? You know what to do.” 
JDG.18.15	So they stopped at the Levite’s house, which was also Micah’s house, and greeted the Levite. 
JDG.18.16	The six hundred Danites stood at the entrance gate, wearing their weapons of war. 
JDG.18.17	The five spies went into the house and took the idol, the holy vest, the household idols, and the statue. The priest and the six hundred men armed for war stood by the entrance gate.
JDG.18.18	When the spies went into Micah’s house and took the image, the holy vest, the household idols, and the statue, the priest asked them, “What are you doing?”
JDG.18.19	They answered, “Be quiet! Don’t say a word. Come with us and be our father and priest. Is it better for you to be a priest for one man’s house or for a tribe and family group in Israel?” 
JDG.18.20	This made the priest happy. So he took the holy vest, the household idols, and the idol and went with the Danites. 
JDG.18.21	They left Micah’s house, putting their little children, their animals, and everything they owned in front of them.
JDG.18.22	When they had gone a little way from Micah’s house, the men who lived near Micah were called out and caught up with them. 
JDG.18.23	The men with Micah shouted at the Danites, who turned around and said to Micah, “What’s the matter with you? Why have you been called out to fight?”
JDG.18.24	Micah answered, “You took my gods that I made and my priest. What do I have left? How can you ask me, ‘What’s the matter?’ ”
JDG.18.25	The Danites answered, “You should not argue with us. Some of our angry men might attack you, killing you and your family.” 
JDG.18.26	Then the Danites went on their way. Micah knew they were too strong for him, so he turned and went back home.
JDG.18.27	Then the Danites took what Micah had made and his priest and went on to Laish. They attacked those peaceful people and killed them with their swords and then burned the city. 
JDG.18.28	There was no one to save the people of Laish. They lived too far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone else. Laish was in a valley near Beth Rehob.
JDG.18.28	The people of Dan rebuilt the city and lived there. 
JDG.18.29	They changed the name of Laish to Dan, naming it for their ancestor Dan, one of the sons of Israel.
JDG.18.30	The people of Dan set up the idols in the city of Dan. Jonathan son of Gershom, Moses’ son, and his sons served as priests for the tribe of Dan until the land was captured. 
JDG.18.31	The people of Dan set up the idols Micah had made as long as the Holy Tent of God was in Shiloh.
JDG.19.1	At that time Israel did not have a king.
JDG.19.1	There was a Levite who lived in the faraway mountains of Ephraim. He had taken a slave woman from the city of Bethlehem in the land of Judah to live with him, 
JDG.19.2	but she was unfaithful to him. She left him and went back to her father’s house in Bethlehem in Judah and stayed there for four months. 
JDG.19.3	Then her husband went to ask her to come back to him, taking with him his servant and two donkeys. When the Levite came to her father’s house, she invited him to come in, and her father was happy to see him. 
JDG.19.4	The father-in-law, the young woman’s father, asked him to stay. So he stayed for three days and ate, drank, and slept there.
JDG.19.5	On the fourth day they got up early in the morning. The Levite was getting ready to leave, but the woman’s father said to his son-in-law, “Refresh yourself by eating something. Then go.” 
JDG.19.6	So the two men sat down to eat and drink together. After that, the father said to him, “Please stay tonight. Relax and enjoy yourself.” 
JDG.19.7	When the man got up to go, his father-in-law asked him to stay. So he stayed again that night. 
JDG.19.8	On the fifth day the man got up early in the morning to leave. The woman’s father said, “Refresh yourself. Wait until this afternoon.” So the two men ate together.
JDG.19.9	When the Levite, his slave woman, and his servant got up to leave, the father-in-law, the young woman’s father, said, “It’s almost night. The day is almost gone. Spend the night here and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow morning you can get up early and go home.” 
JDG.19.10	But the Levite did not want to stay another night. So he took his two saddled donkeys and his slave woman and traveled toward the city of Jebus (also called Jerusalem).
JDG.19.11	As the day was almost over, they came near Jebus. So the servant said to his master, “Let’s stop at this city of the Jebusites, and spend the night here.”
JDG.19.12	But his master said, “No. We won’t go inside a foreign city. Those people are not Israelites. We will go on to the city of Gibeah.” 
JDG.19.13	He said, “Come on. Let’s try to make it to Gibeah or Ramah so we can spend the night in one of those cities.” 
JDG.19.14	So they went on. The sun went down as they came near Gibeah, which belongs to the tribe of Benjamin. 
JDG.19.15	They stopped there to spend the night. They came to the public square of the city and sat down, but no one invited them home to spend the night.
JDG.19.16	Finally, in the evening an old man came in from his work in the fields. His home was in the mountains of Ephraim, but now he was living in Gibeah. (The people of Gibeah were from the tribe of Benjamin.) 
JDG.19.17	He saw the traveler in the public square and asked, “Where are you going? Where did you come from?”
JDG.19.18	The Levite answered, “We are traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to my home in the mountains of Ephraim. I have been to Bethlehem in Judah, but now I am going to the Holy Tent of the L
JDG.19.19	We already have straw and food for our donkeys and bread and wine for me, the young woman, and my servant. We don’t need anything.”
JDG.19.20	The old man said, “You are welcome to stay at my house. Let me give you anything you need, but don’t spend the night in the public square.” 
JDG.19.21	So the old man took the Levite into his house, and he fed their donkeys. They washed their feet and had something to eat and drink.
JDG.19.22	While they were enjoying themselves, some wicked men of the city surrounded the house and beat on the door. They shouted to the old man who owned the house, “Bring out the man who came to your house. We want to have sexual relations with him.”
JDG.19.23	The owner of the house went outside and said to them, “No, my friends. Don’t be so evil. This man is a guest in my house. Don’t do this terrible thing! 
JDG.19.24	Look, here are my daughter, who has never had sexual relations before, and the man’s slave woman. I will bring them out to you now. Do anything you want with them, but don’t do such a terrible thing to this man.”
JDG.19.25	But the men would not listen to him. So the Levite took his slave woman and sent her outside to them. They forced her to have sexual relations with them, and they abused her all night long. Then, at dawn, they let her go. 
JDG.19.26	She came back to the house where her master was staying and fell down at the door and lay there until daylight.
JDG.19.27	In the morning when the Levite got up, he opened the door of the house and went outside to go on his way. But his slave woman was lying at the doorway of the house, with her hands on the doorsill. 
JDG.19.28	The Levite said to her, “Get up; let’s go.” But she did not answer. So he put her on his donkey and went home.
JDG.19.29	When the Levite got home, he took a knife and cut his slave woman into twelve parts, limb by limb. Then he sent a part to each area of Israel. 
JDG.19.30	Everyone who saw this said, “Nothing like this has ever happened before, not since the people of Israel came out of Egypt. Think about it. Tell us what to do.”
JDG.20.1	So all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, joined together before the L
JDG.20.2	The leaders of all the tribes of Israel took their places in the meeting of the people of God. There were 400,000 soldiers with swords. 
JDG.20.3	(The people of Benjamin heard that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the Israelites said to the Levite, “Tell us how this evil thing happened.”
JDG.20.4	So the husband of the murdered woman answered, “My slave woman and I came to Gibeah in Benjamin to spend the night. 
JDG.20.5	During the night the men of Gibeah came after me. They surrounded the house and wanted to kill me. They forced my slave woman to have sexual relations and she died. 
JDG.20.6	I took her and cut her into parts and sent one part to each area of Israel because the people of Benjamin did this wicked and terrible thing in Israel. 
JDG.20.7	Now, all you Israelites, speak up. What is your decision?”
JDG.20.8	Then all the people stood up at the same time, saying, “None of us will go home. Not one of us will go back to his house! 
JDG.20.9	Now this is what we will do to Gibeah. We will throw lots. 
JDG.20.10	That way we will choose ten men from every hundred men from all the tribes of Israel, and we will choose a hundred men from every thousand, and a thousand men from every ten thousand. These will find supplies for the army. Then the army will go to the city of Gibeah of Benjamin to repay them for the terrible thing they have done in Israel.” 
JDG.20.11	So all the men of Israel were united and gathered against the city.
JDG.20.12	The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the tribe of Benjamin demanding, “What is this evil thing some of your men have done? 
JDG.20.13	Hand over the wicked men in Gibeah so that we can put them to death. We must remove this evil from Israel.”
JDG.20.13	But the Benjaminites would not listen to their fellow Israelites. 
JDG.20.14	The Benjaminites left their own cities and met at Gibeah to fight the Israelites. 
JDG.20.15	In only one day the Benjaminites got 26,000 soldiers together who were trained with swords. They also had 700 chosen men from Gibeah. 
JDG.20.16	Seven hundred of these trained soldiers were left-handed, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss!
JDG.20.17	The Israelites, except for the Benjaminites, gathered 400,000 soldiers with swords.
JDG.20.18	The Israelites went up to the city of Bethel and asked God, “Which tribe shall be first to attack the Benjaminites?”
JDG.20.18	The L
JDG.20.19	The next morning the Israelites got up and made a camp near Gibeah. 
JDG.20.20	The men of Israel went out to fight the Benjaminites and took their battle position at Gibeah. 
JDG.20.21	Then the Benjaminites came out of Gibeah and killed 22,000 Israelites during the battle that day. 
JDG.20.22+JDG.20.23	The Israelites went before the L
JDG.20.22+JDG.20.23	The L
JDG.20.24	The Israelites came to fight the Benjaminites the second day. 
JDG.20.25	The Benjaminites came out of Gibeah to attack the Israelites. This time, the Benjaminites killed 18,000 Israelites, all of whom carried swords.
JDG.20.26	Then the Israelites went up to Bethel. There they sat down and cried to the L
JDG.20.27	The Israelites asked the L
JDG.20.28	A priest named Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, served before the Ark of the Agreement.) They asked, “Shall we go to fight our relatives, the Benjaminites, again, or shall we stop fighting?”
JDG.20.28	The L
JDG.20.29	Then the Israelites set up ambushes all around Gibeah. 
JDG.20.30	They went to fight against the Benjaminites at Gibeah on the third day, getting into position for battle as they had done before. 
JDG.20.31	When the Benjaminites came out to fight them, the Israelites backed up and led the Benjaminites away from the city. The Benjaminites began to kill some of the Israelites as they had done before. About thirty Israelites were killed—some in the fields and some on the roads leading to Bethel and to Gibeah.
JDG.20.32	The Benjaminites said, “We are winning as before!”
JDG.20.32	But the Israelites said, “Let’s run. Let’s trick them into going farther away from their city and onto the roads.”
JDG.20.33	All the Israelites moved from their places and got into battle positions at a place named Baal Tamar. Then the Israelites ran out from their hiding places west of Gibeah. 
JDG.20.34	Ten thousand of the best trained soldiers from all of Israel attacked Gibeah. The battle was very hard. The Benjaminites did not know disaster was about to come to them. 
JDG.20.35	The L
JDG.20.36	Then the Benjaminites saw that they were defeated.
JDG.20.36	The Israelites had moved back because they were depending on the surprise attack they had set up near Gibeah. 
JDG.20.37	The men in hiding rushed into Gibeah, spread out, and killed everyone in the city with their swords. 
JDG.20.38	Now the Israelites had set up a signal with the men in hiding. The men in the surprise attack were to send up a cloud of smoke from the city. 
JDG.20.39	Then the army of Israel turned around in the battle.
JDG.20.39	The Benjaminites had killed about thirty Israelites. They were saying, “We are winning, as in the first battle!” 
JDG.20.40	But then a cloud of smoke began to rise from the city. The Benjaminites turned around and saw that the whole city was going up in smoke. 
JDG.20.41	Then the Israelites turned and began to fight. The Benjaminites were terrified because they knew that disaster was coming to them. 
JDG.20.42	So the Benjaminites ran away from the Israelites toward the desert, but they could not escape the battle. And the Israelites who came out of the cities killed them. 
JDG.20.43	They surrounded the Benjaminites and chased them and caught them in the area east of Gibeah. 
JDG.20.44	So 18,000 brave Benjaminite fighters were killed. 
JDG.20.45	The Benjaminites ran toward the desert to the rock of Rimmon, but the Israelites killed 5,000 Benjaminites along the roads. They chased them as far as Gidom and killed 2,000 more Benjaminites there.
JDG.20.46	On that day 25,000 Benjaminites were killed, all of whom had fought bravely with swords. 
JDG.20.47	But 600 Benjaminites ran to the rock of Rimmon in the desert, where they stayed for four months. 
JDG.20.48	Then the Israelites went back to the land of Benjamin and killed the people in every city and also the animals and everything they could find. And they burned every city they found.
JDG.21.1	At Mizpah the men of Israel had sworn, “Not one of us will let his daughter marry a man from the tribe of Benjamin.”
JDG.21.2	The people went to the city of Bethel and sat before God until evening, crying loudly. 
JDG.21.3	They said, “L
JDG.21.4	Early the next day the people built an altar and put burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to God on it.
JDG.21.5	Then the Israelites asked, “Did any tribe of Israel not come here to meet with us in the presence of the L
JDG.21.6	The Israelites felt sorry for their relatives, the Benjaminites. They said, “Today one tribe has been cut off from Israel. 
JDG.21.7	We swore before the L
JDG.21.8	Then they asked, “Which one of the tribes of Israel did not come here to Mizpah?” They found that no one from the city of Jabesh Gilead had come. 
JDG.21.9	The people of Israel counted everyone, but there was no one from Jabesh Gilead.
JDG.21.10	So the whole group of Israelites sent twelve thousand soldiers to Jabesh Gilead to kill the people with their swords, even the women and children.
JDG.21.11	“This is what you must do: Kill every man in Jabesh Gilead and every married woman.” 
JDG.21.12	The soldiers found four hundred young unmarried women in Jabesh Gilead, so they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in Canaan.
JDG.21.13	Then the whole group of Israelites sent a message to the men of Benjamin, who were at the rock of Rimmon, offering to make peace with them. 
JDG.21.14	So the men of Benjamin came back at that time. The Israelites gave them the women from Jabesh Gilead who had not been killed, but there were not enough women.
JDG.21.15	The people of Israel felt sorry for the Benjaminites because the L
JDG.21.16	The elders of the Israelites said, “The women of Benjamin have been killed. Where can we get wives for the men of Benjamin who are still alive? 
JDG.21.17	These men must have children to continue their families so a tribe in Israel will not die out. 
JDG.21.18	But we cannot allow our daughters to marry them, because we swore, ‘Anyone who gives a wife to a man of Benjamin is cursed.’ 
JDG.21.19	We have an idea! There is a yearly festival of the L
JDG.21.20	So the elders told the men of Benjamin, “Go and hide in the vineyards. 
JDG.21.21	Watch for the young women from Shiloh to come out to join the dancing. Then run out from the vineyards and take one of the young Shiloh women and return to the land of Benjamin. 
JDG.21.22	If their fathers or brothers come to us and complain, we will say: ‘Be kind to the men of Benjamin. We did not get wives for Benjamin during the war, and you did not give the women to the men from Benjamin. So you are not guilty.’ ”
JDG.21.23	So that is what the Benjaminites did. While the young women were dancing, each man caught one of them, took her away, and married her. Then they went back to the land God had given them and rebuilt their cities and lived there.
JDG.21.24	Then the Israelites went home to their own tribes and family groups, to their own land that God had given them.
JDG.21.25	In those days Israel did not have a king. All the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes. 
RUT.1.1	Long ago when the judges ruled Israel, there was a shortage of food in the land. 
RUT.1.2	So a man named Elimelech left the town of Bethlehem in Judah to live in the country of Moab with his wife and his two sons. His wife was named Naomi, and his two sons were named Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathahites from Bethlehem in Judah. When they came to Moab, they settled there.
RUT.1.3	Then Naomi’s husband, Elimelech, died, and she was left with her two sons. 
RUT.1.4	These sons married women from Moab. One was named Orpah, and the other was named Ruth. Naomi and her sons had lived in Moab about ten years 
RUT.1.5	when Mahlon and Kilion also died. So Naomi was left alone without her husband or her two sons.
RUT.1.6	While Naomi was in Moab, she heard that the L
RUT.1.7	Naomi and her daughters-in-law left the place where they had lived and started back to the land of Judah. 
RUT.1.8	But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back home, each of you to your own mother’s house. May the L
RUT.1.9	May the L
RUT.1.9	When Naomi kissed the women good-bye, they began to cry out loud. 
RUT.1.10	They said to her, “No, we want to go with you to your people.”
RUT.1.11	But Naomi said, “My daughters, return to your own homes. Why do you want to go with me? I cannot give birth to more sons to give you new husbands; 
RUT.1.12	go back, my daughters, to your own homes. I am too old to have another husband. Even if I told myself, ‘I still have hope’ and had another husband tonight, and even if I had more sons, 
RUT.1.13	should you wait until they were grown into men? Should you live for so many years without husbands? Don’t do that, my daughters. My life is much too sad for you to share, because the L
RUT.1.14	The women cried together out loud again. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law Naomi good-bye, but Ruth held on to her tightly.
RUT.1.15	Naomi said to Ruth, “Look, your sister-in-law is going back to her own people and her own gods. Go back with her.”
RUT.1.16	But Ruth said, “Don’t beg me to leave you or to stop following you. Where you go, I will go. Where you live, I will live. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. 
RUT.1.17	And where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. I ask the L
RUT.1.18	When Naomi saw that Ruth had firmly made up her mind to go with her, she stopped arguing with her. 
RUT.1.19	So Naomi and Ruth went on until they came to the town of Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, all the people became very excited. The women of the town said, “Is this really Naomi?”
RUT.1.20	Naomi answered the people, “Don’t call me Naomi. Call me Mara, because the Almighty has made my life very sad. 
RUT.1.21	When I left, I had all I wanted, but now, the L
RUT.1.22	So Naomi and her daughter-in-law Ruth, the Moabite, returned from Moab and arrived at Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
RUT.2.1	Now Naomi had a rich relative named Boaz, from Elimelech’s family.
RUT.2.2	One day Ruth, the Moabite, said to Naomi, “I am going to the fields. Maybe someone will be kind enough to let me gather the grain he leaves behind.”
RUT.2.2	Naomi said, “Go, my daughter.”
RUT.2.3	So Ruth went to the fields and gathered the grain that the workers cutting the grain had left behind. It just so happened that the field belonged to Boaz, from Elimelech’s family.
RUT.2.4	Soon Boaz came from Bethlehem and greeted his workers, “The L
RUT.2.4	And the workers answered, “May the L
RUT.2.5	Then Boaz asked his servant in charge of the workers, “Whose girl is that?”
RUT.2.6	The servant answered, “She is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. 
RUT.2.7	She said, ‘Please let me follow the workers cutting grain and gather what they leave behind.’ She came and has remained here, from morning until just now. She has stopped only a few moments to rest in the shelter.”
RUT.2.8	Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen, my daughter. Don’t go to gather grain for yourself in another field. Don’t even leave this field at all, but continue following closely behind my women workers. 
RUT.2.9	Watch to see into which fields they go to cut grain and follow them. I have warned the young men not to bother you. When you are thirsty, you may go and drink from the water jugs that the young men have filled.”
RUT.2.10	Then Ruth bowed low with her face to the ground and said to him, “I am not an Israelite. Why have you been so kind to notice me?”
RUT.2.11	Boaz answered her, “I know about all the help you have given your mother-in-law after your husband died. You left your father and mother and your own country to come to a nation where you did not know anyone. 
RUT.2.12	May the L
RUT.2.13	Then Ruth said, “I hope I can continue to please you, sir. You have said kind and encouraging words to me, your servant, though I am not one of your servants.”
RUT.2.14	At mealtime Boaz told Ruth, “Come here. Eat some of our bread and dip it in our sauce.”
RUT.2.14	So Ruth sat down beside the workers. Boaz handed her some roasted grain, and she ate until she was full; she even had some food left over. 
RUT.2.15	When Ruth rose and went back to work, Boaz commanded his workers, “Let her gather even around the piles of cut grain. Don’t tell her to go away. 
RUT.2.16	In fact, drop some full heads of grain for her from what you have in your hands, and let her gather them. Don’t tell her to stop.”
RUT.2.17	So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening. Then she separated the grain from the chaff, and there was about one-half bushel of barley. 
RUT.2.18	Ruth carried the grain into town, and her mother-in-law saw how much she had gathered. Ruth also took out the food that was left over from lunch and gave it to Naomi.
RUT.2.19	Naomi asked her, “Where did you gather all this grain today? Where did you work? Blessed be whoever noticed you!”
RUT.2.19	Ruth told her mother-in-law whose field she had worked in. She said, “The man I worked with today is named Boaz.”
RUT.2.20	Naomi told her daughter-in-law, “The L
RUT.2.21	Then Ruth, the Moabite, said, “Boaz also told me, ‘Keep close to my workers until they have finished my whole harvest.’ ”
RUT.2.22	But Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “It is better for you to continue working with his women workers. If you work in another field, someone might hurt you.” 
RUT.2.23	So Ruth continued working closely with the workers of Boaz, gathering grain until the barley harvest and the wheat harvest were finished. And she continued to live with Naomi, her mother-in-law.
RUT.3.1	Then Naomi, Ruth’s mother-in-law, said to her, “My daughter, I must find a suitable home for you, one that will be good for you. 
RUT.3.2	Now Boaz, whose young women you worked with, is our close relative. Tonight he will be working at the threshing floor. 
RUT.3.3	Wash yourself, put on perfume, change your clothes, and go down to the threshing floor. But don’t let him know you’re there until he has finished his dinner. 
RUT.3.4	Watch him so you will know where he lies down to sleep. When he lies down, go and lift the cover off his feet and lie down. He will tell you what you should do.”
RUT.3.5	Then Ruth answered, “I will do everything you say.”
RUT.3.6	So Ruth went down to the threshing floor and did all her mother-in-law told her to do. 
RUT.3.7	After his evening meal, Boaz felt good and went to sleep lying beside the pile of grain. Ruth went to him quietly and lifted the cover from his feet and lay down.
RUT.3.8	About midnight Boaz was startled and rolled over. There was a woman lying near his feet! 
RUT.3.9	Boaz asked, “Who are you?”
RUT.3.9	She said, “I am Ruth, your servant girl. Spread your cover over me, because you are a relative who is supposed to take care of me.”
RUT.3.10	Then Boaz said, “The L
RUT.3.11	Now, my daughter, don’t be afraid. I will do everything you ask, because all the people in our town know you are a good woman. 
RUT.3.12	It is true that I am a relative who is to take care of you, but you have a closer relative than I. 
RUT.3.13	Stay here tonight, and in the morning we will see if he will take care of you. If he decides to take care of you, that is fine. But if he refuses, I will take care of you myself, as surely as the L
RUT.3.14	So Ruth stayed near his feet until morning but got up while it was still too dark to recognize anyone. Boaz thought, “People in town must not know that the woman came here to the threshing floor.” 
RUT.3.15	So Boaz said to Ruth, “Bring me your shawl and hold it open.”
RUT.3.15	So Ruth held her shawl open, and Boaz poured six portions of barley into it. Boaz then put it on her head and went back to the city.
RUT.3.16	When Ruth went back to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, “How did you do, my daughter?”
RUT.3.16	Ruth told Naomi everything that Boaz did for her. 
RUT.3.17	She said, “Boaz gave me these six portions of barley, saying, ‘You must not go home without a gift for your mother-in-law.’ ”
RUT.3.18	Naomi answered, “Ruth, my daughter, wait here until you see what happens. Boaz will not rest until he has finished doing what he should do today.”
RUT.4.1	Boaz went to the city gate and sat there until the close relative he had mentioned passed by. Boaz called to him, “Come here, friend, and sit down.” So the man came over and sat down. 
RUT.4.2	Boaz gathered ten of the elders of the city and told them, “Sit down here!” So they sat down.
RUT.4.3	Then Boaz said to the close relative, “Naomi, who has come back from the country of Moab, wants to sell the piece of land that belonged to our relative Elimelech. 
RUT.4.4	So I decided to tell you about it: If you want to buy back the land, then buy it in front of the people who are sitting here and in front of the elders of my people. But if you don’t want to buy it, tell me, because you are the only one who can buy it, and I am next after you.”
RUT.4.4	The close relative answered, “I will buy back the land.”
RUT.4.5	Then Boaz explained, “When you buy the land from Naomi, you must also marry Ruth, the Moabite, the dead man’s wife. That way, the land will stay in the dead man’s name.”
RUT.4.6	The close relative answered, “I can’t buy back the land. If I did, I might harm what I can pass on to my own sons. I cannot buy the land back, so buy it yourself.”
RUT.4.7	Long ago in Israel when people traded or bought back something, one person took off his sandal and gave it to the other person. This was the proof of ownership in Israel.
RUT.4.8	So the close relative said to Boaz, “Buy the land yourself,” and he took off his sandal.
RUT.4.9	Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses today. I am buying from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech and Kilion and Mahlon. 
RUT.4.10	I am also taking Ruth, the Moabite who was the wife of Mahlon, as my wife. I am doing this so her dead husband’s property will stay in his name and his name will not be separated from his family and his hometown. You are witnesses today.”
RUT.4.11	So all the people and elders who were at the city gate said, “We are witnesses. May the L
RUT.4.12	As Tamar gave birth to Judah’s son Perez, may the L
RUT.4.13	So Boaz took Ruth home as his wife and had sexual relations with her. The L
RUT.4.14	The women told Naomi, “Praise the L
RUT.4.15	He will give you new life and will take care of you in your old age because of your daughter-in-law who loves you. She is better for you than seven sons, because she has given birth to your grandson.”
RUT.4.16	Naomi took the boy, held him in her arms, and cared for him. 
RUT.4.17	The neighbors gave the boy his name, saying, “This boy was born for Naomi.” They named him Obed. Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David.
RUT.4.18	This is the family history of Perez, the father of Hezron. 
RUT.4.19	Hezron was the father of Ram, who was the father of Amminadab. 
RUT.4.20	Amminadab was the father of Nahshon, who was the father of Salmon. 
RUT.4.21	Salmon was the father of Boaz, who was the father of Obed. 
RUT.4.22	Obed was the father of Jesse, and Jesse was the father of David.
1SA.1.1	There was a man named Elkanah son of Jeroham from Ramathaim in the mountains of Ephraim. Elkanah was from the family of Zuph. (Jeroham was Elihu’s son. Elihu was Tohu’s son, and Tohu was the son of Zuph from the family group of Ephraim.) 
1SA.1.2	Elkanah had two wives named Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.
1SA.1.3	Every year Elkanah left his town of Ramah and went up to Shiloh to worship the L
1SA.1.4	When Elkanah offered sacrifices, he always gave a share of the meat to his wife Peninnah and to her sons and daughters. 
1SA.1.5	But Elkanah always gave a special share of the meat to Hannah, because he loved Hannah and because the L

1SA.1.9	Once, after they had eaten their meal in Shiloh, Hannah got up. Now Eli the priest was sitting on a chair near the entrance to the L
1SA.1.10	Hannah was so sad that she cried and prayed to the L
1SA.1.11	She made a promise, saying, “L
1SA.1.12	While Hannah kept praying, Eli watched her mouth. 
1SA.1.13	She was praying in her heart so her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Eli thought she was drunk 
1SA.1.14	and said to her, “Stop getting drunk! Throw away your wine!”
1SA.1.15	Hannah answered, “No, sir, I have not drunk any wine or beer. I am a deeply troubled woman, and I was telling the L
1SA.1.16	Don’t think I am an evil woman. I have been praying because I have many troubles and am very sad.”
1SA.1.17	Eli answered, “Go! I wish you well. May the God of Israel give you what you asked of him.”
1SA.1.18	Hannah said, “May I always please you.” When she left and ate something, she was not sad anymore.
1SA.1.19	Early the next morning Elkanah’s family got up and worshiped the L

1SA.2.11	Then Elkanah went home to Ramah, but the boy continued to serve the L
1SA.2.12	Now Eli’s sons were evil men; they did not care about the L
1SA.2.13	This is what the priests would normally do to the people: Every time someone brought a sacrifice, the meat would be cooked in a pot. The priest’s servant would then come carrying a fork that had three prongs. 
1SA.2.14	He would plunge the fork into the pot or the kettle. Whatever the fork brought out of the pot belonged to the priest. But this is how they treated all the Israelites who came to Shiloh to offer sacrifices. 
1SA.2.15	Even before the fat was burned, the priest’s servant would come to the person offering sacrifices and say, “Give the priest some meat to roast. He won’t accept boiled meat from you, only raw meat.”
1SA.2.16	If the one who offered the sacrifice said, “Let the fat be burned up first as usual, and then take anything you want,” the priest’s servant would answer, “No, give me the meat now. If you don’t, I’ll take it by force.”
1SA.2.17	The L
1SA.2.18	But Samuel obeyed the L
1SA.2.19	Every year Samuel’s mother made a little coat for him and took it to him when she went with her husband to Shiloh for the sacrifice.

1SA.2.22	Now Eli was very old. He heard about everything his sons were doing to all the Israelites and how his sons had sexual relations with the women who served at the entrance to the Meeting Tent. 
1SA.2.23	Eli said to his sons, “Why do you do these evil things that the people tell me about? 
1SA.2.24	No, my sons. The L
1SA.2.25	If you sin against someone, God can help you. But if you sin against the L

1SA.2.27	A man of God came to Eli and said, “This is what the L
1SA.2.28	I chose them from all the tribes of Israel to be my priests. I wanted them to go up to my altar, to burn incense, and to wear the holy vest. I also let the family of your ancestor have part of all the offerings sacrificed by the Israelites. 
1SA.2.29	So why don’t you respect the sacrifices and gifts? You honor your sons more than me. You grow fat on the best parts of the meat the Israelites bring to me.’
1SA.2.30	“So the L
1SA.2.31	The time is coming when I will destroy the descendants of both you and your ancestors. No man will grow old in your family. 
1SA.2.32	You will see trouble in my house. No matter what good things happen to Israel, there will never be an old man in your family. 
1SA.2.33	I will not totally cut off your family from my altar. But your eyes will cry and your heart be sad, because all your descendants will die.

1SA.2.36	Then everyone left in your family will come and bow down before him. They will beg for a little money or a little food and say, “Please give me a job as priest so I can have food to eat.” ’ ”
1SA.3.1	The boy Samuel served the L
1SA.3.2	Eli’s eyes were so weak he was almost blind. One night he was lying in bed. 
1SA.3.3	Samuel was also in bed in the L
1SA.3.4	Then the L
1SA.3.5	He ran to Eli and said, “I am here. You called me.”
1SA.3.5	But Eli said, “I didn’t call you. Go back to bed.” So Samuel went back to bed.
1SA.3.6	The L
1SA.3.6	Samuel again went to Eli and said, “I am here. You called me.”
1SA.3.6	Again Eli said, “I didn’t call you. Go back to bed.”
1SA.3.7	Samuel did not yet know the L
1SA.3.8	The L
1SA.3.8	Then Eli realized the L
1SA.3.9	So he told Samuel, “Go to bed. If he calls you again, say, ‘Speak, L
1SA.3.10	The L
1SA.3.10	Samuel said, “Speak, L
1SA.3.11	The L
1SA.3.12	At that time I will do to Eli and his family everything I promised, from beginning to end. 
1SA.3.13	I told Eli I would punish his family always, because he knew his sons were evil. They acted without honor, but he did not stop them. 
1SA.3.14	So I swore to Eli’s family, ‘Your guilt will never be removed by sacrifice or offering.’ ”
1SA.3.15	Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the L
1SA.3.16	but Eli called to him, “Samuel, my son!”
1SA.3.16	Samuel answered, “I am here.”
1SA.3.17	Eli asked, “What did the L
1SA.3.18	So Samuel told Eli everything and did not hide anything from him. Then Eli said, “He is the L

1SA.3.20	Then all Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, knew Samuel was a true prophet of the L
1SA.3.21	And the L
1SA.4.1	So, news about Samuel spread through all of Israel.
1SA.4.1	At that time the Israelites went out to fight the Philistines. The Israelites camped at Ebenezer and the Philistines at Aphek. 
1SA.4.2	The Philistines went to meet the Israelites in battle. And as the battle spread, they defeated the Israelites, killing about four thousand soldiers on the battlefield. 
1SA.4.3	When some Israelite soldiers went back to their camp, the elders of Israel asked, “Why did the L
1SA.4.4	So the people sent men to Shiloh. They brought back the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1SA.4.5	When the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1SA.4.6	When the Philistines heard Israel’s shout, they asked, “What’s all this shouting in the Hebrew camp?”
1SA.4.6	Then the Philistines found out that the Ark of the L
1SA.4.7	They were afraid and said, “A god has come into the Hebrew camp! We’re in trouble! This has never happened before! 
1SA.4.8	How terrible it will be for us! Who can save us from these powerful gods? They are the ones who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of disasters in the desert. 
1SA.4.9	Be brave, Philistines! Fight like men! In the past they were our slaves. So fight like men, or we will become their slaves.”
1SA.4.10	So the Philistines fought hard and defeated the Israelites, and every Israelite soldier ran away to his own home. It was a great defeat for Israel, because thirty thousand Israelite soldiers were killed. 
1SA.4.11	The Ark of God was taken by the Philistines, and Eli’s two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
1SA.4.12	That same day a man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battle. He tore his clothes and put dust on his head to show his great sadness. 
1SA.4.13	When he arrived in Shiloh, Eli was by the side of the road. He was sitting there in a chair, watching, because he was worried about the Ark of God. When the Benjaminite entered Shiloh, he told the bad news. Then all the people in town cried loudly. 
1SA.4.14	Eli heard the crying and asked, “What’s all this noise?”
1SA.4.14	The Benjaminite ran to Eli and told him what had happened. 
1SA.4.15	Eli was now ninety-eight years old, and he was blind. 
1SA.4.16	The Benjaminite told him, “I have come from the battle. I ran all the way here today.”
1SA.4.16	Eli asked, “What happened, my son?”
1SA.4.17	The Benjaminite answered, “Israel ran away from the Philistines, and the Israelite army has lost many soldiers. Your two sons are both dead, and the Philistines have taken the Ark of God.”
1SA.4.18	When he mentioned the Ark of God, Eli fell backward off his chair. He fell beside the gate, broke his neck, and died, because he was old and fat. He had led Israel for forty years.
1SA.4.19	Eli’s daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and was about to give birth. When she heard the news that the Ark of God had been taken and that Eli, her father-in-law, and Phinehas, her husband, were both dead, she began to give birth to her child. The child was born, but the mother had much trouble in giving birth. 
1SA.4.20	As she was dying, the women who helped her said, “Don’t worry! You’ve given birth to a son!” But she did not answer or pay attention. 
1SA.4.21	She named the baby Ichabod, saying, “Israel’s glory is gone.” She said this because the Ark of God had been taken and her father-in-law and husband were dead. 
1SA.4.22	She said, “Israel’s glory is gone, because the Ark of God has been taken away.”
1SA.5.1	After the Philistines had captured the Ark of God, they took it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
1SA.5.2	They carried it into Dagon’s temple and put it next to Dagon. 
1SA.5.3	When the people of Ashdod rose early the next morning, they found that Dagon had fallen on his face on the ground before the Ark of the L
1SA.5.4	The next morning when they rose, they again found Dagon fallen on the ground before the Ark of the L
1SA.5.5	So, even today, Dagon’s priests and others who enter his temple at Ashdod refuse to step on the doorsill.
1SA.5.6	The L
1SA.5.7	When the people of Ashdod saw what was happening, they said, “The Ark of the God of Israel can’t stay with us. God is punishing us and Dagon our god.” 
1SA.5.8	The people of Ashdod called all five Philistine kings together and asked them, “What should we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?”
1SA.5.8	The rulers answered, “Move the Ark of the God of Israel to Gath.” So the Philistines moved it to Gath.
1SA.5.9	But after they moved it to Gath, there was a great panic. The L
1SA.5.10	Then the Philistines sent the Ark of God to Ekron.
1SA.5.10	But when it came into Ekron, the people of Ekron yelled, “Why are you bringing the Ark of the God of Israel to our city? Do you want to kill us and our people?” 
1SA.5.11	So they called all the kings of the Philistines together and said, “Send the Ark of the God of Israel back to its place before it kills us and our people!” All the people in the city were struck with terror because God was so hard on them there. 
1SA.5.12	The people who did not die were troubled with growths on their skin. So the people of Ekron cried loudly to heaven.
1SA.6.1	The Philistines kept the Ark of God in their land seven months. 
1SA.6.2	Then they called for their priests and magicians and said, “What should we do with the Ark of the L
1SA.6.3	The priests and magicians answered, “If you send back the Ark of the God of Israel, don’t send it back empty. You must give a penalty offering. If you are then healed, you will know that it was because of the Ark that you had such trouble.”
1SA.6.4	The Philistines asked, “What kind of penalty offering should we send to Israel’s God?”
1SA.6.4	They answered, “Make five gold models of the growths on your skin and five gold models of rats. The number of models must match the number of Philistine kings, because the same sickness has come on you and your kings. 
1SA.6.5	Make models of the growths and the rats that are ruining the country, and give honor to Israel’s God. Then maybe he will stop being so hard on you, your gods, and your land. 
1SA.6.6	Don’t be stubborn like the king of Egypt and the Egyptians. After God punished them terribly, they let the Israelites leave Egypt.
1SA.6.7	“You must build a new cart and get two cows that have just had calves. These must be cows that have never had yokes on their necks. Hitch the cows to the cart, and take the calves home, away from their mothers. 
1SA.6.8	Put the Ark of the L
1SA.6.9	Watch the cart. If it goes toward Beth Shemesh in Israel’s own land, the L
1SA.6.10	The Philistines did what the priests and magicians said. They took two cows that had just had calves and hitched them to the cart, but they kept their calves at home. 
1SA.6.11	They put the Ark of the L
1SA.6.12	Then the cows went straight toward Beth Shemesh. They stayed on the road, mooing all the way, and did not turn right or left. The Philistine kings followed the cows as far as the border of Beth Shemesh.
1SA.6.13	Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley. When they looked up and saw the Ark of the L
1SA.6.14	The cart came to the field belonging to Joshua of Beth Shemesh and stopped near a large rock. The people of Beth Shemesh chopped up the wood of the cart. Then they sacrificed the cows as burnt offerings to the L
1SA.6.15	The Levites took down the Ark of the L
1SA.6.16	After the five Philistine kings saw this, they went back to Ekron the same day.
1SA.6.17	The Philistines had sent these gold models of the growths as penalty offerings to the L
1SA.6.18	And the Philistines also sent gold models of rats. The number of rats matched the number of towns belonging to the Philistine kings, including both strong, walled cities and country villages. The large rock on which they put the Ark of the L
1SA.6.19	But some of the men of Beth Shemesh looked into the Ark of the L
1SA.6.20	They said, “Who can stand before the L

1SA.7.1	The men of Kiriath Jearim came and took the Ark of the L
1SA.7.2	The Ark stayed at Kiriath Jearim a long time—twenty years in all. And the people of Israel began to follow the L
1SA.7.3	Samuel spoke to the whole group of Israel, saying, “If you’re turning back to the L

1SA.7.6	So the Israelites met together at Mizpah. They drew water from the ground and poured it out before the L
1SA.7.7	The Philistines heard the Israelites were meeting at Mizpah, so the Philistine kings came up to attack them. When the Israelites heard they were coming, they were afraid. 
1SA.7.8	They said to Samuel, “Don’t stop praying to the L
1SA.7.9	Then Samuel took a baby lamb and offered it to the L
1SA.7.10	While Samuel was burning the offering, the Philistines came near to attack Israel. But the L
1SA.7.11	The men of Israel ran out of Mizpah and chased the Philistines almost to Beth Car, killing the Philistines along the way.
1SA.7.12	After this happened Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Shen. He named the stone Ebenezer, saying, “The L

1SA.7.14	Earlier the Philistines had taken towns from the Israelites, but the Israelites won them back, from Ekron to Gath. They also took back from the Philistines the lands near these towns. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.
1SA.7.15	Samuel continued as judge of Israel all his life. 
1SA.7.16	Every year he went from Bethel to Gilgal to Mizpah and judged the Israelites in all these towns. 
1SA.7.17	But Samuel always went back to Ramah, where his home was. There he judged Israel and built an altar to the L
1SA.8.1	When Samuel was old, he made his sons judges for Israel. 
1SA.8.2	His first son was named Joel, and his second son was named Abijah. Joel and Abijah were judges in Beersheba. 
1SA.8.3	But Samuel’s sons did not live as he did. They tried to get money dishonestly, and they accepted money secretly to make wrong judgments.
1SA.8.4	So all the elders came together and met Samuel at Ramah. 
1SA.8.5	They said to him, “You’re old, and your sons don’t live as you do. Give us a king to rule over us like all the other nations.”
1SA.8.6	When the elders said that, Samuel was not pleased. He prayed to the L
1SA.8.7	and the L
1SA.8.8	They are doing as they have always done. When I took them out of Egypt, they left me and served other gods. They are doing the same to you. 
1SA.8.9	Now listen to the people, but warn them what the king who rules over them will do.”
1SA.8.10	So Samuel told those who had asked him for a king what the L
1SA.8.11	Samuel said, “If you have a king ruling over you, this is what he will do: He will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and his horses, and they will run in front of the king’s chariot. 
1SA.8.12	The king will make some of your sons commanders over thousands or over fifties. He will make some of your other sons plow his ground and reap his harvest. He will take others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots. 
1SA.8.13	He will take your daughters to make perfume and cook and bake for him. 
1SA.8.14	He will take your best fields, vineyards, and olive groves and give them to his servants. 
1SA.8.15	He will take one-tenth of your grain and grapes and give it to his officers and servants. 
1SA.8.16	He will take your male and female servants, your best cattle, and your donkeys and use them all for his own work. 
1SA.8.17	He will take one-tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves will become his slaves. 
1SA.8.18	When that time comes, you will cry out because of the king you chose. But the L
1SA.8.19	But the people would not listen to Samuel. They said, “No! We want a king to rule over us. 
1SA.8.20	Then we will be the same as all the other nations. Our king will judge for us and go with us and fight our battles.”
1SA.8.21	After Samuel heard all that the people said, he repeated their words to the L
1SA.8.22	The L
1SA.8.22	Then Samuel told the people of Israel, “Go back to your towns.”
1SA.9.1	Kish, son of Abiel from the tribe of Benjamin, was an important man. (Abiel was the son of Zeror, who was the son of Becorath, who was the son of Aphiah of Benjamin.) 
1SA.9.2	Kish had a son named Saul, who was a fine young man. There was no Israelite better than he. Saul stood a head taller than any other man in Israel.
1SA.9.3	Now the donkeys of Saul’s father, Kish, were lost. So Kish said to Saul, his son, “Take one of the servants, and go and look for the donkeys.” 
1SA.9.4	Saul went through the mountains of Ephraim and the land of Shalisha, but he and the servant could not find the donkeys. They went into the land of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. They went through the land of Benjamin, but they still did not find them. 
1SA.9.5	When they arrived in the area of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, “Let’s go back or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and will start worrying about us.”
1SA.9.6	But the servant answered, “A man of God is in this town. People respect him because everything he says comes true. Let’s go into the town now. Maybe he can tell us something about the journey we have taken.”
1SA.9.7	Saul said to his servant, “If we go into the town, what can we give him? The food in our bags is gone. We have no gift to give him. Do we have anything?”
1SA.9.8	Again the servant answered Saul. “Look, I have one-tenth of an ounce of silver. Give it to the man of God. Then he will tell us about our journey.” 
1SA.9.9	(In the past, if someone in Israel wanted to ask something from God, he would say, “Let’s go to the seer.” We call the person a prophet today, but in the past he was called a seer.)
1SA.9.10	Saul said to his servant, “That’s a good idea. Come, let’s go.” So they went toward the town where the man of God was.
1SA.9.11	As Saul and the servant were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to get water. Saul and the servant asked them, “Is the seer here?”
1SA.9.12	The young women answered, “Yes, he’s here. He’s ahead of you. Hurry now. He has just come to our town today, because the people will offer a sacrifice at the place of worship. 
1SA.9.13	As soon as you enter the town, you will find him before he goes up to the place of worship to eat. The people will not begin eating until the seer comes, because he must bless the sacrifice. After that, the guests will eat. Go now, and you should find him.”
1SA.9.14	Saul and the servant went up to the town. Just as they entered it, they saw Samuel coming toward them on his way up to the place of worship.
1SA.9.15	The day before Saul came, the L
1SA.9.16	“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Appoint him to lead my people Israel. He will save my people from the Philistines. I have seen the suffering of my people, and I have listened to their cry.”
1SA.9.17	When Samuel first saw Saul, the L
1SA.9.18	Saul approached Samuel at the gate and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.”
1SA.9.19	Samuel answered, “I am the seer. Go with me to the place of worship. Today you and your servant are to eat with me. Tomorrow morning I will answer all your questions and send you home. 
1SA.9.20	Don’t worry about the donkeys you lost three days ago, because they have been found. Soon all the wealth of Israel will belong to you and your family.”
1SA.9.21	Saul answered, “But I am from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel. And my family group is the smallest in the tribe of Benjamin. Why are you saying such things?”
1SA.9.22	Then Samuel took Saul and his servant into a large room and gave them a choice place at the table. About thirty guests were there. 
1SA.9.23	Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the meat I gave you, the portion I told you to set aside.”
1SA.9.24	So the cook took the thigh and put it on the table in front of Saul. Samuel said, “This is the meat saved for you. Eat it, because it was set aside for you for this special time. As I said, ‘I had invited the people.’ ” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
1SA.9.25	After they finished eating, they came down from the place of worship and went to the town. Then Samuel talked with Saul on the roof of his house. 
1SA.9.26	At dawn they got up, and Samuel called to Saul on the roof. He said, “Get up, and I will send you on your way.” So Saul got up and went out of the house with Samuel. 
1SA.9.27	As Saul, his servant, and Samuel were getting near the edge of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us, but you stay, because I have a message from God for you.”
1SA.10.1	Samuel took a jar of olive oil and poured it on Saul’s head. He kissed Saul and said, “The L
1SA.10.2	After you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel’s tomb on the border of Benjamin at Zelzah. They will say to you, ‘The donkeys you were looking for have been found. But now your father has stopped thinking about his donkeys and is worrying about you. He is asking, “What will I do about my son?” ’
1SA.10.3	“Then you will go on until you reach the big tree at Tabor. Three men on their way to worship God at Bethel will meet you there. One man will be carrying three goats. Another will be carrying three loaves of bread. And the third will have a leather bag full of wine. 
1SA.10.4	They will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread, which you must accept. 
1SA.10.5	Then you will go to Gibeah of God, where a Philistine camp is. When you approach this town, a group of prophets will come down from the place of worship. They will be playing harps, tambourines, flutes, and lyres, and they will be prophesying. 
1SA.10.6	Then the Spirit of the L
1SA.10.7	After these signs happen, do whatever you find to do, because God will help you.
1SA.10.8	“Go ahead of me to Gilgal. I will come down to you to offer whole burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. But you must wait seven days. Then I will come and tell you what to do.”
1SA.10.9	When Saul turned to leave Samuel, God changed Saul’s heart. All these signs came true that day. 
1SA.10.10	When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, Saul met a group of prophets. The Spirit of God rushed upon him, and he prophesied with the prophets. 
1SA.10.11	When people who had known Saul before saw him prophesying with the prophets, they asked each other, “What has happened to Kish’s son? Is even Saul one of the prophets?”
1SA.10.12	A man who lived there said, “Who is the father of these prophets?” So this became a famous saying: “Is even Saul one of the prophets?” 
1SA.10.13	When Saul finished prophesying, he entered the place of worship.
1SA.10.14	Saul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where have you been?”
1SA.10.14	Saul said, “We were looking for the donkeys. When we couldn’t find them, we went to talk to Samuel.”
1SA.10.15	Saul’s uncle asked, “Please tell me. What did Samuel say to you?”
1SA.10.16	Saul answered, “He told us the donkeys had already been found.” But Saul did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about his becoming king.
1SA.10.17	Samuel called all the people of Israel to meet with the L
1SA.10.18	He said, “This is what the L
1SA.10.19	But now you have rejected your God. He saves you from all your troubles and problems, but you said, ‘No! We want a king to rule over us.’ Now come, stand before the L
1SA.10.20	When Samuel gathered all the tribes of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin was picked. 
1SA.10.21	Samuel had them pass by in family groups, and Matri’s family was picked. Then he had each man of Matri’s family pass by, and Saul son of Kish was picked. But when they looked for Saul, they could not find him. 
1SA.10.22	They asked the L
1SA.10.22	The L
1SA.10.23	So they ran and brought him out. When Saul stood among the people, he was a head taller than anyone else. 
1SA.10.24	Then Samuel said to the people, “See the man the L
1SA.10.24	Then the people shouted, “Long live the king!”
1SA.10.25	Samuel explained the rights and duties of the king and then wrote them in a book and put it before the L
1SA.10.26	Saul also went to his home in Gibeah. God touched the hearts of certain brave men who went along with him. 
1SA.10.27	But some troublemakers said, “How can this man save us?” They disapproved of Saul and refused to bring gifts to him. But Saul kept quiet.
1SA.11.1	About a month later Nahash the Ammonite and his army surrounded the city of Jabesh in Gilead. All the people of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us, and we will serve you.”
1SA.11.2	But he answered, “I will make a treaty with you only if I’m allowed to poke out the right eye of each of you. Then all Israel will be ashamed!”
1SA.11.3	The elders of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Give us seven days to send messengers through all Israel. If no one comes to help us, we will give ourselves up to you.”
1SA.11.4	When the messengers came to Gibeah where Saul lived and told the people the news, they cried loudly. 
1SA.11.5	Saul was coming home from plowing the fields with his oxen when he heard the people crying. He asked, “What’s wrong with the people that they are crying?” Then they told Saul what the messengers from Jabesh had said. 
1SA.11.6	When Saul heard their words, God’s Spirit rushed upon him with power, and he became very angry. 
1SA.11.7	So he took a pair of oxen and cut them into pieces. Then he gave the pieces of the oxen to messengers and ordered them to carry them through all the land of Israel.
1SA.11.7	The messengers said, “This is what will happen to the oxen of anyone who does not follow Saul and Samuel.” So the people became very afraid of the L
1SA.11.8	Saul gathered the people together at Bezek. There were three hundred thousand men from Israel and thirty thousand men from Judah.
1SA.11.9	They said to the messengers who had come, “Tell the people at Jabesh Gilead this: ‘Before the day warms up tomorrow, you will be saved.’ ” So the messengers went and reported this to the people at Jabesh, and they were very happy. 
1SA.11.10	The people said to Nahash the Ammonite, “Tomorrow we will come out to meet you. Then you can do anything you want to us.”
1SA.11.11	The next morning Saul divided his soldiers into three groups. At dawn they entered the Ammonite camp and defeated them before the heat of the day. The Ammonites who escaped were scattered; no two of them were still together.
1SA.11.12	Then the people said to Samuel, “Who didn’t want Saul as king? Bring them here and we will kill them!”
1SA.11.13	But Saul said, “No! No one will be put to death today. Today the L
1SA.11.14	Then Samuel said to the people, “Come, let’s go to Gilgal. There we will again promise to obey the king.” 
1SA.11.15	So all the people went to Gilgal, and there, before the L
1SA.12.1	Samuel said to all Israel, “I have done everything you wanted me to do and have put a king over you. 
1SA.12.2	Now you have a king to lead you. I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. I have been your leader since I was young. 
1SA.12.3	Here I am. If I have done anything wrong, you must testify against me before the L
1SA.12.4	The Israelites answered, “You have not cheated us, or hurt us, or taken anything unfairly from anyone.”
1SA.12.5	Samuel said to them, “The L

1SA.12.6	Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the L

1SA.12.25	But if you are stubborn and do evil, he will sweep you and your king away.”
1SA.13.1	Saul was thirty years old when he became king, and he was king over Israel forty-two years. 
1SA.13.2	Saul chose three thousand men from Israel. Two thousand men stayed with him at Micmash in the mountains of Bethel, and one thousand men stayed with Jonathan at Gibeah in Benjamin. Saul sent the other men in the army back home.
1SA.13.3	Jonathan attacked the Philistine camp in Geba, and the other Philistines heard about it. Saul said, “Let the Hebrews hear what happened.” So he told the men to blow trumpets through all the land of Israel. 
1SA.13.4	All the Israelites heard the news. The men said, “Saul has defeated the Philistine camp. Now the Philistines will really hate us!” Then the Israelites were called to join Saul at Gilgal.
1SA.13.5	The Philistines gathered to fight Israel with three thousand chariots and six thousand men to ride in them. Their soldiers were as many as the grains of sand on the seashore. The Philistines went and camped at Micmash, which is east of Beth Aven. 
1SA.13.6	When the Israelites saw that they were in trouble, they went to hide in caves and bushes, among the rocks, and in pits and wells. 
1SA.13.7	Some Hebrews even went across the Jordan River to the land of Gad and Gilead.
1SA.13.7	But Saul stayed at Gilgal, and all the men in his army were shaking with fear. 
1SA.13.8	Saul waited seven days, because Samuel had said he would meet him then. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the soldiers began to leave.
1SA.13.9	So Saul said, “Bring me the whole burnt offering and the fellowship offerings.” Then Saul offered the whole burnt offering. 
1SA.13.10	Just as he finished, Samuel arrived, and Saul went to greet him.
1SA.13.11	Samuel asked, “What have you done?”
1SA.13.11	Saul answered, “I saw the soldiers leaving me, and you were not here when you said you would be. The Philistines were gathering at Micmash. 
1SA.13.12	Then I thought, ‘The Philistines will come against me at Gilgal, and I haven’t asked for the L
1SA.13.13	Samuel said, “You acted foolishly! You haven’t obeyed the command of the L
1SA.13.14	but now your kingdom will not continue. The L
1SA.13.15	Then Samuel left Gilgal and went to Gibeah in Benjamin. Saul counted the men who were still with him, and there were about six hundred.
1SA.13.16	Saul and his son Jonathan and the soldiers with him stayed in Gibeah in the land of Benjamin. The Philistines made their camp at Micmash. 
1SA.13.17	Three groups went out from the Philistine camp to make raids. One group went on the Ophrah road in the land of Shual. 
1SA.13.18	The second group went on the Beth Horon road. The third group went on the border road that overlooks the Valley of Zeboim toward the desert.
1SA.13.19	The whole land of Israel had no blacksmith because the Philistines had said, “The Hebrews might make swords and spears.” 
1SA.13.20	So all the Israelites had to go down to the Philistines to have their plows, hoes, axes, and sickles sharpened. 
1SA.13.21	The Philistine blacksmiths charged about one-fourth of an ounce of silver for sharpening plows and hoes. And they charged one-eighth of an ounce of silver for sharpening picks, axes, and the sticks used to guide oxen.
1SA.13.22	So when the battle came, the soldiers with Saul and Jonathan had no swords or spears. Only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
1SA.13.23	A group from the Philistine army had gone out to the pass at Micmash.
1SA.14.1	One day Jonathan, Saul’s son, said to the officer who carried his armor, “Come, let’s go over to the Philistine camp on the other side.” But Jonathan did not tell his father.
1SA.14.2	Saul was sitting under a pomegranate tree at the threshing floor near Gibeah. He had about six hundred men with him. 
1SA.14.3	One man was Ahijah who was wearing the holy vest. (Ahijah was a son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub. Ichabod was the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the L
1SA.14.4	There was a steep slope on each side of the pass that Jonathan planned to go through to reach the Philistine camp. The cliff on one side was named Bozez, and the cliff on the other side was named Seneh. 
1SA.14.5	One cliff faced north toward Micmash. The other faced south toward Geba.
1SA.14.6	Jonathan said to his officer who carried his armor, “Come. Let’s go to the camp of those men who are not circumcised. Maybe the L
1SA.14.7	The officer who carried Jonathan’s armor said to him, “Do whatever you think is best. Go ahead. I’m with you.”
1SA.14.8	Jonathan said, “Then come. We will cross over to the Philistines and let them see us. 
1SA.14.9	If they say to us, ‘Stay there until we come to you,’ we will stay where we are. We won’t go up to them. 
1SA.14.10	But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we will climb up, and the L
1SA.14.11	When both Jonathan and his officer let the Philistines see them, the Philistines said, “Look! The Hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in!” 
1SA.14.12	The Philistines in the camp shouted to Jonathan and his officer, “Come up to us. We’ll teach you a lesson!”
1SA.14.12	Jonathan said to his officer, “Climb up behind me, because the L
1SA.14.13	So Jonathan climbed up, using his hands and feet, and his officer climbed just behind him. Jonathan struck down the Philistines as he went, and his officer killed them as he followed behind him. 
1SA.14.14	In that first fight Jonathan and his officer killed about twenty Philistines over a half acre of ground.
1SA.14.15	All the Philistine soldiers panicked—those in the camp and those in the raiding party. The ground itself shook! God had caused the panic.
1SA.14.16	Saul’s guards were at Gibeah in the land of Benjamin when they saw the Philistine soldiers running in every direction. 
1SA.14.17	Saul said to his army, “Check to see who has left our camp.” When they checked, they learned that Jonathan and his officer were gone.
1SA.14.18	So Saul said to Ahijah the priest, “Bring the Ark of God.” (At that time it was with the Israelites.) 
1SA.14.19	While Saul was talking to the priest, the confusion in the Philistine camp was growing. Then Saul said to Ahijah, “Put your hand down!”
1SA.14.20	Then Saul gathered his army and entered the battle. They found the Philistines confused, striking each other with their swords! 
1SA.14.21	Earlier, there were Hebrews who had served the Philistines and had stayed in their camp, but now they joined the Israelites with Saul and Jonathan. 
1SA.14.22	When all the Israelites hidden in the mountains of Ephraim heard that the Philistine soldiers were running away, they also joined the battle and chased the Philistines. 
1SA.14.23	So the L
1SA.14.24	The men of Israel were miserable that day because Saul had made an oath for all of them. He had said, “No one should eat food before evening and before I finish defeating my enemies. If he does, he will be cursed!” So no Israelite soldier ate food.
1SA.14.25	Now the army went into the woods, where there was some honey on the ground. 
1SA.14.26	They came upon some honey, but no one took any because they were afraid of the oath. 
1SA.14.27	Jonathan had not heard the oath Saul had put on the army, so he dipped the end of his stick into the honey and lifted some out and ate it. Then he felt better. 
1SA.14.28	Then one of the soldiers told Jonathan, “Your father made an oath for all the soldiers. He said any man who eats today will be cursed! That’s why they are so weak.”
1SA.14.29	Jonathan said, “My father has made trouble for the land! See how much better I feel after just tasting a little of this honey! 
1SA.14.30	It would have been much better for the men to eat the food they took from their enemies today. We could have killed many more Philistines!”
1SA.14.31	That day the Israelites defeated the Philistines from Micmash to Aijalon. After that, they were very tired. 
1SA.14.32	They had taken sheep, cattle, and calves from the Philistines. Now they were so hungry they killed the animals on the ground and ate them, without draining the blood from them! 
1SA.14.33	Someone said to Saul, “Look! The men are sinning against the L
1SA.14.33	Saul said, “You have sinned! Roll a large stone over here now!” 
1SA.14.34	Then he said, “Go to the men and tell them that each person must bring his ox and sheep to me and kill it here and eat it. Don’t sin against the L
1SA.14.34	That night everyone brought his animals and killed them there. 
1SA.14.35	Then Saul built an altar to the L
1SA.14.36	Saul said, “Let’s go after the Philistines tonight and rob them. We won’t let any of them live!”
1SA.14.36	The men answered, “Do whatever you think is best.”
1SA.14.36	But the priest said, “Let’s ask God.”
1SA.14.37	So Saul asked God, “Should I chase the Philistines? Will you let us defeat them?” But God did not answer Saul at that time. 
1SA.14.38	Then Saul said to all the leaders of his army, “Come here. Let’s find out what sin has been done today. 
1SA.14.39	As surely as the L
1SA.14.40	Then Saul said to all the Israelites, “You stand on this side. I and my son Jonathan will stand on the other side.”
1SA.14.40	The men answered, “Do whatever you think is best.”
1SA.14.41	Then Saul prayed to the L
1SA.14.41	And Saul and Jonathan were picked; the other men went free. 
1SA.14.42	Saul said, “Now let us discover if it is I or Jonathan my son who is guilty.” And Jonathan was picked.
1SA.14.43	Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.”
1SA.14.43	So Jonathan told Saul, “I only tasted a little honey from the end of my stick. And must I die now?”
1SA.14.44	Saul said, “Jonathan, if you don’t die, may God punish me terribly.”
1SA.14.45	But the soldiers said to Saul, “Must Jonathan die? Never! He is responsible for saving Israel today! As surely as the L
1SA.14.46	Then Saul stopped chasing the Philistines, and they went back to their own land.
1SA.14.47	When Saul became king over Israel, he fought against Israel’s enemies all around. He fought Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the king of Zobah, and the Philistines. Everywhere Saul went he defeated Israel’s enemies. 
1SA.14.48	He fought bravely and defeated the Amalekites. He saved the Israelites from their enemies who had robbed them.
1SA.14.49	Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua. His older daughter was named Merab, and his younger daughter was named Michal. 
1SA.14.50	Saul’s wife was Ahinoam daughter of Ahimaaz. The commander of his army was Abner son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 
1SA.14.51	Saul’s father Kish and Abner’s father Ner were sons of Abiel.
1SA.14.52	All Saul’s life he fought hard against the Philistines. When he saw strong or brave men, he took them into his army.
1SA.15.1	Samuel said to Saul, “The L
1SA.15.2	This is what the L
1SA.15.3	Now go, attack the Amalekites and destroy everything they own as an offering to the L
1SA.15.4	So Saul called the army together at Telaim. There were two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from Judah. 
1SA.15.5	Then Saul went to the city of Amalek and set up an ambush in the ravine. 
1SA.15.6	He said to the Kenites, “Go away. Leave the Amalekites so that I won’t destroy you with them, because you showed kindness to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt.” So the Kenites moved away from the Amalekites.
1SA.15.7	Then Saul defeated the Amalekites. He fought them all the way from Havilah to Shur, at the border of Egypt. 
1SA.15.8	He took King Agag of the Amalekites alive, but he killed all of Agag’s army with the sword. 
1SA.15.9	Saul and the army let Agag live, along with the best sheep, fat cattle, and lambs. They let every good animal live, because they did not want to destroy them. But when they found an animal that was weak or useless, they killed it.
1SA.15.10	Then the L
1SA.15.11	“I am sorry I made Saul king, because he has stopped following me and has not obeyed my commands.” Samuel was upset, and he cried out to the L
1SA.15.12	Early the next morning Samuel got up and went to meet Saul. But the people told Samuel, “Saul has gone to Carmel, where he has put up a monument in his own honor. Now he has gone down to Gilgal.”
1SA.15.13	When Samuel came to Saul, Saul said, “May the L
1SA.15.14	But Samuel said, “Then why do I hear cattle mooing and sheep bleating?”
1SA.15.15	Saul answered, “The soldiers took them from the Amalekites. They saved the best sheep and cattle to offer as sacrifices to the L
1SA.15.16	Samuel said to Saul, “Stop! Let me tell you what the L
1SA.15.16	Saul answered, “Tell me.”
1SA.15.17	Samuel said, “Once you didn’t think much of yourself, but now you have become the leader of the tribes of Israel. The L
1SA.15.18	And he sent you on a mission. He said, ‘Go and destroy those evil people, the Amalekites. Make war on them until all of them are dead.’ 
1SA.15.19	Why didn’t you obey the L
1SA.15.20	Saul said, “But I did obey the L
1SA.15.21	The soldiers took the best sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the L
1SA.15.22	But Samuel answered,
1SA.15.22	“What pleases the L
1SA.15.22	burnt offerings and sacrifices
1SA.15.22	or obedience to his voice?
1SA.15.22	It is better to obey than to sacrifice.
1SA.15.22	It is better to listen to God than to offer the fat of sheep.
1SA.15.23	Disobedience is as bad as the sin of sorcery.
1SA.15.23	Pride is as bad as the sin of worshiping idols.
1SA.15.23	You have rejected the L
1SA.15.23	Now he rejects you as king.”
1SA.15.24	Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned. I didn’t obey the L
1SA.15.25	Now, I beg you, forgive my sin. Come back with me so I may worship the L
1SA.15.26	But Samuel said to Saul, “I won’t go back with you. You rejected the L
1SA.15.27	As Samuel turned to leave, Saul caught his robe, and it tore. 
1SA.15.28	Samuel said to him, “The L
1SA.15.29	The L
1SA.15.30	Saul answered, “I have sinned. But please honor me in front of the elders of my people and in front of the Israelites. Come back with me so that I can worship the L
1SA.15.31	So Samuel went back with Saul, and Saul worshiped the L
1SA.15.32	Then Samuel said, “Bring me King Agag of the Amalekites.”
1SA.15.32	Agag came to Samuel in chains, but Agag thought, “Surely the threat of death has passed.”
1SA.15.33	Samuel said to him, “Your sword made other mothers lose their children. Now your mother will have no children.” And Samuel cut Agag to pieces before the L
1SA.15.34	Then Samuel left and went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his home in Gibeah. 
1SA.15.35	And Samuel never saw Saul again the rest of his life, but he was sad for Saul. And the L
1SA.16.1	The L
1SA.16.2	But Samuel said, “If I go, Saul will hear the news and will try to kill me.”
1SA.16.2	The L
1SA.16.3	Invite Jesse to the sacrifice. Then I will tell you what to do. You must appoint the one I show you.”
1SA.16.4	Samuel did what the L
1SA.16.5	Samuel answered, “Yes, I come in peace. I have come to make a sacrifice to the L
1SA.16.6	When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab, and he thought, “Surely the L
1SA.16.7	But the L
1SA.16.8	Then Jesse called Abinadab and told him to pass by Samuel. But Samuel said, “The L
1SA.16.9	Then Jesse had Shammah pass by. But Samuel said, “No, the L
1SA.16.10	Jesse had seven of his sons pass by Samuel. But Samuel said to him, “The L
1SA.16.11	Then he asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?”
1SA.16.11	Jesse answered, “I still have the youngest son. He is out taking care of the sheep.”
1SA.16.11	Samuel said, “Send for him. We will not sit down to eat until he arrives.”
1SA.16.12	So Jesse sent and had his youngest son brought in. He was a fine boy, tanned, and handsome.
1SA.16.12	The L
1SA.16.13	So Samuel took the container of olive oil and poured it on Jesse’s youngest son to appoint him in front of his brothers. From that day on, the L
1SA.16.14	But the L
1SA.16.15	Saul’s servants said to him, “See, an evil spirit from God is troubling you. 
1SA.16.16	Give us the command to look for someone who can play the harp. When the evil spirit from God troubles you, he will play, and you will feel better.”
1SA.16.17	So Saul said to his servants, “Find someone who can play well and bring him to me.”
1SA.16.18	One of the servants said, “I have seen a son of Jesse of Bethlehem play the harp. He is brave and courageous. He is a good speaker and handsome, and the L
1SA.16.19	Then Saul sent messengers to Jesse, saying, “Send me your son David, who is with the sheep.” 
1SA.16.20	So Jesse loaded a donkey with bread, a leather bag full of wine, and a young goat, and he sent them with his son David to Saul.
1SA.16.21	When David came to Saul, he began to serve him. Saul liked David and made him the officer who carried his armor. 
1SA.16.22	Saul sent a message to Jesse, saying, “Let David stay and serve me because I like him.”
1SA.16.23	When the evil spirit from God troubled Saul, David would take his harp and play. Then the evil spirit would leave him, and Saul would feel better.
1SA.17.1	The Philistines gathered their armies for war. They met at Socoh in Judah and camped at Ephes Dammim between Socoh and Azekah. 
1SA.17.2	Saul and the Israelites gathered in the Valley of Elah and camped there and took their positions to fight the Philistines. 
1SA.17.3	The Philistines controlled one hill while the Israelites controlled another. The valley was between them.
1SA.17.4	The Philistines had a champion fighter from Gath named Goliath. He was about nine feet, four inches tall. He came out of the Philistine camp 
1SA.17.5	with a bronze helmet on his head and a coat of bronze armor that weighed about one hundred twenty-five pounds. 
1SA.17.6	He wore bronze protectors on his legs, and he had a bronze spear on his back. 
1SA.17.7	The wooden part of his larger spear was like a weaver’s rod, and its blade weighed about fifteen pounds. The officer who carried his shield walked in front of him.
1SA.17.8	Goliath stood and shouted to the Israelite soldiers, “Why have you taken positions for battle? I am a Philistine, and you are Saul’s servants! Choose a man and send him to fight me. 
1SA.17.9	If he can fight and kill me, we will be your servants. But if I can kill him, you will be our servants.” 
1SA.17.10	Then he said, “Today I stand and dare the army of Israel! Send one of your men to fight me!” 
1SA.17.11	When Saul and the Israelites heard the Philistine’s words, they were very scared.
1SA.17.12	Now David was the son of Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons. In Saul’s time Jesse was an old man. 
1SA.17.13	His three oldest sons followed Saul to the war. The first son was Eliab, the second was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah. 
1SA.17.14	David was the youngest. Jesse’s three oldest sons followed Saul, 
1SA.17.15	but David went back and forth from Saul to Bethlehem, where he took care of his father’s sheep.
1SA.17.16	For forty days the Philistine came out every morning and evening and stood before the Israelite army.
1SA.17.17	Jesse said to his son David, “Take this half bushel of cooked grain and ten loaves of bread to your brothers in the camp. 
1SA.17.18	Also take ten pieces of cheese to the commander and to your brothers. See how your brothers are and bring back some proof to show me that they are all right. 
1SA.17.19	Your brothers are with Saul and the army in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.”
1SA.17.20	Early in the morning David left the sheep with another shepherd. He took the food and left as Jesse had told him. When David arrived at the camp, the army was going out to their battle positions, shouting their war cry. 
1SA.17.21	The Israelites and Philistines were lining up their men to face each other in battle.
1SA.17.22	David left the food with the man who kept the supplies and ran to the battle line to talk to his brothers. 
1SA.17.23	While he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, came out. He shouted things against Israel as usual, and David heard him. 
1SA.17.24	When the Israelites saw Goliath, they were very much afraid and ran away.
1SA.17.25	They said, “Look at this man! He keeps coming out to challenge Israel. The king will give much money to whoever kills him. He will also let whoever kills him marry his daughter. And his father’s family will not have to pay taxes in Israel.”
1SA.17.26	David asked the men who stood near him, “What will be done to reward the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the shame from Israel? Who does this uncircumcised Philistine think he is? Does he think he can speak against the armies of the living God?”
1SA.17.27	The Israelites told David what would be done for the man who would kill Goliath.
1SA.17.28	When David’s oldest brother Eliab heard David talking with the soldiers, he was angry with David. He asked David, “Why did you come here? Who’s taking care of those few sheep of yours in the desert? I know you are proud and wicked at heart. You came down here just to watch the battle.”
1SA.17.29	David asked, “Now what have I done wrong? Can’t I even talk?” 
1SA.17.30	When he turned to other people and asked the same questions, they gave him the same answer as before. 
1SA.17.31	Yet what David said was told to Saul, and he sent for David.
1SA.17.32	David said to Saul, “Don’t let anyone be discouraged. I, your servant, will go and fight this Philistine!”
1SA.17.33	Saul answered, “You can’t go out against this Philistine and fight him. You’re only a boy. Goliath has been a warrior since he was a young man.”
1SA.17.34	But David said to Saul, “I, your servant, have been keeping my father’s sheep. When a lion or bear came and took a sheep from the flock, 
1SA.17.35	I would chase it. I would attack it and save the sheep from its mouth. When it attacked me, I caught it by its fur and hit it and killed it. 
1SA.17.36	I, your servant, have killed both a lion and a bear! This uncircumcised Philistine will be like them, because he has spoken against the armies of the living God. 
1SA.17.37	The L
1SA.17.37	Saul said to David, “Go, and may the L
1SA.17.38	Saul put his own clothes on David. He put a bronze helmet on his head and dressed him in armor. 
1SA.17.39	David put on Saul’s sword and tried to walk around, but he was not used to all the armor Saul had put on him.
1SA.17.39	He said to Saul, “I can’t go in this, because I’m not used to it.” Then David took it all off. 
1SA.17.40	He took his stick in his hand and chose five smooth stones from a stream. He put them in his shepherd’s bag and grabbed his sling. Then he went to meet the Philistine.
1SA.17.41	At the same time, the Philistine was coming closer to David. The man who held his shield walked in front of him. 
1SA.17.42	When Goliath looked at David and saw that he was only a boy, tanned and handsome, he looked down on David with disgust. 
1SA.17.43	He said, “Do you think I am a dog, that you come at me with a stick?” He used his gods’ names to curse David. 
1SA.17.44	He said to David, “Come here. I’ll feed your body to the birds of the air and the wild animals!”
1SA.17.45	But David said to him, “You come to me using a sword and two spears. But I come to you in the name of the L
1SA.17.46	Today the L
1SA.17.47	Everyone gathered here will know the L
1SA.17.48	As Goliath came near to attack him, David ran quickly to meet him. 
1SA.17.49	He took a stone from his bag, put it into his sling, and slung it. The stone hit the Philistine and went deep into his forehead, and Goliath fell facedown on the ground.
1SA.17.50	So David defeated the Philistine with only a sling and a stone. He hit him and killed him. He did not even have a sword in his hand. 
1SA.17.51	Then David ran and stood beside him. He took Goliath’s sword out of its holder and killed him by cutting off his head.
1SA.17.51	When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they turned and ran. 
1SA.17.52	The men of Israel and Judah shouted and chased the Philistines all the way to the entrance of the city of Gath and to the gates of Ekron.
1SA.17.52	The Philistines’ bodies lay on the Shaaraim road as far as Gath and Ekron. 
1SA.17.53	The Israelites returned after chasing the Philistines and robbed their camp. 
1SA.17.54	David took Goliath’s head to Jerusalem and put Goliath’s weapons in his own tent.
1SA.17.55	When Saul saw David go out to meet Goliath, Saul asked Abner, commander of the army, “Abner, who is that young man’s father?”
1SA.17.55	Abner answered, “As surely as you live, my king, I don’t know.”
1SA.17.56	The king said, “Find out whose son he is.”
1SA.17.57	When David came back from killing Goliath, Abner brought him to Saul. David was still holding Goliath’s head.
1SA.17.58	Saul asked him, “Young man, who is your father?”
1SA.17.58	David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.”
1SA.18.1	When David finished talking with Saul, Jonathan felt very close to David. He loved David as much as he loved himself. 
1SA.18.2	Saul kept David with him from that day on and did not let him go home to his father’s house. 
1SA.18.3	Jonathan made an agreement with David, because he loved David as much as himself. 
1SA.18.4	He took off his coat and gave it to David, along with his armor, including his sword, bow, and belt.
1SA.18.5	Saul sent David to fight in different battles, and David was very successful. Then Saul put David over the soldiers, which pleased Saul’s officers and all the other people.
1SA.18.6	After David had killed the Philistine, he and the men returned home. Women came out from all the towns of Israel to meet King Saul. They sang songs of joy, danced, and played tambourines and stringed instruments. 
1SA.18.7	As they played, they sang,
1SA.18.7	“Saul has killed thousands of his enemies,
1SA.18.7	but David has killed tens of thousands.”
1SA.18.8	The women’s song upset Saul, and he became very angry. He thought, “The women say David has killed tens of thousands, but they say I have killed only thousands. The only thing left for him to have is the kingdom!” 
1SA.18.9	So Saul watched David closely from then on, because he was jealous.
1SA.18.10	The next day an evil spirit from God rushed upon Saul, and he prophesied in his house. David was playing the harp as he usually did, but Saul had a spear in his hand. 
1SA.18.11	He threw the spear, thinking, “I’ll pin David to the wall.” But David escaped from him twice.
1SA.18.12	The L
1SA.18.13	He sent David away and made him commander of a thousand soldiers. So David led them in battle. 
1SA.18.14	He had great success in everything he did because the L
1SA.18.15	When Saul saw that David was very successful, he feared David even more. 
1SA.18.16	But all the people of Israel and Judah loved David because he led them well in battle.
1SA.18.17	Saul said to David, “Here is my older daughter Merab. I will let you marry her. All I ask is that you remain brave and fight the L
1SA.18.18	But David answered Saul, saying, “Who am I? My family is not important enough for me to become the king’s son-in-law.” 
1SA.18.19	So, when the time came for Saul’s daughter Merab to marry David, Saul gave her instead to Adriel of Meholah.
1SA.18.20	Now Saul’s other daughter, Michal, loved David. When they told Saul, he was pleased. 
1SA.18.21	He thought, “I will let her marry David. Then she will be a trap for him, and the Philistines will defeat him.” So Saul said to David a second time, “You may become my son-in-law.”
1SA.18.22	And Saul ordered his servants to talk with David in private and say, “Look, the king likes you. His servants love you. You should be his son-in-law.”
1SA.18.23	Saul’s servants said these words to David, but David answered, “Do you think it is easy to become the king’s son-in-law? I am poor and unimportant.”
1SA.18.24	When Saul’s servants told him what David had said, 
1SA.18.25	Saul said, “Tell David, ‘The king doesn’t want money for the bride. All he wants is a hundred Philistine foreskins to get even with his enemies.’ ” Saul planned to let the Philistines kill David.
1SA.18.26	When Saul’s servants told this to David, he was pleased to become the king’s son-in-law. 
1SA.18.27	So he and his men went out and killed two hundred Philistines. David brought all their foreskins to Saul so he could be the king’s son-in-law. Then Saul gave him his daughter Michal for his wife. 
1SA.18.28	Saul saw that the L
1SA.18.29	So he grew even more afraid of David, and he was David’s enemy all his life.
1SA.18.30	The Philistine commanders continued to go out to fight the Israelites, but every time, David was more skillful than Saul’s officers. So he became famous.
1SA.19.1	Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David, but Jonathan liked David very much. 
1SA.19.2	So he warned David, “My father Saul is looking for a chance to kill you. Watch out in the morning. Hide in a secret place. 
1SA.19.3	I will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are hiding, and I’ll talk to him about you. Then I’ll let you know what I find out.”
1SA.19.4	When Jonathan talked to Saul his father, he said good things about David. Jonathan said, “The king should do no wrong to your servant David since he has done nothing wrong to you. What he has done has helped you greatly. 
1SA.19.5	David risked his life when he killed Goliath the Philistine, and the L
1SA.19.6	Saul listened to Jonathan and then made this promise: “As surely as the L
1SA.19.7	So Jonathan called to David and told him everything that had been said. He brought David to Saul, and David was with Saul as before.
1SA.19.8	When war broke out again, David went out to fight the Philistines. He defeated them, and they ran away from him.
1SA.19.9	But once again an evil spirit from the L
1SA.19.10	Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear, but David jumped out of the way. So Saul’s spear went into the wall, and David ran away that night.
1SA.19.11	Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch it and to kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, warned him, saying, “Tonight you must run for your life. If you don’t, you will be dead in the morning.” 
1SA.19.12	So she let David down out of a window, and he ran away and escaped. 
1SA.19.13	Then Michal took an idol, laid it on the bed, covered it with clothes, and put goats’ hair at its head.
1SA.19.14	Saul sent messengers to take David prisoner, but Michal said, “He is sick.”
1SA.19.15	Saul sent them back to see David, saying, “Bring him to me on his bed so I can kill him.”
1SA.19.16	When the messengers entered David’s house, they found just an idol on the bed with goats’ hair on its head.
1SA.19.17	Saul said to Michal, “Why did you trick me this way? You let my enemy go so he could run away!”
1SA.19.17	Michal answered Saul, “David told me if I did not help him escape, he would kill me.”
1SA.19.18	After David had escaped from Saul, he went to Samuel at Ramah and told him everything Saul had done to him. Then David and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. 
1SA.19.19	Saul heard that David was in Naioth at Ramah. 
1SA.19.20	So he sent messengers to capture him. But they met a group of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing there leading them. So the Spirit of God entered Saul’s men, and they also prophesied.
1SA.19.21	When Saul heard the news, he sent more messengers, but they also prophesied. Then he sent messengers a third time, but they also prophesied. 
1SA.19.22	Finally, Saul himself went to Ramah, to the well at Secu. He asked, “Where are Samuel and David?”
1SA.19.22	The people answered, “In Naioth at Ramah.”
1SA.19.23	When Saul went to Naioth at Ramah, the Spirit of God also rushed upon him. And he walked on, prophesying until he came to Naioth at Ramah. 
1SA.19.24	He took off his robes and prophesied in front of Samuel. He lay that way all day and all night. That is why people ask, “Is even Saul one of the prophets?”
1SA.20.1	Then David ran away from Naioth in Ramah. He went to Jonathan and asked, “What have I done? What is my crime? How did I sin against your father? Why is he trying to kill me?”
1SA.20.2	Jonathan answered, “No! You won’t die! See, my father doesn’t do anything great or small without first telling me. Why would he keep this from me? It’s not true!”
1SA.20.3	But David took an oath, saying, “Your father knows very well that you like me. He says to himself, ‘Jonathan must not know about it, or he will tell David.’ As surely as the L
1SA.20.4	Jonathan said to David, “I’ll do anything you want me to do.”
1SA.20.5	So David said, “Look, tomorrow is the New Moon festival. I am supposed to eat with the king, but let me hide in the field until the third evening. 
1SA.20.6	If your father notices I am gone, tell him, ‘David begged me to let him go to his hometown of Bethlehem. Every year at this time his family group offers a sacrifice.’ 
1SA.20.7	If your father says, ‘Fine,’ I am safe. But if he becomes angry, you will know that he wants to hurt me. 
1SA.20.8	Jonathan, be loyal to me, your servant. You have made an agreement with me before the L
1SA.20.9	Jonathan answered, “No, never! If I learn that my father plans to hurt you, I will warn you!”
1SA.20.10	David asked, “Who will let me know if your father answers you unkindly?”
1SA.20.11	Then Jonathan said, “Come, let’s go out into the field.” So the two of them went out into the field.
1SA.20.12	Jonathan said to David, “I promise this before the L
1SA.20.13	But if my father plans to hurt you, I will let you know and send you away safely. May the L
1SA.20.14	But show me the kindness of the L
1SA.20.15	You must never stop showing your kindness to my family, even when the L
1SA.20.16	So Jonathan made an agreement with David. He said, “May the L
1SA.20.17	And Jonathan asked David to repeat his promise of love for him, because he loved David as much as he loved himself.
1SA.20.18	Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon festival. Your seat will be empty, so my father will miss you. 
1SA.20.19	On the third day go to the place where you hid when this trouble began. Wait by the rock Ezel. 
1SA.20.20	On the third day I will shoot three arrows to the side of the rock as if I am shooting at a target. 
1SA.20.21	Then I will send a boy to find the arrows. If I say to him, ‘The arrows are near you; bring them here,’ you may come out of hiding. You are safe. As the L
1SA.20.22	But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ you must go, because the L
1SA.20.23	Remember what we talked about. The L
1SA.20.24	So David hid in the field. When the New Moon festival came, the king sat down to eat. 
1SA.20.25	He sat where he always sat, near the wall. Jonathan sat across from him, and Abner sat next to Saul, but David’s place was empty. 
1SA.20.26	That day Saul said nothing. He thought, “Maybe something has happened to David so that he is unclean.” 
1SA.20.27	But the next day was the second day of the month, and David’s place was still empty. So Saul said to Jonathan, “Why hasn’t the son of Jesse come to the feast yesterday or today?”
1SA.20.28	Jonathan answered, “David begged me to let him go to Bethlehem. 
1SA.20.29	He said, ‘Let me go, because our family has a sacrifice in the town, and my brother has ordered me to be there. Now if I am your friend, please let me go to see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”
1SA.20.30	Then Saul became very angry with Jonathan. He said, “You son of a wicked, worthless woman! I know you are on the side of David son of Jesse! You bring shame on yourself and on your mother who gave birth to you. 
1SA.20.31	As long as Jesse’s son lives, you will never be king or have a kingdom. Now send for David and bring him to me. He must die!”
1SA.20.32	Jonathan asked his father, “Why should David be killed? What wrong has he done?” 
1SA.20.33	Then Saul threw his spear at Jonathan, trying to kill him. So Jonathan knew that his father really wanted to kill David. 
1SA.20.34	Jonathan was very angry and left the table. That second day of the month he refused to eat. He was ashamed of his father and upset over David.
1SA.20.35	The next morning Jonathan went out to the field to meet David as they had agreed. He had a young boy with him. 
1SA.20.36	Jonathan said to the boy, “Run and find the arrows I shoot.” When he ran, Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him. 
1SA.20.37	The boy ran to the place where Jonathan’s arrow fell, but Jonathan called, “The arrow is beyond you!” 
1SA.20.38	Then he shouted, “Hurry! Go quickly! Don’t stop!” The boy picked up the arrow and brought it back to his master. 
1SA.20.39	(The boy knew nothing about what this meant; only Jonathan and David knew.) 
1SA.20.40	Then Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him, “Go back to town.”
1SA.20.41	When the boy left, David came out from the south side of the rock. He bowed facedown on the ground before Jonathan three times. Then David and Jonathan kissed each other and cried together, but David cried the most.
1SA.20.42	Jonathan said to David, “Go in peace. We have promised by the L
1SA.21.1	David went to Nob to see Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech shook with fear when he saw David, and he asked, “Why are you alone? Why is no one with you?”
1SA.21.2	David answered him, “The king gave me a special order. He told me, ‘No one must know what I am sending you to do or what I told you to do.’ I told my men where to meet me. 
1SA.21.3	Now, what food do you have with you? Give me five loaves of bread or anything you find.”
1SA.21.4	The priest said to David, “I don’t have any plain bread here, but I do have some holy bread. You may eat it if your men have kept themselves from women.”
1SA.21.5	David answered, “No women have been near us for days. My men always keep themselves holy, even when we do ordinary work. And this is especially true when the work is holy.”
1SA.21.6	So the priest gave David the holy bread from the presence of God because there was no other. Each day the holy bread was replaced with hot bread.
1SA.21.7	One of Saul’s servants happened to be there that day. He had been held there before the L
1SA.21.8	David asked Ahimelech, “Do you have a spear or sword here? The king’s business was very important, so I left without my sword or any other weapon.”
1SA.21.9	The priest answered, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, the one you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here. It is wrapped in a cloth behind the holy vest. If you want it, you may take it. There’s no other sword here but that one.”
1SA.21.9	David said, “There is no other sword like it. Give it to me.”
1SA.21.10	That day David ran away from Saul and went to Achish king of Gath. 
1SA.21.11	But the servants of Achish said to him, “This is David, the king of the Israelites. He’s the man they dance and sing about, saying:
1SA.21.11	‘Saul has killed thousands of his enemies,
1SA.21.11	but David has killed tens of thousands.’ ”
1SA.21.12	David paid attention to these words and was very much afraid of Achish king of Gath. 
1SA.21.13	So he pretended to be crazy in front of Achish and his servants. While he was with them, he acted like a madman and clawed on the doors of the gate and let spit run down his beard.
1SA.21.14	Achish said to his servants, “Look at the man! He’s crazy! Why do you bring him to me? 
1SA.21.15	I have enough madmen. I don’t need you to bring him here to act like this in front of me! Don’t let him in my house!”
1SA.22.1	David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. When his brothers and other relatives heard that he was there, they went to see him. 
1SA.22.2	Everyone who was in trouble, or who owed money, or who was unsatisfied gathered around David, and he became their leader. About four hundred men were with him.
1SA.22.3	From there David went to Mizpah in Moab and spoke to the king of Moab. He said, “Please let my father and mother come and stay with you until I learn what God is going to do for me.” 
1SA.22.4	So he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him as long as David was hiding in the stronghold.
1SA.22.5	But the prophet Gad said to David, “Don’t stay in the stronghold. Go to the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.
1SA.22.6	Saul heard that David and his men had been seen. Saul was sitting under the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, and all his officers were standing around him. He had a spear in his hand. 
1SA.22.7	Saul said to them, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Do you think the son of Jesse will give all of you fields and vineyards? Will David make you commanders over thousands of men or hundreds of men? 
1SA.22.8	You have all made plans against me! No one tells me when my son makes an agreement with the son of Jesse! No one cares about me! No one tells me when my son has encouraged my servant to ambush me this very day!”
1SA.22.9	Doeg the Edomite, who was standing there with Saul’s officers, said, “I saw the son of Jesse. He came to see Ahimelech son of Ahitub at Nob. 
1SA.22.10	Ahimelech prayed to the L
1SA.22.11	Then the king sent for the priest Ahimelech son of Ahitub and for all of Ahimelech’s relatives who were priests at Nob. And they all came to the king. 
1SA.22.12	Saul said to Ahimelech, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.”
1SA.22.12	Ahimelech answered, “Yes, master.”
1SA.22.13	Saul said, “Why are you and Jesse’s son against me? You gave him bread and a sword! You prayed to God for him. David has turned against me and is waiting to attack me even now!”
1SA.22.14	Ahimelech answered, “You have no other servant who is as loyal as David, your own son-in-law and captain of your bodyguards. Everyone in your house respects him. 
1SA.22.15	That was not the first time I prayed to God for David. Don’t blame me or any of my relatives. I, your servant, know nothing about what is going on.”
1SA.22.16	But the king said, “Ahimelech, you and all your relatives must die!” 
1SA.22.17	Then he told the guards at his side, “Go and kill the priests of the L
1SA.22.17	But the king’s officers refused to kill the priests of the L
1SA.22.18	Then the king ordered Doeg, “Go and kill the priests.” So Doeg the Edomite went and killed the priests. That day he killed eighty-five men who wore the linen holy vest. 
1SA.22.19	He also killed the people of Nob, the city of the priests. With the sword he killed men, women, children, babies, cattle, donkeys, and sheep.
1SA.22.20	But Abiathar, a son of Ahimelech, who was the son of Ahitub, escaped. He ran away and joined David. 
1SA.22.21	He told David that Saul had killed the L
1SA.22.22	Then David told him, “Doeg the Edomite was there at Nob that day. I knew he would surely tell Saul. So I am responsible for the death of all your father’s family. 
1SA.22.23	Stay with me. Don’t be afraid. The man who wants to kill you also wants to kill me. You will be safe with me.”
1SA.23.1	Someone told David, “Look, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and stealing grain from the threshing floors.”
1SA.23.2	David asked the L
1SA.23.2	The L
1SA.23.3	But David’s men said to him, “We’re afraid here in Judah. We will be more afraid if we go to Keilah where the Philistine army is.”
1SA.23.4	David again asked the L
1SA.23.5	So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines and took their cattle. David killed many Philistines and saved the people of Keilah. 
1SA.23.6	(Now Abiathar son of Ahimelech had brought the holy vest with him when he came to David at Keilah.)
1SA.23.7	Someone told Saul that David was now at Keilah. Saul said, “God has handed David over to me! He has trapped himself, because he has entered a town with gates and bars.” 
1SA.23.8	Saul called all his army together for battle, and they prepared to go down to Keilah to attack David and his men.
1SA.23.9	David learned Saul was making evil plans against him. So he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the holy vest.” 
1SA.23.10	David prayed, “L
1SA.23.11	Will the leaders of Keilah hand me over to Saul? Will Saul come down to Keilah, as I heard? L
1SA.23.11	The L
1SA.23.12	Again David asked, “Will the leaders of Keilah hand me and my men over to Saul?”
1SA.23.12	The L
1SA.23.13	So David and his six hundred men left Keilah and kept moving from place to place. When Saul found out that David had escaped from Keilah, he did not go there.
1SA.23.14	David stayed in the desert hideouts and in the hills of the Desert of Ziph. Every day Saul looked for David, but the L
1SA.23.15	While David was at Horesh in the Desert of Ziph, he learned that Saul was coming to kill him. 
1SA.23.16	But Saul’s son Jonathan went to David at Horesh and strengthened his faith in God. 
1SA.23.17	Jonathan told him, “Don’t be afraid, because my father won’t touch you. You will be king of Israel, and I will be second to you. Even my father Saul knows this.” 
1SA.23.18	The two of them made an agreement before the L
1SA.23.19	The people from Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and told him, “David is hiding in our land. He’s at the hideouts of Horesh, on the hill of Hakilah, south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.20	Now, our king, come down anytime you want. It’s our duty to hand David over to you.”
1SA.23.21	Saul answered, “The L
1SA.23.22	Go and learn more about him. Find out where he is staying and who has seen him there. I have heard that he is clever. 
1SA.23.23	Find all the hiding places he uses, and come back and tell me everything. Then I’ll go with you. If David is in the area, I will track him down among all the families in Judah.”
1SA.23.24	So they went back to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Desert of Maon in the desert area south of Jeshimon. 
1SA.23.25	Saul and his men went to look for David, but David heard about it and went down to a rock and stayed in the Desert of Maon. When Saul heard that, he followed David into the Desert of Maon.
1SA.23.26	Saul was going along one side of the mountain, and David and his men were on the other side. They were hurrying to get away from Saul, because Saul and his men were closing in on them. 
1SA.23.27	But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Come quickly! The Philistines are attacking our land!” 
1SA.23.28	So Saul stopped chasing David and went to challenge the Philistines. That is why people call this place Rock of Parting. 
1SA.23.29	David also left the Desert of Maon and stayed in the hideouts of En Gedi.
1SA.24.1	After Saul returned from chasing the Philistines, he was told, “David is in the Desert of En Gedi.” 
1SA.24.2	So he took three thousand chosen men from all Israel and began looking for David and his men near the Rocks of the Wild Goats.
1SA.24.3	Saul came to the sheep pens beside the road. A cave was there, and he went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were hiding far back in the cave. 
1SA.24.4	The men said to David, “Today is the day the L
1SA.24.4	Then David crept up to Saul and quietly cut off a corner of Saul’s robe. 
1SA.24.5	Later David felt guilty because he had cut off a corner of Saul’s robe. 
1SA.24.6	He said to his men, “May the L
1SA.24.7	David used these words to stop his men; he did not let them attack Saul. Then Saul left the cave and went his way.
1SA.24.8	When David came out of the cave, he shouted to Saul, “My master and king!” Saul looked back, and David bowed facedown on the ground. 
1SA.24.9	He said to Saul, “Why do you listen when people say, ‘David wants to harm you’? 
1SA.24.10	You have seen something with your own eyes today. The L
1SA.24.11	My father, look at this piece of your robe in my hand! I cut off the corner of your robe, but I didn’t kill you. Now understand and know I am not planning any evil against you. I did nothing wrong to you, but you are hunting me to kill me. 
1SA.24.12	May the L
1SA.24.13	There is an old saying: ‘Evil things come from evil people.’ But I am not against you. 
1SA.24.14	Whom is the king of Israel coming out against? Whom are you chasing? It’s as if you are chasing a dead dog or a flea. 
1SA.24.15	May the L
1SA.24.16	When David finished saying these words, Saul asked, “Is that your voice, David my son?” And he cried loudly. 
1SA.24.17	He said, “You are a better man than I am. You have been good to me, but I have done wrong to you. 
1SA.24.18	You told me what good things you did. The L
1SA.24.19	People don’t normally let an enemy get away like this, do they? May the L
1SA.24.20	I know you will surely be king, and you will rule the kingdom of Israel. 
1SA.24.21	Now swear to me by the L
1SA.24.22	So David made the promise to Saul. Then Saul went back home, and David and his men went up to their hideout.
1SA.25.1	Now Samuel died, and all the Israelites met and had a time of sadness for him. Then they buried him at his home in Ramah.
1SA.25.1	David moved to the Desert of Maon. 
1SA.25.2	A man in Maon who had land at Carmel was very rich. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was cutting the wool off his sheep at Carmel. 
1SA.25.3	His name was Nabal, and he was a descendant of Caleb. His wife was named Abigail. She was wise and beautiful, but Nabal was cruel and mean.
1SA.25.4	While David was in the desert, he heard that Nabal was cutting the wool from his sheep. 
1SA.25.5	So he sent ten young men and told them, “Go to Nabal at Carmel, and greet him for me. 
1SA.25.6	Say to Nabal, ‘May you and your family and all who belong to you have good health! 
1SA.25.7	I have heard that you are cutting the wool from your sheep. When your shepherds were with us, we did not harm them. All the time your shepherds were at Carmel, we stole nothing from them. 
1SA.25.8	Ask your servants, and they will tell you. We come at a happy time, so be kind to my young men. Please give anything you can find for them and for your son David.’ ”
1SA.25.9	When David’s men arrived, they gave the message to Nabal, but Nabal insulted them. 
1SA.25.10	He answered them, “Who is David? Who is this son of Jesse? Many slaves are running away from their masters today! 
1SA.25.11	I have bread and water, and I have meat that I killed for my servants who cut the wool. But I won’t give it to men I don’t know.”
1SA.25.12	David’s men went back and told him all Nabal had said. 
1SA.25.13	Then David said to them, “Put on your swords!” So they put on their swords, and David put on his also. About four hundred men went with David, but two hundred men stayed with the supplies.
1SA.25.14	One of Nabal’s servants said to Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “David sent messengers from the desert to greet our master, but Nabal insulted them. 
1SA.25.15	These men were very good to us. They did not harm us. They stole nothing from us during all the time we were out in the field with them. 
1SA.25.16	Night and day they protected us. They were like a wall around us while we were with them caring for the sheep. 
1SA.25.17	Now think about it, and decide what you can do. Terrible trouble is coming to our master and all his family. Nabal is such a wicked man that no one can even talk to him.”
1SA.25.18	Abigail hurried. She took two hundred loaves of bread, two leather bags full of wine, five cooked sheep, a bushel of cooked grain, a hundred cakes of raisins, and two hundred cakes of pressed figs and put all these on donkeys. 
1SA.25.19	Then she told her servants, “Go on. I’ll follow you.” But she did not tell her husband.
1SA.25.20	Abigail rode her donkey and came down toward the mountain hideout. There she met David and his men coming down toward her.
1SA.25.21	David had just said, “It’s been useless! I watched over Nabal’s property in the desert. I made sure none of his sheep was missing. I did good to him, but he has paid me back with evil. 
1SA.25.22	May God punish my enemies even more. I will not leave one of Nabal’s men alive until morning.”
1SA.25.23	When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed facedown on the ground before him. 
1SA.25.24	She fell at David’s feet and said, “My master, let the blame be on me! Please let me talk to you. Listen to what I say. 
1SA.25.25	My master, don’t pay attention to this worthless man Nabal. He is like his name. His name means ‘fool,’ and he is truly a fool. But I, your servant, didn’t see the men you sent. 
1SA.25.26	The L
1SA.25.27	I have brought a gift to you for the men who follow you.
1SA.25.28	Please forgive my wrong. The L
1SA.25.29	Someone might chase you to kill you, but the L
1SA.25.30	The L
1SA.25.31	Then you won’t feel guilty or troubled because you killed innocent people and punished them. Please remember me when the L
1SA.25.32	David answered Abigail, “Praise the L
1SA.25.33	May you be blessed for your wisdom. You have kept me from killing or punishing people today. 
1SA.25.34	As surely as the L
1SA.25.35	Then David accepted Abigail’s gifts. He told her, “Go home in peace. I have heard your words, and I will do what you have asked.”
1SA.25.36	When Abigail went back to Nabal, he was in the house, eating like a king. He was very drunk and in a good mood. So she told him nothing until the next morning. 
1SA.25.37	In the morning when he was not drunk, his wife told him everything. His heart stopped, and he became like stone. 
1SA.25.38	About ten days later the L
1SA.25.39	When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Praise the L
1SA.25.39	Then David sent a message to Abigail, asking her to be his wife. 
1SA.25.40	His servants went to Carmel and said to Abigail, “David sent us to take you so you can become his wife.”
1SA.25.41	Abigail bowed facedown on the ground and said, “I am your servant. I’m ready to serve you and to wash the feet of my master’s servants.” 
1SA.25.42	Abigail quickly got on a donkey and went with David’s messengers, with her five maids following her. And she became David’s wife.
1SA.25.43	David also had married Ahinoam of Jezreel. So they were both David’s wives. 
1SA.25.44	Saul’s daughter Michal was also David’s wife, but Saul had given her to Paltiel son of Laish, who was from Gallim.
1SA.26.1	The people of Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and said to him, “David is hiding on the hill of Hakilah opposite Jeshimon.”
1SA.26.2	So Saul went down to the Desert of Ziph with three thousand chosen men of Israel to look for David there. 
1SA.26.3	Saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of Hakilah opposite Jeshimon, but David stayed in the desert. When he heard Saul had followed him, 
1SA.26.4	he sent out spies and learned for certain that Saul had come to Hakilah.
1SA.26.5	Then David went to the place where Saul had camped. He saw where Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul’s army, were sleeping. Saul was sleeping in the middle of the camp with all the army around him.
1SA.26.6	David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, “Who will go down into Saul’s camp with me?”
1SA.26.6	Abishai answered, “I’ll go with you.”
1SA.26.7	So that night David and Abishai went into Saul’s camp. Saul was asleep in the middle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the army were sleeping around Saul. 
1SA.26.8	Abishai said to David, “Today God has handed your enemy over to you. Let me pin Saul to the ground with my spear. I’ll only have to do it once. I won’t need to hit him twice.”
1SA.26.9	But David said to Abishai, “Don’t kill Saul! No one can harm the L
1SA.26.10	As surely as the L
1SA.26.11	But may the L
1SA.26.12	So David took the spear and water jug that were near Saul’s head, and they left. No one saw them or knew about it or woke up, because the L
1SA.26.13	David crossed over to the other side of the hill and stood on top of the mountain far from Saul’s camp. They were a long way away from each other. 
1SA.26.14	David shouted to the army and to Abner son of Ner, “Won’t you answer me, Abner?”
1SA.26.14	Abner answered, “Who is calling for the king? Who are you?”
1SA.26.15	David said, “You’re the greatest man in Israel. Isn’t that true? Why didn’t you guard your master the king? Someone came into your camp to kill your master the king! 
1SA.26.16	You have not done well. As surely as the L
1SA.26.17	Saul knew David’s voice. He said, “Is that your voice, David my son?”
1SA.26.17	David answered, “Yes, it is, my master and king.” 
1SA.26.18	David also said, “Why are you chasing me, my master? What wrong have I done? What evil am I guilty of? 
1SA.26.19	My master and king, listen to me. If the L
1SA.26.20	Now don’t let me die far away from the L
1SA.26.21	Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Come back, David my son. Today you respected my life, so I will not try to hurt you. I have been very stupid and foolish.”
1SA.26.22	David answered, “Here is your spear. Let one of your young men come here and get it. 
1SA.26.23	The L
1SA.26.24	As I respected your life today, may the L
1SA.26.25	Then Saul said to David, “You are blessed, my son David. You will do great things and succeed.”
1SA.26.25	So David went on his way, and Saul went back home.
1SA.27.1	But David thought to himself, “Saul will catch me someday. The best thing I can do is escape to the land of the Philistines. Then he will give up looking for me in Israel, and I can get away from him.”
1SA.27.2	So David and his six hundred men left Israel and went to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
1SA.27.3	David, his men, and their families made their home in Gath with Achish. David had his two wives with him—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail of Carmel, the widow of Nabal. 
1SA.27.4	When Saul heard that David had run away to Gath, he stopped looking for him.
1SA.27.5	Then David said to Achish, “If you are pleased with me, give me a place in one of the country towns where I can live. I don’t need to live in the royal city with you.”
1SA.27.6	That day Achish gave David the town of Ziklag, and Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. 
1SA.27.7	David lived in the Philistine land a year and four months.
1SA.27.8	David and his men raided the people of Geshur, Girzi, and Amalek. (These people had lived for a long time in the land that reached to Shur and Egypt.) 
1SA.27.9	When David fought them, he killed all the men and women and took their sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothes. Then he returned to Achish.
1SA.27.10	Achish would ask David, “Where did you go raiding today?” And David would tell him that he had gone to the southern part of Judah, or Jerahmeel, or to the land of the Kenites. 
1SA.27.11	David never brought a man or woman alive to Gath. He thought, “If we bring people alive, they may tell Achish, ‘This is what David really did.’ ” David did this all the time he lived in the Philistine land. 
1SA.27.12	So Achish trusted David and said to himself, “David’s own people, the Israelites, now hate him very much. He will serve me forever.”
1SA.28.1	Later, the Philistines gathered their armies to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “You understand that you and your men must join my army.”
1SA.28.2	David answered, “You will see for yourself what I, your servant, can do!”
1SA.28.2	Achish said, “Fine, I’ll make you my permanent bodyguard.”
1SA.28.3	Now Samuel was dead, and all the Israelites had shown their sadness for him. They had buried Samuel in his hometown of Ramah.
1SA.28.3	And Saul had forced out the mediums and fortune-tellers from the land.
1SA.28.4	The Philistines came together and made camp at Shunem. Saul gathered all the Israelites and made camp at Gilboa. 
1SA.28.5	When he saw the Philistine army, he was afraid, and his heart pounded with fear. 
1SA.28.6	He prayed to the L
1SA.28.7	Then Saul said to his servants, “Find me a woman who is a medium so I may go and ask her what will happen.”
1SA.28.7	His servants answered, “There is a medium in Endor.”
1SA.28.8	Then Saul put on other clothes to disguise himself, and at night he and two of his men went to see the woman. Saul said to her, “Talk to a spirit for me. Bring up the person I name.”
1SA.28.9	But the woman said to him, “Surely you know what Saul has done. He has forced the mediums and fortune-tellers from the land. You are trying to trap me and get me killed.”
1SA.28.10	Saul made a promise to the woman in the name of the L
1SA.28.11	The woman asked, “Whom do you want me to bring up?”
1SA.28.11	He answered, “Bring up Samuel.”
1SA.28.12	When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed. She said, “Why have you tricked me? You are Saul!”
1SA.28.13	The king said to the woman, “Don’t be afraid! What do you see?”
1SA.28.13	The woman said, “I see a spirit coming up out of the ground.”
1SA.28.14	Saul asked, “What does he look like?”
1SA.28.14	The woman answered, “An old man wearing a coat is coming up.”
1SA.28.14	Then Saul knew it was Samuel, and he bowed facedown on the ground.
1SA.28.15	Samuel asked Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?”
1SA.28.15	Saul said, “I am greatly troubled. The Philistines are fighting against me, and God has left me. He won’t answer me anymore, either by prophets or in dreams. That’s why I called for you. Tell me what to do.”
1SA.28.16	Samuel said, “The L
1SA.28.17	He has done what he said he would do—the things he said through me. He has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors, David. 
1SA.28.18	You did not obey the L
1SA.28.19	The L
1SA.28.20	Saul quickly fell flat on the ground and was afraid of what Samuel had said. He was also very weak because he had eaten nothing all that day and night.
1SA.28.21	Then the woman came to Saul and saw that he was really frightened. She said, “Look, I, your servant, have obeyed you. I have risked my life and done what you told me to do. 
1SA.28.22	Now please listen to me. Let me give you some food so you may eat and have enough strength to go on your way.”
1SA.28.23	But Saul refused, saying, “I won’t eat.”
1SA.28.23	His servants joined the woman in asking him to eat, and he listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
1SA.28.24	At the house the woman had a fat calf, which she quickly killed. She took some flour and mixed dough with her hands. Then she baked some bread without yeast. 
1SA.28.25	She put the food before them, and they ate. That same night they got up and left.
1SA.29.1	The Philistines gathered all their soldiers at Aphek. Israel camped by the spring at Jezreel. 
1SA.29.2	The Philistine kings were marching with their groups of a hundred and a thousand men. David and his men were marching behind Achish. 
1SA.29.3	The Philistine commanders asked, “What are these Hebrews doing here?”
1SA.29.3	Achish told them, “This is David. He served Saul king of Israel, but he has been with me for over a year now. I have found nothing wrong in David since the time he left Saul.”
1SA.29.4	But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said, “Send David back to the city you gave him. He cannot go with us into battle. If he does, we’ll have an enemy in our own camp. He could please his king by killing our own men. 
1SA.29.5	David is the one the Israelites dance and sing about, saying:
1SA.29.5	‘Saul has killed thousands of his enemies,
1SA.29.5	but David has killed tens of thousands.’ ”
1SA.29.6	So Achish called David and said to him, “As surely as the L
1SA.29.7	Go back in peace. Don’t do anything to displease the Philistine kings.”
1SA.29.8	David asked, “What wrong have I done? What evil have you found in me from the day I came to you until now? Why can’t I go fight your enemies, my lord and king?”
1SA.29.9	Achish answered, “I know you are as good as an angel from God. But the Philistine commanders have said, ‘David must not go with us into battle.’ 
1SA.29.10	Early in the morning you and your master’s servants should leave. Get up as soon as it is light and go.”
1SA.29.11	So David and his men got up early in the morning and went back to the country of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
1SA.30.1	On the third day, when David and his men arrived at Ziklag, he found that the Amalekites had raided southern Judah and Ziklag, attacking Ziklag and burning it. 
1SA.30.2	They captured the women and everyone, young and old, but they had not killed anyone. They had only taken them away.
1SA.30.3	When David and his men came to Ziklag, they found the town had been burned and their wives, sons, and daughters had been taken as prisoners. 
1SA.30.4	Then David and his army cried loudly until they were too weak to cry anymore. 
1SA.30.5	David’s two wives had also been taken—Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal from Carmel. 
1SA.30.6	The men in the army were threatening to kill David with stones, which greatly upset David. Each man was sad and angry because his sons and daughters had been captured, but David found strength in the L
1SA.30.7	David said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring me the holy vest.”
1SA.30.8	Then David asked the L
1SA.30.8	The L
1SA.30.9	David and the six hundred men with him came to the Besor Ravine, where some of the men stayed. 
1SA.30.10	David and four hundred men kept up the chase. The other two hundred men stayed behind because they were too tired to cross the ravine.
1SA.30.11	They found an Egyptian in a field and brought him to David. They gave the Egyptian some water to drink and some food to eat. 
1SA.30.12	And they gave him a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins. Then he felt better, because he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and nights.
1SA.30.13	David asked him, “Who is your master? Where do you come from?”
1SA.30.13	He answered, “I’m an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite. Three days ago my master left me, because I was sick. 
1SA.30.14	We had raided the southern area of the Kerethites, the land of Judah, and the southern area of Caleb. We burned Ziklag, as well.”
1SA.30.15	David asked him, “Can you lead me to the people who took our families?”
1SA.30.15	He answered, “Yes, if you promise me before God that you won’t kill me or give me back to my master. Then I will take you to them.”
1SA.30.16	So the Egyptian led David to the Amalekites. They were lying around on the ground, eating and drinking and celebrating with the things they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from Judah. 
1SA.30.17	David fought them from sunset until the evening of the next day. None of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode off on their camels. 
1SA.30.18	David got his two wives back and everything the Amalekites had taken. 
1SA.30.19	Nothing was missing. David brought back everyone, young and old, sons and daughters. He recovered the valuable things and everything the Amalekites had taken. 
1SA.30.20	David took all the sheep and cattle, and his men made these animals go in front, saying, “They are David’s prize.”
1SA.30.21	Then David came to the two hundred men who had been too tired to follow him, who had stayed at the Besor Ravine. They came out to meet David and the people with him. When he came near, David greeted the men at the ravine.
1SA.30.22	But the evil men and troublemakers among those who followed David said, “Since these two hundred men didn’t go with us, we shouldn’t give them any of the things we recovered. Just let each man take his wife and children and go.”
1SA.30.23	David answered, “No, my brothers. Don’t do that after what the L
1SA.30.24	Who will listen to what you say? The share will be the same for the one who stayed with the supplies as for the one who went into battle. All will share alike.” 
1SA.30.25	David made this an order and rule for Israel, which continues even today.
1SA.30.26	When David arrived in Ziklag, he sent some of the things he had taken from the Amalekites to his friends, the leaders of Judah. He said, “Here is a present for you from the things we took from the L
1SA.30.27	David also sent some things to the leaders in Bethel, Ramoth in the southern part of Judah, Jattir, 
1SA.30.28	Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
1SA.30.29	Racal, the cities of the Jerahmeelites and the Kenites, 
1SA.30.30	Hormah, Bor Ashan, Athach, 
1SA.30.31	Hebron, and to the people in all the other places where he and his men had been.
1SA.31.1	The Philistines fought against Israel, and the Israelites ran away from them. Many Israelites were killed on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.2	The Philistines fought hard against Saul and his sons, killing his sons Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua. 
1SA.31.3	The fighting was heavy around Saul. The archers shot him, and he was badly wounded. 
1SA.31.4	He said to the officer who carried his armor, “Pull out your sword and kill me. Then those uncircumcised men won’t make fun of me and kill me.” But Saul’s officer refused, because he was afraid. So Saul took his own sword and threw himself on it. 
1SA.31.5	When the officer saw that Saul was dead, he threw himself on his own sword, and he died with Saul. 
1SA.31.6	So Saul, his three sons, and the officer who carried his armor died together that day.
1SA.31.7	When the Israelites who lived across the Jezreel Valley and those who lived across the Jordan River saw how the Israelite army had run away, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they left their cities and ran away. Then the Philistines came and lived there.
1SA.31.8	The next day when the Philistines came to take all the valuable things from the dead soldiers, they found Saul and his three sons dead on Mount Gilboa. 
1SA.31.9	They cut off Saul’s head and took off his armor. Then they sent messengers through all the land of the Philistines to tell the news in the temple of their idols and to their people. 
1SA.31.10	They put Saul’s armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths and hung his body on the wall of Beth Shan.
1SA.31.11	When the people living in Jabesh Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
1SA.31.12	the brave men of Jabesh marched all night and came to Beth Shan. They removed the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth Shan and brought them to Jabesh. There they burned the bodies. 
1SA.31.13	They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh. Then the people of Jabesh fasted for seven days.
2SA.1.1	Now Saul was dead. After David had defeated the Amalekites, he returned to Ziklag and stayed there two days. 
2SA.1.2	On the third day a young man from Saul’s camp came to Ziklag. To show his sadness, his clothes were torn and he had dirt on his head. He came and bowed facedown on the ground before David.
2SA.1.3	David asked him, “Where did you come from?”
2SA.1.3	The man answered, “I escaped from the Israelite camp.”
2SA.1.4	David asked him, “What happened? Please tell me!”
2SA.1.4	The man answered, “The people have run away from the battle, and many of them have fallen and are dead. Saul and his son Jonathan are dead also.”
2SA.1.5	David asked him, “How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?”
2SA.1.6	The young man answered, “I happened to be on Mount Gilboa. There I saw Saul leaning on his spear. The Philistine chariots and the men riding in them were coming closer to Saul. 
2SA.1.7	When he looked back and saw me, he called to me. I answered him, ‘Here I am!’
2SA.1.8	“Then Saul asked me, ‘Who are you?’
2SA.1.8	“I told him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’
2SA.1.9	“Then Saul said to me, ‘Please come here and kill me. I am badly hurt and am almost dead already.’
2SA.1.10	“So I went over and killed him. He had been hurt so badly I knew he couldn’t live. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm, and I have brought them here to you, my master.”
2SA.1.11	Then David tore his clothes to show his sorrow, and all the men with him did also. 
2SA.1.12	They were very sad and cried and fasted until evening. They cried for Saul and his son Jonathan and for all the people of the L
2SA.1.13	David asked the young man who brought the report, “Where are you from?”
2SA.1.13	The young man answered, “I am the son of a foreigner, an Amalekite.”
2SA.1.14	David asked him, “Why were you not afraid to kill the L
2SA.1.15	Then David called one of his men and told him, “Go! Kill the Amalekite!” So the Israelite killed him. 
2SA.1.16	David had said to the Amalekite, “You are responsible for your own death. You confessed by saying, ‘I have killed the L
2SA.1.17	David sang a funeral song about Saul and his son Jonathan, 
2SA.1.18	and he ordered that the people of Judah be taught this song. It is called “The Bow,” and it is written in the Book of Jashar:
2SA.1.19	“Israel, your leaders have been killed on the hills.
2SA.1.19	How the mighty have fallen in battle!
2SA.1.20	Don’t tell it in Gath.
2SA.1.20	Don’t announce it in the streets of Ashkelon.
2SA.1.20	If you do, the Philistine women will be happy.
2SA.1.20	The daughters of the Philistines will rejoice.
2SA.1.21	“May there be no dew or rain on the mountains of Gilboa,
2SA.1.21	and may their fields produce no grain,
2SA.1.21	because there the mighty warrior’s shield was dishonored.
2SA.1.21	Saul’s shield will no longer be rubbed with oil.
2SA.1.22	Jonathan’s bow did not fail
2SA.1.22	to kill many soldiers.
2SA.1.22	Saul’s sword did not fail
2SA.1.22	to wound many strong men.
2SA.1.23	“We loved Saul and Jonathan
2SA.1.23	and enjoyed them while they lived.
2SA.1.23	They are together even in death.
2SA.1.23	They were faster than eagles.
2SA.1.23	They were stronger than lions.
2SA.1.24	“You daughters of Israel, cry for Saul.
2SA.1.24	Saul clothed you with red dresses
2SA.1.24	and put gold decorations on them.
2SA.1.25	“How the mighty have fallen in battle!
2SA.1.25	Jonathan is dead on Gilboa’s hills.
2SA.1.26	I cry for you, my brother Jonathan.
2SA.1.26	I enjoyed your friendship so much.
2SA.1.26	Your love to me was wonderful,
2SA.1.26	better than the love of women.
2SA.1.27	“How the mighty have fallen!
2SA.1.27	The weapons of war are gone.”
2SA.2.1	Later, David prayed to the L
2SA.2.1	The L
2SA.2.1	David asked, “Where should I go?”
2SA.2.1	The L
2SA.2.2	So David went up to Hebron with his two wives: Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel. 
2SA.2.3	David also brought his men and their families, and they all made their homes in the cities of Hebron. 
2SA.2.4	Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and appointed David king over Judah.
2SA.2.4	They told David that the men of Jabesh Gilead had buried Saul. 
2SA.2.5	So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead and said to them, “The L
2SA.2.6	May the L
2SA.2.7	Now be strong and brave. Saul your master is dead, and the people of Judah have appointed me their king.”
2SA.2.8	Abner son of Ner was the commander of Saul’s army. Abner took Saul’s son Ish-Bosheth to Mahanaim 
2SA.2.9	and made him king of Gilead, Ashuri, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all Israel. 
2SA.2.10	Saul’s son Ish-Bosheth was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he ruled two years. But the people of Judah followed David. 
2SA.2.11	David was king in Hebron for seven years and six months.
2SA.2.12	Abner son of Ner and the servants of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul left Mahanaim and went to Gibeon. 
2SA.2.13	Joab son of Zeruiah and David’s men also went there and met Abner and Ish-Bosheth’s men at the pool of Gibeon. Abner’s group sat on one side of the pool; Joab’s group sat on the other.
2SA.2.14	Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men have a contest here.”
2SA.2.14	Joab said, “Yes, let them have a contest.”
2SA.2.15	Then the men got up and were counted—twelve from the people of Benjamin for Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, and twelve from David’s men. 
2SA.2.16	Each man grabbed the one opposite him by the head and stabbed him in the side with a knife. So the men fell down together. For that reason, that place in Gibeon is called the Field of Knives. 
2SA.2.17	That day there was a terrible battle, and David’s men defeated Abner and the Israelites.
2SA.2.18	Zeruiah’s three sons, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, were there. Now Asahel was a fast runner, as fast as a deer in the field. 
2SA.2.19	Asahel chased Abner, going straight toward him. 
2SA.2.20	Abner looked back and asked, “Is that you, Asahel?”
2SA.2.20	Asahel said, “Yes, it is.”
2SA.2.21	Then Abner said to Asahel, “Turn to your right or left and catch one of the young men and take his armor.” But Asahel refused to stop chasing him.
2SA.2.22	Abner again said to Asahel, “Stop chasing me! If you don’t stop, I’ll have to kill you! Then I won’t be able to face your brother Joab again!”
2SA.2.23	But Asahel refused to stop chasing Abner. So using the back end of his spear, Abner stabbed Asahel in the stomach, and the spear came out of his back. Asahel died right there, and everyone stopped when they came to the place where Asahel’s body lay.
2SA.2.24	But Joab and Abishai continued chasing Abner. As the sun was going down, they arrived at the hill of Ammah, near Giah on the way to the desert near Gibeon. 
2SA.2.25	The men of Benjamin came to Abner, and all stood together at the top of the hill.
2SA.2.26	Abner shouted to Joab, “Must the sword kill forever? Surely you must know this will only end in sadness! Tell the people to stop chasing their own brothers!”
2SA.2.27	Then Joab said, “As surely as God lives, if you had not said anything, the people would have chased their brothers until morning.” 
2SA.2.28	Then Joab blew a trumpet, and his people stopped chasing the Israelites. They did not fight them anymore.
2SA.2.29	Abner and his men marched all night through the Jordan Valley. They crossed the Jordan River, and after marching all day, arrived at Mahanaim.
2SA.2.30	After he had stopped chasing Abner, Joab came back and gathered the people together. Asahel and nineteen of David’s men were missing. 
2SA.2.31	But David’s men had killed three hundred sixty Benjaminites who had followed Abner. 
2SA.2.32	David’s men took Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night. The sun came up as they reached Hebron.
2SA.3.1	There was a long war between the people who supported Saul’s family and those who supported David’s family. The supporters of David’s family became stronger and stronger, but the supporters of Saul’s family became weaker and weaker.
2SA.3.2	Sons were born to David at Hebron. The first was Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam from Jezreel. 
2SA.3.3	The second son was Kileab, whose mother was Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel. The third son was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah daughter of Talmai, the king of Geshur. 
2SA.3.4	The fourth son was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith. The fifth son was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital. 
2SA.3.5	The sixth son was Ithream, whose mother was Eglah, David’s wife. These sons were born to David at Hebron.
2SA.3.6	During the war between the supporters of Saul’s family and the supporters of David’s family, Abner made himself a main leader among the supporters of Saul.
2SA.3.7	Saul once had a slave woman named Rizpah, who was the daughter of Aiah. Ish-Bosheth said to Abner, “Why did you have sexual relations with my father’s slave woman?”
2SA.3.8	Abner was very angry because of what Ish-Bosheth said, and he replied, “I have been loyal to Saul and his family and friends! I didn’t hand you over to David. I am not a traitor working for Judah! But now you are saying I did something wrong with this woman! 
2SA.3.9	May God help me if I don’t join David! I will make sure that what the L
2SA.3.10	I will take the kingdom from the family of Saul and make David king of Israel and Judah, from Dan to Beersheba!”
2SA.3.11	Ish-Bosheth couldn’t say anything to Abner, because he was afraid of him.
2SA.3.12	Then Abner sent messengers to ask David, “Who is going to rule the land? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you unite all Israel.”
2SA.3.13	David answered, “Good! I will make an agreement with you, but I ask you one thing. I will not meet with you unless you bring Saul’s daughter Michal to me.” 
2SA.3.14	Then David sent messengers to Saul’s son Ish-Bosheth, saying, “Give me my wife Michal. She was promised to me, and I killed a hundred Philistines to get her.”
2SA.3.15	So Ish-Bosheth sent men to take Michal from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. 
2SA.3.16	Michal’s husband went with her, crying as he followed her to Bahurim. But Abner said to Paltiel, “Go back home.” So he went home.
2SA.3.17	Abner sent this message to the elders of Israel: “You have been wanting to make David your king. 
2SA.3.18	Now do it! The L
2SA.3.19	Abner also said these things to the people of Benjamin. He then went to Hebron to tell David what the Benjaminites and Israel wanted to do. 
2SA.3.20	Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron. There David prepared a feast for them. 
2SA.3.21	Abner said to David, “My master and king, I will go and bring all the Israelites to you. Then they will make an agreement with you so you will rule over all Israel as you wanted.” So David let Abner go, and he left in peace.
2SA.3.22	Just then Joab and David’s men came from a battle, bringing many valuable things they had taken from the enemy. David had let Abner leave in peace, so he was not with David at Hebron. 
2SA.3.23	When Joab and all his army arrived at Hebron, the army said to Joab, “Abner son of Ner came to King David, and David let him leave in peace.”
2SA.3.24	Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Abner came to you. Why did you let him go? Now he’s gone. 
2SA.3.25	You know Abner son of Ner! He came to trick you! He came to learn about everything you are doing!”
2SA.3.26	After Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah. But David did not know this. 
2SA.3.27	When Abner arrived at Hebron, Joab took him aside into the gateway. He acted as though he wanted to talk with Abner in private, but Joab stabbed him in the stomach, and Abner died. Abner had killed Joab’s brother Asahel, so Joab killed Abner to pay him back.
2SA.3.28	Later when David heard the news, he said, “My kingdom and I are innocent forever of the death of Abner son of Ner. The L
2SA.3.29	Joab and his family are responsible for this. May his family always have someone with sores or with a skin disease. May they always have someone who must lean on a crutch. May some of his family be killed in war. May they always have someone without food to eat.”
2SA.3.30	(Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner, because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.)
2SA.3.31	Then David said to Joab and to all the people with Joab, “Tear your clothes and put on rough cloth to show how sad you are. Cry for Abner.” King David himself followed the body of Abner. 
2SA.3.32	They buried Abner in Hebron, and David and all the people cried at Abner’s grave.
2SA.3.33	King David sang this funeral song for Abner.
2SA.3.33	“Did Abner die like a fool?
2SA.3.34	His hands were not tied.
2SA.3.34	His feet were not in chains.
2SA.3.34	He fell at the hands of evil men.”
2SA.3.34	Then all the people cried again for Abner. 
2SA.3.35	They came to encourage David to eat while it was still day. But he made a promise, saying, “May God punish me terribly if I eat bread or anything else before the sun sets!”
2SA.3.36	All the people saw what happened, and they agreed with what the king was doing, just as they agreed with everything he did. 
2SA.3.37	That day all the people of Judah and Israel understood that David did not order the killing of Abner son of Ner.
2SA.3.38	David said to his officers, “You know that a great man died today in Israel. 
2SA.3.39	Even though I am the appointed king, I feel empty. These sons of Zeruiah are too much for me. May the L
2SA.4.1	When Ish-Bosheth son of Saul heard that Abner had died at Hebron, he was shocked and all Israel became frightened. 
2SA.4.2	Two men who were captains in Saul’s army came to Ish-Bosheth. One was named Baanah, and the other was named Recab. They were the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, who was a Benjaminite. (The town Beeroth belonged to the tribe of Benjamin. 
2SA.4.3	The people of Beeroth ran away to Gittaim, and they still live there as foreigners today.)
2SA.4.4	(Saul’s son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth, who was crippled in both feet. He was five years old when the news came from Jezreel that Saul and Jonathan were dead. Mephibosheth’s nurse had picked him up and run away. But as she hurried to leave, she dropped him, and now he was lame.)
2SA.4.5	Recab and Baanah, sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, went to Ish-Bosheth’s house in the afternoon while he was taking a nap. 
2SA.4.6+2SA.4.7	They went into the middle of the house as if to get some wheat. Ish-Bosheth was lying on his bed in his bedroom. Then Recab and Baanah stabbed him in the stomach, killed him, cut off his head, and took it with them. They escaped and traveled all night through the Jordan Valley. 
2SA.4.8	When they arrived at Hebron, they gave his head to David and said to the king, “Here is the head of Ish-Bosheth son of Saul, your enemy. He tried to kill you! Today the L
2SA.4.9	David answered Recab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon of Beeroth, “As surely as the L
2SA.4.10	Once a man thought he was bringing me good news. When he told me, ‘Saul is dead!’ I seized him and killed him at Ziklag. That was the reward I gave him for his news! 
2SA.4.11	So even more I must put you evil men to death because you have killed an innocent man on his own bed in his own house!”
2SA.4.12	So David commanded his men to kill Recab and Baanah. They cut off the hands and feet of Recab and Baanah and hung them over the pool of Hebron. Then they took Ish-Bosheth’s head and buried it in Abner’s tomb at Hebron.
2SA.5.1	Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said to him, “Look, we are your own family. 
2SA.5.2	Even when Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel in battle. The L
2SA.5.3	So all the elders of Israel came to King David at Hebron, and he made an agreement with them in Hebron in the presence of the L
2SA.5.4	David was thirty years old when he became king, and he ruled forty years. 
2SA.5.5	He was king over Judah in Hebron for seven years and six months, and he was king over all Israel and Judah in Jerusalem for thirty-three years.
2SA.5.6	When the king and his men went to Jerusalem to attack the Jebusites who lived there, the Jebusites said to David, “You can’t get inside our city. Even the blind and the crippled can stop you.” They thought David could not enter their city. 
2SA.5.7	But David did take the city of Jerusalem with its strong walls, and it became the City of David.
2SA.5.8	That day David said to his men, “To defeat the Jebusites you must go through the water tunnel. Then you can reach those ‘crippled’ and ‘blind’ enemies. This is why people say, ‘The blind and the crippled may not enter the palace.’ ”
2SA.5.9	So David lived in the strong, walled city and called it the City of David. David built more buildings around it, beginning where the land was filled in. He also built more buildings inside the city. 
2SA.5.10	He became stronger and stronger, because the L
2SA.5.11	Hiram king of the city of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar logs, carpenters, and stonecutters. They built a palace for David. 
2SA.5.12	Then David knew that the L
2SA.5.13	After he came from Hebron, David took for himself more slave women and wives in Jerusalem. More sons and daughters were born to David. 
2SA.5.14	These are the names of the sons born to David in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
2SA.5.15	Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
2SA.5.16	Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
2SA.5.17	When the Philistines heard that David had been made king over Israel, all the Philistines went to look for him. But when David heard the news, he went down to the stronghold. 
2SA.5.18	The Philistines came and camped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.19	David asked the L
2SA.5.19	The L
2SA.5.20	So David went to Baal Perazim and defeated the Philistines there. David said, “Like a flood of water, the L
2SA.5.21	The Philistines left their idols behind at Baal Perazim, so David and his men carried them away.
2SA.5.22	Once again the Philistines came and camped at the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.5.23	When David prayed to the L
2SA.5.24	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, act quickly. I, the L
2SA.5.25	So David did what the L
2SA.6.1	David again gathered all the chosen men of Israel—thirty thousand of them. 
2SA.6.2	Then he and all his people went to Baalah in Judah to bring back the Ark of God. The Ark is called by the Name, the name of the L
2SA.6.3	They put the Ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of Abinadab’s house on the hill. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, led the new cart 
2SA.6.4	which had the Ark of God on it. Ahio was walking in front of it. 
2SA.6.5	David and all the Israelites were celebrating in the presence of the L
2SA.6.6	When David’s men came to the threshing floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled. So Uzzah reached out to steady the Ark of God. 
2SA.6.7	The L
2SA.6.8	David was angry because the L
2SA.6.9	David was afraid of the L
2SA.6.10	So David would not move the Ark of the L
2SA.6.11	The Ark of the L
2SA.6.12	The people told David, “The L
2SA.6.13	When the men carrying the Ark of the L
2SA.6.14	Then David danced with all his might before the L
2SA.6.15	David and all the Israelites shouted with joy and blew the trumpets as they brought the Ark of the L
2SA.6.16	As the Ark of the L
2SA.6.17	David put up a tent for the Ark of the L
2SA.6.18	When David finished offering the whole burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the L
2SA.6.19	David gave a loaf of bread, a cake of dates, and a cake of raisins to every Israelite, both men and women. Then all the people went home.
2SA.6.20	David went back to bless the people in his home, but Saul’s daughter Michal came out to meet him. She said, “With what honor the king of Israel acted today! You took off your clothes in front of the servant girls of your officers like one who takes off his clothes without shame!”
2SA.6.21	Then David said to Michal, “I did it in the presence of the L
2SA.6.22	Maybe I will lose even more honor, and maybe I will be brought down in my own opinion, but the girls you talk about will honor me!”
2SA.6.23	And Saul’s daughter Michal had no children to the day she died.
2SA.7.1	King David was living in his palace, and the L
2SA.7.2	Then David said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I am living in a palace made of cedar wood, but the Ark of God is in a tent!”
2SA.7.3	Nathan said to the king, “Go and do what you really want to do, because the L
2SA.7.4	But that night the L
2SA.7.5	“Go and tell my servant David, ‘This is what the L
2SA.7.6	From the time I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until now I have not lived in a house. I have been moving around all this time with a tent as my home. 
2SA.7.7	As I have moved with the Israelites, I have never said to the tribes, whom I commanded to take care of my people Israel, “Why haven’t you built me a house of cedar?” ’
2SA.7.8	“You must tell my servant David, ‘This is what the L
2SA.7.9	I have been with you everywhere you have gone and have defeated your enemies for you. I will make you as famous as any of the great people on the earth. 
2SA.7.10	Also I will choose a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them so they can live in their own homes. They will not be bothered anymore. Wicked people will no longer bother them as they have in the past 
2SA.7.11	when I chose judges for my people Israel. But I will give you peace from all your enemies. I also tell you that I will make your descendants kings of Israel after you.
2SA.7.12	“ ‘When you die and join your ancestors, I will make one of your sons the next king, and I will set up his kingdom. 
2SA.7.13	He will build a house for me, and I will let his kingdom rule always. 
2SA.7.14	I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he sins, I will use other people to punish him. They will be my whips. 
2SA.7.15	I took away my love from Saul, whom I removed before you, but I will never stop loving your son. 
2SA.7.16	But your family and your kingdom will continue always before me. Your throne will last forever.’ ”
2SA.7.17	Nathan told David everything God had said in this vision.
2SA.7.18	Then King David went in and sat in front of the L
2SA.7.19	But even this is not enough for you, Lord G
2SA.7.20	“What more can I say to you, Lord G
2SA.7.21	You have done this great thing because you said you would and because you wanted to, and you have let me know about it. 
2SA.7.22	This is why you are great, Lord G
2SA.7.23	There is no nation like your people Israel. They are the only people on earth that God chose to be his own. You made your name well known. You did great and wonderful miracles for them. You went ahead of them and forced other nations and their gods out of the land. You freed your people from slavery in Egypt. 
2SA.7.24	You made the people of Israel your very own people forever, and, L
2SA.7.25	“Now, L
2SA.7.26	Then you will be honored always, and people will say, ‘The L

2SA.7.29	Please, bless my family. Let it continue before you always. Lord G
2SA.8.1	Later, David defeated the Philistines, conquered them, and took the city of Metheg Ammah.
2SA.8.2	He also defeated the people of Moab. He made them lie on the ground, and then he used a rope to measure them. Those who were measured within two rope lengths were killed, but those who were within the next rope length were allowed to live. So the people of Moab became servants of David and gave him the payment he demanded.
2SA.8.3	David also defeated Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to take control again at the Euphrates River. 
2SA.8.4	David captured one thousand chariots, seven thousand men who rode in chariots, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He crippled all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
2SA.8.5	Arameans from Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, but David killed twenty-two thousand of them. 
2SA.8.6	Then David put groups of soldiers in Damascus in Aram. The Arameans became David’s servants and gave him the payment he demanded. The L
2SA.8.7	David took the shields of gold that had belonged to Hadadezer’s officers and brought them to Jerusalem. 
2SA.8.8	David also took many things made of bronze from Tebah and Berothai, which had been cities under Hadadezer’s control.
2SA.8.9	Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer. 
2SA.8.10	So Toi sent his son Joram to greet and congratulate King David for defeating Hadadezer. (Hadadezer had been at war with Toi.) Joram brought items made of silver, gold, and bronze. 
2SA.8.11	King David gave them to the L
2SA.8.12	These nations were Edom, Moab, Ammon, Philistia, and Amalek. David also gave the L
2SA.8.13	David was famous after he returned from defeating eighteen thousand Arameans in the Valley of Salt. 
2SA.8.14	He put groups of soldiers all over Edom, and all the Edomites became his servants. The L
2SA.8.15	David was king over all Israel, and he did what was fair and right for all his people. 
2SA.8.16	Joab son of Zeruiah was commander over the army. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder. 
2SA.8.17	Zadok son of Ahitub and Abiathar son of Ahimelech were priests. Seraiah was the royal secretary. 
2SA.8.18	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites. And David’s sons were priests.
2SA.9.1	David asked, “Is anyone still left in Saul’s family? I want to show kindness to that person for Jonathan’s sake!”
2SA.9.2	Now there was a servant named Ziba from Saul’s family. So David’s servants called Ziba to him. King David said to him, “Are you Ziba?”
2SA.9.2	He answered, “Yes, I am your servant.”
2SA.9.3	The king asked, “Is anyone left in Saul’s family? I want to show God’s kindness to that person.”
2SA.9.3	Ziba answered the king, “Jonathan has a son still living who is crippled in both feet.”
2SA.9.4	The king asked Ziba, “Where is this son?”
2SA.9.4	Ziba answered, “He is at the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar.”
2SA.9.5	Then King David had servants bring Jonathan’s son from the house of Makir son of Ammiel in Lo Debar. 
2SA.9.6	Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s son, came before David and bowed facedown on the floor.
2SA.9.6	David said, “Mephibosheth!”
2SA.9.6	Mephibosheth said, “I am your servant.”
2SA.9.7	David said to him, “Don’t be afraid. I will be kind to you for your father Jonathan’s sake. I will give you back all the land of your grandfather Saul, and you will always eat at my table.”
2SA.9.8	Mephibosheth bowed to David again and said, “You are being very kind to me, your servant! And I am no better than a dead dog!”
2SA.9.9	Then King David called Saul’s servant Ziba. David said to him, “I have given your master’s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
2SA.9.10	You, your sons, and your servants will farm the land and harvest the crops. Then your family will have food to eat. But Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, will always eat at my table.”
2SA.9.10	(Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.) 
2SA.9.11	Ziba said to King David, “I, your servant, will do everything my master, the king, commands me.”
2SA.9.11	So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table as if he were one of the king’s sons. 
2SA.9.12	Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. Everyone in Ziba’s family became Mephibosheth’s servants. 
2SA.9.13	Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, because he always ate at the king’s table. And he was crippled in both feet.
2SA.10.1	When Nahash king of the Ammonites died, his son Hanun became king after him. 
2SA.10.2	David said, “Nahash was loyal to me, so I will be loyal to his son Hanun.” So David sent his messengers to comfort Hanun about his father’s death.
2SA.10.2	David’s officers went to the land of the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.3	But the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, their master, “Do you think David wants to honor your father by sending men to comfort you? No! David sent them to study the city and spy it out and capture it!” 
2SA.10.4	So Hanun arrested David’s officers. To shame them he shaved off half their beards and cut off their clothes at the hips. Then he sent them away.
2SA.10.5	When the people told David, he sent messengers to meet his officers because they were very ashamed. King David said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back. Then come home.”
2SA.10.6	The Ammonites knew that they had insulted David. So they hired twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers from Beth Rehob and Zobah. They also hired the king of Maacah with a thousand men and twelve thousand men from Tob.
2SA.10.7	When David heard about this, he sent Joab with the whole army. 
2SA.10.8	The Ammonites came out and prepared for battle at the city gate. The Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the men from Tob and Maacah were out in the field by themselves.
2SA.10.9	Joab saw that there were enemies both in front of him and behind him. So he chose some of the best soldiers of Israel and sent them out to fight the Arameans. 
2SA.10.10	Joab put the rest of the army under the command of Abishai, his brother. Then he sent them out to fight the Ammonites. 
2SA.10.11	Joab said to Abishai, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, you must help me. Or, if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will help you. 
2SA.10.12	Be strong. We must fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The L
2SA.10.13	Then Joab and the army with him went to attack the Arameans, and the Arameans ran away. 
2SA.10.14	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were running away, they also ran away from Abishai and went back to their city. So Joab returned from the battle with the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.
2SA.10.15	When the Arameans saw that Israel had defeated them, they came together into one big army. 
2SA.10.16	Hadadezer sent messengers to bring the Arameans from east of the Euphrates River, and they went to Helam. Their leader was Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army.
2SA.10.17	When David heard about this, he gathered all the Israelites together. They crossed over the Jordan River and went to Helam. There the Arameans prepared for battle and attacked him. 
2SA.10.18	But the Arameans ran away from the Israelites. David killed seven hundred Aramean chariot drivers and forty thousand Aramean horsemen. He also killed Shobach, the commander of the Aramean army.
2SA.10.19	When the kings who served Hadadezer saw that the Israelites had defeated them, they made peace with the Israelites and served them. And the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites again.
2SA.11.1	In the spring, when the kings normally went out to war, David sent out Joab, his servants, and all the Israelites. They destroyed the Ammonites and attacked the city of Rabbah. But David stayed in Jerusalem. 
2SA.11.2	One evening David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of his palace. While he was on the roof, he saw a woman bathing. She was very beautiful. 
2SA.11.3	So David sent his servants to find out who she was. A servant answered, “That woman is Bathsheba daughter of Eliam. She is the wife of Uriah the Hittite.” 
2SA.11.4	So David sent messengers to bring Bathsheba to him. When she came to him, he had sexual relations with her. (Now Bathsheba had purified herself from her monthly period.) Then she went back to her house. 
2SA.11.5	But Bathsheba became pregnant and sent word to David, saying, “I am pregnant.”
2SA.11.6	So David sent a message to Joab: “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.” And Joab sent Uriah to David. 
2SA.11.7	When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the soldiers were, and how the war was going. 
2SA.11.8	Then David said to Uriah, “Go home and rest.”
2SA.11.8	So Uriah left the palace, and the king sent a gift to him. 
2SA.11.9	But Uriah did not go home. Instead, he slept outside the door of the palace as all the king’s officers did.
2SA.11.10	The officers told David, “Uriah did not go home.”
2SA.11.10	Then David said to Uriah, “You came from a long trip. Why didn’t you go home?”
2SA.11.11	Uriah said to him, “The Ark and the soldiers of Israel and Judah are staying in tents. My master Joab and his officers are camping out in the fields. It isn’t right for me to go home to eat and drink and have sexual relations with my wife!”
2SA.11.12	David said to Uriah, “Stay here today. Tomorrow I’ll send you back to the battle.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
2SA.11.13	Then David called Uriah to come to see him, so Uriah ate and drank with David. David made Uriah drunk, but he still did not go home. That evening Uriah again slept with the king’s officers.
2SA.11.14	The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by Uriah. 
2SA.11.15	In the letter David wrote, “Put Uriah on the front lines where the fighting is worst and leave him there alone. Let him be killed in battle.”
2SA.11.16	Joab watched the city and saw where its strongest defenders were and put Uriah there. 
2SA.11.17	When the men of the city came out to fight against Joab, some of David’s men were killed. And Uriah the Hittite was one of them.
2SA.11.18	Then Joab sent David a complete account of the war. 
2SA.11.19	Joab told the messenger, “Tell King David what happened in the war. 
2SA.11.20	After you finish, the king may be angry and ask, ‘Why did you go so near the city to fight? Didn’t you know they would shoot arrows from the city wall? 
2SA.11.21	Do you remember who killed Abimelech son of Jerub-Besheth? It was a woman on the city wall. She threw a large stone for grinding grain on Abimelech and killed him there in Thebez. Why did you go so near the wall?’ If King David asks that, tell him, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.’ ”
2SA.11.22	The messenger left and went to David and told him everything Joab had told him to say. 
2SA.11.23	The messenger told David, “The men of Ammon were winning. They came out and attacked us in the field, but we fought them back to the city gate. 
2SA.11.24	The archers on the city wall shot at your servants, and some of your men were killed. Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.”
2SA.11.25	David said to the messenger, “Say this to Joab: ‘Don’t be upset about this. The sword kills everyone the same. Make a stronger attack against the city and capture it.’ Encourage Joab with these words.”
2SA.11.26	When Bathsheba heard that her husband was dead, she cried for him. 
2SA.11.27	After she finished her time of sadness, David sent servants to bring her to his house. She became David’s wife and gave birth to his son, but the L
2SA.12.1	The L
2SA.12.2	The rich man had many sheep and cattle. 
2SA.12.3	But the poor man had nothing except one little female lamb he had bought. The poor man fed the lamb, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food and drank from his cup and slept in his arms. The lamb was like a daughter to him.
2SA.12.4	“Then a traveler stopped to visit the rich man. The rich man wanted to feed the traveler, but he didn’t want to take one of his own sheep or cattle. Instead, he took the lamb from the poor man and cooked it for his visitor.”
2SA.12.5	David became very angry at the rich man. He said to Nathan, “As surely as the L
2SA.12.6	He must pay for the lamb four times for doing such a thing. He had no mercy!”
2SA.12.7	Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! This is what the L
2SA.12.8	I gave you his kingdom and his wives. And I made you king of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you even more. 
2SA.12.9	So why did you ignore the L
2SA.12.10	Now there will always be people in your family who will die by a sword, because you did not respect me; you took the wife of Uriah the Hittite for yourself!’
2SA.12.11	“This is what the L
2SA.12.12	You had sexual relations with Bathsheba in secret, but I will do this so all the people of Israel can see it.’ ”
2SA.12.13	Then David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the L
2SA.12.13	Nathan answered, “The L
2SA.12.14	But what you did caused the L
2SA.12.15	Then Nathan went home. And the L
2SA.12.16	David prayed to God for the baby. David fasted and went into his house and stayed there, lying on the ground all night. 
2SA.12.17	The elders of David’s family came to him and tried to pull him up from the ground, but he refused to get up or to eat food with them.
2SA.12.18	On the seventh day the baby died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the baby was dead. They said, “Look, we tried to talk to David while the baby was alive, but he refused to listen to us. If we tell him the baby is dead, he may do something awful.”
2SA.12.19	When David saw his servants whispering, he knew that the baby was dead. So he asked them, “Is the baby dead?”
2SA.12.19	They answered, “Yes, he is dead.”
2SA.12.20	Then David got up from the floor, washed himself, put lotions on, and changed his clothes. Then he went into the L
2SA.12.21	David’s servants said to him, “Why are you doing this? When the baby was still alive, you fasted and you cried. Now that the baby is dead, you get up and eat food.”
2SA.12.22	David said, “While the baby was still alive, I fasted, and I cried. I thought, ‘Who knows? Maybe the L
2SA.12.23	But now that the baby is dead, why should I fast? I can’t bring him back to life. Someday I will go to him, but he cannot come back to me.”
2SA.12.24	Then David comforted Bathsheba his wife. He slept with her and had sexual relations with her. She became pregnant again and had another son, whom David named Solomon. The L
2SA.12.25	The L
2SA.12.26	Joab fought against Rabbah, a royal city of the Ammonites, and he was about to capture it. 
2SA.12.27	Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah and have captured its water supply. 
2SA.12.28	Now bring the other soldiers together and attack this city. Capture it before I capture it myself and it is called by my name!”
2SA.12.29	So David gathered all the army and went to Rabbah and fought against it and captured it. 
2SA.12.30	David took the crown off their king’s head and had it placed on his own head. That gold crown weighed about seventy-five pounds, and it had valuable gems in it. And David took many valuable things from the city. 
2SA.12.31	He also brought out the people of the city and forced them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. He also made them build with bricks. David did this to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his army returned to Jerusalem.
2SA.13.1	David had a son named Absalom and a son named Amnon. Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar, and Amnon loved her. 
2SA.13.2	Tamar was a virgin. Amnon made himself sick just thinking about her, because he could not find any chance to be alone with her.
2SA.13.3	Amnon had a friend named Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother. Jonadab was a very clever man. 
2SA.13.4	He asked Amnon, “Son of the king, why do you look so sad day after day? Tell me what’s wrong!”
2SA.13.4	Amnon told him, “I love Tamar, the sister of my half-brother Absalom.”
2SA.13.5	Jonadab said to Amnon, “Go to bed and act as if you are sick. Then your father will come to see you. Tell him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come in and give me food to eat. Let her make the food in front of me so I can watch and eat it from her hand.’ ”
2SA.13.6	So Amnon went to bed and acted sick. When King David came in to see him, Amnon said to him, “Please let my sister Tamar come in. Let her make two of her special cakes for me while I watch. Then I will eat them from her hands.”
2SA.13.7	David sent for Tamar in the palace, saying, “Go to your brother Amnon’s house and make some food for him.” 
2SA.13.8	So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, and he was in bed. Tamar took some dough and pressed it together with her hands. She made some special cakes while Amnon watched. Then she baked them. 
2SA.13.9	Next she took the pan and served him, but he refused to eat.
2SA.13.9	He said to his servants, “All of you, leave me alone!” So they all left him alone. 
2SA.13.10	Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom so I may eat from your hand.”
2SA.13.10	Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them to her brother Amnon in the bedroom. 
2SA.13.11	She went to him so he could eat from her hands, but Amnon grabbed her. He said, “Sister, come and have sexual relations with me.”
2SA.13.12	Tamar said to him, “No, brother! Don’t force me! This should never be done in Israel! Don’t do this shameful thing! 
2SA.13.13	I could never get rid of my shame! And you will be like the shameful fools in Israel! Please talk with the king, and he will let you marry me.”
2SA.13.14	But Amnon refused to listen to her. He was stronger than she was, so he forced her to have sexual relations with him. 
2SA.13.15	After that, Amnon hated Tamar. He hated her more than he had loved her before. Amnon said to her, “Get up and leave!”
2SA.13.16	Tamar said to him, “No! Sending me away would be worse than what you’ve already done!”
2SA.13.16	But he refused to listen to her. 
2SA.13.17	He called his young servant back in and said, “Get this woman out of here and away from me! Lock the door after her.” 
2SA.13.18	So his servant led her out of the room and bolted the door after her.
2SA.13.18	Tamar was wearing a special robe with long sleeves, because the king’s virgin daughters wore this kind of robe. 
2SA.13.19	To show how upset she was, Tamar put ashes on her head and tore her special robe and put her hand on her head. Then she went away, crying loudly.
2SA.13.20	Absalom, Tamar’s brother, said to her, “Has Amnon, your brother, forced you to have sexual relations with him? For now, sister, be quiet. He is your half-brother. Don’t let this upset you so much!” So Tamar lived in her brother Absalom’s house and was sad and lonely.
2SA.13.21	When King David heard the news, he was very angry. 
2SA.13.22	Absalom did not say a word, good or bad, to Amnon. But he hated Amnon for disgracing his sister Tamar.
2SA.13.23	Two years later Absalom had some men come to Baal Hazor, near Ephraim, to cut the wool from his sheep. Absalom invited all the king’s sons to come also. 
2SA.13.24	Absalom went to the king and said, “I have men coming to cut the wool. Please come with your officers and join me.”
2SA.13.25	King David said to Absalom, “No, my son. We won’t all go, because it would be too much trouble for you.” Although Absalom begged David, he would not go, but he did give his blessing.
2SA.13.26	Absalom said, “If you don’t want to come, then please let my brother Amnon come with us.”
2SA.13.26	King David asked, “Why should he go with you?”
2SA.13.27	Absalom kept begging David until he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with Absalom.
2SA.13.28	Then Absalom instructed his servants, “Watch Amnon. When he is drunk, I will tell you, ‘Kill Amnon.’ Right then, kill him! Don’t be afraid, because I have commanded you! Be strong and brave!” 
2SA.13.29	So Absalom’s young men killed Amnon as Absalom commanded, but all of David’s other sons got on their mules and escaped.
2SA.13.30	While the king’s sons were on their way, the news came to David, “Absalom has killed all of the king’s sons! Not one of them is left alive!” 
2SA.13.31	King David tore his clothes and lay on the ground to show his sadness. All his servants standing nearby tore their clothes also.
2SA.13.32	Jonadab son of Shimeah, David’s brother, said to David, “Don’t think all the young men, your sons, are killed. No, only Amnon is dead! Absalom has planned this ever since Amnon forced his sister Tamar to have sexual relations with him. 
2SA.13.33	My master and king, don’t think that all of the king’s sons are dead. Only Amnon is dead!”
2SA.13.34	In the meantime Absalom had run away.
2SA.13.34	A guard standing on the city wall saw many people coming from the other side of the hill. 
2SA.13.35	So Jonadab said to King David, “Look, I was right! The king’s sons are coming!”
2SA.13.36	As soon as Jonadab had said this, the king’s sons arrived, crying loudly. David and all his servants began crying also. 
2SA.13.37	David cried for his son every day.
2SA.13.37	But Absalom ran away to Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. 
2SA.13.38	After Absalom ran away to Geshur, he stayed there for three years. 
2SA.13.39	When King David got over Amnon’s death, he missed Absalom greatly.
2SA.14.1	Joab son of Zeruiah knew that King David missed Absalom very much. 
2SA.14.2	So Joab sent messengers to Tekoa to bring a wise woman from there. He said to her, “Pretend to be very sad. Put on funeral clothes and don’t put lotion on yourself. Act like a woman who has been crying many days for someone who died. 
2SA.14.3	Then go to the king and say these words.” Then Joab told her what to say.
2SA.14.4	So the woman from Tekoa spoke to the king. She bowed facedown on the ground to show respect and said, “My king, help me!”
2SA.14.5	King David asked her, “What is the matter?”
2SA.14.5	The woman said, “I am a widow; my husband is dead. 
2SA.14.6	I had two sons. They were out in the field fighting, and no one was there to stop them. So one son killed the other son. 
2SA.14.7	Now all the family group is against me. They said to me, ‘Bring the son who killed his brother so we may kill him for killing his brother. That way we will also get rid of the one who would receive what belonged to his father.’ My son is like the last spark of a fire. He is all I have left. If they kill him, my husband’s name and property will be gone from the earth.”
2SA.14.8	Then the king said to the woman, “Go home. I will take care of this for you.”
2SA.14.9	The woman of Tekoa said to him, “Let the blame be on me and my father’s family. My master and king, you and your throne are innocent.”
2SA.14.10	King David said, “Bring me anyone who says anything bad to you. Then he won’t bother you again.”
2SA.14.11	The woman said, “Please promise in the name of the L
2SA.14.11	David said, “As surely as the L
2SA.14.12	The woman said, “Let me say something to you, my master and king.”
2SA.14.12	The king said, “Speak.”
2SA.14.13	Then the woman said, “Why have you decided this way against the people of God? When you judge this way, you show that you are guilty for not bringing back your son who was forced to leave home. 
2SA.14.14	We will all die someday. We’re like water spilled on the ground; no one can gather it back. But God doesn’t take away life. Instead, he plans ways that those who have been sent away will not have to stay away from him! 
2SA.14.15	My master and king, I came to say this to you because the people have made me afraid! I thought, ‘Let me talk to the king. Maybe he will do what I ask. 
2SA.14.16	Maybe he will listen. Perhaps he will save me from those who want to keep both me and my son from getting what God gave us.’
2SA.14.17	“Now I say, ‘May the words of my master the king give me rest. Like an angel of God, you know what is good and what is bad. May the L
2SA.14.18	Then King David said, “Do not hide the truth. Answer me one question.”
2SA.14.18	The woman said, “My master the king, please ask your question.”
2SA.14.19	The king said, “Did Joab tell you to say all these things?”
2SA.14.19	The woman answered, “As you live, my master the king, no one could avoid that question. You are right. Your servant Joab did tell me to say these things. 
2SA.14.20	Joab did it so you would see things differently. My master, you are wise like an angel of God who knows everything that happens on earth.”
2SA.14.21	The king said to Joab, “Look, I will do what I promised. Bring back the young man Absalom.”
2SA.14.22	Joab bowed facedown on the ground and blessed the king. Then he said, “Today I know you are pleased with me, because you have done what I asked.”
2SA.14.23	Then Joab got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. 
2SA.14.24	But King David said, “Absalom must go to his own house. He may not come to see me.” So Absalom went to his own house and did not go to see the king.
2SA.14.25	Absalom was greatly praised for his handsome appearance. No man in Israel was as handsome as he. No blemish was on him from his head to his foot. 
2SA.14.26	At the end of every year, Absalom would cut his hair, because it became too heavy. When he weighed it, it would weigh about five pounds by the royal measure.
2SA.14.27	Absalom had three sons and one daughter. His daughter’s name was also Tamar, and she was a beautiful woman.
2SA.14.28	Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two full years without seeing King David. 
2SA.14.29	Then Absalom sent for Joab so he could send him to the king, but Joab would not come. Absalom sent a message a second time, but Joab still refused to come. 
2SA.14.30	Then Absalom said to his servants, “Look, Joab’s field is next to mine, and he has barley growing there. Go burn it.” So Absalom’s servants set fire to Joab’s field.
2SA.14.31	Then Joab went to Absalom’s house and said to him, “Why did your servants burn my field?”
2SA.14.32	Absalom said to Joab, “I sent a message to you, asking you to come here. I wanted to send you to the king to ask him why he brought me home from Geshur. It would have been better for me to stay there! Now let me see the king. If I have sinned, he can put me to death!”
2SA.14.33	So Joab went to the king and told him Absalom’s words. Then the king called for Absalom. Absalom came and bowed facedown on the ground before the king, and the king kissed him.
2SA.15.1	After this, Absalom got a chariot and horses for himself and fifty men to run before him. 
2SA.15.2	Absalom would get up early and stand near the city gate. Anyone who had a problem for the king to settle would come here. When someone came, Absalom would call out and say, “What city are you from?”
2SA.15.2	The person would answer, “I’m from one of the tribes of Israel.”
2SA.15.3	Then Absalom would say, “Look, your claims are right, but the king has no one to listen to you.” 
2SA.15.4	Absalom would also say, “I wish someone would make me judge in this land! Then people with problems could come to me, and I could help them get justice.”
2SA.15.5	People would come near Absalom to bow to him. When they did, Absalom would reach out his hand and take hold of them and kiss them. 
2SA.15.6	Absalom did that to all the Israelites who came to King David for decisions. In this way, Absalom stole the hearts of all Israel.
2SA.15.7	After four years Absalom said to King David, “Please let me go to Hebron. I want to carry out my promise that I made to the L
2SA.15.8	while I was living in Geshur in Aram. I said, ‘If the L
2SA.15.9	The king said, “Go in peace.”
2SA.15.9	So Absalom went to Hebron. 
2SA.15.10	But he sent secret messengers through all the tribes of Israel. They told the people, “When you hear the trumpets, say this: ‘Absalom is the king at Hebron!’ ”
2SA.15.11	Absalom had invited two hundred men to go with him. So they went from Jerusalem with him, but they didn’t know what he was planning. 
2SA.15.12	While Absalom was offering sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel, one of the people who advised David, to come from his hometown of Giloh. So Absalom’s plans were working very well. More and more people began to support him.
2SA.15.13	A messenger came to David, saying, “The Israelites are giving their loyalty to Absalom.”
2SA.15.14	Then David said to all his officers who were with him in Jerusalem, “We must leave quickly! If we don’t, we won’t be able to get away from Absalom. We must hurry before he catches us and destroys us and kills the people of Jerusalem.”
2SA.15.15	The king’s officers said to him, “We will do anything you say.”
2SA.15.16	The king set out with everyone in his house, but he left ten slave women to take care of the palace. 
2SA.15.17	The king left with all his people following him, and they stopped at a house far away. 
2SA.15.18	All the king’s servants passed by him—the Kerethites and Pelethites, all those from Gath, and the six hundred men who had followed him.
2SA.15.19	The king said to Ittai, a man from Gath, “Why are you also going with us? Turn back and stay with King Absalom because you are a foreigner. This is not your homeland. 
2SA.15.20	You joined me only a short time ago. Should I make you wander with us when I don’t even know where I’m going? Turn back and take your brothers with you. May kindness and loyalty be shown to you.”
2SA.15.21	But Ittai said to the king, “As surely as the L
2SA.15.22	David said to Ittai, “Go, march on.” So Ittai from Gath and all his people with their children marched on. 
2SA.15.23	All the people cried loudly as everyone passed by. King David crossed the Kidron Valley, and then all the people went on to the desert. 
2SA.15.24	Zadok and all the Levites with him carried the Ark of the Agreement with God. They set it down, and Abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had left the city.
2SA.15.25	The king said to Zadok, “Take the Ark of God back into the city. If the L
2SA.15.26	But if the L
2SA.15.27	The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Aren’t you a seer? Go back to the city in peace and take your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan with you. 
2SA.15.28	I will wait near the crossings into the desert until I hear from you.” 
2SA.15.29	So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of God back to Jerusalem and stayed there.
2SA.15.30	David went up the Mount of Olives, crying as he went. He covered his head and went barefoot. All the people with David covered their heads also and cried as they went. 
2SA.15.31	Someone told David, “Ahithophel is one of the people with Absalom who made secret plans against you.”
2SA.15.31	So David prayed, “L
2SA.15.32	When David reached the top of the mountain where people used to worship God, Hushai the Arkite came to meet him. Hushai’s coat was torn, and there was dirt on his head to show how sad he was. 
2SA.15.33	David said to Hushai, “If you go with me, you will be just one more person for me to take care of. 
2SA.15.34	But if you return to the city, you can make Ahithophel’s advice useless. Tell Absalom, ‘I am your servant, my king. In the past I served your father, but now I will serve you.’ 
2SA.15.35	The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you. Tell them everything you hear in the royal palace. 
2SA.15.36	Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan are with them. Send them to tell me everything you hear.” 
2SA.15.37	So David’s friend Hushai entered Jerusalem just as Absalom arrived.
2SA.16.1	When David had passed a short way over the top of the Mount of Olives, Ziba, Mephibosheth’s servant, met him. Ziba had a row of donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, one hundred cakes of raisins, one hundred cakes of figs, and leather bags full of wine. 
2SA.16.2	The king asked Ziba, “What are these things for?”
2SA.16.2	Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for your family to ride. The bread and cakes of figs are for the servants to eat. And the wine is for anyone to drink who might become weak in the desert.”
2SA.16.3	The king asked, “Where is Mephibosheth?”
2SA.16.3	Ziba answered him, “Mephibosheth is staying in Jerusalem because he thinks, ‘Today the Israelites will give my father’s kingdom back to me!’ ”
2SA.16.4	Then the king said to Ziba, “All right. Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth, I now give to you!”
2SA.16.4	Ziba said, “I bow to you. I hope I will always be able to please you.”
2SA.16.5	As King David came to Bahurim, a man came out and cursed him. He was from Saul’s family group, and his name was Shimei son of Gera. 
2SA.16.6	He threw stones at David and his officers, but the people and soldiers gathered all around David. 
2SA.16.7	Shimei cursed David, saying, “Get out, get out, you murderer, you troublemaker. 
2SA.16.8	The L
2SA.16.9	Abishai son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse you, the king? Let me go over and cut off his head!”
2SA.16.10	But the king answered, “This does not concern you, sons of Zeruiah! If he is cursing me because the L
2SA.16.11	David also said to Abishai and all his officers, “My own son is trying to kill me! This man is a Benjaminite and has more right to kill me! Leave him alone, and let him curse me because the L
2SA.16.12	Maybe the L
2SA.16.13	So David and his men went on down the road, but Shimei followed on the nearby hillside. He kept cursing David and throwing stones and dirt at him. 
2SA.16.14	When the king and all his people arrived at the Jordan, they were very tired, so they rested there.
2SA.16.15	Meanwhile, Absalom, Ahithophel, and all the Israelites arrived at Jerusalem. 
2SA.16.16	David’s friend Hushai the Arkite came to Absalom and said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”
2SA.16.17	Absalom asked, “Why are you not loyal to your friend David? Why didn’t you leave Jerusalem with your friend?”
2SA.16.18	Hushai said, “I belong to the one chosen by the L
2SA.16.19	In the past I served your father. So whom should I serve now? David’s son! I will serve you as I served him.”
2SA.16.20	Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Tell us what we should do.”
2SA.16.21	Ahithophel said, “Your father left behind some of his slave women to take care of the palace. Have sexual relations with them. Then all Israel will hear that your father is your enemy, and all your people will be encouraged to give you more support.” 
2SA.16.22	So they put up a tent for Absalom on the roof of the palace where everyone in Israel could see it. And Absalom had sexual relations with his father’s slave women.
2SA.16.23	At that time people thought Ahithophel’s advice was as reliable as God’s own word. Both David and Absalom thought it was that reliable.
2SA.17.1	Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose twelve thousand men and chase David tonight. 
2SA.17.2	I’ll catch him while he is tired and weak, and I’ll frighten him so all his people will run away. But I’ll kill only King David. 
2SA.17.3	Then I’ll bring everyone back to you. If the man you are looking for is dead, everyone else will return safely.” 
2SA.17.4	This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the leaders of Israel.
2SA.17.5	But Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Arkite, so I can hear what he says.” 
2SA.17.6	When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “This is the plan Ahithophel gave. Should we follow it? If not, tell us.”
2SA.17.7	Hushai said to Absalom, “Ahithophel’s advice is not good this time.” 
2SA.17.8	Hushai added, “You know your father and his men are strong. They are as angry as a bear that is robbed of its cubs. Your father is a skilled fighter. He won’t stay all night with the army. 
2SA.17.9	He is probably already hiding in a cave or some other place. If the first attack fails, people will hear the news and think, ‘Absalom’s followers are losing!’ 
2SA.17.10	Then even the men who are as brave as lions will be frightened, because all the Israelites know your father is a fighter. They know his men are brave!
2SA.17.11	“This is what I suggest: Gather all the Israelites from Dan to Beersheba. There will be as many people as grains of sand by the sea. Then you yourself must go into the battle. 
2SA.17.12	We will go to David wherever he is hiding. We will fall on him as dew falls on the ground. We will kill him and all of his men so that no one will be left alive. 
2SA.17.13	If David escapes into a city, all the Israelites will bring ropes to that city and pull it into the valley. Not a stone will be left!”
2SA.17.14	Absalom and all the Israelites said, “The advice of Hushai the Arkite is better than that of Ahithophel.” (The L
2SA.17.15	Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, what Ahithophel had suggested to Absalom and the elders of Israel. He also reported to them what he himself had suggested. Hushai said, 
2SA.17.16	“Quickly! Send a message to David. Tell him not to stay tonight at the crossings into the desert but to cross over the Jordan River at once. If he crosses the river, he and all his people won’t be destroyed.”
2SA.17.17	Jonathan and Ahimaaz were waiting at En Rogel. They did not want to be seen going into the city, so a servant girl would go out to them and give them messages. Then Jonathan and Ahimaaz would go and tell King David.
2SA.17.18	But a boy saw Jonathan and Ahimaaz and told Absalom. So Jonathan and Ahimaaz left quickly and went to a man’s house in Bahurim. He had a well in his courtyard, and they climbed down into it. 
2SA.17.19	The man’s wife spread a sheet over the opening of the well and covered it with grain. No one could tell that anyone was hiding there.
2SA.17.20	Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”
2SA.17.20	She said to them, “They have already crossed the brook.”
2SA.17.20	Absalom’s servants then went to look for Jonathan and Ahimaaz, but they could not find them. So they went back to Jerusalem.
2SA.17.21	After Absalom’s servants left, Jonathan and Ahimaaz climbed out of the well and went to tell King David. They said, “Hurry, cross over the river! Ahithophel has said these things against you!” 
2SA.17.22	So David and all his people crossed the Jordan River. By dawn, everyone had crossed the Jordan.
2SA.17.23	When Ahithophel saw that the Israelites did not accept his advice, he saddled his donkey and went to his hometown. He left orders for his family and property, and then he hanged himself. He died and was buried in his father’s tomb.
2SA.17.24	David arrived at Mahanaim. And Absalom and all his Israelites crossed over the Jordan River. 
2SA.17.25	Absalom had made Amasa captain of the army instead of Joab. Amasa was the son of a man named Jether the Ishmaelite. Amasa’s mother was Abigail daughter of Nahash and sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. 
2SA.17.26	Absalom and the Israelites camped in the land of Gilead.
2SA.17.27	Shobi, Makir, and Barzillai were at Mahanaim when David arrived. Shobi son of Nahash was from the Ammonite town of Rabbah. Makir son of Ammiel was from Lo Debar, and Barzillai was from Rogelim in Gilead. 
2SA.17.28	They brought beds, bowls, clay pots, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, beans, small peas, 
2SA.17.29	honey, milk curds, sheep, and cheese made from cows’ milk for David and his people. They said, “The people are hungry and tired and thirsty in the desert.”
2SA.18.1	David counted his men and placed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 
2SA.18.2	He sent the troops out in three groups. Joab commanded one-third of the men. Joab’s brother Abishai son of Zeruiah commanded another third. And Ittai from Gath commanded the last third. King David said to them, “I will also go with you.”
2SA.18.3	But the men said, “You must not go with us! If we run away in the battle, Absalom’s men won’t care. Even if half of us are killed, Absalom’s men won’t care. But you’re worth ten thousand of us! You can help us most by staying in the city.”
2SA.18.4	The king said to his people, “I will do what you think is best.” So the king stood at the side of the gate as the army went out in groups of a hundred and a thousand.
2SA.18.5	The king commanded Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, “Be gentle with young Absalom for my sake.” Everyone heard the king’s orders to the commanders about Absalom.
2SA.18.6	David’s army went out into the field against Absalom’s Israelites, and they fought in the forest of Ephraim. 
2SA.18.7	There David’s army defeated the Israelites. Many died that day—twenty thousand men. 
2SA.18.8	The battle spread through all the country, but that day more men died in the forest than in the fighting.
2SA.18.9	Then Absalom happened to meet David’s troops. As Absalom was riding his mule, it went under the thick branches of a large oak tree. Absalom’s head got caught in the tree, and his mule ran out from under him. So Absalom was left hanging above the ground.
2SA.18.10	When one of the men saw it happen, he told Joab, “I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!”
2SA.18.11	Joab said to him, “You saw him? Why didn’t you kill him and let him fall to the ground? I would have given you a belt and four ounces of silver!”
2SA.18.12	The man answered, “I wouldn’t touch the king’s son even if you gave me twenty-five pounds of silver. We heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, ‘Be careful not to hurt young Absalom.’ 
2SA.18.13	If I had killed him, the king would have found out, and you would not have protected me!”
2SA.18.14	Joab said, “I won’t waste time here with you!” Absalom was still alive in the oak tree, so Joab took three spears and stabbed him in the heart. 
2SA.18.15	Ten young men who carried Joab’s armor also gathered around Absalom and struck him and killed him.
2SA.18.16	Then Joab blew the trumpet, so the troops stopped chasing the Israelites. 
2SA.18.17	Then Joab’s men took Absalom’s body and threw it into a large pit in the forest and filled the pit with many stones. All the Israelites ran away to their homes.
2SA.18.18	When Absalom was alive, he had set up a pillar for himself in the King’s Valley. He said, “I have no son to keep my name alive.” So he named the pillar after himself, and it is called Absalom’s Monument even today.
2SA.18.19	Ahimaaz son of Zadok said to Joab, “Let me run and take the news to King David. I’ll tell him the L
2SA.18.20	Joab answered Ahimaaz, “No, you are not the one to take the news today. You may do it another time, but do not take it today, because the king’s son is dead.”
2SA.18.21	Then Joab said to a man from Cush, “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” The Cushite bowed to Joab and ran to tell David.
2SA.18.22	But Ahimaaz son of Zadok begged Joab again, “No matter what happens, please let me go along with the Cushite!”
2SA.18.22	Joab said, “Son, why do you want to carry the news? You won’t get any reward.”
2SA.18.23	Ahimaaz answered, “No matter what happens, I will run.”
2SA.18.23	So Joab said to Ahimaaz, “Run!” Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the Jordan Valley and passed the Cushite.
2SA.18.24	David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the city. The watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the walls, and as he looked up, he saw a man running alone. 
2SA.18.25	He shouted the news to the king.
2SA.18.25	The king said, “If he is alone, he is bringing good news!”
2SA.18.25	The man came nearer and nearer to the city. 
2SA.18.26	Then the watchman saw another man running, and he called to the gatekeeper, “Look! Another man is running alone!”
2SA.18.26	The king said, “He is also bringing good news!”
2SA.18.27	The watchman said, “I think the first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok.”
2SA.18.27	The king said, “Ahimaaz is a good man. He must be bringing good news!”
2SA.18.28	Then Ahimaaz called a greeting to the king. He bowed facedown on the ground before the king and said, “Praise the L
2SA.18.29	The king asked, “Is young Absalom all right?”
2SA.18.29	Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent me, I saw some great excitement, but I don’t know what it was.”
2SA.18.30	The king said, “Step over here and wait.” So Ahimaaz stepped aside and stood there.
2SA.18.31	Then the Cushite arrived. He said, “Master and king, hear the good news! Today the L
2SA.18.32	The king asked the Cushite, “Is young Absalom all right?”
2SA.18.32	The Cushite answered, “May your enemies and all who come to hurt you be like that young man!”
2SA.18.33	Then the king was very upset, and he went to the room over the city gate and cried. As he went, he cried out, “My son Absalom, my son Absalom! I wish I had died and not you. Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.1	People told Joab, “Look, the king is sad and crying because of Absalom.” 
2SA.19.2	David’s army had won the battle that day. But it became a very sad day for all the people, because they heard that the king was very sad for his son. 
2SA.19.3	The people came into the city quietly that day. They were like an army that had been defeated in battle and had run away. 
2SA.19.4	The king covered his face and cried loudly, “My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!”
2SA.19.5	Joab went into the king’s house and said, “Today you have shamed all your men. They saved your life and the lives of your sons, daughters, wives, and slave women. 
2SA.19.6	You have shamed them because you love those who hate you, and you hate those who love you. Today you have made it clear that your commanders and men mean nothing to you. What if Absalom had lived and all of us were dead? I can see you would be pleased. 
2SA.19.7	Now go out and encourage your servants. I swear by the L
2SA.19.8	So the king went to the city gate. When the news spread that the king was at the gate, everyone came to see him.
2SA.19.8	All the Israelites who had followed Absalom had run away to their homes. 
2SA.19.9	People in all the tribes of Israel began to argue, saying, “The king saved us from the Philistines and our other enemies, but he left the country because of Absalom. 
2SA.19.10	We appointed Absalom to rule us, but now he has died in battle. We should make David the king again.”
2SA.19.11	King David sent a message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, that said, “Speak to the elders of Judah. Say, ‘Even in my house I have heard what all the Israelites are saying. So why are you the last tribe to bring the king back to his palace? 
2SA.19.12	You are my brothers, my own family. Why are you the last tribe to bring back the king?’ 
2SA.19.13	And say to Amasa, ‘You are part of my own family. May God punish me terribly if I don’t make you commander of the army in Joab’s place!’ ”
2SA.19.14	David touched the hearts of all the people of Judah at once. They sent a message to the king that said, “Return with all your men.” 
2SA.19.15	Then the king returned as far as the Jordan River. The men of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and to bring him across the Jordan.
2SA.19.16	Shimei son of Gera, a Benjaminite who lived in Bahurim, hurried down with the men of Judah to meet King David. 
2SA.19.17	With Shimei came a thousand Benjaminites. Ziba, the servant from Saul’s family, also came, bringing his fifteen sons and twenty servants with him. They all hurried to the Jordan River to meet the king. 
2SA.19.18	The people went across the Jordan to help bring the king’s family back to Judah and to do whatever the king wanted. As the king was crossing the river, Shimei son of Gera came to him and bowed facedown on the ground in front of the king. 
2SA.19.19	He said to the king, “My master, don’t hold me guilty. Don’t remember the wrong I did when you left Jerusalem! Don’t hold it against me. 
2SA.19.20	I know I have sinned. That is why I am the first person from Joseph’s family to come down and meet you today, my master and king!”
2SA.19.21	But Abishai son of Zeruiah said, “Shimei should die because he cursed you, the L
2SA.19.22	David said, “This does not concern you, sons of Zeruiah! Today you’re against me! No one will be put to death in Israel today. Today I know I am king over Israel!” 
2SA.19.23	Then the king promised Shimei, “You won’t die.”
2SA.19.24	Mephibosheth, Saul’s grandson, also went down to meet King David. Mephibosheth had not cared for his feet, cut his beard, or washed his clothes from the time the king had left Jerusalem until he returned safely. 
2SA.19.25	When Mephibosheth came from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king asked him, “Mephibosheth, why didn’t you go with me?”
2SA.19.26	He answered, “My master, my servant Ziba tricked me! I said to Ziba, ‘I am crippled, so saddle a donkey. Then I will ride it so I can go with the king.’ 
2SA.19.27	But he lied about me to you. You, my master and king, are like an angel from God. Do what you think is good. 
2SA.19.28	You could have killed all my grandfather’s family. Instead, you put me with those people who eat at your own table. So I don’t have a right to ask anything more from the king!”
2SA.19.29	The king said to him, “Don’t say anything more. I have decided that you and Ziba will divide the land.”
2SA.19.30	Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let Ziba take all the land now that my master the king has arrived safely home.”
2SA.19.31	Barzillai of Gilead came down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan River with the king. 
2SA.19.32	Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years old. He had taken care of the king when David was staying at Mahanaim, because Barzillai was a very rich man. 
2SA.19.33	David said to Barzillai, “Cross the river with me. Come with me to Jerusalem, and I will take care of you.”
2SA.19.34	But Barzillai answered the king, “Do you know how old I am? Do you think I can go with you to Jerusalem? 
2SA.19.35	I am eighty years old! I am too old to taste what I eat or drink. I am too old to hear the voices of men and women singers. Why should you be bothered with me? 
2SA.19.36	I am not worthy of a reward from you, but I will cross the Jordan River with you. 
2SA.19.37	Then let me go back so I may die in my own city near the grave of my father and mother. But here is Kimham, your servant. Let him go with you, my master and king. Do with him whatever you want.”
2SA.19.38	The king answered, “Kimham will go with me. I will do for him anything you wish, and I will do anything for you that you wish.” 
2SA.19.39	The king kissed Barzillai and blessed him. Then Barzillai returned home, and the king and all the people crossed the Jordan.
2SA.19.40	When the king crossed over to Gilgal, Kimham went with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel led David across the river.
2SA.19.41	Soon all the Israelites came to the king and said to him, “Why did our relatives, the people of Judah, steal you away? Why did they bring you and your family across the Jordan River with your men?”
2SA.19.42	All the people of Judah answered the Israelites, “We did this because the king is our close relative. Why are you angry about it? We have not eaten food at the king’s expense or taken anything for ourselves!”
2SA.19.43	The Israelites answered the people of Judah, “We have ten tribes in the kingdom, so we have more right to David than you do! But you ignored us! We were the first ones to talk about bringing our king back!”
2SA.19.43	But the people of Judah spoke even more unkindly than the people of Israel.
2SA.20.1	It happened that a troublemaker named Sheba son of Bicri from the tribe of Benjamin was there. He blew the trumpet and said:
2SA.20.1	“We have no share in David!
2SA.20.1	We have no part in the son of Jesse!
2SA.20.1	People of Israel, let’s go home!”
2SA.20.2	So all the Israelites left David and followed Sheba son of Bicri. But the people of Judah stayed with their king all the way from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.
2SA.20.3	David came back to his palace in Jerusalem. He had left ten of his slave women there to take care of the palace. Now he put them in a locked house. He gave them food, but he did not have sexual relations with them. So they lived like widows until they died.
2SA.20.4	The king said to Amasa, “Tell the men of Judah to meet with me in three days, and you must also be here.” 
2SA.20.5	So Amasa went to call the men of Judah together, but he took more time than the king had said.
2SA.20.6	David said to Abishai, “Sheba son of Bicri is more dangerous to us than Absalom was. Take my men and chase him before he finds walled cities and escapes from us.” 
2SA.20.7	So Joab’s men, the Kerethites and the Pelethites, and all the soldiers went with Abishai. They went out from Jerusalem to chase Sheba son of Bicri.
2SA.20.8	When Joab and the army came to the great rock at Gibeon, Amasa came out to meet them. Joab was wearing his uniform, and at his waist he wore a belt that held his sword in its case. As Joab stepped forward, his sword fell out of its case. 
2SA.20.9	Joab asked Amasa, “Brother, is everything all right with you?” Then with his right hand he took Amasa by the beard to kiss him. 
2SA.20.10	Amasa was not watching the sword in Joab’s hand. So Joab pushed the sword into Amasa’s stomach, causing Amasa’s insides to spill onto the ground. Joab did not have to stab Amasa again; he was already dead. Then Joab and his brother Abishai continued to chase Sheba son of Bicri.
2SA.20.11	One of Joab’s young men stood by Amasa’s body and said, “Everyone who is for Joab and David should follow Joab!” 
2SA.20.12	Amasa lay in the middle of the road, covered with his own blood. When the young man saw that everyone was stopping to look at the body, he dragged it from the road, laid it in a field, and put a cloth over it. 
2SA.20.13	After Amasa’s body was taken off the road, all the men followed Joab to chase Sheba son of Bicri.
2SA.20.14	Sheba went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel Beth Maacah. All the Berites also came together and followed him. 
2SA.20.15	So Joab and his men came to Abel Beth Maacah and surrounded it. They piled dirt up against the city wall, and they began hacking at the walls to bring them down.
2SA.20.16	But a wise woman shouted out from the city, “Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here. I want to talk to him!”
2SA.20.17	So Joab came near her. She asked him, “Are you Joab?”
2SA.20.17	He answered, “Yes, I am.”
2SA.20.17	Then she said, “Listen to what I say.”
2SA.20.17	Joab said, “I’m listening.”
2SA.20.18	Then the woman said, “In the past people would say, ‘Ask for advice at Abel,’ and the problem would be solved. 
2SA.20.19	I am one of the peaceful, loyal people of Israel. You are trying to destroy an important city of Israel. Why must you destroy what belongs to the L
2SA.20.20	Joab answered, “I would prefer not to destroy or ruin anything! 
2SA.20.21	That is not what I want. But there is a man here from the mountains of Ephraim, who is named Sheba son of Bicri. He has turned against King David. If you bring him to me, I will leave the city alone.”
2SA.20.21	The woman said to Joab, “His head will be thrown over the wall to you.”
2SA.20.22	Then the woman spoke very wisely to all the people of the city. They cut off the head of Sheba son of Bicri and threw it over the wall to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and the army left the city. Every man returned home, and Joab went back to the king in Jerusalem.
2SA.20.23	Joab was commander of all the army of Israel. Benaiah son of Jehoiada led the Kerethites and Pelethites. 
2SA.20.24	Adoniram was in charge of the men who were forced to do hard work. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder. 
2SA.20.25	Sheba was the royal secretary. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests, 
2SA.20.26	and Ira the Jairite was David’s priest.
2SA.21.1	During the time David was king, there was a shortage of food that lasted for three years. So David prayed to the L
2SA.21.1	The L
2SA.21.2	(Now the Gibeonites were not Israelites; they were a group of Amorites who were left alive. The Israelites had promised not to hurt the Gibeonites, but Saul had tried to kill them, because he was eager to help the people of Israel and Judah.)
2SA.21.2	King David called the Gibeonites together and spoke to them. 
2SA.21.3	He asked, “What can I do for you? How can I make up for the harm done so you can bless the L
2SA.21.4	The Gibeonites said to David, “We cannot demand silver or gold from Saul or his family. And we don’t have the right to kill anyone in Israel.”
2SA.21.4	Then David asked, “What do you want me to do for you?”
2SA.21.5	The Gibeonites said, “Saul made plans against us and tried to destroy all our people who are left in the land of Israel. 
2SA.21.6	So bring seven of his sons to us. Then we will kill them and hang them on stakes in the presence of the L
2SA.21.6	The king said, “I will give them to you.” 
2SA.21.7	But the king protected Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the promise he had made to Jonathan in the L
2SA.21.8	The king did take Armoni and Mephibosheth, sons of Rizpah and Saul. (Rizpah was the daughter of Aiah.) And the king took the five sons of Saul’s daughter Merab. (Adriel son of Barzillai the Meholathite was the father of Merab’s five sons.) 
2SA.21.9	David gave these seven sons to the Gibeonites. Then the Gibeonites killed them and hung them on stakes on a hill in the presence of the L
2SA.21.10	Aiah’s daughter Rizpah took the rough cloth that was worn to show sadness and put it on a rock for herself. She stayed there from the beginning of the harvest until the rain fell on her sons’ bodies. During the day she did not let the birds of the sky touch her sons’ bodies, and during the night she did not let the wild animals touch them.
2SA.21.11	People told David what Aiah’s daughter Rizpah, Saul’s slave woman, was doing. 
2SA.21.12	Then David took the bones of Saul and Jonathan from the men of Jabesh Gilead. (The Philistines had hung the bodies of Saul and Jonathan in the public square of Beth Shan after they had killed Saul at Gilboa. Later the men of Jabesh Gilead had secretly taken them from there.) 
2SA.21.13	David brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from Gilead. Then the people gathered the bodies of Saul’s seven sons who were hanged on stakes. 
2SA.21.14	The people buried the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan at Zela in Benjamin in the tomb of Saul’s father Kish. The people did everything the king commanded.
2SA.21.14	Then God answered the prayers for the land.
2SA.21.15	Again there was war between the Philistines and Israel. David and his men went out to fight the Philistines, but David became tired. 
2SA.21.16	Ishbi-Benob, one of the sons of Rapha, had a bronze spearhead weighing about seven and one-half pounds and a new sword. He planned to kill David, 
2SA.21.17	but Abishai son of Zeruiah killed the Philistine and saved David’s life.
2SA.21.17	Then David’s men made a promise to him, saying, “Never again will you go out with us to battle. If you were killed, Israel would lose its greatest leader.”
2SA.21.18	Later, at Gob, there was another battle with the Philistines. Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph, another one of the sons of Rapha.
2SA.21.19	Later, there was another battle at Gob with the Philistines. Elhanan son of Jaare-Oregim from Bethlehem killed Goliath from Gath. His spear was as large as a weaver’s rod.
2SA.21.20	At Gath another battle took place. A huge man was there; he had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four fingers and toes in all. This man also was one of the sons of Rapha. 
2SA.21.21	When he challenged Israel, Jonathan son of Shimeah, David’s brother, killed him.
2SA.21.22	These four sons of Rapha from Gath were killed by David and his men.
2SA.22.1	David sang this song to the L
2SA.22.2	He said:
2SA.22.2	“The L
2SA.22.3	My God is my rock.
2SA.22.3	I can run to him for safety.

2SA.22.7	I cried out to my God.

2SA.22.9	Burning coals went before him.

2SA.22.10	with dark clouds under his feet.
2SA.22.11	He rode a creature with wings and flew.
2SA.22.11	He raced on the wings of the wind.
2SA.22.12	He made darkness his shelter,
2SA.22.12	surrounded by fog and clouds.

2SA.22.16	The wind blew from his nose.

2SA.22.51	to David and his descendants forever.”
2SA.23.1	These are the last words of David.
2SA.23.1	This is the message of David son of Jesse.
2SA.23.1	The man made great by the Most High God speaks.
2SA.23.1	He is the appointed king of the God of Jacob;
2SA.23.1	he is the sweet singer of Israel:
2SA.23.2	“The L
2SA.23.2	and his word was on my tongue.
2SA.23.3	The God of Israel spoke;
2SA.23.3	the Rock of Israel said to me:
2SA.23.3	‘Whoever rules fairly over people,
2SA.23.3	who rules with respect for God,
2SA.23.4	is like the morning light at dawn,
2SA.23.4	like a morning without clouds.
2SA.23.4	He is like sunshine after a rain
2SA.23.4	that makes the grass sprout from the ground.’
2SA.23.5	“This is how God has cared for my family.
2SA.23.5	God made a lasting agreement with me,
2SA.23.5	right and sure in every way.
2SA.23.5	He will accomplish my salvation
2SA.23.5	and satisfy all my desires.
2SA.23.6	“But all evil people will be thrown away like thorns
2SA.23.6	that cannot be held in a hand.
2SA.23.7	No one can touch them
2SA.23.7	except with a tool of iron or wood.
2SA.23.7	They will be thrown in the fire and burned where they lie.”
2SA.23.8	These are the names of David’s warriors:
2SA.23.8	Josheb-Basshebeth, the Tahkemonite, was head of the Three. He killed eight hundred men at one time.
2SA.23.9	Next was Eleazar son of Dodai the Ahohite. Eleazar was one of the three soldiers who were with David when they challenged the Philistines. The Philistines were gathered for battle, and the Israelites drew back. 
2SA.23.10	But Eleazar stayed where he was and fought the Philistines until he was so tired his hand stuck to his sword. The L
2SA.23.11	Next there was Shammah son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines came together to fight in a vegetable field. Israel’s troops ran away from the Philistines, 
2SA.23.12	but Shammah stood in the middle of the field and fought for it and killed the Philistines. And the L
2SA.23.13	Once, three of the Thirty, David’s chief soldiers, came down to him at the cave of Adullam during harvest. The Philistine army had camped in the Valley of Rephaim. 
2SA.23.14	At that time David was in the stronghold, and some of the Philistines were in Bethlehem.
2SA.23.15	David had a strong desire for some water. He said, “Oh, I wish someone would get me water from the well near the city gate of Bethlehem!” 
2SA.23.16	So the three warriors broke through the Philistine army and took water from the well near the city gate of Bethlehem. Then they brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. He poured it out before the L
2SA.23.17	saying, “May the L
2SA.23.18	Abishai, brother of Joab son of Zeruiah, was captain of the Three. Abishai fought three hundred soldiers with his spear and killed them. He became as famous as the Three 
2SA.23.19	and was more honored than the Three. He became their commander even though he was not one of them.
2SA.23.20	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave fighter from Kabzeel who did mighty things. He killed two of the best warriors from Moab. He also went down into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day. 
2SA.23.21	Benaiah killed a large Egyptian who had a spear in his hand. Benaiah had a club, but he grabbed the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. 
2SA.23.22	These were the things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did. He was as famous as the Three. 
2SA.23.23	He received more honor than the Thirty, but he did not become a member of the Three. David made him leader of his bodyguards.
2SA.23.24	The following men were among the Thirty:
2SA.23.24	Asahel brother of Joab;
2SA.23.24	Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem;
2SA.23.25	Shammah the Harodite;
2SA.23.25	Elika the Harodite;
2SA.23.26	Helez the Paltite;
2SA.23.26	Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa;
2SA.23.27	Abiezer the Anathothite;
2SA.23.27	Mebunnai the Hushathite;
2SA.23.28	Zalmon the Ahohite;
2SA.23.28	Maharai the Netophathite;
2SA.23.29	Heled son of Baanah the Netophathite;
2SA.23.29	Ithai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin;
2SA.23.30	Benaiah the Pirathonite;
2SA.23.30	Hiddai from the ravines of Gaash;
2SA.23.31	Abi-Albon the Arbathite;
2SA.23.31	Azmaveth the Barhumite;
2SA.23.32	Eliahba the Shaalbonite;
2SA.23.32	the sons of Jashen;
2SA.23.32	Jonathan 
2SA.23.33	son of Shammah the Hararite;
2SA.23.33	Ahiam son of Sharar the Hararite;
2SA.23.34	Eliphelet son of Ahasbai the Maacathite;
2SA.23.34	Eliam son of Ahithophel the Gilonite;
2SA.23.35	Hezro the Carmelite;
2SA.23.35	Paarai the Arbite;
2SA.23.36	Igal son of Nathan of Zobah;
2SA.23.36	the son of Hagri;
2SA.23.37	Zelek the Ammonite;
2SA.23.37	Naharai the Beerothite, who carried the armor of Joab son of Zeruiah;
2SA.23.38	Ira the Ithrite;
2SA.23.38	Gareb the Ithrite,
2SA.23.39	and Uriah the Hittite.
2SA.23.39	There were thirty-seven in all.

2SA.24.2	So King David said to Joab, the commander of the army, “Go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, and count the people. Then I will know how many there are.”
2SA.24.3	But Joab said to the king, “May the L
2SA.24.4	But the king commanded Joab and the commanders of the army, so they left the king to count the Israelites.
2SA.24.5	After crossing the Jordan River, they camped near Aroer on the south side of the city in the ravine. They went through Gad and on to Jazer. 
2SA.24.6	Then they went to Gilead and the land of Tahtim Hodshi and to Dan Jaan and around to Sidon. 
2SA.24.7	They went to the strong, walled city of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went to southern Judah, to Beersheba. 
2SA.24.8	After nine months and twenty days, they had gone through all the land. Then they came back to Jerusalem.
2SA.24.9	Joab gave the list of the people to the king. There were eight hundred thousand men in Israel who could use the sword and five hundred thousand men in Judah.
2SA.24.10	David felt ashamed after he had counted the people. He said to the L
2SA.24.11	When David got up in the morning, the L

2SA.24.13	So Gad went to David and said to him, “Should three years of hunger come to you and your land? Or should your enemies chase you for three months? Or should there be three days of disease in your land? Think about it. Then decide which of these things I should tell the L
2SA.24.14	David said to Gad, “I am in great trouble. Let the L
2SA.24.15	So the L
2SA.24.16	When the angel raised his arm toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the L
2SA.24.17	When David saw the angel that killed the people, he said to the L
2SA.24.18	That day Gad came to David and said, “Go and build an altar to the L
2SA.24.19	So David did what Gad told him to do, just as the L
2SA.24.20	Araunah looked and saw the king and his servants coming to him. So he went out and bowed facedown on the ground before the king. 
2SA.24.21	He said, “Why has my master the king come to me?”
2SA.24.21	David answered, “To buy the threshing floor from you so I can build an altar to the L
2SA.24.22	Araunah said to David, “My master and king, you may take anything you want for a sacrifice. Here are some oxen for the whole burnt offering and the threshing boards and the yokes for the wood. 
2SA.24.23	My king, I give everything to you.” Araunah also said to the king, “May the L
2SA.24.24	But the king answered Araunah, “No, I will pay you for the land. I won’t offer to the L
2SA.24.24	So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for one and one-fourth pounds of silver. 
2SA.24.25	He built an altar to the L
1KI.1.1	At this time King David was very old, and although his servants covered him with blankets, he could not keep warm. 
1KI.1.2	They said to him, “We will look for a young woman to care for you. She will lie close to you and keep you warm.” 
1KI.1.3	After searching everywhere in Israel for a beautiful young woman, they found a girl named Abishag from Shunam and brought her to the king. 
1KI.1.4	The girl was very beautiful, and she cared for the king and served him. But the king did not have sexual relations with her.
1KI.1.5	Adonijah was the son of King David and Haggith, and he was very proud. “I will be the king,” he said. So he got chariots and horses for himself and fifty men for his personal bodyguard. 
1KI.1.6	Now David had never interfered with Adonijah by questioning what he did. Born next after Absalom, Adonijah was a very handsome man.
1KI.1.7	Adonijah spoke with Joab son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest, and they agreed to help him. 
1KI.1.8	But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and King David’s special guard did not join Adonijah.
1KI.1.9	Then Adonijah killed some sheep, cows, and fat calves for sacrifices at the Stone of Zoheleth near the spring of Rogel. He invited all his brothers, the other sons of King David, to come, as well as all the men of Judah. 
1KI.1.10	But Adonijah did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, his father’s special guard, or his brother Solomon.
1KI.1.11	When Nathan heard about this, he went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. “Have you heard that Adonijah, Haggith’s son, has made himself king?” Nathan asked. “Our real king, David, does not know it. 
1KI.1.12	I strongly advise you to save yourself and your sons. 
1KI.1.13	Go to King David and tell him, ‘My master and king, you promised that my son Solomon would be king and would rule on your throne after you. Why then has Adonijah become king?’ 
1KI.1.14	While you are still talking to the king, I will come in and tell him that what you have said about Adonijah is true.”
1KI.1.15	So Bathsheba went in to see the aged king in his bedroom, where Abishag, the girl from Shunam, was caring for him. 
1KI.1.16	Bathsheba bowed and knelt before the king. He asked, “What do you want?”
1KI.1.17	She answered, “My master, you made a promise to me in the name of the L
1KI.1.18	But now, unknown to you, Adonijah has become king. 
1KI.1.19	He has killed many cows, fat calves, and sheep for sacrifices. And he has invited all your sons, as well as Abiathar the priest and Joab the commander of the army, but he did not invite Solomon, who serves you. 
1KI.1.20	My master and king, all the Israelites are watching you, waiting for you to decide who will be king after you. 
1KI.1.21	As soon as you die, Solomon and I will be treated as criminals.”
1KI.1.22	While Bathsheba was still talking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
1KI.1.23	The servants told the king, “Nathan the prophet is here.” So Nathan went to the king and bowed facedown on the ground before him.
1KI.1.24	Nathan said, “My master and king, have you said that Adonijah will be the king after you and that he will rule on your throne? 
1KI.1.25	Today he has sacrificed many cows, fat calves, and sheep, and he has invited all your other sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. Right now they are eating and drinking with him. They are saying, ‘Long live King Adonijah!’ 
1KI.1.26	But he did not invite me, your own servant, or Zadok the priest, or Benaiah son of Jehoiada, or your son Solomon. 
1KI.1.27	Did you do this? Since we are your servants, why didn’t you tell us who should be king after you?”
1KI.1.28	Then the king said, “Tell Bathsheba to come in!” So she came in and stood before the king.
1KI.1.29	Then the king made this promise, “The L
1KI.1.30	I will do today what I have promised you in the name of the L
1KI.1.31	Then Bathsheba bowed facedown on the ground and knelt before the king and said, “Long live my master King David!”
1KI.1.32	Then King David said, “Tell Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada to come in.” When they came before the king, 
1KI.1.33	he said to them, “Take my servants with you and put my son Solomon on my own mule. Take him down to the spring called Gihon. 
1KI.1.34	There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet should pour olive oil on him and make him king over Israel. Blow the trumpet and shout, ‘Long live King Solomon!’ 
1KI.1.35	Then come back up here with him. He will sit on my throne and rule in my place, because he is the one I have chosen to be the ruler over Israel and Judah.”
1KI.1.36	Benaiah son of Jehoiada answered the king, “Amen! This is what the L
1KI.1.37	The L
1KI.1.38	So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada left with the Kerethites and Pelethites. They put Solomon on King David’s mule and took him to the spring called Gihon. 
1KI.1.39	Zadok the priest took the container of olive oil from the Holy Tent and poured the oil on Solomon’s head to show he was the king. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people shouted, “Long live King Solomon!” 
1KI.1.40	All the people followed Solomon into the city. Playing flutes and shouting for joy, they made so much noise the ground shook.
1KI.1.41	At this time Adonijah and all the guests with him were finishing their meal. When he heard the sound from the trumpet, Joab asked, “What does all that noise from the city mean?”
1KI.1.42	While Joab was speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. Adonijah said, “Come in! You are an important man, so you must be bringing good news.”
1KI.1.43	But Jonathan answered, “No! Our master King David has made Solomon the new king. 
1KI.1.44	King David sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and all the king’s bodyguards with him, and they have put Solomon on the king’s own mule. 
1KI.1.45	Then Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet poured olive oil on Solomon at Gihon to make him king. After that they went into the city, shouting with joy. Now the whole city is excited, and that is the noise you hear. 
1KI.1.46	Solomon has now become the king. 
1KI.1.47	All the king’s officers have come to tell King David that he has done a good thing. They are saying, ‘May your God make Solomon even more famous than you and an even greater king than you.’ ” Jonathan continued, “And King David bowed down on his bed to worship God, 
1KI.1.48	saying, ‘Bless the L
1KI.1.49	Then all of Adonijah’s guests were afraid, and they left quickly and scattered. 
1KI.1.50	Adonijah was also afraid of Solomon, so he went and took hold of the corners of the altar. 
1KI.1.51	Then someone told Solomon, “Adonijah is afraid of you, so he is at the altar, holding on to its corners. He says, ‘Tell King Solomon to promise me today that he will not kill me.’ ”
1KI.1.52	So Solomon answered, “Adonijah must show that he is a man of honor. If he does that, I promise he will not lose even a single hair from his head. But if he does anything wrong, he will die.” 
1KI.1.53	Then King Solomon sent some men to get Adonijah. When he was brought from the altar, he came before King Solomon and bowed down. Solomon told him, “Go home.”
1KI.2.1	Since it was almost time for David to die, he gave his son Solomon his last commands. 
1KI.2.2	David said, “My time to die is near. Be a good and strong leader. 
1KI.2.3	Obey the L
1KI.2.4	And if you obey the L
1KI.2.5	“Also, you remember what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me. He killed the two commanders of Israel’s armies: Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He did this as if he and they were at war, although it was a time of peace. He put their blood on the belt around his waist and on his sandals on his feet. 
1KI.2.6	Punish him in the way you think is wisest, but do not let him die peacefully of old age.
1KI.2.7	“Be kind to the children of Barzillai of Gilead, and allow them to eat at your table. They welcomed me when I ran away from your brother Absalom.
1KI.2.8	“And remember, Shimei son of Gera, the Benjaminite, is here with you. He cursed me the day I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan River, I promised him before the Lord, ‘Shimei, I will not kill you.’ 
1KI.2.9	But you should not leave him unpunished. You are a wise man, and you will know what to do to him, but you must be sure he is killed.”
1KI.2.10	Then David died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem. 
1KI.2.11	He had ruled over Israel forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.
1KI.2.12	Solomon became king after David, his father, and he was in firm control of his kingdom.
1KI.2.13	At this time Adonijah son of Haggith went to Bathsheba, Solomon’s mother. “Do you come in peace?” Bathsheba asked.
1KI.2.13	“Yes. This is a peaceful visit,” Adonijah answered. 
1KI.2.14	“I have something to say to you.”
1KI.2.14	“You may speak,” she said.
1KI.2.15	“You remember that at one time the kingdom was mine,” Adonijah said. “All the people of Israel recognized me as their king, but things have changed. Now my brother is the king, because the L
1KI.2.16	Now I have one thing to ask you; please do not refuse me.”
1KI.2.16	Bathsheba answered, “What do you want?”
1KI.2.17	“I know King Solomon will do anything you ask him,” Adonijah continued. “Please ask him to give me Abishag the Shunammite to be my wife.”
1KI.2.18	“Very well,” she answered. “I will speak to the king for you.”
1KI.2.19	So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. When Solomon saw her, he stood up to meet her, then bowed down, and sat on the throne. He told some servants to bring another throne for his mother. Then she sat down at his right side.
1KI.2.20	Bathsheba said, “I have one small thing to ask you. Please do not refuse me.”
1KI.2.20	“Ask, mother,” the king answered. “I will not refuse you.”
1KI.2.21	So she said, “Allow Abishag the Shunammite to marry your brother Adonijah.”
1KI.2.22	King Solomon answered his mother, “Why do you ask me to give him Abishag? Why don’t you also ask for him to become the king since he is my older brother? Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah would support him!”
1KI.2.23	Then King Solomon swore by the name of the L
1KI.2.24	By the L
1KI.2.25	Then King Solomon gave orders to Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and he went and killed Adonijah.
1KI.2.26	King Solomon said to Abiathar the priest, “I should kill you too, but I will allow you to go back to your fields in Anathoth. I will not kill you at this time, because you helped carry the Ark of the Lord 
1KI.2.27	Then Solomon removed Abiathar from being the 
1KI.2.28	When Joab heard about what had happened, he was afraid. He had supported Adonijah but not Absalom. So Joab ran to the Tent of the L
1KI.2.29	Someone told King Solomon that Joab had run to the Tent of the L
1KI.2.30	Benaiah went into the Tent of the L
1KI.2.30	But Joab answered, “No, I will die here.”
1KI.2.30	So Benaiah went back to the king and told him what Joab had said. 
1KI.2.31	Then the king ordered Benaiah, “Do as he says! Kill him there and bury him. Then my family and I will be free of the guilt of Joab, who has killed innocent people. 
1KI.2.32	Without my father knowing it, he killed two men who were much better than he was—Abner son of Ner, the commander of Israel’s army, and Amasa son of Jether, the commander of Judah’s army. So the L
1KI.2.33	Joab and his family will be forever guilty for their deaths, but there will be peace from the L
1KI.2.34	So Benaiah son of Jehoiada killed Joab, and he was buried near his home in the desert. 
1KI.2.35	The king then made Benaiah son of Jehoiada commander of the army in Joab’s place. He also made Zadok the new high priest in Abiathar’s place.
1KI.2.36	Next the king sent for Shimei. Solomon said to him, “Build a house for yourself in Jerusalem and live there. Don’t leave the city. 
1KI.2.37	The very day you leave and cross the Kidron Valley, someone will kill you, and it will be your own fault.”
1KI.2.38	So Shimei answered the king, “I agree with what you say. I will do what you say, my master and king.” So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
1KI.2.39	But three years later two of Shimei’s slaves ran away to Achish king of Gath, who was the son of Maacah. Shimei heard that his slaves were in Gath, 
1KI.2.40	so he put his saddle on his donkey and went to Achish at Gath to find them. Then he brought them back from Gath.
1KI.2.41	Someone told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and had returned. 
1KI.2.42	So Solomon sent for Shimei and said, “I made you promise in the name of the L
1KI.2.43	Why did you break your promise to the L
1KI.2.44	The king also said, “You know the many wrong things you did to my father David, so now the L
1KI.2.45	But the L
1KI.2.46	Then the king ordered Benaiah to kill Shimei, and he did. Now Solomon was in full control of his kingdom.
1KI.3.1	Solomon made an agreement with the king of Egypt by marrying his daughter and bringing her to Jerusalem. At this time Solomon was still building his palace and the Temple of the L
1KI.3.2	The Temple for the worship of the L
1KI.3.3	Solomon showed he loved the L
1KI.3.4	King Solomon went to Gibeon to offer a sacrifice, because it was the most important place of worship. He offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. 
1KI.3.5	While he was at Gibeon, the L
1KI.3.6	Solomon answered, “You were very kind to your servant, my father David. He obeyed you, and he was honest and lived right. You showed great kindness to him when you allowed his son to be king after him. 
1KI.3.7	L
1KI.3.8	I, your servant, am here among your chosen people, and there are too many of them to count. 
1KI.3.9	I ask that you give me a heart that understands, so I can rule the people in the right way and will know the difference between right and wrong. Otherwise, it is impossible to rule this great people of yours.”
1KI.3.10	The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked this. 
1KI.3.11	So God said to him, “You did not ask for a long life, or riches for yourself, or the death of your enemies. Since you asked for wisdom to make the right decisions, 
1KI.3.12	I will do what you asked. I will give you wisdom and understanding that is greater than anyone has had in the past or will have in the future. 
1KI.3.13	I will also give you what you did not ask for: riches and honor. During your life no other king will be as great as you. 
1KI.3.14	If you follow me and obey my laws and commands, as your father David did, I will also give you a long life.”
1KI.3.15	After Solomon woke up from the dream, he went to Jerusalem. He stood before the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1KI.3.16	One day two women who were prostitutes came to Solomon. As they stood before him, 
1KI.3.17	one of the women said, “My master, this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth to a baby while she was there with me. 
1KI.3.18	Three days later this woman also gave birth to a baby. No one else was in the house with us; it was just the two of us. 
1KI.3.19	One night this woman rolled over on her baby, and he died. 
1KI.3.20	So she took my son from my bed during the night while I was asleep, and she carried him to her bed. Then she put the dead baby in my bed. 
1KI.3.21	The next morning when I got up to feed my baby, I saw that he was dead! When I looked at him more closely, I realized he was not my son.”
1KI.3.22	“No!” the other woman cried. “The living baby is my son, and the dead baby is yours!”
1KI.3.22	But the first woman said, “No! The dead baby is yours, and the living one is mine!” So the two women argued before the king.
1KI.3.23	Then King Solomon said, “One of you says, ‘My son is alive and your son is dead.’ Then the other one says, ‘No! Your son is dead and my son is alive.’ ”
1KI.3.24	The king sent his servants to get a sword. When they brought it to him, 
1KI.3.25	he said, “Cut the living baby into two pieces, and give each woman half.”
1KI.3.26	The real mother of the living child was full of love for her son. So she said to the king, “Please, my master, don’t kill him! Give the baby to her!”
1KI.3.26	But the other woman said, “Neither of us will have him. Cut him into two pieces!”
1KI.3.27	Then King Solomon said, “Don’t kill him. Give the baby to the first woman, because she is the real mother.”
1KI.3.28	When the people of Israel heard about King Solomon’s decision, they respected him very much. They saw he had wisdom from God to make the right decisions.
1KI.4.1	King Solomon ruled over all Israel. 
1KI.4.2	These are the names of his leading officers:
1KI.4.2	Azariah son of Zadok was the priest;
1KI.4.3	Elihoreph and Ahijah, sons of Shisha, recorded what happened in the courts;
1KI.4.3	Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud recorded the history of the people;
1KI.4.4	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was commander of the army;
1KI.4.4	Zadok and Abiathar were priests;
1KI.4.5	Azariah son of Nathan was in charge of the district governors;
1KI.4.5	Zabud son of Nathan was a priest and adviser to the king;
1KI.4.6	Ahishar was responsible for everything in the palace;
1KI.4.6	Adoniram son of Abda was in charge of the labor force.
1KI.4.7	Solomon placed twelve governors over the districts of Israel, who gathered food from their districts for the king and his family. Each governor was responsible for bringing food to the king one month of each year. 
1KI.4.8	These are the names of the twelve governors:
1KI.4.8	Ben-Hur was governor of the mountain country of Ephraim.
1KI.4.9	Ben-Deker was governor of Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth Shemesh, and Elon Bethhanan.
1KI.4.10	Ben-Hesed was governor of Arubboth, Socoh, and all the land of Hepher.
1KI.4.11	Ben-Abinadab was governor of Naphoth Dor. (He was married to Taphath, Solomon’s daughter.)
1KI.4.12	Baana son of Ahilud was governor of Taanach, Megiddo, and all of Beth Shan next to Zarethan. This was below Jezreel from Beth Shan to Abel Meholah across from Jokmeam.
1KI.4.13	Ben-Geber was governor of Ramoth in Gilead. (He was governor of all the towns of Jair in Gilead. Jair was the son of Manasseh. Ben-Geber was also over the district of Argob in Bashan, which had sixty large, walled cities with bronze bars on their gates.)
1KI.4.14	Ahinadab son of Iddo was governor of Mahanaim.
1KI.4.15	Ahimaaz was governor of Naphtali. (He was married to Basemath, Solomon’s daughter.)
1KI.4.16	Baana son of Hushai was governor of Asher and Aloth.
1KI.4.17	Jehoshaphat son of Paruah was governor of Issachar.
1KI.4.18	Shimei son of Ela was governor of Benjamin.
1KI.4.19	Geber son of Uri was governor of Gilead. Gilead had been the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and Og king of Bashan. But Geber was the only governor over this district.
1KI.4.20	There were as many people in Judah and Israel as grains of sand on the seashore. The people ate, drank, and were happy. 
1KI.4.21	Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. These countries brought Solomon the payments he demanded, and they were under his control all his life.
1KI.4.22	Solomon needed much food each day to feed himself and all the people who ate at his table: one hundred ninety-five bushels of fine flour, three hundred ninety bushels of grain, 
1KI.4.23	ten cows that were fed on good grain, twenty cows that were raised in the fields, one hundred sheep, three kinds of deer, and fattened birds.
1KI.4.24	Solomon controlled all the countries west of the Euphrates River—the land from Tiphsah to Gaza. And he had peace on all sides of his kingdom. 
1KI.4.25	During Solomon’s life Judah and Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, also lived in peace; all of his people were able to sit under their own fig trees and grapevines.
1KI.4.26	Solomon had four thousand stalls for his chariot horses and twelve thousand horses. 
1KI.4.27	Each month one of the district governors gave King Solomon all the food he needed—enough for every person who ate at the king’s table. The governors made sure he had everything he needed. 
1KI.4.28	They also brought enough barley and straw for Solomon’s chariot and work horses; each person brought this grain to the right place.
1KI.4.29	God gave Solomon great wisdom so he could understand many things. His wisdom was as hard to measure as the grains of sand on the seashore. 
1KI.4.30	His wisdom was greater than any wisdom of the East, or any wisdom in Egypt. 
1KI.4.31	He was wiser than anyone on earth. He was even wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, as well as Heman, Calcol, and Darda—the three sons of Mahol. King Solomon became famous in all the surrounding countries. 
1KI.4.32	During his life he spoke three thousand wise sayings and also wrote one thousand five songs. 
1KI.4.33	He taught about many kinds of plants—everything from the great cedar trees of Lebanon to the weeds that grow out of the walls. He also taught about animals, birds, crawling things, and fish. 
1KI.4.34	People from all nations came to listen to King Solomon’s wisdom. The kings of all nations sent them to him, because they had heard of Solomon’s wisdom.
1KI.5.1	Hiram, the king of Tyre, had always been David’s friend. When Hiram heard that Solomon had been made king in David’s place, he sent his messengers to Solomon. 
1KI.5.2	Solomon sent this message back to King Hiram: 
1KI.5.3	“You remember my father David had to fight many wars with the countries around him, so he was never able to build a temple for worshiping the L
1KI.5.4	But now the L
1KI.5.5	“The L
1KI.5.6	So send your men to cut down cedar trees for me from Lebanon. My servants will work with yours, and I will pay them whatever wages you decide. We don’t have anyone who can cut down trees as well as the people of Sidon.”
1KI.5.7	When Hiram heard what Solomon asked, he was very happy. He said, “Praise the L
1KI.5.8	Then Hiram sent back this message to Solomon: “I received the message you sent, and I will give you all the cedar and pine trees you want. 
1KI.5.9	My servants will bring them down from Lebanon to the sea. There I will tie them together and float them along the shore to the place you choose. Then I will separate the logs there, and you can take them away. In return it is my wish that you give food to all those who live with me.” 
1KI.5.10	So Hiram gave Solomon as much cedar and pine as he wanted. 
1KI.5.11	And Solomon gave Hiram about one hundred twenty-five thousand bushels of wheat each year to feed the people who lived with him. Solomon also gave him about one hundred fifteen thousand gallons of pure olive oil every year.
1KI.5.12	The L
1KI.5.13	King Solomon forced thirty thousand men of Israel to help in this work. 
1KI.5.14	He sent a group of ten thousand men each month to Lebanon. Each group worked in Lebanon one month, then went home for two months. A man named Adoniram was in charge. 
1KI.5.15	Solomon forced eighty thousand men to work in the hill country, cutting stone, and he had seventy thousand men to carry the stones. 
1KI.5.16	There were also thirty-three hundred men who directed the workers. 
1KI.5.17	King Solomon commanded them to cut large blocks of fine stone to be used for the foundation of the Temple. 
1KI.5.18	Solomon’s and Hiram’s builders and the men from Byblos carved the stones and prepared the stones and the logs for building the Temple.
1KI.6.1	Solomon began to build the Temple four hundred eighty years after the people of Israel had left Egypt. This was during the fourth year of King Solomon’s rule over Israel. It was the second month, the month of Ziv.
1KI.6.2	The Temple was ninety feet long, thirty feet wide, and forty-five feet high. 
1KI.6.3	The porch in front of the main room of the Temple was fifteen feet deep and thirty feet wide. This room ran along the front of the Temple itself. Its width was equal to that of the Temple. 
1KI.6.4	The Temple also had windows that opened and closed. 
1KI.6.5	Solomon also built some side rooms against the walls of the main room and the inner room of the Temple. He built rooms all around. 
1KI.6.6	The rooms on the bottom floor were seven and one-half feet wide. Those on the middle floor were nine feet wide, and the rooms above them were ten and one-half feet wide. The Temple wall that formed the side of each room was thinner than the wall in the room below. These rooms were pushed against the Temple wall, but they did not have their main beams built into this wall.
1KI.6.7	The stones were prepared at the same place where they were cut from the ground. Since these stones were the only ones used to build the Temple, there was no noise of hammers, axes, or any other iron tools at the Temple.
1KI.6.8	The entrance to the lower rooms beside the Temple was on the south side. From there, stairs went up to the second-floor rooms. And from there, stairs went on to the third-floor rooms. 
1KI.6.9	Solomon put a roof made from beams and cedar boards on the Temple. So he finished building the Temple 
1KI.6.10	as well as the bottom floor that was beside the Temple. This bottom floor was seven and one-half feet high and was attached to the Temple by cedar beams.
1KI.6.11	The L
1KI.6.12	“If you obey all my laws and commands, I will do for you what I promised your father David. 
1KI.6.13	I will live among the Israelites in this Temple, and I will never leave my people Israel.”
1KI.6.14	So Solomon finished building the Temple. 
1KI.6.15	The inside walls were covered from floor to ceiling with cedar boards. The floor was made from pine boards. 
1KI.6.16	A room thirty feet long was built in the back part of the Temple. This room, called the Most Holy Place, was separated from the rest of the Temple by cedar boards which reached from floor to ceiling. 
1KI.6.17	The main room, the one in front of the Most Holy Place, was sixty feet long. 
1KI.6.18	Everything inside the Temple was covered with cedar, which was carved with pictures of flowers and plants. A person could not see the stones of the wall, only the cedar.
1KI.6.19	Solomon prepared the inner room at the back of the Temple to keep the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1KI.6.20	This inner room was thirty feet long, thirty feet wide, and thirty feet high. He covered this room with pure gold, and he also covered the altar of cedar. 
1KI.6.21	He covered the inside of the Temple with pure gold, placing gold chains across the front of the inner room, which was also covered with gold. 
1KI.6.22	So all the inside of the Temple, as well as the altar of the Most Holy Place, was covered with gold.
1KI.6.23	Solomon made two creatures from olive wood and placed them in the Most Holy Place. Each creature was fifteen feet tall 
1KI.6.24	and had two wings. Each wing was seven and one-half feet long, so it was fifteen feet from the end of one wing to the end of the other. 
1KI.6.25	The creatures were the same size and shape; 
1KI.6.26	each was fifteen feet tall. 
1KI.6.27	These creatures were put beside each other in the Most Holy Place with their wings spread out. One creature’s wing touched one wall, and the other creature’s wing touched the other wall with their wings touching each other in the middle of the room. 
1KI.6.28	These two creatures were covered with gold.
1KI.6.29	All the walls around the Temple were carved with pictures of creatures with wings, as well as palm trees and flowers. This was true for both the main room and the inner room. 
1KI.6.30	The floors of both rooms were covered with gold.
1KI.6.31	Doors made from olive wood were placed at the entrance to the Most Holy Place. These doors had five-sided frames. 
1KI.6.32	Creatures with wings, as well as palm trees and flowers, were also carved on the two olive wood doors that were covered with gold. The creatures and the palm trees on the doors were covered with gold as well. 
1KI.6.33	At the entrance to the main room there was a square door frame made of olive wood. 
1KI.6.34	Two doors were made from pine. Each door had two parts so the doors folded. 
1KI.6.35	The doors were covered with pictures of creatures with wings, as well as palm trees and flowers. All of the carvings were covered with gold, which was evenly spread over them.
1KI.6.36	The inner courtyard was enclosed by walls, which were made of three rows of cut stones and one row of cedar boards.
1KI.6.37	Work began on the Temple in Ziv, the second month, during the fourth year Solomon was king over Israel. 
1KI.6.38	The Temple was finished during the eleventh year he was king, in the eighth month, the month of Bul. It was built exactly as it was planned. Solomon had spent seven years building it.
1KI.7.1	King Solomon also built a palace for himself; it took him thirteen years to finish it. 
1KI.7.2	Built of cedars from the Forest of Lebanon, it was one hundred fifty feet long, seventy-five feet wide, and forty-five feet high. It had four rows of cedar columns which supported the cedar beams. 
1KI.7.3	There were forty-five beams on the roof, with fifteen beams in each row, and the ceiling was covered with cedar above the beams. 
1KI.7.4	Windows were placed in three rows facing each other. 
1KI.7.5	All the doors were square, and the three doors at each end faced each other.
1KI.7.6	Solomon also built the porch that had pillars. This porch was seventy-five feet long and forty-five feet wide. Along the front of the porch was a roof supported by pillars.
1KI.7.7	Solomon also built a throne room where he judged people, called the Hall of Justice. This room was covered with cedar from the floor to the ceiling. 
1KI.7.8	The palace where Solomon lived was built like the Hall of Justice, and it was behind this hall. Solomon also built the same kind of palace for his wife, who was the daughter of the king of Egypt.
1KI.7.9	All these buildings were made with blocks of fine stone. First they were carefully cut. Then they were trimmed with a saw in the front and back. These fine stones went from the foundations of the buildings to the top of the walls. Even the courtyard was made with blocks of stone. 
1KI.7.10	The foundations were made with large blocks of fine stone, some as long as fifteen feet. Others were twelve feet long. 
1KI.7.11	On top of these foundation stones were other blocks of fine stone and cedar beams. 
1KI.7.12	The palace courtyard, the courtyard inside the Temple, and the porch of the Temple were surrounded by walls. All of these walls had three rows of stone blocks and one row of cedar beams.
1KI.7.13	King Solomon sent to Tyre and had Huram brought to him. 
1KI.7.14	Huram’s mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali. His father was from Tyre and had been skilled in making things from bronze. Huram was also very skilled and experienced in bronze work. So he came to King Solomon and did all the bronze work.
1KI.7.15	He made two bronze pillars, each one twenty-seven feet tall and eighteen feet around. 
1KI.7.16	He also made two bronze capitals that were seven and one-half feet tall, and he put them on top of the pillars. 
1KI.7.17	Then he made a net of seven chains for each capital, which covered the capitals on top of the two pillars. 
1KI.7.18	He made two rows of bronze pomegranates to go on the nets. These covered the capitals at the top of the pillars. 
1KI.7.19	The capitals on top of the pillars in the porch were shaped like lilies, and they were six feet tall. 
1KI.7.20	The capitals were on top of both pillars, above the bowl-shaped section and next to the nets. At that place there were two hundred pomegranates in rows all around the capitals. 
1KI.7.21	Huram put these two bronze pillars at the porch of the Temple. He named the south pillar He Establishes and the north pillar In Him Is Strength. 
1KI.7.22	The capitals on top of the pillars were shaped like lilies. So the work on the pillars was finished.
1KI.7.23	Then Huram made from bronze a large round bowl, which was called the Sea. It was forty-five feet around, fifteen feet across, and seven and one-half feet deep. 
1KI.7.24	Around the outer edge of the bowl was a rim. Under this rim were two rows of bronze plants which surrounded the bowl. There were ten plants every eighteen inches, and these plants were made in one piece with the bowl. 
1KI.7.25	The bowl rested on the backs of twelve bronze bulls that faced outward from the center of the bowl. Three bulls faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. 
1KI.7.26	The sides of the bowl were four inches thick, and it held about eleven thousand gallons. The rim of the bowl was like the rim of a cup or like a lily blossom.
1KI.7.27	Then Huram made ten bronze stands, each one six feet long, six feet wide, and four and one-half feet high. 
1KI.7.28	The stands were made from square sides, which were put on frames. 
1KI.7.29	On the sides were bronze lions, bulls, and creatures with wings. On the frames above and below the lions and bulls were designs of flowers hammered into the bronze. 
1KI.7.30	Each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles. At the corners there were bronze supports for a large bowl, and the supports had designs of flowers. 
1KI.7.31	There was a frame on top of the bowls, eighteen inches high above the bowls. The opening of the bowl was round, twenty-seven inches deep. Designs were carved into the bronze on the frame, which was square, not round. 
1KI.7.32	The four wheels, placed under the frame, were twenty-seven inches high. The axles between the wheels were made as one piece with the stand. 
1KI.7.33	The wheels were like a chariot’s wheels. Everything on the wheels—the axles, rims, spokes, and hubs—were made of bronze.
1KI.7.34	The four supports were on the four corners of each stand. They were made as one piece with the stand. 
1KI.7.35	A strip of bronze around the top of each stand was nine inches deep. It was also made as one piece with the stand. 
1KI.7.36	The sides of the stand and the frames were covered with carvings of creatures with wings, as well as lions, palm trees, and flowers. 
1KI.7.37	This is the way Huram made the ten stands. The bronze for each stand was melted and poured into a mold, so all the stands were the same size and shape.
1KI.7.38	Huram also made ten bronze bowls, one bowl for each of the ten stands. Each bowl was six feet across and could hold about two hundred thirty gallons. 
1KI.7.39	Huram put five stands on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. He put the large bowl in the southeast corner of the Temple. 
1KI.7.40	Huram also made bowls, shovels, and small bowls.
1KI.7.40	So Huram finished all his work for King Solomon on the Temple of the L
1KI.7.41	two pillars;
1KI.7.41	two large bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars;
1KI.7.41	two nets to cover the two large bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars;
1KI.7.42	four hundred pomegranates for the two nets (there were two rows of pomegranates for each net covering the bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars); 
1KI.7.43	ten stands with a bowl on each stand;
1KI.7.44	the large bowl with twelve bulls under it;
1KI.7.45	the pots, shovels, small bowls, and all the utensils for the Temple of the L
1KI.7.45	Huram made everything King Solomon wanted from polished bronze. 
1KI.7.46	The king had these things poured into clay molds that were made in the plain of the Jordan River between Succoth and Zarethan. 
1KI.7.47	Solomon never weighed the bronze used to make these things, because there was too much to weigh. So the total weight of all the bronze was never known.
1KI.7.48	Solomon also made all the items for the Temple of the L
1KI.7.48	the golden altar;
1KI.7.48	the golden table which held the bread that shows God’s people are in his presence;
1KI.7.49	the lampstands of pure gold (five on the right side and five on the left side in front of the Most Holy Place);
1KI.7.49	the flowers, lamps, and tongs of gold;
1KI.7.50	the pure gold bowls, wick trimmers, small bowls, pans, and dishes used to carry coals;
1KI.7.50	the gold hinges for the doors of the Most Holy Place and the main room of the Temple.
1KI.7.51	Finally the work King Solomon did for the Temple of the L
1KI.8.1	King Solomon called for the elders of Israel, the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the families to come to him in Jerusalem. He wanted them to bring the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1KI.8.2	So all the Israelites came together with King Solomon during the festival in the month of Ethanim, the seventh month.
1KI.8.3	When all the elders of Israel arrived, the priests lifted up the Ark. 
1KI.8.4	They carried the Ark of the L
1KI.8.5	King Solomon and all the Israelites gathered before the Ark and sacrificed so many sheep and cattle no one could count them all. 
1KI.8.6	Then the priests put the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1KI.8.7	The wings of these creatures were spread out over the place for the Ark, covering it and its carrying poles. 
1KI.8.8	The carrying poles were so long that anyone standing in the Holy Place in front of the Most Holy Place could see the ends of the poles, but no one could see them from outside the Holy Place. The poles are still there today. 
1KI.8.9	The only things inside the Ark were two stone tablets that Moses had put in the Ark at Mount Sinai. That was where the L
1KI.8.10	When the priests left the Holy Place, a cloud filled the Temple of the L
1KI.8.11	The priests could not continue their work, because the Temple was filled with the glory of the L
1KI.8.12	Then Solomon said, “The L
1KI.8.13	L
1KI.8.14	While all the Israelites were standing there, King Solomon turned to them and blessed them.
1KI.8.15	Then he said, “Praise the L
1KI.8.16	‘Since the time I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel where a temple will be built for me. But I have chosen David to lead my people Israel.’
1KI.8.17	“My father David wanted to build a temple for the L
1KI.8.18	But the L
1KI.8.19	But you are not the one to build it. Your son, who comes from your own body, is the one who will build my temple.’
1KI.8.20	“Now the L
1KI.8.21	I have made a place there for the Ark, in which is the Agreement the L
1KI.8.22	Then Solomon stood facing the L
1KI.8.23	and said:
1KI.8.23	“L
1KI.8.24	You have kept the promise you made to your servant David, my father. You spoke it with your own mouth and finished it with your hands today. 
1KI.8.25	Now L
1KI.8.26	Now, God of Israel, please continue to keep that promise you made to your servant David, my father.
1KI.8.27	“But, God, can you really live here on the earth? The sky and the highest place in heaven cannot contain you. Surely this house which I have built cannot contain you. 
1KI.8.28	But please listen to my prayer and my request, because I am your servant. L
1KI.8.29	Night and day please watch over this Temple where you have said, ‘I will be worshiped there.’ Hear the prayer I pray facing this Temple. 
1KI.8.30	Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people Israel when we pray facing this place. Hear from your home in heaven, and when you hear, forgive us.
1KI.8.31	“If someone wrongs another person, he will be brought to the altar in this Temple. If he swears an oath that he is not guilty, 
1KI.8.32	then hear in heaven. Judge the case, punish the guilty, but declare that the innocent person is not guilty.
1KI.8.33	“When your people, the Israelites, sin against you, their enemies will defeat them. But if they come back to you and praise you and pray to you in this Temple, 
1KI.8.34	then hear them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land you gave to their ancestors.
1KI.8.35	“When they sin against you, you will stop the rain from falling on their land. Then they will pray, facing this place and praising you; they will stop sinning when you make them suffer. 
1KI.8.36	When this happens, please hear their prayer in heaven, and forgive the sins of your servants, the Israelites. Teach them to do what is right. Then please send rain to this land you have given particularly to them.
1KI.8.37	“At times the land will become so dry that no food will grow, or a great sickness will spread among the people. Sometimes all the crops will be destroyed by locusts or grasshoppers. Your people will be attacked in their cities by their enemy or will become sick. 
1KI.8.38	When any of these things happen, the people will become truly sorry. If your people spread their hands in prayer toward this Temple, 
1KI.8.39	then hear their prayers from your home in heaven. Forgive and treat each person as he should be treated because you know what is in a person’s heart. Only you know what is in everyone’s heart. 
1KI.8.40	Then your people will respect you as long as they live in this land you gave to our ancestors.
1KI.8.41+1KI.8.42	“People who are not Israelites, foreigners from other lands, will hear about your greatness and power. They will come from far away to pray at this Temple. 
1KI.8.43	Then hear from your home in heaven, and do whatever they ask you. Then people everywhere will know you and respect you, just as your people in Israel do. Then everyone will know I built this Temple as a place to worship you.
1KI.8.44	“When your people go out to fight their enemies along some road on which you send them, your people will pray to you, facing the city which you have chosen and the Temple I have built for you. 
1KI.8.45	Then hear in heaven their prayers, and do what is right.
1KI.8.46	“Everyone sins, so your people will also sin against you. You will become angry with them and hand them over to their enemies. Their enemies will capture them and take them away to their countries far or near. 
1KI.8.47	Your people will be sorry for their sins when they are held as prisoners in another country. They will be sorry and pray to you in the land where they are held as prisoners, saying, ‘We have sinned. We have done wrong and acted wickedly.’ 
1KI.8.48	They will truly turn back to you in the land of their enemies. They will pray to you, facing this land you gave their ancestors, this city you have chosen, and the Temple I have built for you. 
1KI.8.49	Then hear their prayers from your home in heaven, and do what is right. 
1KI.8.50	Forgive your people of all their sins and for turning against you. Make those who have captured them show them mercy. 
1KI.8.51	Remember, they are your special people. You brought them out of Egypt, as if you were pulling them out of a blazing furnace.
1KI.8.52	“Give your attention to my prayers and the prayers of your people Israel. Listen to them anytime they ask you for help. 
1KI.8.53	You chose them from all the nations on earth to be your very own people. This is what you promised through Moses your servant when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt, Lord G
1KI.8.54	Solomon prayed this prayer to the L
1KI.8.55	Then, in a loud voice, he stood and blessed all the people of Israel, saying: 
1KI.8.56	“Praise the L
1KI.8.57	May the L
1KI.8.58	and may he turn us to himself so we will follow him. Let us obey all the laws and commands he gave our ancestors. 
1KI.8.59	May the L
1KI.8.60	Then all the people of the world will know the L
1KI.8.61	You must fully obey the L
1KI.8.62	Then King Solomon and all Israel with him offered sacrifices to the L
1KI.8.63	Solomon killed twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep as fellowship offerings. So the king and all the people gave the Temple to the L
1KI.8.64	On that day King Solomon made holy the middle part of the courtyard which is in front of the Temple of the L
1KI.8.65	Solomon and all the Israelites celebrated the other festival that came at that time. People came from as far away as Lebo Hamath and the brook of Egypt. A great many people celebrated before the L
1KI.8.66	On the following day Solomon sent the people home. They blessed the king as they went, happy because of all the good things the L
1KI.9.1	Solomon finished building the Temple of the L
1KI.9.2	Then the L
1KI.9.3	The L
1KI.9.4	“But you must serve me as your father David did; he was fair and sincere. You must obey all I have commanded and keep my laws and rules. 
1KI.9.5	If you do, I will make your kingdom strong. This is the promise I made to your father David—that someone from his family would always rule Israel.
1KI.9.6	“But you and your children must follow me and obey the laws and commands I have given you. You must not serve or worship other gods. 
1KI.9.7	If you do, I will force Israel to leave the land I have given them, and I will leave this Temple that I have made holy. All the nations will make fun of Israel and speak evil about them. 
1KI.9.8	If the Temple is destroyed, everyone who passes by will be shocked. They will make fun of you and ask, ‘Why did the L
1KI.9.9	People will answer, ‘This happened because they left the L
1KI.9.10	By the end of twenty years, King Solomon had built two buildings—the Temple of the L
1KI.9.11	At that time King Solomon gave twenty towns in Galilee to Hiram king of Tyre, because Hiram had helped with the buildings. Hiram had given Solomon all the cedar, pine, and gold he wanted. 
1KI.9.12	So Hiram traveled from Tyre to see the towns Solomon had given him, but when he saw them, he was not pleased. 
1KI.9.13	He asked, “What good are these towns you have given me, my brother?” So he named them the Land of Cabul, and they are still called that today. 
1KI.9.14	Hiram had sent Solomon about nine thousand pounds of gold.
1KI.9.15	This is the account of the forced labor Solomon used to build the Temple and the palace. He had them fill in the land and build the wall around Jerusalem. He also had them rebuild the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 
1KI.9.16	(In the past the king of Egypt had attacked and captured Gezer. After burning it, he killed the Canaanites who lived there. Then he gave it as a wedding present to his daughter, who married Solomon. 
1KI.9.17	So Solomon rebuilt it.) He also built the cities of Lower Beth Horon 
1KI.9.18	and Baalath, as well as Tadmor, which is in the desert. 
1KI.9.19	King Solomon also built cities for storing grain and supplies and cities for his chariots and horses. He built whatever he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and everywhere he ruled.
1KI.9.20	There were other people in the land who were not Israelites—Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
1KI.9.21	They were descendants of people that the Israelites had not destroyed. Solomon forced them to work for him as slaves, as is still true today. 
1KI.9.22	But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites. They were his soldiers, government leaders, officers, captains, chariot commanders, and drivers.
1KI.9.23	These were his most important officers over the work. There were five hundred fifty supervisors over the people who did the work on Solomon’s projects.
1KI.9.24	The daughter of the king of Egypt moved from the old part of Jerusalem to the palace that Solomon had built for her. Then Solomon filled in the surrounding land.
1KI.9.25	Three times each year Solomon offered whole burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the L
1KI.9.26	King Solomon also built ships at Ezion Geber, a town near Elath on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. 
1KI.9.27	Hiram had skilled sailors, so he sent them to serve in these ships with Solomon’s men. 
1KI.9.28	The ships sailed to Ophir and brought back about thirty-two thousand pounds of gold to King Solomon.
1KI.10.1	When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon, she came to test him with hard questions. 
1KI.10.2	She traveled to Jerusalem with a large group of servants and camels carrying spices, jewels, and much gold. When she came to Solomon, she talked with him about all she had in mind, 
1KI.10.3	and Solomon answered all her questions. Nothing was too hard for him to explain to her. 
1KI.10.4	The queen of Sheba learned that Solomon was very wise. She saw the palace he had built, 
1KI.10.5	the food on his table, his many officers, the palace servants, and their good clothes. She saw the servants who served him at feasts and the whole burnt offerings he made in the Temple of the L
1KI.10.6	So she said to King Solomon, “What I heard in my own country about your achievements and wisdom is true. 
1KI.10.7	I could not believe it then, but now I have come and seen it with my own eyes. I was not told even half of it! Your wisdom and wealth are much greater than I had heard. 
1KI.10.8	Your men and officers are very lucky, because in always serving you, they are able to hear your wisdom. 
1KI.10.9	Praise the L
1KI.10.10	Then she gave the king about nine thousand pounds of gold and many spices and jewels. No one since that time has brought more spices than the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
1KI.10.11	(Hiram’s ships brought gold from Ophir, as well as much juniper wood and jewels. 
1KI.10.12	Solomon used the juniper wood to build supports for the Temple of the L
1KI.10.13	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she wanted and asked for, in addition to what he had already given her of his wealth. Then she and her servants returned to her own country.
1KI.10.14	Every year King Solomon received about fifty thousand pounds of gold. 
1KI.10.15	Besides that, he also received gold from the traders and merchants, as well as from the kings of Arabia and governors of the land.
1KI.10.16	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold, each of which contained about seven and one-half pounds of gold. 
1KI.10.17	He also made three hundred smaller shields of hammered gold, each of which contained about four pounds of gold. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
1KI.10.18	The king built a large throne of ivory and covered it with fine gold. 
1KI.10.19	The throne had six steps on it, and its back was round at the top. There were armrests on both sides of the chair, and each armrest had a lion beside it. 
1KI.10.20	Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one lion at each end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any other kingdom. 
1KI.10.21	All of Solomon’s drinking cups, as well as the dishes in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon, were made of pure gold. Nothing was made from silver, because silver was not valuable in Solomon’s time.
1KI.10.22	King Solomon also had many trading ships at sea, along with Hiram’s ships. Every three years the ships returned, bringing back gold, silver, ivory, apes, and baboons.
1KI.10.23	So Solomon had more riches and wisdom than all the other kings on earth. 
1KI.10.24	People everywhere wanted to see King Solomon and listen to the wisdom God had given him. 
1KI.10.25	Every year those who came brought gifts of silver and gold, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
1KI.10.26	Solomon had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses. He kept some in special cities for the chariots, and others he kept with him in Jerusalem. 
1KI.10.27	In Jerusalem Solomon made silver as common as stones and cedar trees as common as the fig trees on the western hills. 
1KI.10.28	He imported horses from Egypt and Kue. His traders bought them in Kue. 
1KI.10.29	A chariot from Egypt cost about fifteen pounds of silver, and a horse cost nearly four pounds of silver. Solomon’s traders also sold horses and chariots to all the kings of the Hittites and the Arameans.
1KI.11.1	King Solomon loved many women who were not from Israel. He loved the daughter of the king of Egypt, as well as women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites. 
1KI.11.2	The L
1KI.11.3	He had seven hundred wives who were from royal families and three hundred slave women who gave birth to his children. His wives caused him to turn away from God. 
1KI.11.4	As Solomon grew old, his wives caused him to follow other gods. He did not follow the L
1KI.11.5	Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the people of Sidon, and Molech, the hated god of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.6	So Solomon did what the L
1KI.11.7	On a hill east of Jerusalem, Solomon built two places for worship. One was a place to worship Chemosh, the hated god of the Moabites, and the other was a place to worship Molech, the hated god of the Ammonites. 
1KI.11.8	Solomon did the same thing for all his foreign wives so they could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their gods.
1KI.11.9	The L
1KI.11.10	because he had commanded Solomon not to follow other gods. But Solomon did not obey the L
1KI.11.11	So the L
1KI.11.12	But I will not take it away while you are alive because of my love for your father David. I will tear it away from your son when he becomes king. 
1KI.11.13	I will not tear away all the kingdom from him, but I will leave him one tribe to rule. I will do this because of David, my servant, and because of Jerusalem, the city I have chosen.”
1KI.11.14	The L
1KI.11.15	Earlier, David had defeated Edom. When Joab, the commander of David’s army, went into Edom to bury the dead, he killed all the males. 
1KI.11.16	Joab and all the Israelites stayed in Edom for six months and killed every male in Edom. 
1KI.11.17	At that time Hadad was only a young boy, so he ran away to Egypt with some of his father’s officers. 
1KI.11.18	They left Midian and went to Paran, where they were joined by other men. Then they all went to Egypt to see the king, who gave Hadad a house, some food, and some land.
1KI.11.19	The king liked Hadad so much he gave Hadad a wife—the sister of Tahpenes, the king’s wife. 
1KI.11.20	They had a son named Genubath. Queen Tahpenes brought him up in the royal palace with the king’s own children.
1KI.11.21	While he was in Egypt, Hadad heard that David had died and that Joab, the commander of the army, was dead also. So Hadad said to the king, “Let me go; I will return to my own country.”
1KI.11.22	“Why do you want to go back to your own country?” the king asked. “What haven’t I given you here?”
1KI.11.22	“Nothing,” Hadad answered, “but please, let me go.”
1KI.11.23	God also caused another man to be Solomon’s enemy—Rezon son of Eliada. Rezon had run away from his master, Hadadezer king of Zobah. 
1KI.11.24	After David defeated the army of Zobah, Rezon gathered some men and became the leader of a small army. They went to Damascus and settled there, and Rezon became king of Damascus. 
1KI.11.25	Rezon ruled Aram, and he hated Israel. So he was an enemy of Israel all the time Solomon was alive. Both Rezon and Hadad made trouble for Israel.
1KI.11.26	Jeroboam son of Nebat was one of Solomon’s officers. He was an Ephraimite from the town of Zeredah, and he was the son of a widow named Zeruah. Jeroboam turned against the king.
1KI.11.27	This is the story of how Jeroboam turned against the king. Solomon was filling in the land and repairing the wall of Jerusalem, the city of David, his father. 
1KI.11.28	Jeroboam was a capable man, and Solomon saw that this young man was a good worker. So Solomon put him over all the workers from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh.
1KI.11.29	One day as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, Ahijah, the prophet from Shiloh, who was wearing a new coat, met him on the road. The two men were alone out in the country. 
1KI.11.30	Ahijah took his new coat and tore it into twelve pieces. 
1KI.11.31	Then he said to Jeroboam, “Take ten pieces of this coat for yourself. The L
1KI.11.32	But I will allow him to control one tribe. I will do this for the sake of my servant David and for Jerusalem, the city I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel. 
1KI.11.33	I will do this because Solomon has stopped following me and has worshiped the Sidonian god Ashtoreth, the Moabite god Chemosh, and the Ammonite god Molech. Solomon has not obeyed me by doing what I said is right and obeying my laws and commands, as his father David did.
1KI.11.34	“ ‘But I will not take all the kingdom away from Solomon. I will let him rule all his life because of my servant David, whom I chose, who obeyed all my commands and laws. 
1KI.11.35	But I will take the kingdom away from his son, and I will allow you to rule over the ten tribes. 
1KI.11.36	I will allow Solomon’s son to continue to rule over one tribe so that there will always be a descendant of David, my servant, in Jerusalem, the city where I chose to be worshiped. 
1KI.11.37	But I will make you rule over everything you want. You will rule over all of Israel, 
1KI.11.38	and I will always be with you if you do what I say is right. You must obey all my commands. If you obey my laws and commands as David did, I will be with you. I will make your family a lasting family of kings, as I did for David, and give Israel to you. 
1KI.11.39	I will punish David’s children because of this, but I will not punish them forever.’ ”
1KI.11.40	Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but he ran away to Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, where he stayed until Solomon died.
1KI.11.41	Everything else King Solomon did, and the wisdom he showed, is written in the book of the history of Solomon. 
1KI.11.42	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. 
1KI.11.43	Then he died and was buried in Jerusalem, the city of David, his father. And his son Rehoboam became king in his place.
1KI.12.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all the Israelites had gone to make him king. 
1KI.12.2	Jeroboam son of Nebat was still in Egypt, where he had gone to escape from Solomon. When Jeroboam heard about Rehoboam being made king, he was living in Egypt. 
1KI.12.3	After the people sent for him, he and the people went to Rehoboam and said to him, 
1KI.12.4	“Your father forced us to work very hard. Now, make it easier for us, and don’t make us work as hard as he did. Then we will serve you.”
1KI.12.5	Rehoboam answered, “Go away for three days, and then come back to me.” So the people left.
1KI.12.6	King Rehoboam asked the elders who had advised Solomon during his lifetime, “How do you think I should answer these people?”
1KI.12.7	They said, “You should be like a servant to them today. If you serve them and give them a kind answer, they will serve you always.”
1KI.12.8	But Rehoboam rejected this advice. Instead, he asked the young men who had grown up with him and who served as his advisers. 
1KI.12.9	Rehoboam asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who said, ‘Don’t make us work as hard as your father did’?”
1KI.12.10	The young men who had grown up with him answered, “Those people said to you, ‘Your father forced us to work very hard. Now make our work easier.’ You should tell them, ‘My little finger is bigger than my father’s legs. 
1KI.12.11	He forced you to work hard, but I will make you work even harder. My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with whips that have sharp points.’ ”
1KI.12.12	Rehoboam had told the people, “Come back to me in three days.” So after three days Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam. 
1KI.12.13	King Rehoboam spoke cruel words to them, because he had rejected the advice the elders had given him. 
1KI.12.14	He followed the advice of the young men and said to the people, “My father forced you to work hard, but I will make you work even harder. My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with whips that have sharp points.” 
1KI.12.15	So the king did not listen to the people. The L
1KI.12.16	When all the Israelites saw that the new king refused to listen to them, they said to the king,
1KI.12.16	“We have no share in David!
1KI.12.16	We have no part in the son of Jesse!
1KI.12.16	People of Israel, let’s go to our own homes!
1KI.12.16	Let David’s son rule his own people!”
1KI.12.16	So the Israelites went home. 
1KI.12.17	But Rehoboam still ruled over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah.
1KI.12.18	Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. When Rehoboam sent him to the people of Israel, they threw stones at him until he died. But King Rehoboam ran to his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem. 
1KI.12.19	Since then, Israel has been against the family of David.
1KI.12.20	When all the Israelites heard that Jeroboam had returned, they called him to a meeting and made him king over all Israel. Only the tribe of Judah continued to follow the family of David.
1KI.12.21	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered one hundred eighty thousand of the best soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. As son of Solomon, Rehoboam wanted to fight the people of Israel to take back his kingdom.
1KI.12.22	But God spoke his word to Shemaiah, a man of God, saying, 
1KI.12.23	“Speak to Solomon’s son Rehoboam, the king of Judah, and to all the people of Judah and Benjamin and the rest of the people. Say to them, 
1KI.12.24	‘The L
1KI.12.25	Then Jeroboam made Shechem in the mountains of Ephraim a very strong city, and he lived there. He also went to the city of Peniel and made it stronger.
1KI.12.26	Jeroboam said to himself, “The kingdom will probably go back to David’s family. 
1KI.12.27	If the people continue going to the Temple of the L
1KI.12.28	King Jeroboam asked for advice. Then he made two golden calves. “It is too long a journey for you to go to Jerusalem to worship,” he said to the people. “Israel, here are your gods who brought you out of Egypt.” 
1KI.12.29	Jeroboam put one golden calf in the city of Bethel and the other in the city of Dan. 
1KI.12.30	This became a very great sin, because the people traveled as far as Dan to worship the calf there.
1KI.12.31	Jeroboam built temples on the places of worship. He also chose priests from all the people, not just from the tribe of Levi. 
1KI.12.32	And he started a new festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, just like the festival in Judah. During that time the king offered sacrifices on the altar, along with sacrifices to the calves in Bethel he had made. He also chose priests in Bethel to serve at the places of worship he had made. 
1KI.12.33	So Jeroboam chose his own time for a festival for the Israelites—the fifteenth day of the eighth month. During that time he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built in Bethel. He set up a festival for the Israelites and offered sacrifices on the altar.
1KI.13.1	The L
1KI.13.2	The L
1KI.13.3	That same day the man of God gave proof that these things would happen. “This is the L
1KI.13.4	When King Jeroboam heard what the man of God said about the altar in Bethel, the king raised his hand from the altar and pointed at the man. “Take him!” he said. But when the king said this, his arm was paralyzed, and he could not move it. 
1KI.13.5	The altar also broke into pieces, and its ashes fell to the ground. This was the sign the L
1KI.13.6	Then the king said to the man of God, “Please pray to the L
1KI.13.6	So the man of God prayed to the L
1KI.13.7	Then the king said to the man of God, “Please come home and eat with me, and I will give you a gift.”
1KI.13.8	But the man of God answered the king, “Even if you gave me half of your kingdom, I would not go with you. I will not eat or drink anything in this place. 
1KI.13.9	The L
1KI.13.10	So he took a different road and did not return on the same road by which he had come to Bethel.
1KI.13.11	Now an old prophet was living in Bethel. His sons came and told him what the man of God had done there that day. They also told their father what he had said to King Jeroboam. 
1KI.13.12	The father asked, “Which road did he use when he left?” So his sons showed him the road the man of God from Judah had taken. 
1KI.13.13	Then the prophet told his sons to put a saddle on his donkey. So they saddled the donkey, and he left.
1KI.13.14	He went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree. The prophet asked, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?”
1KI.13.14	The man answered, “Yes, I am.”
1KI.13.15	The prophet said, “Please come home and eat with me.”
1KI.13.16	“I can’t go home with you,” the man of God answered. “I can’t eat or drink with you in this place. 
1KI.13.17	The L
1KI.13.18	Then the old prophet said, “But I also am a prophet like you.” Then he told a lie. He said, “An angel from the L
1KI.13.19	So the man of God went to the old prophet’s house, and he ate and drank with him there.
1KI.13.20	While they were sitting at the table, the L
1KI.13.21	The old prophet cried out to the man of God from Judah, “The L
1KI.13.22	The L
1KI.13.23	After the man of God finished eating and drinking, the prophet put a saddle on his donkey for him, and the man left. 
1KI.13.24	As he was traveling home, a lion attacked and killed him. His body lay on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing nearby. 
1KI.13.25	Some men who were traveling on that road saw the body and the lion standing nearby. So they went to the city where the old prophet lived and told what they had seen.
1KI.13.26	The old prophet who had brought back the man of God heard what had happened. “It is the man of God who did not obey the L
1KI.13.27	Then the prophet said to his sons, “Put a saddle on my donkey,” which they did. 
1KI.13.28	The old prophet went out and found the body lying on the road, with the donkey and the lion still standing nearby. The lion had not eaten the body or hurt the donkey. 
1KI.13.29	The prophet put the body on his donkey and carried it back to the city to have a time of sadness for him and to bury him. 
1KI.13.30	The prophet buried the body in his own family grave, and they were sad for the man of God and said, “Oh, my brother.”
1KI.13.31	After the prophet buried the body, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in this same grave. Put my bones next to his. 
1KI.13.32	Through him the L
1KI.13.33	After this incident King Jeroboam did not stop doing evil. He continued to choose priests for the places of worship from among all the people. Anyone who wanted to be a priest for the places of worship was allowed to be one. 
1KI.13.34	In this way the family of Jeroboam sinned, and this sin caused its ruin and destruction from the earth.
1KI.14.1	At that time Jeroboam’s son Abijah became very sick. 
1KI.14.2	So Jeroboam said to his wife, “Go to Shiloh to see the prophet Ahijah. He is the one who said I would become king of Israel. But dress yourself so people won’t know you are my wife. 
1KI.14.3	Take the prophet ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey. Then ask him what will happen to our son, and he will tell you.” 
1KI.14.4	So the king’s wife did as he said and went to Ahijah’s home in Shiloh.
1KI.14.4	Now Ahijah was very old and blind. 
1KI.14.5	The L
1KI.14.6	When Ahijah heard her walking to the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why are you pretending to be someone else? I have bad news for you. 
1KI.14.7	Go back and tell Jeroboam that this is what the L
1KI.14.8	I tore the kingdom away from David’s family, and I gave it to you. But you are not like my servant David, who always obeyed my commands and followed me with all his heart. He did only what I said was right. 
1KI.14.9	But you have done more evil than anyone who ruled before you. You have quit following me and have made other gods and idols of metal. This has made me very angry, 
1KI.14.10	so I will soon bring disaster to your family. I will kill all the men in your family, both slaves and free men. I will destroy your family as completely as fire burns up manure. 
1KI.14.11	Anyone from your family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the fields will be eaten by the birds. The L
1KI.14.12	Then Ahijah said to Jeroboam’s wife, “Go home now. As soon as you enter your city, your son will die, 
1KI.14.13	and all Israel will be sad for him and bury him. He is the only one of Jeroboam’s family who will be buried, because he is the only one in the king’s family who pleased the L
1KI.14.14	“The L
1KI.14.15	Then the L
1KI.14.16	Jeroboam sinned, and then he made the people of Israel sin. So the L
1KI.14.17	Then Jeroboam’s wife left and returned to Tirzah. As soon as she entered her home, the boy died. 
1KI.14.18	After they buried him, all Israel had a time of sadness for him, just as the L
1KI.14.19	Everything else Jeroboam did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. He fought wars and continued to rule the people, 
1KI.14.20	serving as king for twenty-two years. Then he died, and his son Nadab became king in his place.
1KI.14.21	Solomon’s son Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he became king of Judah. His mother was Naamah from Ammon. Rehoboam ruled in Jerusalem for seventeen years. (The L
1KI.14.22	The people of Judah did what the L
1KI.14.23	The people built stone pillars and places to worship gods and Asherah idols on every high hill and under every green tree. 
1KI.14.24	There were even male prostitutes in the land. They acted like the people who had lived in the land before the Israelites. They had done many evil things, and God had taken the land away from them.
1KI.14.25	During the fifth year Rehoboam was king, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. 
1KI.14.26	He took the treasures from the Temple of the L
1KI.14.27	So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to put in their place and gave them to the commanders of the guards for the palace gates. 
1KI.14.28	Whenever the king went to the Temple of the L
1KI.14.29	Everything else King Rehoboam did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
1KI.14.30	There was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam the whole time. 
1KI.14.31	Rehoboam, son of Naamah from Ammon, died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Abijam became king in his place.
1KI.15.1	Abijam became king of Judah during the eighteenth year Jeroboam son of Nebat was king of Israel. 
1KI.15.2	Abijam ruled in Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Maacah daughter of Abishalom. 
1KI.15.3	He did all the same sins his father before him had done. Abijam was not faithful to the L
1KI.15.4	Because the L
1KI.15.5	David always did what the L
1KI.15.6	There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam during Abijam’s lifetime. 
1KI.15.7	Everything else Abijam did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. During the time Abijam ruled, there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
1KI.15.8	Abijam died and was buried in Jerusalem, and his son Asa became king in his place.
1KI.15.9	During the twentieth year Jeroboam was king of Israel, Asa became king of Judah. 
1KI.15.10	His grandmother’s name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom. Asa ruled in Jerusalem for forty-one years.
1KI.15.11	Asa did what the L
1KI.15.12	He forced the male prostitutes at the worship places to leave the country. He also took away the idols that his ancestors had made. 
1KI.15.13	His grandmother Maacah had made a terrible Asherah idol, so Asa removed her from being queen mother. He cut down that idol and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
1KI.15.14	The places of worship to gods were not removed. Even so, Asa was faithful to the L
1KI.15.15	Asa brought into the Temple of the L
1KI.15.16	There was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all the time they were kings. 
1KI.15.17	Baasha attacked Judah, and he made the town of Ramah strong so he could keep people from leaving or entering Judah, Asa’s country.
1KI.15.18	Asa took the rest of the silver and gold from the treasuries of the Temple of the L
1KI.15.19	“Let there be a treaty between you and me as there was between my father and your father. I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will leave my land.”
1KI.15.20	Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa, so he sent the commanders of his armies to attack the towns of Israel. They defeated the towns of Ijon, Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, as well as all Galilee and the area of Naphtali. 
1KI.15.21	When Baasha heard about these attacks, he stopped building up Ramah and returned to Tirzah. 
1KI.15.22	Then King Asa gave an order to all the people of Judah; everyone had to help. They carried away all the stones and wood Baasha had been using in Ramah, and they used them to build up Geba and Mizpah in the land of Benjamin.
1KI.15.23	Everything else Asa did—his victories and the cities he built—is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. When he became old, he got a disease in his feet. 
1KI.15.24	After Asa died, he was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, the city of David, his ancestor. Then Jehoshaphat, Asa’s son, became king in his place.
1KI.15.25	Nadab son of Jeroboam became king of Israel during the second year Asa was king of Judah. Nadab was king of Israel for two years, 
1KI.15.26	and he did what the L
1KI.15.27	Baasha son of Ahijah, from the tribe of Issachar, made plans to kill Nadab. Nadab and all Israel were attacking the Philistine town of Gibbethon, so Baasha killed Nadab there. 
1KI.15.28	This happened during Asa’s third year as king of Judah, and Baasha became the next king of Israel.
1KI.15.29	As soon as Baasha became king, he killed all of Jeroboam’s family, leaving no one in Jeroboam’s family alive. He destroyed them all as the L
1KI.15.30	King Jeroboam had sinned very much and had led the people of Israel to sin, so he made the L
1KI.15.31	Everything else Nadab did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
1KI.15.32	There was war between Asa king of Judah and Baasha king of Israel all the time they ruled.
1KI.15.33	Baasha son of Ahijah became king of Israel during Asa’s third year as king of Judah. Baasha ruled in Tirzah for twenty-four years, 
1KI.15.34	and he did what the L
1KI.16.1	Jehu son of Hanani spoke the word of the L
1KI.16.2	The L
1KI.16.3	so, Baasha, I will soon destroy you and your family. I will do to you what I did to the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat. 
1KI.16.4	Anyone from your family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone from your family who dies in the fields will be eaten by birds.”
1KI.16.5	Everything else Baasha did and all his victories are written down in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
1KI.16.6	So Baasha died and was buried in Tirzah, and his son Elah became king in his place.
1KI.16.7	The L
1KI.16.8	Elah son of Baasha became king of Israel during Asa’s twenty-sixth year as king of Judah, and Elah ruled in Tirzah for two years.
1KI.16.9	Zimri, one of Elah’s officers, commanded half of Elah’s chariots. Zimri made plans against Elah while the king was in Tirzah, getting drunk at Arza’s home. (Arza was in charge of the palace at Tirzah.) 
1KI.16.10	Zimri went into Arza’s house and killed Elah during Asa’s twenty-seventh year as king of Judah. Then Zimri became king of Israel in Elah’s place.
1KI.16.11	As soon as Zimri became king, he killed all of Baasha’s family, not allowing any of Baasha’s family or friends to live. 
1KI.16.12	So Zimri destroyed all of Baasha’s family just as the L
1KI.16.13	Baasha and his son Elah sinned and led the people of Israel to sin, and they made the L
1KI.16.14	Everything else Elah did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
1KI.16.15	So during Asa’s twenty-seventh year as king of Judah, Zimri became king of Israel and ruled in Tirzah seven days.
1KI.16.15	The army of Israel was camped near Gibbethon, a Philistine town. 
1KI.16.16	The men in the camp heard that Zimri had made secret plans against King Elah and had killed him. So that day in the camp they made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel. 
1KI.16.17	So Omri and all the Israelite army left Gibbethon and attacked Tirzah. 
1KI.16.18	When Zimri saw that the city had been captured, he went into the palace and set it on fire, burning the palace and himself with it. 
1KI.16.19	So Zimri died because he had sinned by doing what the L
1KI.16.20	Everything else Zimri did and the story of how he turned against King Elah are written down in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
1KI.16.21	The people of Israel were divided into two groups. Half of the people wanted Tibni son of Ginath to be king, while the other half wanted Omri. 
1KI.16.22	Omri’s followers were stronger than the followers of Tibni son of Ginath, so Tibni died, and Omri became king.
1KI.16.23	Omri became king of Israel during the thirty-first year Asa was king of Judah. Omri ruled Israel for twelve years, six of those years in the city of Tirzah. 
1KI.16.24	He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for about one hundred fifty pounds of silver. Omri built a city on that hill and called it Samaria after the name of its earlier owner, Shemer.
1KI.16.25	But Omri did what the L
1KI.16.26	Jeroboam son of Nebat had led the people of Israel to sin, and Omri sinned in the same way as Jeroboam. The Israelites made the L
1KI.16.27	Everything else Omri did and all his successes are written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
1KI.16.28	So Omri died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Ahab became king in his place.
1KI.16.29	Ahab son of Omri became king of Israel during Asa’s thirty-eighth year as king of Judah, and Ahab ruled Israel in the city of Samaria for twenty-two years. 
1KI.16.30	More than any king before him, Ahab son of Omri did many things the L
1KI.16.31	He sinned in the same ways as Jeroboam son of Nebat, but he did even worse things. He married Jezebel daughter of Ethbaal, the king of Sidon. Then Ahab began to serve Baal and worship him. 
1KI.16.32	He built a temple in Samaria for worshiping Baal and put an altar there for Baal. 
1KI.16.33	Ahab also made an idol for worshiping Asherah. He did more things to make the L
1KI.16.34	During the time of Ahab, Hiel from Bethel rebuilt the city of Jericho. It cost Hiel the life of Abiram, his oldest son, to begin work on the city, and it cost the life of Segub, his youngest son, to build the city gates. This happened just as the L

1KI.17.5	So Elijah did what the L
1KI.17.6	The birds brought Elijah bread and meat every morning and evening, and he drank water from the stream.
1KI.17.7	After a while the stream dried up because there was no rain.

1KI.17.10	So Elijah went to Zarephath. When he reached the town gate, he saw a widow gathering wood for a fire. Elijah asked her, “Would you bring me a little water in a cup so I may have a drink?” 
1KI.17.11	As she was going to get his water, Elijah said, “Please bring me a piece of bread, too.”
1KI.17.12	The woman answered, “As surely as the L
1KI.17.13	“Don’t worry,” Elijah said to her. “Go home and cook your food as you have said. But first make a small loaf of bread from the flour you have, and bring it to me. Then cook something for yourself and your son. 
1KI.17.14	The L
1KI.17.15	So the woman went home and did what Elijah told her to do. And the woman and her son and Elijah had enough food every day. 
1KI.17.16	The jar of flour and the jug of oil were never empty, just as the L
1KI.17.17	Some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became sick. He grew worse and worse and finally stopped breathing. 
1KI.17.18	The woman said to Elijah, “Man of God, what have you done to me? Did you come here to remind me of my sin and to kill my son?”
1KI.17.19	Elijah said to her, “Give me your son.” Elijah took the boy from her, carried him upstairs, and laid him on the bed in the room where he was staying. 
1KI.17.20	Then he prayed to the L
1KI.17.21	Then Elijah lay on top of the boy three times. He prayed to the L

1KI.17.23	Elijah carried the boy downstairs and gave him to his mother and said, “See! Your son is alive!”

1KI.18.5	Ahab said to Obadiah, “Let’s check every spring and valley in the land. Maybe we can find enough grass to keep our horses and mules alive and not have to kill our animals.” 
1KI.18.6	So each one chose a part of the country to search; Ahab went in one direction and Obadiah in another.
1KI.18.7	While Obadiah was on his way, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized Elijah, so he bowed down to the ground and said, “Elijah? Is it really you, master?”
1KI.18.8	“Yes,” Elijah answered. “Go tell your master that I am here.”
1KI.18.9	Then Obadiah said, “What wrong have I done for you to hand me over to Ahab like this? He will put me to death.

1KI.18.16	So Obadiah went to Ahab and told him where Elijah was. Then Ahab went to meet Elijah.
1KI.18.17	When he saw Elijah, he asked, “Is it you—the biggest troublemaker in Israel?”
1KI.18.18	Elijah answered, “I have not made trouble in Israel. You and your father’s family have made all this trouble by not obeying the L
1KI.18.19	Now tell all Israel to meet me at Mount Carmel. Also bring the four hundred fifty prophets of Baal and the four hundred prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table.”
1KI.18.20	So Ahab called all the Israelites and those prophets to Mount Carmel. 
1KI.18.21	Elijah approached the people and said, “How long will you not decide between two choices? If the L
1KI.18.22	Elijah said, “I am the only prophet of the L
1KI.18.23	Bring two bulls. Let the prophets of Baal choose one bull and kill it and cut it into pieces. Then let them put the meat on the wood, but they are not to set fire to it. I will prepare the other bull, putting the meat on the wood but not setting fire to it. 
1KI.18.24	You prophets of Baal, pray to your god, and I will pray to the L
1KI.18.24	All the people agreed that this was a good idea.
1KI.18.25	Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, “There are many of you, so you go first. Choose a bull and prepare it. Pray to your god, but don’t start the fire.”
1KI.18.26	So they took the bull that was given to them and prepared it. They prayed to Baal from morning until noon, shouting “Baal, answer us!” But there was no sound, and no one answered. They danced around the altar they had built.
1KI.18.27	At noon Elijah began to make fun of them. “Pray louder!” he said. “If Baal really is a god, maybe he is thinking, or busy, or traveling! Maybe he is sleeping so you will have to wake him!” 
1KI.18.28	The prophets prayed louder, cutting themselves with swords and spears until their blood flowed, which was the way they worshiped. 
1KI.18.29	The afternoon passed, and the prophets continued to act like this until it was time for the evening sacrifice. But no voice was heard; Baal did not answer, and no one paid attention.
1KI.18.30	Then Elijah said to all the people, “Now come to me.” So they gathered around him, and Elijah rebuilt the altar of the L
1KI.18.31	He took twelve stones, one stone for each of the twelve tribes, the number of Jacob’s sons. (The L
1KI.18.32	Elijah used these stones to rebuild the altar in honor of the L
1KI.18.33	Elijah put the wood on the altar, cut the bull into pieces, and laid the pieces on the wood. 
1KI.18.34	Then he said, “Fill four jars with water, and pour it on the meat and on the wood.” Then Elijah said, “Do it again,” and they did it again. Then he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it the third time. 
1KI.18.35	So the water ran off the altar and filled the ditch.
1KI.18.36	At the time for the evening sacrifice, the prophet Elijah went near the altar. “L

1KI.18.38	Then fire from the L
1KI.18.39	When all the people saw this, they fell down to the ground, crying, “The L
1KI.18.40	Then Elijah said, “Capture the prophets of Baal! Don’t let any of them run away!” The people captured all the prophets. Then Elijah led them down to the Kishon Valley, where he killed them.
1KI.18.41	Then Elijah said to Ahab, “Now, go, eat, and drink, because a heavy rain is coming.” 
1KI.18.42	So King Ahab went to eat and drink. At the same time Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel, where he bent down to the ground with his head between his knees.
1KI.18.43	Then Elijah said to his servant, “Go and look toward the sea.”
1KI.18.43	The servant went and looked. “I see nothing,” he said.
1KI.18.43	Elijah told him to go and look again. This happened seven times. 
1KI.18.44	The seventh time, the servant said, “I see a small cloud, the size of a human fist, coming from the sea.”
1KI.18.44	Elijah told the servant, “Go to Ahab and tell him to get his chariot ready and go home now. Otherwise, the rain will stop him.”
1KI.18.45	After a short time the sky was covered with dark clouds. The wind began to blow, and soon a heavy rain began to fall. Ahab got in his chariot and started back to Jezreel. 
1KI.18.46	The L
1KI.19.1	King Ahab told Jezebel every thing Elijah had done and how Elijah had killed all the prophets with a sword. 
1KI.19.2	So Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, “May the gods punish me terribly if by this time tomorrow I don’t kill you just as you killed those prophets.”
1KI.19.3	When Elijah heard this, he was afraid and ran for his life, taking his servant with him. When they came to Beersheba in Judah, Elijah left his servant there. 
1KI.19.4	Then Elijah walked for a whole day into the desert. He sat down under a bush and asked to die. “I have had enough, L
1KI.19.5	Then he lay down under the tree and slept.
1KI.19.5	Suddenly an angel came to him and touched him. “Get up and eat,” the angel said. 
1KI.19.6	Elijah saw near his head a loaf baked over coals and a jar of water, so he ate and drank. Then he went back to sleep.
1KI.19.7	Later the L
1KI.19.8	So Elijah got up and ate and drank. The food made him strong enough to walk for forty days and nights to Mount Sinai, the mountain of God. 
1KI.19.9	There Elijah went into a cave and stayed all night.
1KI.19.9	Then the L
1KI.19.10	He answered, “L
1KI.19.11	The L
1KI.19.12	After the earthquake, there was a fire, but the L
1KI.19.13	When Elijah heard it, he covered his face with his coat and went out and stood at the entrance to the cave.
1KI.19.13	Then a voice said to him, “Elijah! Why are you here?”
1KI.19.14	He answered, “L

1KI.19.16	Then pour oil on Jehu son of Nimshi to make him king over Israel. Next, pour oil on Elisha son of Shaphat from Abel Meholah to make him a prophet in your place. 
1KI.19.17	Jehu will kill anyone who escapes from Hazael’s sword, and Elisha will kill anyone who escapes from Jehu’s sword. 
1KI.19.18	I have seven thousand people left in Israel who have never bowed down before Baal and whose mouths have never kissed his idol.”
1KI.19.19	So Elijah left that place and found Elisha son of Shaphat plowing a field with a team of oxen. He owned twelve teams of oxen and was plowing with the twelfth team. Elijah came up to Elisha, took off his coat, and put it on Elisha. 
1KI.19.20	Then Elisha left his oxen and ran to follow Elijah. “Let me kiss my father and my mother good-bye,” Elisha said. “Then I will go with you.”
1KI.19.20	Elijah answered, “Go back. It does not matter to me.”
1KI.19.21	So Elisha went back and took his pair of oxen and killed them. He used their wooden yoke for a fire. Then he cooked the meat and gave it to the people. After they ate it, Elisha left and followed Elijah and became his helper.
1KI.20.1	Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered together all his army. There were thirty-two kings with their horses and chariots who went with him and surrounded Samaria and attacked it. 
1KI.20.2	The king sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel.
1KI.20.2	This was his message: “Ben-Hadad says, 
1KI.20.3	‘Your silver and gold belong to me, as well as the best of your wives and children.’ ”
1KI.20.4	Ahab king of Israel answered, “My master and king, I agree to what you say. I and everything I have belong to you.”
1KI.20.5	Then the messengers came to Ahab again. They said, “Ben-Hadad says, ‘I told you before that you must give me your silver and gold, your wives and your children. 
1KI.20.6	About this time tomorrow I will send my men, who will search everywhere in your palace and in the homes of your officers. Whatever they want they will take and carry off.’ ”
1KI.20.7	Then Ahab called a meeting of all the elders of his country. He said, “Ben-Hadad is looking for trouble. First he said I had to give him my wives, my children, my silver, and my gold, and I have not refused him.”
1KI.20.8	The elders and all the people said, “Don’t listen to him or agree to this.”
1KI.20.9	So Ahab said to Ben-Hadad’s messengers, “Tell my master the king: ‘I will do what you said at first, but I cannot allow this second command.’ ” And King Ben-Hadad’s men carried the message back to him.
1KI.20.10	Then Ben-Hadad sent another message to Ahab: “May the gods punish me terribly if I don’t completely destroy Samaria. There won’t be enough left for each of my men to get a handful of dust!”
1KI.20.11	Ahab answered, “Tell Ben-Hadad, ‘The man who puts on his armor should not brag. It’s the man who lives to take it off who has the right to brag.’ ”
1KI.20.12	Ben-Hadad was drinking in his tent with the other rulers when the message came from Ahab. Ben-Hadad commanded his men to prepare to attack the city, and they moved into place for battle.
1KI.20.13	At the same time a prophet came to Ahab king of Israel. The prophet said, “Ahab, the L
1KI.20.14	Ahab asked, “Who will you use to defeat them?”
1KI.20.14	The prophet answered, “The L
1KI.20.14	Then the king asked, “Who will command the main army?”
1KI.20.14	The prophet answered, “You will.”
1KI.20.15	So Ahab gathered the young officers of the district governors, two hundred thirty-two of them. Then he called together the army of Israel, about seven thousand people in all.
1KI.20.16	They marched out at noon, while Ben-Hadad and the thirty-two rulers helping him were getting drunk in their tents. 
1KI.20.17	The young officers of the district governors attacked first. Ben-Hadad sent out scouts who told him that soldiers were coming from Samaria. 
1KI.20.18	Ben-Hadad said, “They may be coming to fight, or they may be coming to ask for peace. In either case capture them alive.”
1KI.20.19	The young officers of the district governors led the attack, followed by the army of Israel. 
1KI.20.20	Each officer of Israel killed the man who came against him. The men from Aram ran away as Israel chased them, but Ben-Hadad king of Aram escaped on a horse with some of his horsemen. 
1KI.20.21	Ahab king of Israel led the army and destroyed the Arameans’ horses and chariots. King Ahab thoroughly defeated the Aramean army.
1KI.20.22	Then the prophet went to Ahab king of Israel and said, “The king of Aram will attack you again next spring. So go home now and strengthen your army and see what you need to do.”
1KI.20.23	Meanwhile the officers of Ben-Hadad king of Aram said to him, “The gods of Israel are mountain gods. Since we fought in a mountain area, Israel won. Let’s fight them on the flat land, and then we will win. 
1KI.20.24	This is what you should do. Don’t allow the thirty-two rulers to command the armies, but put other commanders in their places. 
1KI.20.25	Gather an army like the one that was destroyed and as many horses and chariots as before. We will fight the Israelites on flat land, and then we will win.” Ben-Hadad agreed with their advice and did what they said.
1KI.20.26	The next spring Ben-Hadad gathered the army of Aram and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel.
1KI.20.27	The Israelites also had prepared for war. They marched out to meet the Arameans and camped opposite them. The Israelites looked like two small flocks of goats, but the Arameans covered the area.
1KI.20.28	A man of God came to the king of Israel with this message: “The L
1KI.20.29	The armies were camped across from each other for seven days. On the seventh day the battle began. The Israelites killed one hundred thousand Aramean soldiers in one day. 
1KI.20.30	The rest of them ran away to the city of Aphek, where a city wall fell on twenty-seven thousand of them. Ben-Hadad also ran away to the city and hid in a room.
1KI.20.31	His officers said to him, “We have heard that the kings of Israel are trustworthy. Let’s dress in rough cloth to show our sadness, and wear ropes on our heads. Then we will go to the king of Israel, and perhaps he will let you live.”
1KI.20.32	So they dressed in rough cloth and wore ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel. They said, “Your servant Ben-Hadad says, ‘Please let me live.’ ”
1KI.20.32	Ahab answered, “Is he still alive? He is my brother.”
1KI.20.33	Ben-Hadad’s men had wanted a sign from Ahab. So when Ahab called Ben-Hadad his brother, they quickly said, “Yes! Ben-Hadad is your brother.”
1KI.20.33	Ahab said, “Bring him to me.” When Ben-Hadad came, Ahab asked him to join him in the chariot.
1KI.20.34	Ben-Hadad said to him, “Ahab, I will give you back the cities my father took from your father. And you may put shops in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria.”
1KI.20.34	Ahab said, “If you agree to this, I will allow you to go free.” So the two kings made a peace agreement. Then Ahab let Ben-Hadad go free.
1KI.20.35	One prophet from one of the groups of prophets told another, “Hit me!” He said this because the L
1KI.20.36	The prophet said, “You did not obey the 
1KI.20.37	The prophet went to another man and said, “Hit me, please!” So the man hit him and hurt him. 
1KI.20.38	The prophet wrapped his face in a cloth so no one could tell who he was. Then he went and waited by the road for the king. 
1KI.20.39	As Ahab king of Israel passed by, the prophet called out to him. “I went to fight in the battle,” the prophet said. “One of our men brought an enemy soldier to me. Our man said, ‘Guard this man. If he runs away, you will have to give your life in his place. Or, you will have to pay a fine of seventy-five pounds of silver.’ 
1KI.20.40	But I was busy doing other things, so the man ran away.”
1KI.20.40	The king of Israel answered, “You have already said what the punishment is. You must do what the man said.”
1KI.20.41	Then the prophet quickly took the cloth from his face. When the king of Israel saw him, he knew he was one of the prophets. 
1KI.20.42	The prophet said to the king, “This is what the L
1KI.20.43	Then King Ahab went back to his palace in Samaria, angry and upset.
1KI.21.1	After these things had happened, this is what followed. A man named Naboth owned a vineyard in Jezreel, near the palace of Ahab king of Israel. 
1KI.21.2	One day Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard. It is near my palace, and I want to make it into a vegetable garden. I will give you a better vineyard in its place, or, if you prefer, I will pay you what it is worth.”
1KI.21.3	Naboth answered, “May the L
1KI.21.4	Ahab went home angry and upset, because he did not like what Naboth from Jezreel had said. (Naboth had said, “I will not give you my family’s land.”) Ahab lay down on his bed, turned his face to the wall, and refused to eat.
1KI.21.5	His wife, Jezebel, came in and asked him, “Why are you so upset that you refuse to eat?”
1KI.21.6	Ahab answered, “I talked to Naboth, the man from Jezreel. I said, ‘Sell me your vineyard, or, if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard for it.’ But Naboth refused.”
1KI.21.7	Jezebel answered, “Is this how you rule as king over Israel? Get up, eat something, and cheer up. I will get Naboth’s vineyard for you.”
1KI.21.8	So Jezebel wrote some letters, signed Ahab’s name to them, and used his own seal to seal them. Then she sent them to the elders and important men who lived in Naboth’s town. 
1KI.21.9	The letter she wrote said: “Declare a day during which the people are to fast. Call the people together, and give Naboth a place of honor among them. 
1KI.21.10	Seat two troublemakers across from him, and have them say they heard Naboth speak against God and the king. Then take Naboth out of the city and kill him with stones.”
1KI.21.11	The elders and important men of Jezreel obeyed Jezebel’s command, just as she wrote in the letters. 
1KI.21.12	They declared a special day on which the people were to fast. And they put Naboth in a place of honor before the people. 
1KI.21.13	Two troublemakers sat across from Naboth and said in front of everybody that they had heard him speak against God and the king. So the people carried Naboth out of the city and killed him with stones. 
1KI.21.14	Then the leaders sent a message to Jezebel, saying, “Naboth has been killed.”
1KI.21.15	When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been killed, she told Ahab, “Naboth of Jezreel is dead. Now you may go and take for yourself the vineyard he would not sell to you.” 
1KI.21.16	When Ahab heard that Naboth of Jezreel was dead, he got up and went to the vineyard to take it for his own.
1KI.21.17	At this time the L
1KI.21.18	“Go to Ahab king of Israel in Samaria. He is at Naboth’s vineyard, where he has gone to take it as his own. 
1KI.21.19	Tell Ahab that I, the L
1KI.21.20	When Ahab saw Elijah, he said, “So you have found me, my enemy!”
1KI.21.20	Elijah answered, “Yes, I have found you. You have always chosen to do what the L
1KI.21.21	So the L
1KI.21.22	Your family will be like the family of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of King Baasha son of Ahijah. I will destroy you, because you have made me angry and have led the people of Israel to sin.’
1KI.21.23	“And the L
1KI.21.24	“Anyone in your family who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone who dies in the fields will be eaten by birds.”
1KI.21.25	There was no one like Ahab who had chosen so often to do what the L
1KI.21.26	Ahab sinned terribly by worshiping idols, just as the Amorite people did. And the L
1KI.21.27	After Elijah finished speaking, Ahab tore his clothes. He put on rough cloth, fasted, and even slept in the rough cloth to show how sad and upset he was.
1KI.21.28	The L
1KI.21.29	“I see that Ahab is now sorry for what he has done. So I will not cause the trouble to come to him during his life, but I will wait until his son is king. Then I will bring this trouble to Ahab’s family.”
1KI.22.1	For three years there was peace between Israel and Aram. 
1KI.22.2	During the third year Jehoshaphat king of Judah went to visit Ahab king of Israel.
1KI.22.3	At that time Ahab asked his officers, “Do you remember that the king of Aram took Ramoth in Gilead from us? Why have we done nothing to get it back?” 
1KI.22.4	So Ahab asked King Jehoshaphat, “Will you go with me to fight at Ramoth in Gilead?”
1KI.22.4	“I will go with you,” Jehoshaphat answered. “My soldiers are yours, and my horses are yours.” 
1KI.22.5	Jehoshaphat also said to Ahab, “But first we should ask if this is the L
1KI.22.6	Ahab called about four hundred prophets together and asked them, “Should I go to war against Ramoth in Gilead or not?”
1KI.22.6	They answered, “Go, because the Lord will hand them over to you.”
1KI.22.7	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the L
1KI.22.8	Then King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “There is one other prophet. We could ask the L
1KI.22.8	Jehoshaphat said, “King Ahab, you shouldn’t say that!”
1KI.22.9	So Ahab king of Israel told one of his officers to bring Micaiah to him at once.
1KI.22.10	Ahab king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah had on their royal robes and were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor, near the entrance to the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were standing before them, speaking their messages. 
1KI.22.11	Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made some iron horns. He said to Ahab, “This is what the L
1KI.22.12	All the other prophets said the same thing. “Attack Ramoth in Gilead and win, because the L
1KI.22.13	The messenger who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, “All the other prophets are saying King Ahab will succeed. You should agree with them and give the king a good answer.”
1KI.22.14	But Micaiah answered, “As surely as the L
1KI.22.15	When Micaiah came to Ahab, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth in Gilead or not?”
1KI.22.15	Micaiah answered, “Attack and win! The L
1KI.22.16	But Ahab said to Micaiah, “How many times do I have to tell you to speak only the truth to me in the name of the L
1KI.22.17	So Micaiah answered, “I saw the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd. The L
1KI.22.18	Then Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I told you! He never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad.”
1KI.22.19	But Micaiah said, “Hear the message from the L
1KI.22.20	The L
1KI.22.20	“Some said one thing; some said another. 
1KI.22.21	Then one spirit came and stood before the L
1KI.22.22	“The L
1KI.22.22	“The spirit answered, ‘I will go to Ahab’s prophets and make them tell lies.’
1KI.22.22	“So the L

1KI.22.25	Micaiah answered, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inside room.”
1KI.22.26	Then Ahab king of Israel ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king’s son. 
1KI.22.27	Tell them I said to put this man in prison and give him only bread and water until I return safely from the battle.”
1KI.22.28	Micaiah said, “Ahab, if you come back safely from battle, the L
1KI.22.29	So Ahab king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went to Ramoth in Gilead. 
1KI.22.30	King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I will go into battle, but I will wear other clothes so no one will recognize me. But you wear your royal clothes.” So Ahab wore other clothes and went into battle.
1KI.22.31	The king of Aram had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “Don’t fight with anyone—important or unimportant—except the king of Israel.” 
1KI.22.32	When these commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought he was certainly the king of Israel, so they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat began shouting. 
1KI.22.33	When they saw he was not King Ahab, they stopped chasing him.
1KI.22.34	By chance, a soldier shot an arrow, but he hit Ahab king of Israel between the pieces of his armor. King Ahab said to his chariot driver, “Turn around and get me out of the battle, because I am hurt!” 
1KI.22.35	The battle continued all day. King Ahab was held up in his chariot and faced the Arameans. His blood flowed down to the bottom of the chariot. That evening he died. 
1KI.22.36	Near sunset a cry went out through the army of Israel: “Each man go back to his own city and land.”
1KI.22.37	In that way King Ahab died. His body was carried to Samaria and buried there. 
1KI.22.38	The men cleaned Ahab’s chariot at a pool in Samaria where prostitutes bathed, and the dogs licked his blood from the chariot. These things happened as the L
1KI.22.39	Everything else Ahab did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. It tells about the palace Ahab built and decorated with ivory and the cities he built. 
1KI.22.40	So Ahab died, and his son Ahaziah became king in his place.
1KI.22.41	Jehoshaphat son of Asa became king of Judah during Ahab’s fourth year as king of Israel. 
1KI.22.42	Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
1KI.22.43	Jehoshaphat was good, like his father Asa, and he did what the L
1KI.22.44	Jehoshaphat was at peace with the king of Israel. 
1KI.22.45	Jehoshaphat fought many wars, and these wars and his successes are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
1KI.22.46	There were male prostitutes still in the places of worship from the days of his father, Asa. So Jehoshaphat forced them to leave.
1KI.22.47	During this time the land of Edom had no king; it was ruled by a governor.
1KI.22.48	King Jehoshaphat built trading ships to sail to Ophir for gold. But the ships were wrecked at Ezion Geber, so they never set sail. 
1KI.22.49	Ahaziah son of Ahab went to help Jehoshaphat, offering to give Jehoshaphat some men to sail with his men, but Jehoshaphat refused.
1KI.22.50	Jehoshaphat died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, the city of David, his ancestor. Then his son Jehoram became king in his place.
1KI.22.51	Ahaziah son of Ahab became king of Israel in Samaria during Jehoshaphat’s seventeenth year as king over Judah. Ahaziah ruled Israel for two years, 
1KI.22.52	and he did what the L
1KI.22.53	Ahaziah worshiped and served the god Baal, and this made the L
2KI.1.1	After Ahab died, Moab broke away from Israel’s rule. 
2KI.1.2	Ahaziah fell down through the wooden bars in his upstairs room in Samaria and was badly hurt. He sent messengers and told them, “Go, ask Baal-Zebub, god of Ekron, if I will recover from my injuries.”
2KI.1.3	But the L
2KI.1.4	This is what the L
2KI.1.5	When the messengers returned to Ahaziah, he asked them, “Why have you returned?”
2KI.1.6	They said, “A man came to meet us. He said, ‘Go back to the king who sent you and tell him what the L
2KI.1.7	Ahaziah asked them, “What did the man look like who met you and told you this?”
2KI.1.8	They answered, “He was a hairy man and wore a leather belt around his waist.”
2KI.1.8	Ahaziah said, “It was Elijah the Tishbite.”
2KI.1.9	Then he sent a captain with his fifty men to Elijah. The captain went to Elijah, who was sitting on top of the hill, and said to him, “Man of God, the king says, ‘Come down!’ ”
2KI.1.10	Elijah answered the captain, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and burn up you and your fifty men.” Then fire came down from heaven and burned up the captain and his fifty men.
2KI.1.11	Ahaziah sent another captain and fifty men to Elijah. The captain said to him, “Man of God, this is what the king says: ‘Come down quickly!’ ”
2KI.1.12	Elijah answered, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and burn up you and your fifty men!” Then fire came down from heaven and burned up the captain and his fifty men.
2KI.1.13	Ahaziah then sent a third captain with his fifty men. The third captain came and fell down on his knees before Elijah and begged, “Man of God, please respect my life and the lives of your fifty servants. 
2KI.1.14	See, fire came down from heaven and burned up the first two captains of fifty with all their men. But now, respect my life.”
2KI.1.15	The L
2KI.1.16	Elijah told Ahaziah, “This is what the L
2KI.1.17	So Ahaziah died, just as the L
2KI.1.17	Joram became king in Ahaziah’s place during the second year Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat was king of Judah. Joram ruled because Ahaziah had no son to take his place. 
2KI.1.18	The other things Ahaziah did are written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2KI.2.1	It was almost time for the L
2KI.2.2	Elijah said to Elisha, “Please stay here. The L
2KI.2.2	But Elisha said, “As the L
2KI.2.3	The groups of prophets at Bethel came out to Elisha and said to him, “Do you know the L
2KI.2.3	Elisha said, “Yes, I know, but don’t talk about it.”
2KI.2.4	Elijah said to him, “Stay here, Elisha, because the L

2KI.2.4	So they went to Jericho. 
2KI.2.5	The groups of prophets at Jericho came to Elisha and said, “Do you know that the L
2KI.2.5	Elisha answered, “Yes, I know, but don’t talk about it.”
2KI.2.6	Elijah said to Elisha, “Stay here. The L
2KI.2.6	Elisha answered, “As the L
2KI.2.6	So the two of them went on. 
2KI.2.7	Fifty men of the groups of prophets came and stood far from where Elijah and Elisha were by the Jordan. 
2KI.2.8	Elijah took off his coat, rolled it up, and hit the water. The water divided to the right and to the left, and Elijah and Elisha crossed over on dry ground.
2KI.2.9	After they had crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, “What can I do for you before I am taken from you?”
2KI.2.9	Elisha said, “Leave me a double share of your spirit.”
2KI.2.10	Elijah said, “You have asked a hard thing. But if you see me when I am taken from you, it will be yours. If you don’t, it won’t happen.”
2KI.2.11	As they were walking and talking, a chariot and horses of fire appeared and separated Elijah from Elisha. Then Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind. 
2KI.2.12	Elisha saw it and shouted, “My father! My father! The chariots of Israel and their horsemen!” And Elisha did not see him anymore. Then Elisha grabbed his own clothes and tore them to show how sad he was.
2KI.2.13	He picked up Elijah’s coat that had fallen from him. Then he returned and stood on the bank of the Jordan. 
2KI.2.14	Elisha hit the water with Elijah’s coat and said, “Where is the L
2KI.2.15	The groups of prophets at Jericho were watching and said, “Elisha now has the spirit Elijah had.” And they came to meet him, bowing down to the ground before him. 
2KI.2.16	They said to him, “There are fifty strong men with us. Please let them go and look for your master. Maybe the Spirit of the L
2KI.2.16	But Elisha answered, “No, don’t send them.”
2KI.2.17	When the groups of prophets had begged Elisha until he couldn’t refuse them anymore, he said, “Send them.” So they sent fifty men who looked for three days, but they could not find him. 
2KI.2.18	Then they came back to Elisha at Jericho where he was staying. He said to them, “I told you not to go, didn’t I?”
2KI.2.19	The people of the city said to Elisha, “Look, master, this city is a nice place to live as you can see. But the water is so bad the land cannot grow crops.”
2KI.2.20	Elisha said, “Bring me a new bowl and put salt in it.” So they brought it to him.
2KI.2.21	Then he went out to the spring and threw the salt in it. He said, “This is what the L
2KI.2.22	So the water has been healed to this day just as Elisha had said.
2KI.2.23	From there Elisha went up to Bethel. On the way some boys came out of the city and made fun of him. They said to him, “Go up too, you baldhead! Go up too, you baldhead!” 
2KI.2.24	Elisha turned around, looked at them, and put a curse on them in the name of the L
2KI.2.25	Elisha went to Mount Carmel and from there he returned to Samaria.
2KI.3.1	Joram son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria in Jehoshaphat’s eighteenth year as king of Judah. And Joram ruled twelve years. 
2KI.3.2	He did what the L
2KI.3.3	But he continued to sin like Jeroboam son of Nebat who had led Israel to sin. Joram did not stop doing these same sins.
2KI.3.4	Mesha king of Moab raised sheep. He paid the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool of one hundred thousand sheep. 
2KI.3.5	But when Ahab died, the king of Moab turned against the king of Israel. 
2KI.3.6	So King Joram went out from Samaria and gathered Israel’s army. 
2KI.3.7	He also sent messengers to Jehoshaphat king of Judah. “The king of Moab has turned against me,” he said. “Will you go with me to fight Moab?”
2KI.3.7	Jehoshaphat replied, “I will go with you. My soldiers and my horses are yours.”
2KI.3.8	Jehoshaphat asked, “Which way should we attack?”
2KI.3.8	Joram answered, “Through the Desert of Edom.”
2KI.3.9	So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. After they had marched seven days, there was no more water for the army or for their animals that were with them. 
2KI.3.10	The king of Israel said, “This is terrible! The L
2KI.3.11	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Is there a prophet of the L
2KI.3.11	An officer of the king of Israel answered, “Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He was Elijah’s servant.”
2KI.3.12	Jehoshaphat said, “He speaks the L
2KI.3.13	Elisha said to the king of Israel, “I have nothing to do with you. Go to the prophets of your father and to the prophets of your mother!”
2KI.3.13	The king of Israel said to Elisha, “No, the L
2KI.3.14	Elisha said, “As surely as the L
2KI.3.15	Now bring me someone who plays the harp.”
2KI.3.15	While the harp was being played, the L
2KI.3.16	Then Elisha said, “The L
2KI.3.17	The L
2KI.3.18	This is easy for the L
2KI.3.19	You will destroy every strong, walled city and every important town. You will cut down every good tree and stop up all springs. You will ruin every good field with rocks.”
2KI.3.20	The next morning, about the time the sacrifice was offered, water came from the direction of Edom and filled the valley.
2KI.3.21	All the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. So they gathered everyone old enough to put on armor and waited at the border. 
2KI.3.22	But when the Moabites got up early in the morning, the sun was shining on the water. They saw the water across from them, and it looked as red as blood. 
2KI.3.23	Then they said, “This is blood! The kings must have fought and killed each other! Come, Moabites, let’s take the valuables from the dead bodies!”
2KI.3.24	When the Moabites came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites came out and fought them until they ran away. Then the Israelites went on into the land, killing the Moabites. 
2KI.3.25	They tore down the cities and threw rocks all over every good field. They stopped up all the springs and cut down all the good trees. Kir Hareseth was the only city with its stones still in place, but the men with slingshots surrounded it and conquered it, too.
2KI.3.26	When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too much for him, he took seven hundred men with swords to try to break through to the king of Edom. But they could not break through. 
2KI.3.27	Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have been king after him, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. So there was great anger against the Israelites, who left and went back to their own land.
2KI.4.1	The wife of a man from the groups of prophets said to Elisha, “Your servant, my husband, is dead. You know he honored the L
2KI.4.2	Elisha answered, “How can I help you? Tell me, what do you have in your house?”
2KI.4.2	The woman said, “I don’t have anything there except a pot of oil.”
2KI.4.3	Then Elisha said, “Go and get empty jars from all your neighbors. Don’t ask for just a few. 
2KI.4.4	Then go into your house and shut the door behind you and your sons. Pour oil into all the jars, and set the full ones aside.”
2KI.4.5	So she left Elisha and shut the door behind her and her sons. As they brought the jars to her, she poured out the oil. 
2KI.4.6	When the jars were all full, she said to her son, “Bring me another jar.”
2KI.4.6	But he said, “There are no more jars.” Then the oil stopped flowing.
2KI.4.7	She went and told Elisha. And the prophet said to her, “Go, sell the oil and pay what you owe. You and your sons can live on what is left.”
2KI.4.8	One day Elisha went to Shunem, where an important woman lived. She begged Elisha to stay and eat. So every time Elisha passed by, he stopped there to eat. 
2KI.4.9	The woman said to her husband, “I know that this is a holy man of God who passes by our house all the time. 
2KI.4.10	Let’s make a small room on the roof and put a bed in the room for him. We can put a table, a chair, and a lampstand there. Then when he comes by, he can stay there.”
2KI.4.11	One day Elisha came to the woman’s house. After he went to his room and rested, 
2KI.4.12	he said to his servant Gehazi, “Call the Shunammite woman.”
2KI.4.12	When the servant had called her, she stood in front of him. 
2KI.4.13	Elisha had told his servant, “Now say to her, ‘You have gone to all this trouble for us. What can I do for you? Do you want me to speak to the king or the commander of the army for you?’ ”
2KI.4.13	She answered, “I live among my own people.”
2KI.4.14	Elisha said to Gehazi, “But what can we do for her?”
2KI.4.14	He answered, “She has no son, and her husband is old.”
2KI.4.15	Then Elisha said to Gehazi, “Call her.” When he called her, she stood in the doorway. 
2KI.4.16	Then Elisha said, “About this time next year, you will hold a son in your arms.”
2KI.4.16	The woman said, “No, master, man of God, don’t lie to me, your servant!”
2KI.4.17	But the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son at that time the next year, just as Elisha had told her.
2KI.4.18	The boy grew up and one day went out to his father, who was with the grain harvesters. 
2KI.4.19	The boy said to his father, “My head! My head!”
2KI.4.19	The father said to his servant, “Take him to his mother!” 
2KI.4.20	The servant took him to his mother, and he lay on his mother’s lap until noon. Then he died. 
2KI.4.21	So she took him up and laid him on Elisha’s bed. Then she shut the door and left.
2KI.4.22	She called to her husband, “Send me one of the servants and one of the donkeys. Then I can go quickly to the man of God and return.”
2KI.4.23	The husband said, “Why do you want to go to him today? It isn’t the New Moon or the Sabbath day.”
2KI.4.23	She said, “It will be all right.”
2KI.4.24	Then she saddled the donkey and said to her servant, “Lead on. Don’t slow down for me unless I tell you.” 
2KI.4.25	So she went to Elisha, the man of God, at Mount Carmel.
2KI.4.25	When he saw her coming from far away, he said to his servant Gehazi, “Look, there’s the Shunammite woman! 
2KI.4.26	Run to meet her and ask, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is the boy all right?’ ”
2KI.4.26	She answered, “Everything is all right.”
2KI.4.27	Then she came to Elisha at the hill and grabbed his feet. Gehazi came near to pull her away, but Elisha said to him, “Leave her alone. She’s very upset, and the L
2KI.4.28	She said, “Master, did I ask you for a son? Didn’t I tell you not to lie to me?”
2KI.4.29	Then Elisha said to Gehazi, “Get ready. Take my walking stick in your hand and go quickly. If you meet anyone, don’t say hello. If anyone greets you, don’t respond. Lay my walking stick on the boy’s face.”
2KI.4.30	The boy’s mother said, “As surely as the L
2KI.4.31	Gehazi went on ahead and laid the walking stick on the boy’s face, but the boy did not talk or move. Then Gehazi went back to meet Elisha. “The boy has not awakened,” he said.
2KI.4.32	When Elisha came into the house, the boy was lying dead on his bed. 
2KI.4.33	Elisha entered the room and shut the door, so only he and the boy were in the room. Then he prayed to the L
2KI.4.34	He went to the bed and lay on the boy, putting his mouth on the boy’s mouth, his eyes on the boy’s eyes, and his hands on the boy’s hands. He stretched himself out on top of the boy. Soon the boy’s skin became warm. 
2KI.4.35	Elisha turned away and walked around the room. Then he went back and put himself on the boy again. The boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes.
2KI.4.36	Elisha called Gehazi and said, “Call the Shunammite!” So he did. When she came, Elisha said, “Pick up your son.” 
2KI.4.37	She came in and fell at Elisha’s feet, bowing facedown to the floor. Then she picked up her son and went out.
2KI.4.38	When Elisha returned to Gilgal, there was a shortage of food in the land. While the groups of prophets were sitting in front of him, he said to his servant, “Put the large pot on the fire, and boil some stew for these men.”
2KI.4.39	One of them went out into the field to gather plants. Finding a wild vine, he picked fruit from the vine and filled his robe with it. Then he came and cut up the fruit into the pot. But they didn’t know what kind of fruit it was. 
2KI.4.40	They poured out the stew for the others to eat. When they began to eat it, they shouted, “Man of God, there’s death in the pot!” And they could not eat it.
2KI.4.41	Elisha told them to bring some flour. He threw it into the pot and said, “Pour it out for the people to eat.” Then there was nothing harmful in the pot.
2KI.4.42	A man from Baal Shalishah came to Elisha, bringing him twenty loaves of barley bread from the first harvest. He also brought fresh grain in his sack. Elisha said, “Give it to the people to eat.”
2KI.4.43	Elisha’s servant asked, “How can I feed a hundred people with so little?”
2KI.4.43	“Give the bread to the people to eat,” Elisha said. “This is what the L
2KI.4.44	After he gave it to them, the people ate and had food left over, as the L
2KI.5.1	Naaman was commander of the army of the king of Aram. He was honored by his master, and he had much respect because the L
2KI.5.2	The Arameans had gone out to raid the Israelites and had taken a little girl as a captive. This little girl served Naaman’s wife. 
2KI.5.3	She said to her mistress, “I wish my master would meet the prophet who lives in Samaria. He would cure him of his disease.”
2KI.5.4	Naaman went to the king and told him what the girl from Israel had said. 
2KI.5.5	The king of Aram said, “Go ahead, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel.” So Naaman left and took with him about seven hundred fifty pounds of silver, as well as one hundred fifty pounds of gold and ten changes of clothes. 
2KI.5.6	He brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, “I am sending my servant Naaman to you so you can heal him of his skin disease.”
2KI.5.7	When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes to show how upset he was. He said, “I’m not God! I can’t kill and make alive again! Why does this man send someone with a skin disease for me to heal? You can see that the king of Aram is trying to start trouble with me.”
2KI.5.8	When Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent the king this message: “Why have you torn your clothes? Let Naaman come to me. Then he will know there is a prophet in Israel.” 
2KI.5.9	So Naaman went with his horses and chariots to Elisha’s house and stood outside the door.
2KI.5.10	Elisha sent Naaman a messenger who said, “Go and wash in the Jordan River seven times. Then your skin will be healed, and you will be clean.”
2KI.5.11	Naaman became angry and left. He said, “I thought Elisha would surely come out and stand before me and call on the name of the L
2KI.5.12	The Abana and the Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, are better than all the waters of Israel. Why can’t I wash in them and become clean?” So Naaman went away very angry.
2KI.5.13	Naaman’s servants came near and said to him, “My father, if the prophet had told you to do some great thing, wouldn’t you have done it? Doesn’t it make more sense just to do it? After all, he only told you, ‘Wash, and you will be clean.’ ” 
2KI.5.14	So Naaman went down and dipped in the Jordan seven times, just as Elisha had said. Then his skin became new again, like the skin of a child. And he was clean.
2KI.5.15	Naaman and all his group returned to Elisha. He stood before Elisha and said, “Look, I now know there is no God in all the earth except in Israel. Now please accept a gift from me.”
2KI.5.16	But Elisha said, “As surely as the L
2KI.5.17	Then Naaman said, “If you won’t take the gift, then please give me some soil—as much as two of my mules can carry. From now on I’ll not offer any burnt offering or sacrifice to any other gods but the L
2KI.5.18	But let the L
2KI.5.19	Elisha said to him, “Go in peace.”
2KI.5.19	Naaman left Elisha and went a short way. 
2KI.5.20	Gehazi, the servant of Elisha the man of God, thought, “My master has not accepted what Naaman the Aramean brought. As surely as the L
2KI.5.21	So Gehazi went after Naaman.
2KI.5.21	When Naaman saw someone running after him, he got off the chariot to meet Gehazi. He asked, “Is everything all right?”
2KI.5.22	Gehazi said, “Everything is all right. My master has sent me. He said, ‘Two young men from the groups of prophets in the mountains of Ephraim just came to me. Please give them seventy-five pounds of silver and two changes of clothes.’ ”
2KI.5.23	Naaman said, “Please take one hundred fifty pounds,” and he urged Gehazi to take it. He tied one hundred fifty pounds of silver in two bags with two changes of clothes. Then he gave them to two of his servants to carry for Gehazi. 
2KI.5.24	When they came to the hill, Gehazi took these things from Naaman’s servants and put them in the house. Then he let Naaman’s servants go, and they left.
2KI.5.25	When he came in and stood before his master, Elisha said to him, “Where have you been, Gehazi?”
2KI.5.25	“I didn’t go anywhere,” he answered.
2KI.5.26	But Elisha said to him, “My spirit was with you. I knew when the man turned from his chariot to meet you. This isn’t a time to take money, clothes, olives, grapes, sheep, oxen, male servants, or female servants. 
2KI.5.27	So Naaman’s skin disease will come on you and your children forever.” When Gehazi left Elisha, he had the disease and was as white as snow.
2KI.6.1	The groups of prophets said to Elisha, “The place where we meet with you is too small for us. 
2KI.6.2	Let’s go to the Jordan River. There everyone can get a log, and let’s build a place there to live.”
2KI.6.2	Elisha said, “Go.”
2KI.6.3	One of them said, “Please go with us.”
2KI.6.3	Elisha answered, “I will go,” 
2KI.6.4	so he went with them. When they arrived at the Jordan, they cut down some trees. 
2KI.6.5	As one man was cutting down a tree, the head of his ax fell into the water. He yelled, “Oh, my master! I borrowed that ax!”
2KI.6.6	Elisha asked, “Where did it fall?” The man showed him the place. Then Elisha cut down a stick and threw it into the water, and it made the iron head float. 
2KI.6.7	Elisha said, “Pick up the axhead.” Then the man reached out and took it.
2KI.6.8	The king of Aram was at war with Israel. He had a council meeting with his officers and said, “I will set up my camp in this place.”
2KI.6.9	Elisha, the man of God, sent a message to the king of Israel, saying, “Be careful! Don’t pass that place, because the Arameans are going down there!”
2KI.6.10	The king of Israel checked the place about which Elisha had warned him. Elisha warned him several times, so the king protected himself there.
2KI.6.11	The king of Aram was angry about this. He called his officers together and demanded, “Tell me who of us is working for the king of Israel.”
2KI.6.12	One of the officers said, “None, my master and king. It’s Elisha, the prophet from Israel. He can tell you what you speak in your bedroom.”
2KI.6.13	The king said, “Go and find him so I can send men and catch him.”
2KI.6.13	The servants came back and reported, “He is in Dothan.”
2KI.6.14	Then the king sent horses, chariots, and many troops to Dothan. They arrived at night and surrounded the city.
2KI.6.15	Elisha’s servant got up early, and when he went out, he saw an army with horses and chariots all around the city. The servant said to Elisha, “Oh, my master, what can we do?”
2KI.6.16	Elisha said, “Don’t be afraid. The army that fights for us is larger than the one against us.”
2KI.6.17	Then Elisha prayed, “L
2KI.6.17	The L
2KI.6.18	As the enemy came down toward Elisha, he prayed to the L
2KI.6.19	Elisha said to them, “This is not the right road or the right city. Follow me and I’ll take you to the man you are looking for.” Then Elisha led them to Samaria.
2KI.6.20	After they entered Samaria, Elisha said, “L
2KI.6.21	When the king of Israel saw the Aramean army, he said to Elisha, “My father, should I kill them? Should I kill them?”
2KI.6.22	Elisha answered, “Don’t kill them. You wouldn’t kill people whom you captured with your sword and bow. Give them food and water, and let them eat and drink and then go home to their master.” 
2KI.6.23	So he prepared a great feast for the Aramean army. After they ate and drank, the king sent them away, and they went home to their master. The soldiers of Aram did not come anymore into the land of Israel.
2KI.6.24	Later, Ben-Hadad king of Aram gathered his whole army and surrounded and attacked Samaria. 
2KI.6.25	There was a shortage of food in Samaria. It was so bad that a donkey’s head sold for about two pounds of silver, and half of a pint of dove’s dung sold for about two ounces of silver.
2KI.6.26	As the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman yelled out to him, “Help me, my master and king!”
2KI.6.27	The king said, “If the L
2KI.6.28	Then the king said to her, “What is your trouble?”
2KI.6.28	She answered, “This woman said to me, ‘Give up your son so we can eat him today. Then we will eat my son tomorrow.’ 
2KI.6.29	So we boiled my son and ate him. Then the next day I said to her, ‘Give up your son so we can eat him.’ But she had hidden him.”
2KI.6.30	When the king heard the woman’s words, he tore his clothes in grief. As he walked along the wall, the people looked and saw he had on rough cloth under his clothes to show his sadness. 
2KI.6.31	He said, “May God punish me terribly if the head of Elisha son of Shaphat isn’t cut off from his body today!”
2KI.6.32	The king sent a messenger to Elisha, who was sitting in his house with the elders. But before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to them, “See, this murderer is sending men to cut off my head. When the messenger arrives, shut the door and hold it; don’t let him in. The sound of his master’s feet is behind him.”
2KI.6.33	Elisha was still talking with the leaders when the messenger arrived. The king said, “This trouble has come from the L
2KI.7.1	Elisha said, “Listen to the L
2KI.7.2	Then the officer who was close to the king answered Elisha, “Even if the L
2KI.7.2	Elisha said, “You will see it with your eyes, but you will not eat any of it.”
2KI.7.3	There were four men with a skin disease at the entrance to the city gate. They said to each other, “Why do we sit here until we die? 
2KI.7.4	There is no food in the city. So if we go into the city, we will die there. If we stay here, we will die. So let’s go to the Aramean camp. If they let us live, we will live. If they kill us, we die.”
2KI.7.5	So they got up at twilight and went to the Aramean camp, but when they arrived, no one was there. 
2KI.7.6	The Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the sound of chariots, horses, and a large army. They had said to each other, “The king of Israel has hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to attack us!” 
2KI.7.7	So they got up and ran away in the twilight, leaving their tents, horses, and donkeys. They left the camp standing and ran for their lives.
2KI.7.8	When the men with the skin disease came to the edge of the camp, they went into one of the tents and ate and drank. They carried silver, gold, and clothes out of the camp and hid them. Then they came back and entered another tent. They carried things from this tent and hid them, also. 
2KI.7.9	Then they said to each other, “We’re doing wrong. Today we have good news, but we are silent. If we wait until the sun comes up, we’ll be discovered. Let’s go right now and tell the people in the king’s palace.”
2KI.7.10	So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city. They said, “We went to the Aramean camp, but no one is there; we didn’t hear anyone. The horses and donkeys were still tied up, and the tents were still standing.” 
2KI.7.11	Then the gatekeepers shouted out and told the people in the palace.
2KI.7.12	The king got up in the night and said to his officers, “I’ll tell you what the Arameans are doing to us. They know we are starving. They have gone out of the camp to hide in the field. They’re saying, ‘When the Israelites come out of the city, we’ll capture them alive. Then we’ll enter the city.’ ”
2KI.7.13	One of his officers answered, “Let some men take five of the horses that are still left in the city. These men are like all the Israelites who are left; they are also about to die. Let’s send them to see what has happened.”
2KI.7.14	So the men took two chariots with horses. The king sent them after the Aramean army, saying, “Go and see what has happened.” 
2KI.7.15	The men followed the Aramean army as far as the Jordan River. The road was full of clothes and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away as they had hurriedly left. So the messengers returned and told the king. 
2KI.7.16	Then the people went out and took valuables from the Aramean camp. So seven quarts of fine flour were sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver, and thirteen quarts of barley were sold for two-fifths of an ounce of silver, just as the L
2KI.7.17	The king chose the officer who was close to him to guard the gate, but the people trampled the officer to death. This happened just as Elisha had told the king when the king came to his house. 
2KI.7.18	He had said, “Thirteen quarts of barley and seven quarts of fine flour will each sell for two-fifths of an ounce of silver about this time tomorrow at the gate of Samaria.”
2KI.7.19	But the officer had answered, “Even if the L
2KI.7.20	It happened to the officer just that way. The people trampled him in the gateway, and he died.
2KI.8.1	Elisha spoke to the woman whose son he had brought back to life. He said, “Get up and go with your family. Stay any place you can, because the L
2KI.8.2	So the woman got up and did as the man of God had said. She left with her family, and they stayed in the land of the Philistines for seven years. 
2KI.8.3	After seven years she returned from the land of the Philistines and went to beg the king for her house and land. 
2KI.8.4	The king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God. The king had said, “Please tell me all the great things Elisha has done.” 
2KI.8.5	Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead boy back to life. Just then the woman whose son Elisha had brought back to life came and begged the king for her house and land.
2KI.8.5	Gehazi said, “My master and king, this is the woman, and this is the son Elisha brought back to life.”
2KI.8.6	The king asked the woman, and she told him about it. Then the king chose an officer to help her. “Give the woman everything that is hers,” the king said. “Give her all the money made from her land from the day she left until now.”
2KI.8.7	Then Elisha went to Damascus, where Ben-Hadad king of Aram was sick. Someone told him, “The man of God has arrived.”
2KI.8.8	The king said to Hazael, “Take a gift in your hand and go meet him. Ask the L
2KI.8.9	So Hazael went to meet Elisha, taking with him a gift of forty camels loaded with every good thing in Damascus. He came and stood before Elisha and said, “Your son Ben-Hadad king of Aram sent me to you. He asks if he will recover from his sickness.”
2KI.8.10	Elisha said to Hazael, “Go and tell Ben-Hadad, ‘You will surely recover,’ but the L
2KI.8.11	Hazael stared at Elisha until he felt ashamed. Then Elisha cried.
2KI.8.12	Hazael asked, “Why are you crying, master?”
2KI.8.12	Elisha answered, “Because I know what evil you will do to the Israelites. You will burn their strong, walled cities with fire and kill their young men with swords. You will throw their babies to the ground and split open their pregnant women.”
2KI.8.13	Hazael said, “Am I a dog? How could I do such things?”
2KI.8.13	Elisha answered, “The L
2KI.8.14	Then Hazael left Elisha and came to his master. Ben-Hadad said to him, “What did Elisha say to you?”
2KI.8.14	Hazael answered, “He told me that you will surely recover.” 
2KI.8.15	But the next day Hazael took a blanket and dipped it in water. Then he put it over Ben-Hadad’s face, and he died. So Hazael became king in Ben-Hadad’s place.
2KI.8.16	While Jehoshaphat was king in Judah, Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah. This was during the fifth year Joram son of Ahab was king of Israel. 
2KI.8.17	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he began to rule, and he ruled eight years in Jerusalem. 
2KI.8.18	He followed the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the family of Ahab had done, because he married Ahab’s daughter. Jehoram did what the L
2KI.8.19	But the L
2KI.8.20	In Jehoram’s time Edom broke away from Judah’s rule and chose their own king. 
2KI.8.21	So Jehoram and all his chariots went to Zair. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders. Jehoram got up and attacked the Edomites at night, but his army ran away to their tents. 
2KI.8.22	From then until now the country of Edom has fought against the rule of Judah. At the same time Libnah also broke away from Judah’s rule.
2KI.8.23	The other acts of Jehoram and all the things he did are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.8.24	Jehoram died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, and Jehoram’s son Ahaziah ruled in his place.
2KI.8.25	Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah during the twelfth year Joram son of Ahab was king of Israel. 
2KI.8.26	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri king of Israel. 
2KI.8.27	Ahaziah followed the ways of Ahab’s family. He did what the L
2KI.8.28	Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to Ramoth in Gilead, where they fought against Hazael king of Aram. The Arameans wounded Joram. 
2KI.8.29	So King Joram returned to Jezreel to heal from the wound he had received from the Arameans at Ramoth when he fought Hazael king of Aram. Ahaziah son of Jehoram king of Judah went down to visit Joram son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he had been wounded.
2KI.9.1	At the same time, Elisha the prophet called a man from the groups of prophets. Elisha said, “Get ready, and take this small bottle of olive oil in your hand. Go to Ramoth in Gilead. 
2KI.9.2	When you arrive, find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi. Go in and make Jehu get up from among his brothers, and take him to an inner room. 
2KI.9.3	Then take the bottle and pour the oil on Jehu’s head and say, ‘This is what the L
2KI.9.4	So the young man, the prophet, went to Ramoth in Gilead. 
2KI.9.5	When he arrived, he saw the officers of the army sitting together. He said, “Commander, I have a message for you.”
2KI.9.5	Jehu asked, “For which one of us?”
2KI.9.5	The young man said, “For you, commander.”
2KI.9.6	Jehu got up and went into the house. Then the young prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu’s head and said to him, “This is what the L
2KI.9.7	You must destroy the family of Ahab your master. I will punish Jezebel for the deaths of my servants the prophets and for all the L
2KI.9.8	All of Ahab’s family must die. I will not let any male child in Ahab’s family live in Israel, whether slave or free. 
2KI.9.9	I will make Ahab’s family like the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat and like the family of Baasha son of Ahijah. 
2KI.9.10	The dogs will eat Jezebel at Jezreel, and no one will bury her.’ ”
2KI.9.10	Then the young prophet opened the door and ran away.
2KI.9.11	When Jehu went back to his master’s officers, one of them said to Jehu, “Is everything all right? Why did this crazy man come to you?”
2KI.9.11	Jehu answered, “You know the man and how he talks.”
2KI.9.12	They answered, “That’s not true. Tell us.”
2KI.9.12	Jehu said, “He said to me, ‘This is what the L
2KI.9.13	Then the officers hurried, and each man took off his own coat and put it on the stairs for Jehu. They blew the trumpet and shouted, “Jehu is king!”
2KI.9.14	So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, made plans against Joram. Now Joram and all Israel had been defending Ramoth in Gilead from Hazael king of Aram. 
2KI.9.15	But King Joram had to return to Jezreel to heal from the injuries the Arameans had given him when he fought against Hazael king of Aram.
2KI.9.15	Jehu said, “If you agree with this, don’t let anyone leave the city. They might tell the news in Jezreel.” 
2KI.9.16	Then he got into his chariot and set out for Jezreel, where Joram was resting. Ahaziah king of Judah had gone down to see him.
2KI.9.17	The lookout was standing on the watchtower in Jezreel when he saw Jehu’s troops coming. He said, “I see some soldiers!”
2KI.9.17	Joram said, “Take a horseman and send him to meet them. Tell him to ask, ‘Is all in order?’ ”
2KI.9.18	The horseman rode out to meet Jehu, and he said, “This is what the king says: ‘Is all in order?’ ”
2KI.9.18	Jehu said, “Why bother yourself with order? Come along behind me.”
2KI.9.18	The lookout reported, “The messenger reached them, but he is not coming back.”
2KI.9.19	Then Joram sent out a second horseman. This rider came to Jehu’s group and said, “This is what the king says: ‘Is all in order?’ ”
2KI.9.19	Jehu answered, “Why bother yourself with order? Come along behind me.”
2KI.9.20	The lookout reported, “The second man reached them, but he is not coming back. The man in the chariot is driving like Jehu son of Nimshi. He drives as if he were crazy!”
2KI.9.21	Joram said, “Get my chariot ready.” Then the servant got Joram’s chariot ready. Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his own chariot, to meet Jehu at the property of Naboth the Jezreelite.
2KI.9.22	When Joram saw Jehu, he said, “Is all in order, Jehu?”
2KI.9.22	Jehu answered, “There will never be any order as long as your mother Jezebel worships idols and uses witchcraft.”
2KI.9.23	Joram turned the horses to run away and yelled to Ahaziah, “It’s a trick, Ahaziah!”
2KI.9.24	Then Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between his shoulders. The arrow went through Joram’s heart, and he fell down in his chariot.
2KI.9.25	Jehu ordered Bidkar, his chariot officer, “Pick up Joram’s body, and throw it into the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. Remember when you and I rode together with Joram’s father Ahab. The L
2KI.9.26	‘Yesterday I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons, says the L
2KI.9.27	When Ahaziah king of Judah saw this, he ran away toward Beth Haggan. Jehu chased him, saying, “Shoot Ahaziah, too!” Ahaziah was wounded in his chariot on the way up to Gur near Ibleam. He got as far as Megiddo but died there. 
2KI.9.28	Ahaziah’s servants carried his body in a chariot to Jerusalem and buried him with his ancestors in his tomb in Jerusalem. 
2KI.9.29	(Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year Joram son of Ahab was king.)
2KI.9.30	When Jehu came to Jezreel, Jezebel heard about it. She put on her eye makeup and fixed her hair. Then she looked out the window. 
2KI.9.31	When Jehu entered the city gate, Jezebel said, “Have you come in peace, you Zimri, you who killed your master?”
2KI.9.32	Jehu looked up at the window and said, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three servants looked out the window at Jehu. 
2KI.9.33	He said to them, “Throw her down.” So they threw Jezebel down, and the horses ran over her. Some of her blood splashed on the wall and on the horses.
2KI.9.34	Jehu went into the house and ate and drank. Then he said, “Now see about this cursed woman. Bury her, because she is a king’s daughter.”
2KI.9.35	The men went to bury Jezebel, but they could not find her. They found only her skull, feet, and the palms of her hands. 
2KI.9.36	When they came back and told Jehu, he said, “The L
2KI.9.37	Her body will be like manure on the field in the land at Jezreel. No one will be able to say that this is Jezebel.’ ”
2KI.10.1	Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria to the officers and elders of Jezreel and to the guardians of the sons of Ahab. Jehu said, 
2KI.10.2	“You have your master’s sons with you, and you have chariots, horses, a city with strong walls, and weapons. When you get this letter, 
2KI.10.3	choose the best and most worthy person among your master’s sons, and make him king. Then fight for your master’s family.”
2KI.10.4	But the officers and leaders of Jezreel were frightened. They said, “Two kings could not stand up to Jehu, so how can we?”
2KI.10.5	The palace manager, the city governor, the leaders, and the guardians sent a message to Jehu. “We are your servants,” they said. “We will do everything you tell us to do. We won’t make any man king, so do whatever you think is best.”
2KI.10.6	Then Jehu wrote a second letter, saying, “If you are on my side and will obey me, cut off the heads of your master’s sons and come to me at Jezreel tomorrow about this time.”
2KI.10.6	Now the seventy sons of the king’s family were with the leading men of the city who were their guardians. 
2KI.10.7	When the leaders received the letter, they took the king’s sons and killed all seventy of them. They put their heads in baskets and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel. 
2KI.10.8	The messenger came to Jehu and told him, “They have brought the heads of the king’s sons.”
2KI.10.8	Then Jehu said, “Lay the heads in two piles at the city gate until morning.”
2KI.10.9	In the morning, Jehu went out and stood before the people and said to them, “You are innocent. Look, I made plans against my master and killed him. But who killed all these? 
2KI.10.10	You should know that everything the L
2KI.10.11	So Jehu killed everyone of Ahab’s family in Jezreel who was still alive. He also killed all Ahab’s leading men, close friends, and priests. No one who had helped Ahab was left alive.
2KI.10.12	Then Jehu left and went to Samaria by way of the road to Beth Eked of the Shepherds. 
2KI.10.13	There Jehu met some relatives of Ahaziah king of Judah. Jehu asked, “Who are you?”
2KI.10.13	They answered, “We are relatives of Ahaziah. We have come down to get revenge for the families of the king and the king’s mother.”
2KI.10.14	Then Jehu said, “Take them alive!” So they captured Ahaziah’s relatives alive and killed them at the well near Beth Eked—forty-two of them. Jehu did not leave anyone alive.
2KI.10.15	After Jehu left there, he met Jehonadab son of Recab, who was also on his way to meet Jehu. Jehu greeted him and said, “Are you as good a friend to me as I am to you?”
2KI.10.15	Jehonadab answered, “Yes, I am.”
2KI.10.15	Jehu said, “If you are, then give me your hand.” So Jehonadab gave him his hand, and Jehu pulled him into the chariot. 
2KI.10.16	“Come with me,” Jehu said. “You can see how strong my feelings are for the L
2KI.10.17	When Jehu came to Samaria, he killed all of Ahab’s family in Samaria. He destroyed all those who were left, just as the L
2KI.10.18	Then Jehu gathered all the people together and said to them, “Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve Baal much. 
2KI.10.19	Now call for me all Baal’s prophets and priests and all the people who worship Baal. Don’t let anyone miss this meeting, because I have a great sacrifice for Baal. Anyone who is not there will not live.” But Jehu was tricking them so he could destroy the worshipers of Baal. 
2KI.10.20	He said, “Prepare a holy meeting for Baal.” So they announced the meeting. 
2KI.10.21	Then Jehu sent word through all Israel, and all the worshipers of Baal came; not one stayed home. They came into the temple of Baal, and the temple was filled from one side to the other.
2KI.10.22	Jehu said to the man who kept the robes, “Bring out robes for all the worshipers of Baal.” After he brought out robes for them, 
2KI.10.23	Jehu and Jehonadab son of Recab went into the temple of Baal. Jehu said to the worshipers of Baal, “Look around, and make sure there are no servants of the L
2KI.10.24	Then the worshipers of Baal went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings.
2KI.10.24	Jehu had eighty men waiting outside. He had told them, “Don’t let anyone escape. If you do, you must pay with your own life.”
2KI.10.25	As soon as Jehu finished offering the burnt offering, he ordered the guards and the captains, “Go in and kill the worshipers of Baal. Don’t let anyone come out.” So the guards and captains killed the worshipers of Baal with the sword and threw their bodies out. Then they went to the inner rooms of the temple 
2KI.10.26	and brought out the pillars of the temple of Baal and burned them. 
2KI.10.27	They tore down the stone pillar of Baal, as well as the temple of Baal. And they made it into a sewage pit, as it is today.
2KI.10.28	So Jehu destroyed Baal worship in Israel, 
2KI.10.29	but he did not stop doing the sins Jeroboam son of Nebat had done. Jeroboam had led Israel to sin by worshiping the golden calves in Bethel and Dan.
2KI.10.30	The L
2KI.10.31	But Jehu was not careful to follow the teachings of the L
2KI.10.32	At that time the L
2KI.10.33	taking all the land of the Jordan known as the land of Gilead. (It was the region of Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh.) He took land from Aroer by the Arnon Ravine through Gilead to Bashan.
2KI.10.34	The other things Jehu did—everything he did and all his victories—are recorded in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.10.35	Jehu died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoahaz became king in his place. 
2KI.10.36	Jehu was king over Israel in Samaria for twenty-eight years.
2KI.11.1	When Ahaziah’s mother, Athaliah, saw that her son was dead, she killed all the royal family. 
2KI.11.2	But Jehosheba, King Jehoram’s daughter and Ahaziah’s sister, took Joash, Ahaziah’s son. She stole him from among the other sons of the king who were about to be murdered. She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah, so he was not killed. 
2KI.11.3	He hid with her in the Temple of the L
2KI.11.4	In the seventh year Jehoiada sent for the commanders of groups of a hundred men, as well as the Carites. He brought them together in the Temple of the L
2KI.11.5	He commanded them, “This is what you must do. A third of you who go on duty on the Sabbath will guard the king’s palace. 
2KI.11.6	A third of you will be at the Sur Gate, and another third will be at the gate behind the guard. This way you will guard the Temple. 
2KI.11.7	The two groups who go off duty on the Sabbath must protect the Temple of the L
2KI.11.8	All of you must stand around the king, with weapons in hand. Kill anyone who comes near. Stay close to the king when he goes out and when he comes in.”
2KI.11.9	The commanders over a hundred men obeyed everything Jehoiada the priest had commanded. Each one took his men who came on duty on the Sabbath and those who went off duty on the Sabbath, and they came to Jehoiada the priest. 
2KI.11.10	He gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to King David and that were kept in the Temple of the L
2KI.11.11	Then each guard took his place with his weapons in his hand. There were guards from the south side of the Temple to the north side. They stood by the altar and the Temple and around the king. 
2KI.11.12	Jehoiada brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him and gave him a copy of the agreement. They appointed him king and poured olive oil on him. Then they clapped their hands and said, “Long live the king!”
2KI.11.13	When Athaliah heard the noise of the guards and the people, she went to them at the Temple of the L
2KI.11.14	She looked, and there was the king, standing by the pillar, as the custom was. The officers and trumpeters were standing beside him, and all the people of the land were very happy and were blowing trumpets. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, “Traitors! Traitors!”
2KI.11.15	Jehoiada the priest gave orders to the commanders of a hundred men, who led the army. He said, “Surround her with soldiers and kill with a sword anyone who follows her.” He commanded this because he had said, “Don’t put Athaliah to death in the Temple of the L
2KI.11.16	So they caught her when she came to the horses’ entrance near the palace. There she was put to death.
2KI.11.17	Then Jehoiada made an agreement between the L
2KI.11.18	All the people of the land went to the temple of Baal and tore it down, smashing the altars and idols. They also killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.
2KI.11.18	Then Jehoiada the priest placed guards at the Temple of the L
2KI.11.19	He took with him the commanders of a hundred men and the Carites, the royal bodyguards, as well as the guards and all the people of the land. Together they took the king out of the Temple of the L
2KI.11.20	So all the people of the land were very happy, and Jerusalem had peace, because Athaliah had been put to death with the sword at the palace.
2KI.11.21	Joash was seven years old when he became king.
2KI.12.1	Joash became king of Judah in Jehu’s seventh year as king of Israel, and he ruled for forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah, and she was from Beersheba. 
2KI.12.2	Joash did what the L
2KI.12.3	But the places where gods were worshiped were not removed; the people still made sacrifices and burned incense there.
2KI.12.4	Joash said to the priests, “Take all the money brought as offerings to the Temple of the L
2KI.12.5	Each priest will take the money from the people he serves. Then the priests must repair any damage they find in the Temple.”
2KI.12.6	But by the twenty-third year Joash was king, the priests still had not repaired the Temple. 
2KI.12.7	So King Joash called for Jehoiada the priest and the other priests and said to them, “Why aren’t you repairing the damage of the Temple? Don’t take any more money from the people you serve, but hand over the money for the repair of the Temple.” 
2KI.12.8	The priests agreed not to take any more money from the people and not to repair the Temple themselves.
2KI.12.9	Jehoiada the priest took a box and made a hole in the top of it. Then he put it by the altar, on the right side as the people came into the Temple of the L
2KI.12.10	Each time the priests saw that the box was full of money, the king’s royal secretary and the high priest came. They counted the money that had been brought to the Temple of the L
2KI.12.11	Next they weighed the money and gave it to the people in charge of the work on the Temple. With it they paid the carpenters and the builders who worked on the Temple of the L
2KI.12.12	as well as the bricklayers and stonecutters. They also used the money to buy timber and cut stone to repair the damage of the Temple of the L
2KI.12.13	The money brought into the Temple of the L
2KI.12.14	They paid the money to the workers, who used it to repair the Temple of the L
2KI.12.15	They did not demand to know how the money was spent, because the workers were honest. 
2KI.12.16	The money from the penalty offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the Temple of the L
2KI.12.17	About this time Hazael king of Aram attacked Gath and captured it. Then he went to attack Jerusalem. 
2KI.12.18	Joash king of Judah took all the holy things given by his ancestors, the kings of Judah—Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah. He also took his own holy things as well as the gold that was found in the treasuries of the Temple of the L
2KI.12.19	Everything else Joash did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.12.20	His officers made plans against him and killed him at Beth Millo on the road down to Silla. 
2KI.12.21	The officers who killed him were Jozabad son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer. Joash was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, and Amaziah, his son, became king in his place.
2KI.13.1	Jehoahaz son of Jehu became king over Israel in Samaria during the twenty-third year Joash son of Ahaziah was king of Judah. Jehoahaz ruled seventeen years, 
2KI.13.2	and he did what the L
2KI.13.3	So the L
2KI.13.4	Then Jehoahaz begged the L
2KI.13.5	He gave Israel a man to save them, and they escaped from the Arameans. The Israelites then lived in their own homes as they had before, 
2KI.13.6	but they still did not stop doing the same sins that the family of Jeroboam had done. He had led Israel to sin, and they continued doing those sins. The Asherah idol also was left standing in Samaria.
2KI.13.7	Nothing was left of Jehoahaz’s army except fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers. The king of Aram had destroyed them and made them like chaff.
2KI.13.8	Everything else Jehoahaz did and all his victories are written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.13.9	Jehoahaz died and was buried in Samaria, and his son Jehoash became king in his place.
2KI.13.10	Jehoash son of Jehoahaz became king of Israel in Samaria during Joash’s thirty-seventh year as king of Judah. Jehoash ruled sixteen years, 
2KI.13.11	and he did what the L
2KI.13.12	Everything else he did and all his victories, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.13.13	Jehoash died, and Jeroboam took his place on the throne. Jehoash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
2KI.13.14	At this time Elisha became sick. Before he died, Jehoash king of Israel went to Elisha and cried for him. Jehoash said, “My father, my father! The chariots of Israel and their horsemen!”
2KI.13.15	Elisha said to Jehoash, “Take a bow and arrows.” So he took a bow and arrows. 
2KI.13.16	Then Elisha said to him, “Put your hand on the bow.” So Jehoash put his hand on the bow. Then Elisha put his hands on the king’s hands. 
2KI.13.17	Elisha said, “Open the east window.” So Jehoash opened the window. Then Elisha said, “Shoot,” and Jehoash shot. Elisha said, “The L
2KI.13.18	Elisha said, “Take the arrows.” So Jehoash took them. Then Elisha said to him, “Strike the ground.” So Jehoash struck the ground three times and stopped. 
2KI.13.19	The man of God was angry with him. “You should have struck five or six times!” Elisha said. “Then you would have struck Aram until you had completely destroyed it. But now you will defeat it only three times.”
2KI.13.20	Then Elisha died and was buried.
2KI.13.20	At that time groups of Moabites would rob the land in the springtime. 
2KI.13.21	Once as some Israelites were burying a man, suddenly they saw a group of Moabites coming. The Israelites threw the dead man into Elisha’s grave. When the man touched Elisha’s bones, the man came back to life and stood on his feet.
2KI.13.22	During all the days Jehoahaz was king, Hazael king of Aram troubled Israel. 
2KI.13.23	But the L
2KI.13.24	When Hazael king of Aram died, his son Ben-Hadad became king in his place. 
2KI.13.25	During a war Hazael had taken some cities from Jehoahaz, Jehoash’s father. Now Jehoash took back those cities from Hazael’s son Ben-Hadad. He defeated Ben-Hadad three times and took back the cities of Israel.
2KI.14.1	Amaziah son of Joash became king of Judah during the second year Jehoash son of Jehoahaz was king of Israel. 
2KI.14.2	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was named Jehoaddin, and she was from Jerusalem. 
2KI.14.3	Amaziah did what the L
2KI.14.4	The places where gods were worshiped were not removed, so the people still sacrificed and burned incense there.
2KI.14.5	As soon as Amaziah took control of the kingdom, he executed the officers who had murdered his father the king. 
2KI.14.6	But he did not put to death the children of the murderers because of the rule written in the Book of the Teachings of Moses. The L
2KI.14.7	In battle Amaziah killed ten thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. He also took the city of Sela. He called it Joktheel, as it is still called today.
2KI.14.8	Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel. They said, “Come, let’s meet face to face.”
2KI.14.9	Then Jehoash king of Israel answered Amaziah king of Judah, “A thornbush in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree in Lebanon. It said, ‘Let your daughter marry my son.’ But then a wild animal from Lebanon came by, walking on and crushing the thornbush. 
2KI.14.10	You have defeated Edom, but you have become proud. Stay at home and brag. Don’t ask for trouble, or you and Judah will be defeated.”
2KI.14.11	But Amaziah would not listen, so Jehoash king of Israel went to attack. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah. 
2KI.14.12	Israel defeated Judah, and every man of Judah ran away to his home. 
2KI.14.13	At Beth Shemesh Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah. (Amaziah was the son of Joash, who was the son of Ahaziah.) Jehoash went up to Jerusalem and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, which was about six hundred feet. 
2KI.14.14	He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils in the Temple of the L
2KI.14.15	The other acts of Jehoash and his victories, including his war against Amaziah king of Judah, are written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.14.16	Jehoash died and was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel, and his son Jeroboam became king in his place.
2KI.14.17	Amaziah son of Joash, the king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel. 
2KI.14.18	The other things Amaziah did are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.14.19	The people in Jerusalem made plans against him. So he ran away to the town of Lachish, but they sent men after him to Lachish and killed him. 
2KI.14.20	They brought his body back on horses, and he was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, in the city of David.
2KI.14.21	Then all the people of Judah made Uzziah king in place of his father Amaziah. Uzziah was sixteen years old. 
2KI.14.22	He rebuilt the town of Elath and made it part of Judah again after Amaziah died.
2KI.14.23	Jeroboam son of Jehoash became king of Israel in Samaria during the fifteenth year Amaziah was king of Judah. (Amaziah was the son of Joash.) Jeroboam ruled forty-one years, 
2KI.14.24	and he did what the L
2KI.14.25	Jeroboam won back Israel’s border from Lebo Hamath to the Dead Sea. This happened as the L

2KI.14.28	Everything else Jeroboam did is written down—all his victories and how he won back from Judah the towns of Damascus and Hamath for Israel. All this is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.14.29	Jeroboam died and was buried with his ancestors, the kings of Israel. Jeroboam’s son Zechariah became king in his place.
2KI.15.1	Uzziah son of Amaziah became king of Judah during Jeroboam’s twenty-seventh year as king of Israel. 
2KI.15.2	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he ruled fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother was named Jecoliah, and she was from Jerusalem. 
2KI.15.3	He did what the L
2KI.15.4	But the places where gods were worshiped were not removed, so the people still made sacrifices and burned incense there.
2KI.15.5	The L
2KI.15.6	All the other things Uzziah did are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.15.7	Uzziah died and was buried near his ancestors in Jerusalem, and his son Jotham became king in his place.
2KI.15.8	Zechariah son of Jeroboam was king over Israel in Samaria. He ruled for six months during Uzziah’s thirty-eighth year as king of Judah. 
2KI.15.9	Zechariah did what the L
2KI.15.10	Shallum son of Jabesh made plans against Zechariah and killed him in front of the people. Then Shallum became king in his place. 
2KI.15.11	The other acts of Zechariah are written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.12	The L
2KI.15.13	Shallum son of Jabesh became king during Uzziah’s thirty-ninth year as king of Judah. Shallum ruled for a month in Samaria. 
2KI.15.14	Then Menahem son of Gadi came up from Tirzah to Samaria and attacked Shallum son of Jabesh in Samaria. He killed him and became king in Shallum’s place.
2KI.15.15	The other acts of Shallum and his secret plans are written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.16	Menahem started out from Tirzah and attacked Tiphsah, destroying the city and the area nearby. This was because the people had refused to open the city gate for him. He defeated them and ripped open all their pregnant women.
2KI.15.17	Menahem son of Gadi became king over Israel during Uzziah’s thirty-ninth year as king of Judah. Menahem ruled ten years in Samaria, 
2KI.15.18	and he did what the L
2KI.15.19	Pul king of Assyria came to attack the land. Menahem gave him about seventy-four thousand pounds of silver so Pul would support him and make his hold on the kingdom stronger. 
2KI.15.20	Menahem taxed Israel to pay about one and one-fourth pounds of silver to each soldier of the king of Assyria. So the king left and did not stay in the land.
2KI.15.21	Everything else Menahem did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel. 
2KI.15.22	Then Menahem died, and his son Pekahiah became king in his place.
2KI.15.23	Pekahiah son of Menahem became king over Israel in Samaria during Uzziah’s fiftieth year as king of Judah. Pekahiah ruled two years, 
2KI.15.24	and he did what the L
2KI.15.25	Pekah son of Remaliah was one of Pekahiah’s captains, and he made plans against Pekahiah. He took fifty men of Gilead with him and killed Pekahiah, as well as Argob and Arieh, in the palace at Samaria. Then Pekah became king in Pekahiah’s place.
2KI.15.26	Everything else Pekahiah did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.27	Pekah son of Remaliah became king over Israel in Samaria during Uzziah’s fifty-second year as king of Judah. Pekah ruled twenty years, 
2KI.15.28	and he did what the L
2KI.15.29	Tiglath-Pileser was king of Assyria. He attacked while Pekah was king of Israel, capturing the cities of Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, and Hazor. He also captured Gilead and Galilee and all the land of Naphtali and carried the people away to Assyria. 
2KI.15.30	Then Hoshea son of Elah made plans against Pekah son of Remaliah and attacked and killed him. Then Hoshea became king in Pekah’s place during the twentieth year Jotham son of Uzziah was king.
2KI.15.31	Everything else Pekah did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Israel.
2KI.15.32	Jotham son of Uzziah became king of Judah during the second year Pekah son of Remaliah was king of Israel. 
2KI.15.33	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok. 
2KI.15.34	Jotham did what the L
2KI.15.35	But the places where gods were worshiped were not removed, and the people still made sacrifices and burned incense there. Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the Temple of the L
2KI.15.36	The other things Jotham did while he was king are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.15.37	At that time the L
2KI.15.38	Jotham died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, the city of David, his ancestor. Then Jotham’s son Ahaz became king in his place.
2KI.16.1	Ahaz was the son of Jotham king of Judah. Ahaz became king of Judah in the seventeenth year Pekah son of Remaliah was king of Israel. 
2KI.16.2	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem. Unlike his ancestor David, he did not do what the L
2KI.16.3	Ahaz did the same things the kings of Israel had done. He even made his son pass through fire. He did the same hateful sins as the nations had done whom the L
2KI.16.4	Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense at the places where gods were worshiped, on the hills, and under every green tree.
2KI.16.5	Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, came up to attack Jerusalem. They surrounded Ahaz but could not defeat him. 
2KI.16.6	At that time Rezin king of Aram took back the city of Elath for Aram, and he forced out all the people of Judah. Then Edomites moved into Elath, and they still live there today.
2KI.16.7	Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, saying, “I am your servant and your friend. Come and save me from the king of Aram and the king of Israel, who are attacking me.” 
2KI.16.8	Ahaz took the silver and gold that was in the Temple of the L
2KI.16.9	So the king of Assyria listened to Ahaz. He attacked Damascus and captured it and sent all its people away to Kir. And he killed Rezin.
2KI.16.10	Then King Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria. Ahaz saw an altar at Damascus, and he sent plans and a pattern of this altar to Uriah the priest. 
2KI.16.11	So Uriah the priest built an altar, just like the plans King Ahaz had sent him from Damascus. Uriah finished the altar before King Ahaz came back from Damascus. 
2KI.16.12	When the king arrived from Damascus, he saw the altar and went near and offered sacrifices on it. 
2KI.16.13	He burned his burnt offerings and grain offerings and poured out his drink offering. He also sprinkled the blood of his fellowship offerings on the altar.
2KI.16.14	Ahaz moved the bronze altar that was before the L
2KI.16.15	King Ahaz commanded Uriah the priest, “On the large altar burn the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, the king’s burnt offering and grain offering, and the whole burnt offering, the grain offering, and the drink offering for all the people of the land. Sprinkle on the altar all the blood of the burnt offering and of the sacrifice. But I will use the bronze altar to ask questions of God.” 
2KI.16.16	So Uriah the priest did everything as King Ahaz commanded him.
2KI.16.17	Then King Ahaz took off the side panels from the bases and removed the washing bowls from the top of the bases. He also took the large bowl, which was called the Sea, off the bronze bulls that held it up, and he put it on a stone base. 
2KI.16.18	Ahaz took away the platform for the royal throne, which had been built at the Temple of the L
2KI.16.19	The other things Ahaz did as king are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.16.20	Ahaz died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, and Ahaz’s son Hezekiah became king in his place.
2KI.17.1	Hoshea son of Elah became king over Israel during Ahaz’s twelfth year as king of Judah. Hoshea ruled in Samaria nine years. 
2KI.17.2	He did what the L
2KI.17.3	Shalmaneser king of Assyria came to attack Hoshea. Hoshea had been Shalmaneser’s servant and had made the payments to Shalmaneser that he had demanded. 
2KI.17.4	But the king of Assyria found out that Hoshea had made plans against him by sending messengers to So, the king of Egypt. Hoshea had also stopped giving Shalmaneser the payments, which he had paid every year in the past. For that, the king put Hoshea in prison. 
2KI.17.5	Then the king of Assyria came and attacked all the land of Israel. He surrounded Samaria and attacked it for three years. 
2KI.17.6	He defeated Samaria in the ninth year Hoshea was king, and he took the Israelites away to Assyria. He settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes.
2KI.17.7	All these things happened because the Israelites had sinned against the L
2KI.17.8	They lived like the nations the L
2KI.17.9	secretly sinning against the L
2KI.17.10	They put up stone pillars to gods and Asherah idols on every high hill and under every green tree. 
2KI.17.11	The Israelites burned incense everywhere gods were worshiped, just as the nations who lived there before them had done, whom the L
2KI.17.12	They served idols when the L
2KI.17.13	The L
2KI.17.14	But the people would not listen. They were stubborn, just as their ancestors had been who did not believe in the L

2KI.17.18	Because he was very angry with the people of Israel, he removed them from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah was left.
2KI.17.19	But even Judah did not obey the commands of the L
2KI.17.20	so the L
2KI.17.21	When the L
2KI.17.22	So they continued to do all the sins Jeroboam did. They did not stop doing these sins 
2KI.17.23	until the L
2KI.17.24	The king of Assyria brought people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and put them in the cities of Samaria to replace the Israelites. These people took over Samaria and lived in the cities. 
2KI.17.25	At first they did not worship the L
2KI.17.26	The king of Assyria was told, “You sent foreigners into the cities of Samaria who do not know the law of the god of the land. This is why he has sent lions among them. The lions are killing them because they don’t know what the god wants.”
2KI.17.27	Then the king of Assyria commanded, “Send back one of the priests you took away. Let him live there and teach the people what the god wants.” 
2KI.17.28	So one of the priests who had been carried away from Samaria returned to live in Bethel. And he taught the people how to honor the L
2KI.17.29	But each nation made gods of its own and put them in the cities where they lived and in the temples where gods were worshiped. These temples had been built by the Samaritans. 
2KI.17.30	The people from Babylon made Succoth Benoth their god. The people from Cuthah worshiped Nergal. The people of Hamath worshiped Ashima. 
2KI.17.31	The Avvites worshiped Nibhaz and Tartak. The Sepharvites burned their children in the fire, sacrificing them to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sepharvaim. 
2KI.17.32	They also honored the L
2KI.17.33	The people honored the L
2KI.17.34	Even today they do as they did in the past. They do not worship the L

2KI.17.38	Do not forget the agreement I made with you, and do not honor other gods. 
2KI.17.39	Instead worship the L

2KI.17.41	So these nations honored the L
2KI.18.1	Hezekiah son of Ahaz king of Judah became king during the third year Hoshea son of Elah was king of Israel. 
2KI.18.2	Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah. 
2KI.18.3	Hezekiah did what the L
2KI.18.4	He removed the places where gods were worshiped. He smashed the stone pillars and cut down the Asherah idols. Also the Israelites had been burning incense to Nehushtan, the bronze snake Moses had made. But Hezekiah broke it into pieces.
2KI.18.5	Hezekiah trusted in the L
2KI.18.6	Hezekiah was loyal to the L

2KI.18.8	Hezekiah defeated the Philistines all the way to Gaza and its borders, including the watchtowers and the strong, walled cities.
2KI.18.9	Shalmaneser king of Assyria surrounded Samaria and attacked it in the fourth year Hezekiah was king. This was the seventh year Hoshea son of Elah was king of Israel. 
2KI.18.10	After three years the Assyrians captured Samaria. This was in the sixth year Hezekiah was king, which was Hoshea’s ninth year as king of Israel. 
2KI.18.11	The king of Assyria took the Israelites away to Assyria and settled them in Halah, in Gozan on the Habor River, and in the cities of the Medes. 
2KI.18.12	This happened because they did not obey the L
2KI.18.13	During Hezekiah’s fourteenth year as king, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the strong, walled cities of Judah and captured them. 
2KI.18.14	Then Hezekiah king of Judah sent a message to the king of Assyria at Lachish. He said, “I have done wrong. Leave me alone, and I will pay anything you ask.” So the king of Assyria made Hezekiah pay about twenty-two thousand pounds of silver and two thousand pounds of gold. 
2KI.18.15	Hezekiah gave him all the silver that was in the Temple of the L
2KI.18.16	Hezekiah stripped all the gold that covered the doors and doorposts of the Temple of the L
2KI.18.17	The king of Assyria sent out his supreme commander, his chief officer, and his field commander. They went with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. When they came near the waterway from the upper pool on the road where people do their laundry, they stopped. 
2KI.18.18	They called for the king, so the king sent Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah out to meet them. Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager, Shebna was the royal secretary, and Joah son of Asaph was the recorder.
2KI.18.19	The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah this:
2KI.18.19	“ ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says: What can you trust in now? 
2KI.18.20	You say you have battle plans and power for war, but your words mean nothing. Whom are you trusting for help so that you turn against me? 
2KI.18.21	Look, you are depending on Egypt to help you, but Egypt is like a splintered walking stick. If you lean on it for help, it will stab your hand and hurt you. The king of Egypt will hurt all those who depend on him. 
2KI.18.22	You might say, “We are depending on the L
2KI.18.23	“ ‘Now make an agreement with my master, the king of Assyria: I will give you two thousand horses if you can find enough men to ride them. 
2KI.18.24	You cannot defeat one of my master’s least important officers, so why do you depend on Egypt to give you chariots and horsemen? 
2KI.18.25	I have not come to attack and destroy this place without an order from the L
2KI.18.26	Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to us in the Aramaic language. We understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew, because the people on the city wall can hear you.”
2KI.18.27	“No,” the commander said, “my master did not send me to tell these things only to you and your king. He sent me to speak also to those people sitting on the wall who will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine like you.”
2KI.18.28	Then the commander stood and shouted loudly in the Hebrew language, “Listen to what the great king, the king of Assyria, says! 
2KI.18.29	The king says you should not let Hezekiah fool you, because he can’t save you from my power. 
2KI.18.30	Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting the L
2KI.18.31	“Don’t listen to Hezekiah. The king of Assyria says, ‘Make peace with me, and come out of the city to me. Then everyone will be free to eat the fruit from his own grapevine and fig tree and to drink water from his own well. 
2KI.18.32	After that I will come and take you to a land like your own—a land with grain and new wine, bread and vineyards, olives, and honey. Choose to live and not to die!’
2KI.18.32	“Don’t listen to Hezekiah. He is fooling you when he says, ‘The L
2KI.18.33	Has a god of any other nation saved his people from the power of the king of Assyria? 
2KI.18.34	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? They did not save Samaria from my power. 
2KI.18.35	Not one of all the gods of these countries has saved his people from me. Neither can the L
2KI.18.36	The people were silent. They didn’t answer the commander at all, because King Hezekiah had ordered, “Don’t answer him.”
2KI.18.37	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah tore their clothes to show how upset they were. (Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager, Shebna was the royal secretary, and Joah son of Asaph was the recorder.) The three men went to Hezekiah and told him what the field commander had said.
2KI.19.1	When King Hezekiah heard the message, he tore his clothes and put on rough cloth to show how sad he was. Then he went into the Temple of the L
2KI.19.2	Hezekiah sent Eliakim, the palace manager, and Shebna, the royal secretary, and the older priests to Isaiah. They were all wearing rough cloth when they came to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 
2KI.19.3	They told Isaiah, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of sorrow and punishment and disgrace, as when a child should be born, but the mother is not strong enough to give birth to it. 
2KI.19.4	The king of Assyria sent his field commander to make fun of the living God. Maybe the L
2KI.19.5	When Hezekiah’s officers came to Isaiah, 
2KI.19.6	he said to them, “Tell your master this: The L

2KI.19.8	The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish. When he went back, he found the king fighting against the city of Libnah.
2KI.19.9	The king received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt, was coming to attack him. When the king of Assyria heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
2KI.19.10	“Tell Hezekiah king of Judah: Don’t be fooled by the god you trust. Don’t believe him when he says Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria. 
2KI.19.11	You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done. They have completely defeated every country, so do not think you will be saved. 
2KI.19.12	Did the gods of those people save them? My ancestors destroyed them, defeating the cities of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and the people of Eden living in Tel Assar. 
2KI.19.13	Where are the kings of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the kings of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”
2KI.19.14	When Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the Temple of the L
2KI.19.15	and prayed to the L
2KI.19.16	Hear, L
2KI.19.17	It is true, L
2KI.19.18	They have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire, but they were only wood and rock statues that people made. So the kings have destroyed them. 
2KI.19.19	Now, L
2KI.19.20	Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent a message to Hezekiah that said, “This is what the L

2KI.19.25	Long ago I, the L
2KI.19.25	Long ago I designed them,
2KI.19.25	and now I have made them happen.
2KI.19.25	I allowed you to turn those strong, walled cities
2KI.19.25	into piles of rocks.
2KI.19.26	The people in those cities were weak;
2KI.19.26	they were frightened and put to shame.
2KI.19.26	They were like grass in the field,
2KI.19.26	like tender, young grass,
2KI.19.26	like grass on the housetop
2KI.19.26	that is burned by the wind before it can grow.
2KI.19.27	“ ‘I know when you rest,
2KI.19.27	when you come and go,
2KI.19.27	and how you rage against me.
2KI.19.28	Because you rage against me,
2KI.19.28	and because I have heard your proud words,
2KI.19.28	I will put my hook in your nose
2KI.19.28	and my bit in your mouth.
2KI.19.28	Then I will force you to leave my country
2KI.19.28	the same way you came.’
2KI.19.29	“Then the L
2KI.19.29	This year you will eat the grain that grows wild,
2KI.19.29	and the second year you will eat what grows wild from that.
2KI.19.29	But in the third year, plant grain and harvest it.
2KI.19.29	Plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
2KI.19.30	Some of the people in the family of Judah
2KI.19.30	will escape.
2KI.19.30	Like plants that take root,
2KI.19.30	they will grow strong and have many children.
2KI.19.31	A few people will come out of Jerusalem alive;
2KI.19.31	a few from Mount Zion will live.
2KI.19.31	The strong love of the L
2KI.19.31	will make this happen.’
2KI.19.32	“So this is what the L
2KI.19.32	‘He will not enter this city
2KI.19.32	or even shoot an arrow here.
2KI.19.32	He will not fight against it with shields
2KI.19.32	or build a ramp to attack the city walls.
2KI.19.33	He will return to his country the same way he came,
2KI.19.33	and he will not enter this city,’
2KI.19.33	says the L
2KI.19.34	‘I will defend and save this city
2KI.19.34	for my sake and for the sake of David, my servant.’ ”
2KI.19.35	That night the angel of the L
2KI.19.36	So Sennacherib king of Assyria left and went back to Nineveh and stayed there.
2KI.19.37	One day as Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword. Then they escaped to the land of Ararat. So Sennacherib’s son Esarhaddon became king of Assyria.
2KI.20.1	At that time Hezekiah became so sick he almost died. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and told him, “This is what the L
2KI.20.2	Hezekiah turned toward the wall and prayed to the L
2KI.20.3	“L
2KI.20.4	Before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard, the L
2KI.20.5	“Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people: ‘This is what the L
2KI.20.6	I will add fifteen years to your life. I will save you and this city from the king of Assyria; I will protect the city for my sake and for the sake of my servant David.’ ”
2KI.20.7	Then Isaiah said, “Make a paste from figs.” So they made it and put it on Hezekiah’s boil, and he got well.
2KI.20.8	Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign that the L
2KI.20.9	Isaiah said, “The L
2KI.20.10	Hezekiah answered, “It’s easy for the shadow to go forward ten steps. Instead, let it go back ten steps.”
2KI.20.11	Then Isaiah the prophet called to the L
2KI.20.12	At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan was king of Babylon. He sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, because he had heard that Hezekiah was sick. 
2KI.20.13	Hezekiah listened to the messengers, so he showed them what was in his storehouses: the silver, gold, spices, expensive perfumes, his swords and shields, and all his wealth. He showed them everything in his palace and his kingdom.
2KI.20.14	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say? Where did they come from?”
2KI.20.14	Hezekiah said, “They came from a faraway country—from Babylon.”
2KI.20.15	So Isaiah asked him, “What did they see in your palace?”
2KI.20.15	Hezekiah said, “They saw everything in my palace. I showed them all my wealth.”
2KI.20.16	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the words of the L
2KI.20.17	‘In the future everything in your palace and everything your ancestors have stored up until this day will be taken away to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says the L
2KI.20.18	‘Some of your own children, those who will be born to you, will be taken away. And they will become servants in the palace of the king of Babylon.’ ”
2KI.20.19	Hezekiah told Isaiah, “These words from the L
2KI.20.20	Everything else Hezekiah did—all his victories, his work on the pool, his work on the tunnel to bring water into the city—is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.20.21	Then Hezekiah died, and his son Manasseh became king in his place.
2KI.21.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he was king fifty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hephzibah. 
2KI.21.2	He did what the L
2KI.21.3	Manasseh’s father, Hezekiah, had destroyed the places where gods were worshiped, but Manasseh rebuilt them. He built altars for Baal, and he made an Asherah idol as Ahab king of Israel had done. Manasseh also worshiped all the stars of the sky and served them. 
2KI.21.4	The L
2KI.21.5	He built altars to worship the stars in the two courtyards of the Temple of the L
2KI.21.6	He made his own son pass through fire. He practiced magic and told the future by explaining signs and dreams, and he got advice from mediums and fortune-tellers. He did many things the L
2KI.21.7	Manasseh carved an Asherah idol and put it in the Temple. The L
2KI.21.8	I will never again make the Israelites wander out of the land I gave their ancestors. But they must obey everything I have commanded them and all the teachings my servant Moses gave them.” 
2KI.21.9	But the people did not listen. Manasseh led them to do more evil than the nations the L
2KI.21.10	The L
2KI.21.11	“Manasseh king of Judah has done these hateful things. He has done more evil than the Amorites before him. He also has led Judah to sin with his idols. 
2KI.21.12	So this is what the L
2KI.21.13	I will stretch the measuring line of Samaria over Jerusalem, and the plumb line used against Ahab’s family will be used on Jerusalem. I will wipe out Jerusalem as a person wipes a dish and turns it upside down. 
2KI.21.14	I will throw away the rest of my people who are left. I will give them to their enemies, and they will be robbed by all their enemies, 
2KI.21.15	because my people did what I said was wrong. They have made me angry from the day their ancestors left Egypt until now.’ ”
2KI.21.16	Manasseh also killed many innocent people, filling Jerusalem from one end to the other with their blood. This was besides the sin he led Judah to do; he led Judah to do what the L
2KI.21.17	The other things Manasseh did as king, even the sin he did, are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.21.18	Manasseh died and was buried in the garden of his own palace, the garden of Uzza. Then Manasseh’s son Amon became king in his place.
2KI.21.19	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he was king for two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Meshullemeth daughter of Haruz, who was from Jotbah. 
2KI.21.20	Amon did what the L
2KI.21.21	He lived in the same way his father had lived: he worshiped the idols his father had worshiped, and he bowed down before them. 
2KI.21.22	Amon rejected the L
2KI.21.23	Amon’s officers made plans against him and killed him in his palace. 
2KI.21.24	Then the people of the land killed all those who had made plans to kill King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
2KI.21.25	Everything else Amon did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.21.26	He was buried in his grave in the garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah became king in his place.
2KI.22.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he ruled thirty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jedidah daughter of Adaiah, who was from Bozkath. 
2KI.22.2	Josiah did what the L
2KI.22.3	In Josiah’s eighteenth year as king, he sent Shaphan to the Temple of the L
2KI.22.4	“Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, and have him empty out the money the gatekeepers have gathered from the people. This is the money they have brought into the Temple of the L
2KI.22.5	Have him give the money to the supervisors of the work on the Temple of the L
2KI.22.6	the carpenters, builders, and bricklayers. Also use the money to buy timber and cut stone to repair the Temple. 
2KI.22.7	They do not need to report how they use the money given to them, because they are working honestly.”
2KI.22.8	Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the royal secretary, “I’ve found the Book of the Teachings in the Temple of the L
2KI.22.9	Then Shaphan the royal secretary went to the king and reported to Josiah, “Your officers have paid out the money that was in the Temple of the L
2KI.22.10	Then Shaphan the royal secretary told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from the book to the king.
2KI.22.11	When the king heard the words of the Book of the Teachings, he tore his clothes to show how upset he was. 
2KI.22.12	He gave orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the royal secretary, and Asaiah the king’s servant. These were the orders: 
2KI.22.13	“Go and ask the L
2KI.22.14	So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to talk to Huldah the prophetess. She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, who took care of the king’s clothes. Huldah lived in Jerusalem, in the new area of the city.
2KI.22.15	She said to them, “This is what the L
2KI.22.16	‘This is what the L
2KI.22.17	The people of Judah have left me and have burned incense to other gods. They have made me angry by all that they have done. My anger burns against this place like a fire, and it will not be put out.’ 
2KI.22.18	Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to ask the L
2KI.22.19	When you heard my words against this place and its people, you became sorry for what you had done and humbled yourself before me. I said they would be cursed and would be destroyed. You tore your clothes to show how upset you were, and you cried in my presence. This is why I have heard you, says the L
2KI.22.20	So I will let you die, and you will be buried in peace. You won’t see all the trouble I will bring to this place.’ ”
2KI.22.20	So they took her message back to the king.
2KI.23.1	Then the king gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem together. 
2KI.23.2	He went up to the Temple of the L
2KI.23.3	The king stood by the pillar and made an agreement in the presence of the L
2KI.23.4	The king commanded Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the next rank and the gatekeepers to bring out of the Temple of the L
2KI.23.5	The kings of Judah had chosen priests for these gods. These priests burned incense in the places where gods were worshiped in the cities of Judah and the towns around Jerusalem. They burned incense to Baal, the sun, the moon, the planets, and all the stars of the sky. But Josiah took those priests away. 
2KI.23.6	He removed the Asherah idol from the Temple of the L
2KI.23.7	He also tore down the houses of the male prostitutes who were in the Temple of the L
2KI.23.8	King Josiah brought all the false priests from the cities of Judah. He ruined the places where gods were worshiped, where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the places of worship at the entrance to the Gate of Joshua, the ruler of the city, on the left side of the city gate. 
2KI.23.9	The priests at the places where gods were worshiped were not allowed to serve at the L
2KI.23.10	Josiah ruined Topheth, in the Valley of Ben Hinnom, so no one could sacrifice his son or daughter to Molech. 
2KI.23.11	Judah’s kings had placed horses at the front door of the Temple of the L
2KI.23.12	The kings of Judah had built altars on the roof of the upstairs room of Ahaz. Josiah broke down these altars and the altars Manasseh had made in the two courtyards of the Temple of the L
2KI.23.13	King Josiah ruined the places where gods were worshiped east of Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Olives. Solomon king of Israel had built these places. One was for Ashtoreth, the hated goddess of the Sidonians. One was for Chemosh, the hated god of Moab. And one was for Molech, the hated god of the Ammonites. 
2KI.23.14	Josiah smashed to pieces the stone pillars they worshiped, and he cut down the Asherah idols. Then he covered the places with human bones.
2KI.23.15	Josiah also broke down the altar at Bethel—the place of worship made by Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had led Israel to sin. Josiah burned that place, broke the stones of the altar into pieces, then beat them into dust. He also burned the Asherah idol. 
2KI.23.16	When he turned around, he saw the graves on the mountain. He had the bones taken from the graves, and he burned them on the altar to ruin it. This happened as the L
2KI.23.17	Josiah asked, “What is that monument I see?”
2KI.23.17	The people of the city answered, “It’s the grave of the man of God who came from Judah. This prophet announced the things you have done against the altar of Bethel.”
2KI.23.18	Josiah said, “Leave the grave alone. No one may move this man’s bones.” So they left his bones and the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria.
2KI.23.19	The kings of Israel had built temples for worshiping gods in the cities of Samaria, which had caused the L
2KI.23.20	He killed all the priests of those places of worship; he killed them on the altars and burned human bones on the altars. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
2KI.23.21	The king commanded all the people, “Celebrate the Passover to the L
2KI.23.22	The Passover had not been celebrated like this since the judges led Israel. Nor had one like it happened while there were kings of Israel and kings of Judah. 
2KI.23.23	This Passover was celebrated to the L
2KI.23.24	Josiah destroyed the mediums, fortune-tellers, house gods, and idols. He also destroyed all the hated gods seen in the land of Judah and Jerusalem. This was to obey the words of the teachings written in the book Hilkiah the priest had found in the Temple of the L
2KI.23.25	There was no king like Josiah before or after him. He obeyed the L
2KI.23.26	Even so, the L
2KI.23.27	The L
2KI.23.28	Everything else Josiah did is written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah.
2KI.23.29	While Josiah was king, Neco king of Egypt went to help the king of Assyria at the Euphrates River. King Josiah marched out to fight against Neco, but at Megiddo, Neco faced him and killed him. 
2KI.23.30	Josiah’s servants carried his body in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own grave. Then the people of Judah chose Josiah’s son Jehoahaz and poured olive oil on him to make him king in his father’s place.
2KI.23.31	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he was king in Jerusalem for three months. His mother’s name was Hamutal, who was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 
2KI.23.32	Jehoahaz did what the L
2KI.23.33	King Neco took Jehoahaz prisoner at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that Jehoahaz could not rule in Jerusalem. Neco made the people of Judah pay about seventy-five hundred pounds of silver and about seventy-five pounds of gold.
2KI.23.34	King Neco made Josiah’s son Eliakim the king in place of Josiah his father. Then Neco changed Eliakim’s name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took Jehoahaz to Egypt, where he died. 
2KI.23.35	Jehoiakim gave King Neco the silver and gold he demanded. Jehoiakim taxed the land and took silver and gold from the people of the land to give to King Neco. Each person had to pay his share.
2KI.23.36	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was king in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother’s name was Zebidah daughter of Pedaiah, who was from Rumah. 
2KI.23.37	Jehoiakim did what the L
2KI.24.1	While Jehoiakim was king, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked the land of Judah. So Jehoiakim became Nebuchadnezzar’s servant for three years. Then he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and broke away from his rule. 
2KI.24.2	The L
2KI.24.3	The L
2KI.24.4	He had killed many innocent people and had filled Jerusalem with their blood. And the L
2KI.24.5	The other things that happened while Jehoiakim was king and all he did are written in the book of the history of the kings of Judah. 
2KI.24.6	Jehoiakim died, and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place.
2KI.24.7	The king of Egypt did not leave his land again, because the king of Babylon had captured all that belonged to the king of Egypt, from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
2KI.24.8	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he was king three months in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Nehushta daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem. 
2KI.24.9	Jehoiachin did what the L
2KI.24.10	At that time the officers of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up to Jerusalem. When they reached the city, they attacked it. 
2KI.24.11	Nebuchadnezzar himself came to the city while his officers were attacking it. 
2KI.24.12	Jehoiachin king of Judah surrendered to the king of Babylon, along with Jehoiachin’s mother, servants, nobles, and officers. So Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiachin a prisoner in the eighth year he was king of Babylon. 
2KI.24.13	Nebuchadnezzar took all the treasures from the Temple of the L
2KI.24.14	Nebuchadnezzar took away all the people of Jerusalem, including all the leaders, all the wealthy people, and all the craftsmen and metal workers. There were ten thousand prisoners in all. Only the poorest people in the land were left. 
2KI.24.15	Nebuchadnezzar carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, as well as the king’s mother and his wives, the officers, and the leading men of the land. They were taken captive from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
2KI.24.16	The king of Babylon also took all seven thousand soldiers, who were strong and able to fight in war, and about a thousand craftsmen and metal workers. Nebuchadnezzar took them as prisoners to Babylon. 
2KI.24.17	Then he made Mattaniah, Jehoiachin’s uncle, king in Jehoiachin’s place. He also changed Mattaniah’s name to Zedekiah.
2KI.24.18	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he was king in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 
2KI.24.19	Zedekiah did what the L
2KI.24.20	All this happened in Jerusalem and Judah because the L
2KI.24.20	Zedekiah turned against the king of Babylon.
2KI.25.1	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army during Zedekiah’s ninth year as king, on the tenth day of the tenth month. He made a camp around the city and piled dirt against the city walls to attack it. 
2KI.25.2	The city was under attack until Zedekiah’s eleventh year as king. 
2KI.25.3	By the ninth day of the fourth month, the hunger was terrible in the city. There was no food for the people to eat. 
2KI.25.4	Then the city was broken into, and the whole army ran away at night through the gate between the two walls by the king’s garden. While the Babylonians were still surrounding the city, Zedekiah and his men ran away toward the Jordan Valley. 
2KI.25.5	But the Babylonian army chased King Zedekiah and caught up with him in the plains of Jericho. All of his army was scattered from him, 
2KI.25.6	so they captured Zedekiah and took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah. There he passed sentence on Zedekiah. 
2KI.25.7	They killed Zedekiah’s sons as he watched. Then they put out his eyes and put bronze chains on him and took him to Babylon.
2KI.25.8	Nebuzaradan was the commander of the king’s special guards. This officer of the king of Babylon came to Jerusalem on the seventh day of the fifth month, in Nebuchadnezzar’s nineteenth year as king of Babylon. 
2KI.25.9	Nebuzaradan set fire to the Temple of the L
2KI.25.10	The whole Babylonian army, led by the commander of the king’s special guards, broke down the walls around Jerusalem. 
2KI.25.11	Nebuzaradan, the commander of the guards, captured the people left in Jerusalem, those who had surrendered to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the people. 
2KI.25.12	But the commander left behind some of the poorest people of the land to take care of the vineyards and fields.
2KI.25.13	The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars, the bronze stands, and the large bronze bowl, which was called the Sea, in the Temple of the L
2KI.25.14	They also took the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, dishes, and all the bronze objects used to serve in the Temple. 
2KI.25.15	The commander of the king’s special guards took away the pans for carrying hot coals, the bowls, and everything made of pure gold or silver. 
2KI.25.16	There were two pillars and the large bronze bowl and the movable stands which Solomon had made for the Temple of the L
2KI.25.17	Each pillar was about twenty-seven feet high. The bronze capital on top of the pillar was about four and one-half feet high. It was decorated with a net design and bronze pomegranates all around it. The other pillar also had a net design and was like the first pillar.
2KI.25.18	The commander of the guards took some prisoners—Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three doorkeepers. 
2KI.25.19	Of the people who were still in the city, he took the officer in charge of the fighting men, as well as five people who advised the king. He took the royal secretary who selected people for the army and sixty other men who were in the city. 
2KI.25.20	Nebuzaradan, the commander, took all these people and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
2KI.25.21	There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them killed. So the people of Judah were led away from their country as captives.
2KI.25.22	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon left some people in the land of Judah. He appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, as governor.
2KI.25.23	The army captains and their men heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor, so they came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. They were Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite, and their men. 
2KI.25.24	Then Gedaliah promised these army captains and their men, “Don’t be afraid of the Babylonian officers. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and everything will go well for you.”
2KI.25.25	In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah, son of Elishama from the king’s family, came with ten men and killed Gedaliah. They also killed the men of Judah and Babylon who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
2KI.25.26	Then all the people, from the least important to the most important, along with the army leaders, ran away to Egypt, because they were afraid of the Babylonians.
2KI.25.27	Jehoiachin king of Judah was held in Babylon for thirty-seven years. In the thirty-seventh year Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon, and he let Jehoiachin out of prison on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month. 
2KI.25.28	Evil-Merodach spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a seat of honor above the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
2KI.25.29	So Jehoiachin put away his prison clothes. For the rest of his life, he ate at the king’s table. 
2KI.25.30	Every day, for as long as Jehoiachin lived, the king gave him an allowance.

1CH.5.19	They started a war against the Hagrites and the people of Jetur, Naphish, and Nodab. 
1CH.5.20	The men from the tribes of Manasseh, Reuben, and Gad prayed to God during the war, asking him to help them. So he helped them because they trusted him. He handed over to them the Hagrites and all those who were with them. 
1CH.5.21	They took the animals that belonged to the Hagrites: fifty thousand camels, two hundred fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand donkeys. They also captured one hundred thousand people. 
1CH.5.22	Many Hagrites were killed because God helped the people of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh. Then they lived there until Babylon captured them and took them away.
1CH.5.23	There were many people in East Manasseh, and they lived in the area of Bashan all the way to Baal Hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon.
1CH.5.24	These were the family leaders: Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel. They were all strong, brave, and famous men, and leaders in their families. 
1CH.5.25	But they sinned against the God that their ancestors had worshiped. They began worshiping the gods of the people in that land, and those were the people God was destroying. 
1CH.5.26	So the God of Israel made Pul king of Assyria want to go to war. (Pul was also called Tiglath-Pileser.) He captured the people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh, and he took them away to Halah, Habor, Hara, and near the Gozan River. They have lived there from that time until this day.

1CH.11.2	Even when Saul was king, you were the one who led Israel in battle. The L
1CH.11.3	So all the elders of Israel came to King David at Hebron. He made an agreement with them in Hebron in the presence of the L
1CH.11.4	David and all the Israelites went to the city of Jerusalem. At that time Jerusalem was called Jebus, and the people living there were named Jebusites. 
1CH.11.5	They said to David, “You can’t get inside our city.” But David did take the city of Jerusalem with its strong walls, and it became the City of David.
1CH.11.6	David had said, “The person who leads the attack against the Jebusites will become the commander over all my army.” Joab son of Zeruiah led the attack, so he became the commander of the army.
1CH.11.7	Then David made his home in the strong, walled city, which is why it was named the City of David. 
1CH.11.8	David rebuilt the city, beginning where the land was filled in and going to the wall that was around the city. Joab repaired the other parts of the city. 
1CH.11.9	David became stronger and stronger, and the L
1CH.11.10	This is a list of the leaders over David’s warriors who helped make David’s kingdom strong. All the people of Israel also supported David’s kingdom. These heroes and all the people of Israel made David king, just as the L
1CH.11.11	This is a list of David’s warriors:
1CH.11.11	Jashobeam was from the Hacmonite people. He was the head of the Three, David’s most powerful soldiers. He used his spear to fight three hundred men at one time, and he killed them all.
1CH.11.12	Next was Eleazar, one of the Three. Eleazar was Dodai’s son from the Ahohite people. 
1CH.11.13	Eleazar was with David at Pas Dammim when the Philistines came there to fight. There was a field of barley at that place. The Israelites ran away from the Philistines, 
1CH.11.14	but they stopped in the middle of that field and fought for it and killed the Philistines. The L
1CH.11.15	Once, three of the Thirty, David’s chief soldiers, came down to him at the rock by the cave near Adullam. At the same time the Philistine army had camped in the Valley of Rephaim.
1CH.11.16	At that time David was in a stronghold, and some of the Philistines were in Bethlehem. 
1CH.11.17	David had a strong desire for some water. He said, “Oh, I wish someone would get me water from the well near the city gate of Bethlehem!” 
1CH.11.18	So the Three broke through the Philistine army and took water from the well near the city gate in Bethlehem. Then they brought it to David, but he refused to drink it. He poured it out before the L
1CH.11.19	saying, “May God keep me from drinking this water! It would be like drinking the blood of the men who risked their lives to bring it to me!” So David refused to drink it.
1CH.11.19	These were the brave things that the three warriors did.
1CH.11.20	Abishai brother of Joab was the captain of the Three. Abishai fought three hundred soldiers with his spear and killed them. He became as famous as the Three 
1CH.11.21	and was more honored than the Three. He became their commander even though he was not one of them.
1CH.11.22	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was a brave fighter from Kabzeel who did mighty things. He killed two of the best warriors from Moab. He also went down into a pit and killed a lion on a snowy day. 
1CH.11.23	Benaiah killed an Egyptian who was about seven and one-half feet tall and had a spear as large as a weaver’s rod. Benaiah had a club, but he grabbed the spear from the Egyptian’s hand and killed him with his own spear. 
1CH.11.24	These were the things Benaiah son of Jehoiada did. He was as famous as the Three. 
1CH.11.25	He received more honor than the Thirty, but he did not become a member of the Three. David made him leader of his bodyguards.

1CH.11.47	Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaites.
1CH.12.1	These were the men who came to David at Ziklag when David was hiding from Saul son of Kish. They were among the warriors who helped David in battle. 
1CH.12.2	They came with bows for weapons and could use either their right or left hands to shoot arrows or to sling rocks. They were Saul’s relatives from the tribe of Benjamin. 
1CH.12.3	Ahiezer was their leader, and there was Joash. (Ahiezer and Joash were sons of Shemaah, who was from the town of Gibeah.) There were also Jeziel and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth. There were Beracah and Jehu from the town of Anathoth. 
1CH.12.4	And there was Ishmaiah from the town of Gibeon; he was one of the Thirty. In fact, he was the leader of the Thirty. There were Jeremiah, Jahaziel, Johanan, and Jozabad from Gederah. 
1CH.12.5	There were Eluzai, Jerimoth, Bealiah, and Shemariah. There was Shephatiah from Haruph. 
1CH.12.6	There were Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, and Jashobeam from the family group of Korah. 
1CH.12.7	And there were Joelah and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham, from the town of Gedor.
1CH.12.8	Part of the people of Gad joined David at his stronghold in the desert. They were brave warriors trained for war and skilled with shields and spears. They were as fierce as lions and as fast as gazelles over the hills.
1CH.12.9	Ezer was the leader of Gad’s army, and Obadiah was second in command. Eliab was third, 
1CH.12.10	Mishmannah was fourth, Jeremiah was fifth, 
1CH.12.11	Attai was sixth, Eliel was seventh, 
1CH.12.12	Johanan was eighth, Elzabad was ninth, 
1CH.12.13	Jeremiah was tenth, and Macbannai was eleventh in command.
1CH.12.14	They were the commanders of the army from Gad. The least of these leaders was in charge of a hundred soldiers, and the greatest was in charge of a thousand. 
1CH.12.15	They crossed the Jordan River and chased away the people living in the valleys, to the east and to the west. This happened in the first month of the year when the Jordan floods the valley.
1CH.12.16	Other people from the tribes of Benjamin and Judah also came to David at his stronghold. 
1CH.12.17	David went out to meet them and said to them, “If you have come peacefully to help me, I welcome you. Join me. But if you have come to turn me over to my enemies, even though I have done nothing wrong, the God of our ancestors will see this and punish you.”
1CH.12.18	Then the Spirit entered Amasai, the leader of the Thirty, and he said:
1CH.12.18	“We belong to you, David.
1CH.12.18	We are with you, son of Jesse.
1CH.12.18	Success, success to you.
1CH.12.18	Success to those who help you,
1CH.12.18	because your God helps you.”
1CH.12.18	So David welcomed these men and made them leaders of his army.
1CH.12.19	Some of the men from Manasseh also joined David when he went with the Philistines to fight Saul. But David and his men did not really help the Philistines. After talking about it, the Philistine leaders decided to send David away. They said, “If David goes back to his master Saul, we will be killed.” 
1CH.12.20	These are the men from Manasseh who joined David when he went to Ziklag: Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each of them was a leader of a thousand men from Manasseh. 
1CH.12.21	All these men of Manasseh were brave soldiers, and they helped David fight against groups of men who went around the country robbing people. These soldiers became commanders in David’s army. 
1CH.12.22	Every day more men joined David, and his army became large, like the army of God.
1CH.12.23	These are the numbers of the soldiers ready for battle who joined David at Hebron. They came to help turn the kingdom of Saul over to David, just as the L
1CH.12.24	There were sixty-eight hundred men with their weapons from Judah. They carried shields and spears.
1CH.12.25	There were seventy-one hundred men from Simeon. They were warriors ready for war.
1CH.12.26	There were forty-six hundred men from Levi. 
1CH.12.27	Jehoiada, a leader from Aaron’s family, was in that group. There were thirty-seven hundred with him. 
1CH.12.28	Zadok was also in that group. He was a strong young warrior, and with him came twenty-two leaders from his family.
1CH.12.29	There were three thousand men from Benjamin, who were Saul’s relatives. Most of them had remained loyal to Saul’s family until then.
1CH.12.30	There were twenty thousand eight hundred men from Ephraim. They were brave warriors and were famous men in their own family groups.
1CH.12.31	There were eighteen thousand men from West Manasseh. Each one was especially chosen to make David king.
1CH.12.32	There were two hundred leaders from Issachar. They knew what Israel should do, and they knew the right time to do it. Their relatives were with them and under their command.
1CH.12.33	There were fifty thousand men from Zebulun. They were trained soldiers and knew how to use every kind of weapon of war. They followed David completely.
1CH.12.34	There were one thousand officers from Naphtali. They had thirty-seven thousand soldiers with them who carried shields and spears.
1CH.12.35	There were twenty-eight thousand six hundred men from Dan, who were ready for war.
1CH.12.36	There were forty thousand trained soldiers from Asher, who were ready for war.
1CH.12.37	There were one hundred twenty thousand soldiers from the east side of the Jordan River from the people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh. They had every kind of weapon.
1CH.12.38	All these fighting men were ready to go to war. They came to Hebron fully agreed to make David king of all Israel. All the other Israelites also agreed to make David king. 
1CH.12.39	They spent three days there with David, eating and drinking, because their relatives had prepared food for them. 
1CH.12.40	Also, their neighbors came from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, bringing food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. They brought much flour, fig cakes, raisins, wine, oil, cows, and sheep, because the people of Israel were very happy.
1CH.13.1	David talked with all the officers of his army, the commanders of a hundred men and the commanders of a thousand men. 
1CH.13.2	Then David called the people of Israel together and said, “If you think it is a good idea, and if it is what the L
1CH.13.3	Let’s bring the Ark of our God back to us. We did not use it to ask God for help while Saul was king.” 
1CH.13.4	All the people agreed with David, because they all thought it was the right thing to do.
1CH.13.5	So David gathered all the Israelites, from the Shihor River in Egypt to Lebo Hamath, to bring the Ark of God back from the town of Kiriath Jearim. 
1CH.13.6	David and all the Israelites with him went to Baalah of Judah, which is Kiriath Jearim, to get the Ark of God the L
1CH.13.7	The people carried the Ark of God from Abinadab’s house on a new cart, and Uzzah and Ahio guided it. 
1CH.13.8	David and all the Israelites were celebrating in the presence of God. With all their strength they were singing and playing lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
1CH.13.9	When David’s men came to the threshing floor of Kidon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the Ark. 
1CH.13.10	The L
1CH.13.11	David was angry because the L
1CH.13.12	David was afraid of God that day and asked, “How can I bring the Ark of God home to me?” 
1CH.13.13	So David did not take the Ark with him to Jerusalem. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-Edom who was from Gath. 
1CH.13.14	The Ark of God stayed with Obed-Edom’s family in his house for three months, and the L
1CH.14.1	Hiram king of the city of Tyre sent messengers to David. He also sent cedar logs, bricklayers, and carpenters to build a palace for David. 
1CH.14.2	Then David knew that the L
1CH.14.3	David married more women in Jerusalem and had more sons and daughters. 
1CH.14.4	These are the names of David’s children born in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
1CH.14.5	Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
1CH.14.6	Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
1CH.14.7	Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.
1CH.14.8	When the Philistines heard that David had been made king of all Israel, they went to look for him. But David heard about it and went out to fight them. 
1CH.14.9	The Philistines had attacked and robbed the people in the Valley of Rephaim. 
1CH.14.10	David asked God, “Should I go and attack the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?”
1CH.14.10	The L
1CH.14.11	So David and his men went up to the town of Baal Perazim and defeated the Philistines. David said, “Like a flood of water, God has broken through my enemies by using me.” So that place was named Baal Perazim. 
1CH.14.12	The Philistines had left their idols there, so David ordered his men to burn them.
1CH.14.13	Soon the Philistines attacked the people in the valley again. 
1CH.14.14	David prayed to God again, and God answered him, saying, “Don’t attack the Philistines from the front. Instead, go around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees. 
1CH.14.15	When you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then attack. I, God, will have gone out before you to defeat the Philistine army.” 
1CH.14.16	David did as God commanded, and he and his men defeated the Philistine army all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
1CH.14.17	So David became famous in all the countries, and the L
1CH.15.1	David built houses for himself in Jerusalem. Then he prepared a place for the Ark of God, and he set up a tent for it. 
1CH.15.2	David said, “Only the Levites may carry the Ark of God. The L
1CH.15.3	David called all the people of Israel to come to Jerusalem. He wanted to bring the Ark of the L
1CH.15.4	David called together the descendants of Aaron and the Levites. 
1CH.15.5	There were one hundred twenty people from Kohath’s family group, with Uriel as their leader. 
1CH.15.6	There were two hundred twenty people from Merari’s family group, with Asaiah as their leader. 
1CH.15.7	There were one hundred thirty people from Gershon’s family group, with Joel as their leader. 
1CH.15.8	There were two hundred people from Elizaphan’s family group, with Shemaiah as their leader. 
1CH.15.9	There were eighty people from Hebron’s family group, with Eliel as their leader. 
1CH.15.10	And there were one hundred twelve people from Uzziel’s family group, with Amminadab as their leader.
1CH.15.11	Then David asked the priests Zadok and Abiathar and these Levites to come to him: Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab. 
1CH.15.12	David said to them, “You are the leaders of the families of Levi. You and the other Levites must give yourselves for service to the L
1CH.15.13	The last time we did not ask the L
1CH.15.14	Then the priests and Levites prepared themselves for service to the L
1CH.15.15	The Levites used special poles to carry the Ark of God on their shoulders, as Moses had commanded, just as the L
1CH.15.16	David told the leaders of the Levites to appoint their brothers as singers to play their lyres, harps, and cymbals and to sing happy songs.
1CH.15.17	So the Levites appointed Heman and his relatives Asaph and Ethan. Heman was Joel’s son. Asaph was Berekiah’s son. And Ethan, from the Merari family group, was Kushaiah’s son. 
1CH.15.18	There was also a second group of Levites: Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They were the Levite guards.
1CH.15.19	The singers Heman, Asaph, and Ethan played bronze cymbals. 
1CH.15.20	Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played the lyres. 
1CH.15.21	Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-Edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah played the harps. 
1CH.15.22	The Levite leader Kenaniah was in charge of the singing, because he was very good at it.
1CH.15.23	Berekiah and Elkanah were two of the guards for the Ark of the Agreement. 
1CH.15.24	The priests Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer had the job of blowing trumpets in front of the Ark of God. Obed-Edom and Jehiah were also guards for the Ark.
1CH.15.25	David, the leaders of Israel, and the commanders of a thousand soldiers went to get the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1CH.15.26	Because God helped the Levites who carried the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1CH.15.27	All the Levites who carried the Ark, and Kenaniah, the man in charge of the singing, and all the singers wore robes of fine linen. David also wore a robe of fine linen and a holy vest of fine linen. 
1CH.15.28	So all the people of Israel brought up the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1CH.15.29	As the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1CH.16.1	They brought the Ark of God and put it inside the tent that David had set up for it. Then they offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to God. 
1CH.16.2	When David had finished giving the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the L
1CH.16.3	He gave a loaf of bread, some dates, and raisins to every Israelite man and woman.
1CH.16.4	Then David appointed some of the Levites to serve before the Ark of the L
1CH.16.5	Asaph, who played the cymbals, was the leader. Zechariah was second to him. The other Levites were Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-Edom, and Jeiel. They played the lyres and harps. 
1CH.16.6	Benaiah and Jahaziel were priests who blew the trumpets regularly before the Ark of the Agreement with God. 
1CH.16.7	That day David first gave Asaph and his relatives the job of singing praises to the L
1CH.16.8	Give thanks to the L
1CH.16.8	Tell the nations what he has done.
1CH.16.9	Sing to him; sing praises to him.
1CH.16.9	Tell about all his miracles.
1CH.16.10	Be glad that you are his;
1CH.16.10	let those who seek the L
1CH.16.11	Depend on the L
1CH.16.11	always go to him for help.
1CH.16.12	Remember the miracles he has done,
1CH.16.12	his wonders, and his decisions.
1CH.16.13	You are the descendants of his servant, Israel;
1CH.16.13	you are the children of Jacob, his chosen people.
1CH.16.14	He is the L
1CH.16.14	His laws are for all the world.
1CH.16.15	He will keep his agreement forever;
1CH.16.15	he will keep his promises always.
1CH.16.16	He will keep the agreement he made with Abraham
1CH.16.16	and the promise he made to Isaac.
1CH.16.17	He made it a law for the people of Jacob;
1CH.16.17	he made it an agreement with Israel to last forever.
1CH.16.18	He said, “I will give the land of Canaan to you,
1CH.16.18	to belong to you.”
1CH.16.19	Then God’s people were few in number,
1CH.16.19	and they were strangers in the land.
1CH.16.20	They went from one nation to another,
1CH.16.20	from one kingdom to another.
1CH.16.21	But he did not let anyone hurt them;
1CH.16.21	he warned kings not to harm them.
1CH.16.22	He said, “Don’t touch my chosen people,
1CH.16.22	and don’t harm my prophets.”
1CH.16.23	Sing to the L
1CH.16.23	Every day tell how he saves us.
1CH.16.24	Tell the nations about his glory;
1CH.16.24	tell all peoples the miracles he does.
1CH.16.25	The L
1CH.16.25	He should be respected more than all the gods.
1CH.16.26	All the gods of the nations are only idols,
1CH.16.26	but the L
1CH.16.27	He has glory and majesty;
1CH.16.27	he has power and joy in his Temple.

1CH.16.31	Let people everywhere say, “The L
1CH.16.32	Let the sea and everything in it shout;
1CH.16.32	let the fields and everything in them rejoice.
1CH.16.33	Then the trees of the forest will sing
1CH.16.33	for joy before the L
1CH.16.33	They will sing because he is coming to judge the world.
1CH.16.34	Thank the L
1CH.16.34	His love continues forever.
1CH.16.35	Say to him, “Save us, God our Savior,
1CH.16.35	and bring us back and save us from other nations.
1CH.16.35	Then we will thank you
1CH.16.35	and will gladly praise you.”
1CH.16.36	Praise the L
1CH.16.36	He always was and always will be.
1CH.16.36	All the people said “Amen” and praised the L
1CH.16.37	Then David left Asaph and the other Levites there in front of the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1CH.16.38	David also left Obed-Edom and sixty-eight other Levites to serve with them. Hosah and Obed-Edom son of Jeduthun were guards.
1CH.16.39	David left Zadok the priest and the other priests who served with him in front of the Tent of the L
1CH.16.40	Every morning and evening they offered burnt offerings on the altar of burnt offerings, following the rules written in the Teachings of the L
1CH.16.41	With them were Heman and Jeduthun and other Levites. They were chosen by name to sing praises to the L
1CH.16.42	Heman and Jeduthun also had the job of playing the trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments when songs were sung to God. Jeduthun’s sons guarded the gates.
1CH.16.43	Then all the people left. Each person went home, and David also went home to bless the people in his home.
1CH.17.1	When David moved into his palace, he said to Nathan the prophet, “Look, I am living in a palace made of cedar, but the Ark of the Agreement with the L
1CH.17.2	Nathan said to David, “Do what you want to do, because God is with you.”
1CH.17.3	But that night God spoke his word to Nathan, saying, 
1CH.17.4	“Go and tell David my servant, ‘This is what the L
1CH.17.5	From the time I brought Israel out of Egypt until now I have not lived in a house. I have moved from one tent site to another and from one place to another. 
1CH.17.6	As I have moved with the Israelites to different places, I have never said to the leaders, whom I commanded to take care of my people, “Why haven’t you built me a house of cedar?” ’
1CH.17.7	“Now, tell my servant David: ‘This is what the L
1CH.17.8	I have been with you everywhere you have gone. I have defeated your enemies for you. I will make you as famous as any of the great people on the earth. 
1CH.17.9	I will choose a place for my people Israel, and I will plant them so they can live in their own homes. They will not be bothered anymore. Wicked people will no longer hurt them as they have in the past 
1CH.17.10	when I chose judges for my people Israel. I will defeat all your enemies.
1CH.17.10	“ ‘I tell you that the L
1CH.17.11	When you die and join your ancestors, I will make one of your sons the new king, and I will set up his kingdom. 
1CH.17.12	He will build a house for me, and I will let his kingdom rule always. 
1CH.17.13	I will be his father, and he will be my son. I took away my love from Saul, who ruled before you, but I will never stop loving your son. 
1CH.17.14	I will put him in charge of my house and kingdom forever. His family will rule forever.’ ”
1CH.17.15	Nathan told David everything God had said in this vision.
1CH.17.16	Then King David went in and sat in front of the L
1CH.17.17	But that was not enough for you, God. You have also made promises about my future family. L
1CH.17.18	“What more can I say to you for honoring me, your servant? You know me so well. 
1CH.17.19	L
1CH.17.20	“There is no one like you, L
1CH.17.21	There is no nation like your people Israel. They are the only people on earth that God chose to be his own. You made your name well known by the great and wonderful things you did for them. You went ahead of them and forced other nations out of the land. You freed your people from slavery in Egypt. 
1CH.17.22	You made the people of Israel your very own people forever, and, L
1CH.17.23	“L
1CH.17.24	Then you will be honored always, and people will say, ‘The L

1CH.17.26	L
1CH.17.27	You have chosen to bless my family. Let it continue before you always. L
1CH.18.1	Later, David defeated the Philistines, conquered them, and took the city of Gath and the small towns around it.
1CH.18.2	He also defeated the people of Moab. So the people of Moab became servants of David and gave him the payment he demanded.
1CH.18.3	David also defeated Hadadezer king of Zobah all the way to the town of Hamath as he tried to spread his kingdom to the Euphrates River. 
1CH.18.4	David captured one thousand of his chariots, seven thousand men who rode in chariots, and twenty thousand foot soldiers. He crippled all but a hundred of the chariot horses.
1CH.18.5	Arameans from Damascus came to help Hadadezer king of Zobah, but David killed twenty-two thousand of them. 
1CH.18.6	Then David put groups of soldiers in Damascus in Aram. The Arameans became David’s servants and gave him the payments he demanded. So the L
1CH.18.7	David took the shields of gold that had belonged to Hadadezer’s officers and brought them to Jerusalem. 
1CH.18.8	David also took many things made of bronze from Tebah and Cun, which had been cities under Hadadezer’s control. Later, Solomon used this bronze to make things for the Temple: the large bronze bowl, which was called the Sea, the pillars, and other bronze utensils.
1CH.18.9	Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer king of Zobah. 
1CH.18.10	So Toi sent his son Hadoram to greet and congratulate King David for defeating Hadadezer. (Hadadezer had been at war with Toi.) Hadoram brought items made of gold, silver, and bronze. 
1CH.18.11	King David gave them to the L
1CH.18.12	Abishai son of Zeruiah killed eighteen thousand Edomites in the Valley of Salt. 
1CH.18.13	David put groups of soldiers in Edom, and all the Edomites became his servants. The L
1CH.18.14	David was king over all of Israel, and he did what was fair and right for all his people. 
1CH.18.15	Joab son of Zeruiah was commander over the army. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the recorder. 
1CH.18.16	Zadok son of Ahitub and Abiathar son of Ahimelech were priests. Shavsha was the royal secretary. 
1CH.18.17	Benaiah son of Jehoiada was over the Kerethites and Pelethites. And David’s sons were important officers who served at his side.
1CH.19.1	When Nahash king of the Ammonites died, his son became king after him. 
1CH.19.2	David said, “Nahash was loyal to me, so I will be loyal to his son Hanun.” So David sent messengers to comfort Hanun about his father’s death.
1CH.19.2	David’s officers went to the land of the Ammonites to comfort Hanun. 
1CH.19.3	But the Ammonite leaders said to Hanun, “Do you think David wants to honor your father by sending men to comfort you? No! David sent them to study the land and capture it and spy it out.” 
1CH.19.4	So Hanun arrested David’s officers. To shame them he shaved their beards and cut off their clothes at the hips. Then he sent them away.
1CH.19.5	When the people told David what had happened to his officers, he sent messengers to meet them, because they were very ashamed. King David said, “Stay in Jericho until your beards have grown back. Then come home.”
1CH.19.6	The Ammonites knew that they had insulted David. So Hanun and the Ammonites sent about seventy-four thousand pounds of silver to hire chariots and chariot drivers from Northwest Mesopotamia, Aram Maacah, and Zobah. 
1CH.19.7	The Ammonites hired thirty-two thousand chariots and the king of Maacah and his army. So they came and set up camp near the town of Medeba. The Ammonites themselves came out of their towns and got ready for battle.
1CH.19.8	When David heard about this, he sent Joab with the whole army. 
1CH.19.9	The Ammonites came out and prepared for battle at the city gate. The kings who had come to help were out in the field by themselves.
1CH.19.10	Joab saw that there were enemies both in front of him and behind him. So he chose some of the best soldiers of Israel and sent them out to fight the Arameans. 
1CH.19.11	Joab put the rest of the army under the command of Abishai, his brother. Then they went out to fight the Ammonites. 
1CH.19.12	Joab said to Abishai, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, you must help me. Or, if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will help you. 
1CH.19.13	Be strong. We must fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. The L
1CH.19.14	Then Joab and the army with him went to attack the Arameans, and the Arameans ran away. 
1CH.19.15	When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans were running away, they also ran away from Joab’s brother Abishai and went back to their city. So Joab went back to Jerusalem.
1CH.19.16	When the Arameans saw that Israel had defeated them, they sent messengers to bring other Arameans from east of the Euphrates River. Their leader was Shophach, the commander of Hadadezer’s army.
1CH.19.17	When David heard about this, he gathered all the Israelites, and they crossed over the Jordan River. He prepared them for battle, facing the Arameans. The Arameans fought with him, 
1CH.19.18	but they ran away from the Israelites. David killed seven thousand Aramean chariot drivers and forty thousand Aramean foot soldiers. He also killed Shophach, the commander of the Aramean army.
1CH.19.19	When those who served Hadadezer saw that the Israelites had defeated them, they made peace with David and served him. So the Arameans refused to help the Ammonites again.
1CH.20.1	In the spring, the time of year when kings normally went out to battle, Joab led out the army of Israel. But David stayed in Jerusalem. The army of Israel destroyed the land of Ammon and went to the city of Rabbah and attacked it. 
1CH.20.2	David took the crown off the head of their king, and had it placed on his own head. That gold crown weighed about seventy-five pounds, and it had valuable gems in it. And David took many valuable things from the city. 
1CH.20.3	He also brought out the people of the city and forced them to work with saws, iron picks, and axes. David did this to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all his army returned to Jerusalem.
1CH.20.4	Later, at Gezer, war broke out with the Philistines. Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, who was one of the descendants of the Rephaites. So those Philistines were defeated.
1CH.20.5	Later, there was another battle with the Philistines. Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath, who was from the town of Gath. His spear was as large as a weaver’s rod.
1CH.20.6	At Gath another battle took place. A huge man was there; he had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot—twenty-four fingers and toes in all. This man also was one of the sons of Rapha. 
1CH.20.7	When he spoke against Israel, Jonathan son of Shimea, David’s brother, killed him.
1CH.20.8	These descendants of Rapha from Gath were killed by David and his men.
1CH.21.1	Satan was against Israel, and he caused David to count the people of Israel. 
1CH.21.2	So David said to Joab and the commanders of the troops, “Go and count all the Israelites from Beersheba to Dan. Then tell me so I will know how many there are.”
1CH.21.3	But Joab said, “May the L
1CH.21.4	But the king commanded Joab, so Joab left and went through all Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem. 
1CH.21.5	Joab gave the list of the people to David. There were one million one hundred thousand men in all of Israel who could use the sword, and there were four hundred seventy thousand men in Judah who could use the sword. 
1CH.21.6	But Joab did not count the tribes of Levi and Benjamin, because he didn’t like King David’s order. 
1CH.21.7	David had done something God had said was wrong, so God punished Israel.
1CH.21.8	Then David said to God, “I have sinned greatly by what I have done! Now, I beg you to forgive me, your servant, because I have been very foolish.”
1CH.21.9	The L
1CH.21.10	“Go and tell David, ‘This is what the L
1CH.21.11	So Gad went to David and said to him, “This is what the L
1CH.21.12	three years of hunger. Or choose three months of running from your enemies as they chase you with their swords. Or choose three days of punishment from the L
1CH.21.13	David said to Gad, “I am in great trouble. Let the L
1CH.21.14	So the L
1CH.21.15	God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but when the angel started to destroy it, the L
1CH.21.16	David looked up and saw the angel of the L
1CH.21.17	David said to God, “I am the one who sinned and did wrong. I gave the order for the people to be counted. These people only followed me like sheep. They did nothing wrong. L
1CH.21.18	Then the angel of the L
1CH.21.19	So David did what Gad told him to do, in the name of the L
1CH.21.20	Araunah was separating the wheat from the straw. When he turned around, he saw the angel. Araunah’s four sons who were with him hid. 
1CH.21.21	David came to Araunah, and when Araunah saw him, he left the threshing floor and bowed facedown on the ground before David.
1CH.21.22	David said to him, “Sell me your threshing floor so I can build an altar to the L
1CH.21.23	Araunah said to David, “Take this threshing floor. My master the king, do anything you want. Look, I will also give you oxen for the whole burnt offerings, the threshing boards for the wood, and wheat for the grain offering. I give everything to you.”
1CH.21.24	But King David answered Araunah, “No, I will pay the full price for the land. I won’t take anything that is yours and give it to the L
1CH.21.25	So David paid Araunah about fifteen pounds of gold for the place. 
1CH.21.26	David built an altar to the L
1CH.21.27	Then the L
1CH.21.28	When David saw that the L
1CH.21.29	The Holy Tent that Moses made while the Israelites were in the desert and the altar of burnt offerings were in Gibeon at the place of worship. 
1CH.21.30	But David could not go to the Holy Tent to speak with God, because he was afraid of the angel of the L
1CH.22.1	David said, “The Temple of the L
1CH.22.2	So David ordered all foreigners living in Israel to gather together. From that group David chose stonecutters to cut stones to be used in building the Temple of God. 
1CH.22.3	David supplied a large amount of iron to be used for making nails and hinges for the gate doors. He also supplied more bronze than could be weighed, 
1CH.22.4	and he supplied more cedar logs than could be counted. Much of the cedar had been brought to David by the people from Sidon and Tyre.
1CH.22.5	David said, “We should build a great Temple for the L
1CH.22.6	Then David called for his son Solomon and told him to build the Temple for the L
1CH.22.7	David said to him, “My son, I wanted to build a temple for worshiping the L
1CH.22.8	But the L
1CH.22.9	But, you will have a son, a man of peace and rest. I will give him rest from all his enemies around him. His name will be Solomon, and I will give Israel peace and quiet while he is king. 
1CH.22.10	Solomon will build a temple for worship to me. He will be my son, and I will be his father. I will make his kingdom strong; someone from his family will rule Israel forever.’ ”
1CH.22.11	David said, “Now, my son, may the L
1CH.22.12	He will make you the king of Israel. May the L

1CH.22.14	“Solomon, I have worked hard getting many of the materials for building the Temple of the L
1CH.22.15	You have many workmen—stonecutters, bricklayers, carpenters, and people skilled in every kind of work. 
1CH.22.16	They are skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, and iron. You have more craftsmen than can be counted. Now begin the work, and may the L
1CH.22.17	Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to help his son Solomon. 
1CH.22.18	David said to them, “The L
1CH.22.19	Now give yourselves completely to obeying the L
1CH.23.1	After David had lived long and was old, he made his son Solomon the new king of Israel. 
1CH.23.2	David gathered all the leaders of Israel, along with the priests and Levites. 
1CH.23.3	He counted the Levites who were thirty years old and older. In all, there were thirty-eight thousand Levites. 
1CH.23.4	David said, “Of these, twenty-four thousand Levites will direct the work of the Temple of the L
1CH.23.5	four thousand Levites will be gatekeepers, and four thousand Levites will praise the L
1CH.23.6	David separated the Levites into three groups that were led by Levi’s three sons: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
1CH.23.7	From the people of Gershon, there were Ladan and Shimei.
1CH.23.8	Ladan had three sons. His first son was Jehiel, and his other sons were Zetham and Joel.
1CH.23.9	Shimei’s sons were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. These three sons were leaders of Ladan’s families. 
1CH.23.10	Shimei had four sons: Jahath, Ziza, Jeush, and Beriah. 
1CH.23.11	Jahath was the first son, and Ziza was the second son. But Jeush and Beriah did not have many children, so they were counted as if they were one family.
1CH.23.12	Kohath had four sons: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
1CH.23.13	Amram’s sons were Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were chosen to be special forever. They were chosen to prepare the holy things for the L
1CH.23.14	Moses was the man of God, and his sons were counted as part of the tribe of Levi. 
1CH.23.15	Moses’ sons were Gershom and Eliezer. 
1CH.23.16	Gershom’s first son was Shubael. 
1CH.23.17	Eliezer’s first son was Rehabiah. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many sons.
1CH.23.18	Izhar’s first son was Shelomith.
1CH.23.19	Hebron’s first son was Jeriah, his second was Amariah, his third was Jahaziel, and his fourth was Jekameam.
1CH.23.20	Uzziel’s first son was Micah and his second was Isshiah.
1CH.23.21	Merari’s sons were Mahli and Mushi. Mahli’s sons were Eleazar and Kish. 
1CH.23.22	Eleazar died without sons; he had only daughters. Eleazar’s daughters married their cousins, the sons of Kish. 
1CH.23.23	Mushi’s three sons were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
1CH.23.24	These were Levi’s descendants listed by their families. They were the leaders of families. Each person who was twenty years old or older was listed. They served in the L
1CH.23.25	David had said, “The L
1CH.23.26	So the Levites don’t need to carry the Holy Tent or any of the things used in its services anymore.” 
1CH.23.27	David’s last instructions were to count the Levites who were twenty years old and older.
1CH.23.28	The Levites had the job of helping Aaron’s descendants in the service of the Temple of the L
1CH.23.29	They were responsible for putting the holy bread on the table, for the flour in the grain offerings, for the bread made without yeast, for the baking and mixing, and for the measuring. 
1CH.23.30	The Levites also stood every morning and gave thanks and praise to the L
1CH.23.31	The Levites offered all the burnt offerings to the L
1CH.23.32	So the Levites took care of the Meeting Tent and the Holy Place. And they helped their relatives, Aaron’s descendants, with the services at the Temple of the L
1CH.24.1	These were the groups of Aaron’s sons: Aaron’s sons were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
1CH.24.2	But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, and they had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as the priests. 
1CH.24.3	David, with the help of Zadok, a descendant of Eleazar, and Ahimelech, a descendant of Ithamar, separated their family groups into two different groups. Each group had certain duties. 
1CH.24.4	There were more leaders from Eleazar’s family than from Ithamar’s—sixteen leaders from Eleazar’s family and eight leaders from Ithamar’s family. 
1CH.24.5	Men were chosen from Eleazar’s and Ithamar’s families by throwing lots. Some men from each family were chosen to be in charge of the Holy Place, and some were chosen to serve as priests.
1CH.24.6	Shemaiah son of Nethanel, from the tribe of Levi, was the secretary. He recorded the names of those descendants in front of King David, the officers, Zadok the priest, Ahimelech son of Abiathar, and the leaders of the families of the priests and Levites. The work was divided by lots among the families of Eleazar and Ithamar. The following men with their groups were chosen.
1CH.24.7	The first one chosen was Jehoiarib. The second was Jedaiah. 
1CH.24.8	The third was Harim. The fourth was Seorim.

1CH.24.19	These were the groups chosen to serve in the Temple of the L
1CH.24.20	These are the names of the rest of Levi’s descendants:
1CH.24.20	Shubael was a descendant of Amram, and Jehdeiah was a descendant of Shubael.
1CH.24.21	Isshiah was the first son of Rehabiah.

1CH.24.28	Mahli’s son was Eleazar, but Eleazar did not have any sons.
1CH.24.29	Kish’s son was Jerahmeel.
1CH.24.30	Mushi’s sons were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
1CH.24.30	These are the Levites, listed by their families. 
1CH.24.31	They were chosen for special jobs by throwing lots in front of King David, Zadok, Ahimelech, the leaders of the families of the priests, and the Levites. They did this just as their relatives, the priests, Aaron’s descendants, had done. The families of the oldest brother and the youngest brother were treated the same.
1CH.25.1	David and the commanders of the army chose some of the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun to preach and play harps, lyres, and cymbals. Here is a list of the men who served in this way:
1CH.25.2	Asaph’s sons who served were Zaccur, Joseph, Nethaniah, and Asarelah. King David chose Asaph to preach, and Asaph directed his sons.
1CH.25.3	Jeduthun’s sons who served were Gedaliah, Zeri, Jeshaiah, Shimei, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah. There were six of them, and Jeduthun directed them. He preached and used a harp to give thanks and praise to the L

1CH.25.6	Heman directed all his sons in making music for the Temple of the L
1CH.25.7	These men and their relatives were trained and skilled in making music for the L
1CH.25.8	Everyone threw lots to choose the time his family was to serve at the Temple. The young and the old, the teacher and the student, had to throw lots.

1CH.29.14	we have given you back what you gave us.
1CH.29.15	We are like foreigners and strangers,
1CH.29.15	as our ancestors were.

1CH.29.19	Help him build the Temple

1CH.29.20	Then David said to all the people who were gathered, “Praise the L

1CH.29.22	That day the people ate and drank with much joy, and the L
1CH.29.22	And they made David’s son Solomon king for the second time. They poured olive oil on Solomon to appoint him king in the presence of the L
1CH.29.23	Then Solomon sat on the L
1CH.29.24	All the leaders and soldiers and King David’s sons accepted Solomon as king and promised to obey him. 
1CH.29.25	The L
1CH.29.26	David son of Jesse was king over all Israel. 
1CH.29.27	He had ruled over Israel forty years—seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. 
1CH.29.28	David died when he was old. He had lived a good, long life and had received many riches and honors. His son Solomon became king after him.
1CH.29.29	Everything David did as king, from beginning to end, is recorded in the records of Samuel the seer, the records of Nathan the prophet, and the records of Gad the seer. 
1CH.29.30	Those writings tell what David did as king of Israel. They tell about his power and what happened to him and to Israel and to all the kingdoms around them.
2CH.1.1	Solomon, David’s son, became a powerful king, because the L
2CH.1.2	Solomon spoke to all the people of Israel—the commanders of a hundred men and of a thousand men, the judges, every leader in all Israel, and the leaders of the families. 
2CH.1.3	Then Solomon and all the people with him went to the place of worship at the town of Gibeon. God’s Meeting Tent, which Moses the L
2CH.1.4	David had brought the Ark of God from Kiriath Jearim to Jerusalem, where he had made a place for it and had set up a tent for it. 
2CH.1.5	The bronze altar that Bezalel son of Uri, who was the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon in front of the Holy Tent. So Solomon and the people worshiped there. 
2CH.1.6	Solomon went up to the bronze altar in the presence of the L
2CH.1.7	That night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.”
2CH.1.8	Solomon answered, “You have been very kind to my father David, and you have made me king in his place. 
2CH.1.9	Now, L
2CH.1.10	Now give me wisdom and knowledge so I can lead these people in the right way, because no one can rule them without your help.”
2CH.1.11	God said to Solomon, “You have not asked for wealth or riches or honor, or for the death of your enemies, or for a long life. But since you have asked for wisdom and knowledge to lead my people, over whom I have made you king, 
2CH.1.12	I will give you wisdom and knowledge. I will also give you more wealth, riches, and honor than any king who has lived before you or any who will live after you.”
2CH.1.13	Then Solomon left the place of worship, the Meeting Tent, at Gibeon and went back to Jerusalem. There King Solomon ruled over Israel.
2CH.1.14	Solomon had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses. He kept some in special cities for the chariots, and others he kept with him in Jerusalem. 
2CH.1.15	In Jerusalem Solomon made silver and gold as plentiful as stones and cedar trees as plentiful as the fig trees on the western hills. 
2CH.1.16	He imported horses from Egypt and Kue; his traders bought them in Kue. 
2CH.1.17	They imported chariots from Egypt for about fifteen pounds of silver apiece, and horses cost nearly four pounds of silver apiece. Then they sold the horses and chariots to all the kings of the Hittites and the Arameans.
2CH.2.1	Solomon decided to build a temple as a place to worship the L
2CH.2.2	He chose seventy thousand men to carry loads, eighty thousand men to cut stone in the hill country, and thirty-six hundred men to direct the workers.
2CH.2.3	Solomon sent this message to Hiram king of the city of Tyre: “Help me as you helped my father David by sending him cedar logs so he could build himself a palace to live in. 
2CH.2.4	I will build a temple for worshiping the L
2CH.2.5	“The temple I build will be great, because our God is greater than all gods. 
2CH.2.6	But no one can really build a house for our God. Not even the highest of heavens can hold him. How then can I build a temple for him except as a place to burn sacrifices to him?
2CH.2.7	“Now send me a man skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and with purple, red, and blue thread. He must also know how to make engravings. He will work with my skilled craftsmen in Judah and Jerusalem, whom my father David chose.
2CH.2.8	“Also send me cedar, pine, and juniper logs from Lebanon. I know your servants are experienced at cutting down the trees in Lebanon, and my servants will help them. 
2CH.2.9	Send me a lot of wood, because the temple I am going to build will be large and wonderful. 
2CH.2.10	I will give your servants who cut the wood one hundred twenty-five thousand bushels of wheat, one hundred twenty-five thousand bushels of barley, one hundred fifteen thousand gallons of wine, and one hundred fifteen thousand gallons of oil.”
2CH.2.11	Then Hiram king of Tyre answered Solomon with this letter: “Solomon, because the L
2CH.2.12	Hiram also said: “Praise the L
2CH.2.13	“I will send you a skilled and wise man named Huram-Abi. 
2CH.2.14	His mother was from the people of Dan, and his father was from Tyre. Huram-Abi is skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and with purple, blue, and red thread, and expensive linen. He is skilled in making engravings and can make any design you show him. He will help your craftsmen and the craftsmen of your father David.
2CH.2.15	“Now send my servants the wheat, barley, oil, and wine you promised. 
2CH.2.16	We will cut as much wood from Lebanon as you need and will bring it on rafts by sea to Joppa. Then you may carry it to Jerusalem.”
2CH.2.17	Solomon counted all the foreigners living in Israel. (This was after the time his father David had counted the people.) There were one hundred fifty-three thousand six hundred foreigners in the country. 
2CH.2.18	Solomon chose seventy thousand of them to carry loads, eighty thousand of them to cut stone in the mountains, and thirty-six hundred of them to direct the workers and to keep the people working.
2CH.3.1	Then Solomon began to build the Temple of the L
2CH.3.2	Solomon began building in the second month of the fourth year he ruled Israel.
2CH.3.3	Solomon used these measurements for building the Temple of God. It was ninety feet long and thirty feet wide, using the old measurement. 
2CH.3.4	The porch in front of the main room of the Temple was thirty feet long and thirty feet high.
2CH.3.4	He covered the inside of the porch with pure gold. 
2CH.3.5	He put panels of pine on the walls of the main room and covered them with pure gold. Then he put designs of palm trees and chains in the gold. 
2CH.3.6	He decorated the Temple with gems and gold from Parvaim. 
2CH.3.7	He put gold on the Temple’s ceiling beams, doorposts, walls, and doors, and he carved creatures with wings on the walls.
2CH.3.8	Then he made the Most Holy Place. It was thirty feet long and thirty feet wide, as wide as the Temple. He covered its walls with about forty-six thousand pounds of pure gold. 
2CH.3.9	The gold nails weighed over a pound. He also covered the upper rooms with gold.
2CH.3.10	He made two creatures with wings for the Most Holy Place and covered them with gold. 
2CH.3.11	The wings of the gold creatures were thirty feet across. One wing of one creature was seven and one-half feet long and touched the Temple wall. The creature’s other wing was also seven and one-half feet long, and it touched a wing of the second creature. 
2CH.3.12	One wing of the second creature touched the other side of the room and was also seven and one-half feet long. The second creature’s other wing touched the first creature’s wing, and it was also seven and one-half feet long. 
2CH.3.13	Together, the creatures’ wings were thirty feet across. The creatures stood on their feet, facing the main room.
2CH.3.14	He made the curtain of blue, purple, and red thread, and expensive linen, and he put designs of creatures with wings in it.
2CH.3.15	He made two pillars to stand in front of the Temple. They were about fifty-two feet tall, and the capital of each pillar was over seven feet tall. 
2CH.3.16	He made a net of chains and put them on the tops of the pillars. He made a hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains. 
2CH.3.17	Then he put the pillars up in front of the Temple. One pillar stood on the south side, the other on the north. He named the south pillar He Establishes and the north pillar In Him Is Strength.
2CH.4.1	He made a bronze altar thirty feet long, thirty feet wide, and fifteen feet tall. 
2CH.4.2	Then he made from bronze a large round bowl, which was called the Sea. It was forty-five feet around, fifteen feet across, and seven and one-half feet deep. 
2CH.4.3	There were carvings of bulls under the rim of the bowl—ten bulls every eighteen inches. They were in two rows and were made in one piece with the bowl.
2CH.4.4	The bowl rested on the backs of twelve bronze bulls that faced outward from the center of the bowl. Three bulls faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. 
2CH.4.5	The sides of the bowl were four inches thick, and it held about seventeen thousand five hundred gallons. The rim of the bowl was like the rim of a cup or like a lily blossom.
2CH.4.6	He made ten smaller bowls and put five on the south side and five on the north. They were for washing the animals for the burnt offerings, but the large bowl was for the priests to wash in.
2CH.4.7	He made ten lampstands of gold, following the plans. He put them in the Temple, five on the south side and five on the north.
2CH.4.8	He made ten tables and put them in the Temple, five on the south side and five on the north. And he used gold to make a hundred other bowls.
2CH.4.9	He also made the priests’ courtyard and the large courtyard. He made the doors that opened to the courtyard and covered them with bronze. 
2CH.4.10	Then he put the large bowl in the southeast corner of the Temple.
2CH.4.11	Huram also made bowls, shovels, and small bowls. So he finished his work for King Solomon on the Temple of God:
2CH.4.12	two pillars;
2CH.4.12	two large bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars;
2CH.4.12	two nets to cover the two large bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars;
2CH.4.13	four hundred pomegranates for the two nets (there were two rows of pomegranates for each net covering the bowls for the capitals on top of the pillars);
2CH.4.14	the stands with a bowl on each stand;
2CH.4.15	the large bowl with twelve bulls under it;
2CH.4.16	the pots, shovels, forks, and all the things to go with them.
2CH.4.16	All the things that Huram-Abi made for King Solomon for the Temple of the L
2CH.4.17	The king had these things poured into clay molds that were made in the plain of the Jordan River between Succoth and Zarethan. 
2CH.4.18	Solomon had so many things made that the total weight of all the bronze was never known.
2CH.4.19	Solomon also made all the things for God’s Temple: the golden altar; tables which held the bread that shows God’s people are in his presence;

2CH.4.21	the flowers, lamps, and tongs of pure gold; 
2CH.4.22	the pure gold wick trimmers, small bowls, pans, and dishes used to carry coals, the gold doors for the Temple, and the inside doors of the Most Holy Place and of the main room.
2CH.5.1	Finally all the work Solomon did for the Temple of the L
2CH.5.2	Solomon called for the elders of Israel, the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the families to come to him in Jerusalem. He wanted them to bring the Ark of the Agreement with the L
2CH.5.3	So all the Israelites came together with the king during the festival in the seventh month.
2CH.5.4	When all the elders of Israel arrived, the Levites lifted up the Ark. 
2CH.5.5	They carried the Ark of the Agreement, the Meeting Tent, and the holy utensils in it; the priests and the Levites brought them up. 
2CH.5.6	King Solomon and all the Israelites gathered before the Ark of the Agreement and sacrificed so many sheep and bulls no one could count them.
2CH.5.7	Then the priests put the Ark of the Agreement with the L
2CH.5.8	The wings of these creatures were spread out over the place for the Ark, covering it and its carrying poles. 
2CH.5.9	The carrying poles were so long that anyone standing in the Holy Place in front of the Most Holy Place could see the ends of the poles. But no one could see them from outside the Holy Place. The poles are still there today. 
2CH.5.10	The only things inside the Ark were two stone tablets that Moses had put in the Ark at Mount Sinai. That was where the L
2CH.5.11	Then all the priests left the Holy Place. (All the priests from each group had made themselves ready to serve the L
2CH.5.12	All the Levite musicians—Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and all their sons and relatives—stood on the east side of the altar. They were dressed in white linen and played cymbals, harps, and lyres. With them were one hundred twenty priests who blew trumpets. 
2CH.5.13	Those who blew the trumpets and those who sang together sounded like one person as they praised and thanked the L
2CH.5.13	“He is good;
2CH.5.13	his love continues forever.”
2CH.5.13	Then the Temple of the L
2CH.5.14	The priests could not continue their work because of the cloud, because the L

2CH.6.3	While all the Israelites were standing there, King Solomon turned to them and blessed them. 
2CH.6.4	Then he said, “Praise the L
2CH.6.5	‘Since the time I brought my people out of Egypt, I have not chosen a city in any tribe of Israel where a temple will be built for me. I did not choose a man to lead my people Israel.

2CH.6.7	“My father David wanted to build a temple for the L
2CH.6.8	But the L
2CH.6.9	But you are not the one to build it. Your son, who comes from your own body, is the one who will build my temple.’

2CH.6.11	There I have put the Ark, in which is the Agreement the L
2CH.6.12	Then Solomon stood facing the L
2CH.6.13	He had made a bronze platform seven and one-half feet long, seven and one-half feet wide, and seven and one-half feet high, and he had placed it in the middle of the outer courtyard. Solomon stood on the platform. Then he kneeled in front of all the people of Israel gathered there, and he spread out his hands toward the sky. 
2CH.6.14	He said, “L
2CH.6.15	You have kept the promise you made to your servant David, my father. You spoke it with your own mouth and finished it with your hands today.
2CH.6.16	“Now, L
2CH.6.17	Now, L
2CH.6.18	“But, God, can you really live here on the earth with people? The sky and the highest place in heaven cannot contain you. Surely this house which I have built cannot contain you. 
2CH.6.19	But please listen to my prayer and my request, because I am your servant. L
2CH.6.20	Day and night please watch over this Temple where you have said you would be worshiped. Hear the prayer I pray facing this Temple. 
2CH.6.21	Hear my prayers and the prayers of your people Israel when we pray facing this place. Hear from your home in heaven, and when you hear, forgive us.
2CH.6.22	“If someone wrongs another person, he will be brought to the altar in this Temple. If he swears an oath that he is not guilty, 
2CH.6.23	then hear in heaven. Judge the case, punish the guilty, but declare that the innocent person is not guilty.
2CH.6.24	“When your people, the Israelites, sin against you, their enemies will defeat them. But if they come back to you and praise you and pray to you in this Temple, 
2CH.6.25	then listen from heaven. Forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their ancestors.
2CH.6.26	“When they sin against you, you will stop the rain from falling on their land. Then they will pray, facing this place and praising you; they will stop sinning when you make them suffer. 
2CH.6.27	When this happens, hear their prayer in heaven, and forgive the sins of your servants, the Israelites. Teach them to do what is right. Then please send rain to this land you have given particularly to them.
2CH.6.28	“At times the land will get so dry that no food will grow, or a great sickness will spread among the people. Sometimes the crops will be destroyed by locusts or grasshoppers. Your people will be attacked in their cities by their enemies, or will become sick. 
2CH.6.29	When any of these things happens, the people will become truly sorry. If your people spread their hands in prayer toward this Temple, 
2CH.6.30	then hear their prayers from your home in heaven. Forgive and treat each person as he should be treated because you know what is in a person’s heart. Only you know what is in people’s hearts. 
2CH.6.31	Then the people will respect and obey you as long as they live in this land you gave our ancestors.
2CH.6.32	“People who are not Israelites, foreigners from other lands, will hear about your greatness and power. They will come from far away to pray at this Temple. 
2CH.6.33	Then hear from your home in heaven, and do whatever they ask you. Then people everywhere will know you and respect you, just as your people Israel do. Then everyone will know that I built this Temple as a place to worship you.
2CH.6.34	“When your people go out to fight their enemies along some road on which you send them, your people will pray to you, facing this city which you have chosen and the Temple I have built for you. 
2CH.6.35	Then hear in heaven their prayers, and do what is right.
2CH.6.36	“Everyone sins, so your people will also sin against you. You will become angry with them and will hand them over to their enemies. Their enemies will capture them and take them away to a country far or near. 
2CH.6.37	Your people will be sorry for their sins when they are held as prisoners in another country. They will be sorry and pray to you in the land where they are held as prisoners, saying, ‘We have sinned. We have done wrong and acted wickedly.’ 
2CH.6.38	They will truly turn back to you in the land where they are captives. They will pray, facing this land you gave their ancestors, this city you have chosen, and the Temple I have built for you. 
2CH.6.39	Then hear their prayers from your home in heaven and do what is right. Forgive your people who have sinned against you.
2CH.6.40	“Now, my God, look at us. Listen to the prayers we pray in this place.
2CH.6.41	Now, rise, L

2CH.6.42	Remember your love for your servant David.”
2CH.7.1	When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from the sky and burned up the burnt offering and the sacrifices. The L
2CH.7.2	The priests could not enter the Temple of the L
2CH.7.3	When all the people of Israel saw the fire come down from heaven and the L

2CH.7.4	Then King Solomon and all the people offered sacrifices to the L
2CH.7.5	King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the people gave the Temple to God. 
2CH.7.6	The priests stood ready to do their work. The Levites also stood with the instruments of the L
2CH.7.7	Solomon made holy the middle part of the courtyard, which is in front of the Temple of the L
2CH.7.8	Solomon and all the Israelites celebrated the festival for seven days. There were many people, and they came from as far away as Lebo Hamath and the brook of Egypt. 
2CH.7.9	For seven days they celebrated giving the altar for the worship of God. Then they celebrated the festival for seven days. On the eighth day they had a meeting. 
2CH.7.10	On the twenty-third day of the seventh month Solomon sent the people home, full of joy. They were happy because the L

2CH.7.15	Now I will see them, and I will listen to the prayers prayed in this place. 
2CH.7.16	I have chosen this Temple and made it holy. So I will be worshiped there forever. Yes, I will always watch over it and love it.
2CH.7.17	“But you must serve me as your father David did. You must obey all I have commanded and keep my laws and rules. 
2CH.7.18	If you do, I will make your kingdom strong. This is the agreement I made with your father David, saying, ‘Someone from your family will always rule in Israel.’
2CH.7.19	“But you must follow me and obey the laws and commands I have given you. You must not serve or worship other gods. 
2CH.7.20	If you do, I will take the Israelites out of my land, the land I have given them, and I will leave this Temple that I have made holy. All the nations will make fun of it and speak evil about it. 
2CH.7.21	This Temple is honored now, but then, everyone who passes by will be shocked. They will ask, ‘Why did the L
2CH.7.22	People will answer, ‘This happened because they left the L
2CH.8.1	By the end of twenty years, Solomon had built the Temple of the L
2CH.8.2	Solomon rebuilt the towns that Hiram had given him, and Solomon sent Israelites to live in them. 
2CH.8.3	Then he went to Hamath Zobah and captured it. 
2CH.8.4	Solomon also built the town of Tadmor in the desert, and he built all the towns in Hamath as towns for storing grain and supplies. 
2CH.8.5	He rebuilt the towns of Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon, protecting them with strong walls, gates, and bars in the gates. 
2CH.8.6	He also rebuilt the town of Baalath. And he built all the other towns for storage and all the cities for his chariots and horses. He built all he wanted in Jerusalem, Lebanon, and everywhere he ruled.
2CH.8.7	There were other people in the land who were not Israelites—the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. 
2CH.8.8	They were descendants of the people that the Israelites had not destroyed. Solomon forced them to be slave workers, as is still true today. 
2CH.8.9	But Solomon did not make slaves of the Israelites. They were his soldiers, chief captains, commanders of his chariots, and his chariot drivers. 
2CH.8.10	These were his most important officers. There were two hundred fifty of them to direct the people.
2CH.8.11	Solomon brought the daughter of the king of Egypt from the older part of Jerusalem to the palace he had built for her. Solomon said, “My wife must not live in King David’s palace, because the places where the Ark of the Agreement has been are holy.”
2CH.8.12	Then Solomon offered burnt offerings to the L
2CH.8.13	He offered sacrifices every day as Moses had commanded. They were offered on the Sabbath days, New Moons, and the three yearly feasts—the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Shelters. 
2CH.8.14	Solomon followed his father David’s instructions and chose the groups of priests for their service and the Levites to lead the praise and to help the priests do their daily work. And he chose the gatekeepers by their groups to serve at each gate, as David, the man of God, had commanded. 
2CH.8.15	They obeyed all of Solomon’s commands to the priests and Levites, as well as his commands about the treasuries.
2CH.8.16	All Solomon’s work was done as he had said from the day the foundation of the Temple of the L
2CH.8.17	Then Solomon went to the towns of Ezion Geber and Elath near the Red Sea in the land of Edom. 
2CH.8.18	Hiram sent ships to Solomon that were commanded by his own men, who were skilled sailors. Hiram’s men went with Solomon’s men to Ophir and brought back about thirty-four thousand pounds of gold to King Solomon.
2CH.9.1	When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon’s fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She had a large group of servants with her and camels carrying spices, jewels, and much gold. When she came to Solomon, she talked with him about all she had in mind, 
2CH.9.2	and Solomon answered all her questions. Nothing was too hard for him to explain to her. 
2CH.9.3	The queen of Sheba saw that Solomon was very wise. She saw the palace he had built, 
2CH.9.4	the food on his table, his many officers, the palace servants and their good clothes, the servants who served Solomon his wine and their good clothes. She saw the whole burnt offerings he made in the Temple of the L
2CH.9.5	So she said to King Solomon, “What I heard in my own country about your achievements and wisdom is true. 
2CH.9.6	I did not believe it then, but now I have come and seen it with my own eyes. I was not told even half of your great wisdom! You are much greater than I had heard. 
2CH.9.7	Your people and officials are very lucky, because in always serving you, they are able to hear your wisdom. 
2CH.9.8	Praise the L
2CH.9.9	Then she gave the king about nine thousand pounds of gold and many spices and jewels. No one had ever given such spices as the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon.
2CH.9.10	Hiram’s men and Solomon’s men brought gold from Ophir, juniper wood, and jewels. 
2CH.9.11	King Solomon used the juniper wood to build steps for the Temple of the L
2CH.9.12	King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she wanted and asked for, even more than she had brought to him. Then she and her servants returned to her own country.
2CH.9.13	Every year King Solomon received about fifty thousand pounds of gold. 
2CH.9.14	Besides that, he also received gold from traders and merchants. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land also brought gold and silver.
2CH.9.15	King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold, each of which contained about seven and one-half pounds of hammered gold. 
2CH.9.16	He also made three hundred smaller shields of hammered gold, each of which contained about four pounds of gold. The king put them in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
2CH.9.17	The king built a large throne of ivory and covered it with pure gold. 
2CH.9.18	The throne had six steps on it and a gold footstool. There were armrests on both sides of the chair, and each armrest had a lion beside it. 
2CH.9.19	Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one lion at each end of each step. Nothing like this had ever been made for any other kingdom. 
2CH.9.20	All of Solomon’s drinking cups, as well as the dishes in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon, were made of pure gold. In Solomon’s time people did not think silver was valuable.
2CH.9.21	King Solomon had many ships that he sent out to trade, with Hiram’s men as the crews. Every three years the ships returned, bringing back gold, silver, ivory, apes, and baboons.
2CH.9.22	King Solomon had more riches and wisdom than all the other kings on earth. 
2CH.9.23	All the kings of the earth wanted to see Solomon and listen to the wisdom God had given him. 
2CH.9.24	Year after year everyone who came brought gifts of silver and gold, clothes, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
2CH.9.25	Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and he had twelve thousand horses. He kept some in special cities for the chariots, and others he kept with him in Jerusalem. 
2CH.9.26	Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the land of the Philistines, as far as the border of Egypt. 
2CH.9.27	In Jerusalem the king made silver as common as stones and cedar trees as plentiful as the fig trees on the western hills. 
2CH.9.28	Solomon imported horses from Egypt and all other countries.
2CH.9.29	Everything else Solomon did, from the beginning to the end, is written in the records of Nathan the prophet, and in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer, who wrote about Jeroboam, Nebat’s son. 
2CH.9.30	Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years. 
2CH.9.31	Then Solomon died and was buried in Jerusalem, the city of David, his father. And Solomon’s son Rehoboam became king in his place.
2CH.10.1	Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all the Israelites had gone to make him king. 
2CH.10.2	Jeroboam son of Nebat was in Egypt, where he had gone to escape from King Solomon. When Jeroboam heard about Rehoboam being made king, he returned from Egypt. 
2CH.10.3	After the people sent for him, he and the people went to Rehoboam and said to him, 
2CH.10.4	“Your father forced us to work very hard. Now, make it easier for us, and don’t make us work as he did. Then we will serve you.”
2CH.10.5	Rehoboam answered, “Come back to me in three days.” So the people left.
2CH.10.6	King Rehoboam asked the elders who had advised Solomon during his lifetime, “How do you think I should answer these people?”
2CH.10.7	They answered, “Be kind to these people. If you please them and give them a kind answer, they will serve you always.”
2CH.10.8	But Rehoboam rejected this advice. Instead, he asked the young men who had grown up with him and who served as his advisers. 
2CH.10.9	Rehoboam asked them, “What is your advice? How should we answer these people who said, ‘Don’t make us work as hard as your father did’?”
2CH.10.10	The young men who had grown up with him answered, “The people said to you, ‘Your father forced us to work very hard. Now make our work easier.’ You should tell them, ‘My little finger is bigger than my father’s legs. 
2CH.10.11	He forced you to work hard, but I will make you work even harder. My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with whips that have sharp points.’ ”
2CH.10.12	Rehoboam had told the people, “Come back to me in three days.” So after three days Jeroboam and all the people returned to Rehoboam. 
2CH.10.13	King Rehoboam spoke cruel words to them, because he had rejected the advice of the elders. 
2CH.10.14	He followed the advice of the young men and said, “My father forced you to work hard, but I will make you work even harder. My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with whips that have sharp points.” 
2CH.10.15	So the king did not listen to the people. God caused this to happen so that the L
2CH.10.16	When all the Israelites saw that the king refused to listen to them, they said to the king,
2CH.10.16	“We have no share in David!
2CH.10.16	We have no part in the son of Jesse!
2CH.10.16	People of Israel, let’s go to our own homes!
2CH.10.16	Let David’s son rule his own people.”
2CH.10.16	So all the Israelites went home. 
2CH.10.17	But Rehoboam still ruled over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah.
2CH.10.18	Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor. When Rehoboam sent him to the people, they threw stones at him until he died. But King Rehoboam ran to his chariot and escaped to Jerusalem. 
2CH.10.19	Since then, Israel has been against the family of David.
2CH.11.1	When Rehoboam arrived in Jerusalem, he gathered one hundred eighty thousand of the best soldiers from Judah and Benjamin. He wanted to fight Israel to take back his kingdom. 
2CH.11.2	But the L
2CH.11.3	“Speak to Solomon’s son Rehoboam, the king of Judah, and to all the Israelites living in Judah and Benjamin. Say to them, 
2CH.11.4	‘The L
2CH.11.5	Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem and built strong cities in Judah to defend it. 
2CH.11.6	He built up the cities of Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
2CH.11.7	Beth Zur, Soco, Adullam, 
2CH.11.8	Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
2CH.11.9	Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah, 
2CH.11.10	Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were strong, walled cities in Judah and Benjamin. 
2CH.11.11	When Rehoboam made those cities strong, he put commanders and supplies of food, oil, and wine in them. 
2CH.11.12	Also, Rehoboam put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong. Rehoboam kept the people of Judah and Benjamin under his control.
2CH.11.13	The priests and the Levites from all over Israel joined Rehoboam. 
2CH.11.14	The Levites even left their pasturelands and property and came to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons refused to let them serve as priests to the L
2CH.11.15	Jeroboam chose his own priests for the places of worship and for the goat and calf idols he had made. 
2CH.11.16	There were people from all the tribes of Israel who wanted to obey the L
2CH.11.17	These people made the kingdom of Judah strong, and they supported Solomon’s son Rehoboam for three years. During this time they lived the way David and Solomon had lived.
2CH.11.18	Rehoboam married Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth and Abihail. Jerimoth was David’s son, and Abihail was the daughter of Eliab, Jesse’s son. 
2CH.11.19	Mahalath gave Rehoboam these sons: Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
2CH.11.20	Then Rehoboam married Absalom’s daughter Maacah, and she gave Rehoboam these children: Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
2CH.11.21	Rehoboam loved Maacah more than his other wives and slave women. Rehoboam had eighteen wives and sixty slave women and was the father of twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
2CH.11.22	Rehoboam chose Abijah son of Maacah to be the leader of his own brothers, because he planned to make Abijah king. 
2CH.11.23	Rehoboam acted wisely. He spread his sons through all the areas of Judah and Benjamin, sending them to every strong, walled city. He gave plenty of supplies to his sons, and he also found wives for them.
2CH.12.1	After Rehoboam’s kingdom was set up and he became strong, he and the people of Judah stopped obeying the teachings of the L
2CH.12.2	During the fifth year Rehoboam was king, Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem, because Rehoboam and the people were unfaithful to the L
2CH.12.3	Shishak had twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. He brought troops of Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites from Egypt with him, so many they couldn’t be counted. 
2CH.12.4	Shishak captured the strong, walled cities of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.
2CH.12.5	Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the leaders of Judah who had gathered in Jerusalem because they were afraid of Shishak. Shemaiah said to them, “This is what the L
2CH.12.6	Then the leaders of Judah and King Rehoboam were sorry for what they had done. They said, “The L
2CH.12.7	When the L
2CH.12.8	But the people of Jerusalem will become Shishak’s servants so they may learn that serving me is different than serving the kings of other nations.”
2CH.12.9	Shishak king of Egypt attacked Jerusalem and took the treasures from the Temple of the L
2CH.12.10	So King Rehoboam made bronze shields to take their place and gave them to the commanders of the guards for the palace gates. 
2CH.12.11	Whenever the king went to the Temple of the L
2CH.12.12	When Rehoboam was sorry for what he had done, the L
2CH.12.13	King Rehoboam made himself a strong king in Jerusalem. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he was king in Jerusalem for seventeen years. Jerusalem is the city that the L
2CH.12.14	Rehoboam did evil because he did not want to obey the L
2CH.12.15	The things Rehoboam did as king, from the beginning to the end, are written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer, in the family histories. There were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the time they ruled. 
2CH.12.16	Rehoboam died and was buried in Jerusalem, and his son Abijah became king in his place.
2CH.13.1	Abijah became the king of Judah during the eighteenth year Jeroboam was king of Israel. 
2CH.13.2	Abijah ruled in Jerusalem for three years. His mother was Maacah daughter of Uriel from the town of Gibeah.
2CH.13.2	And there was war between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
2CH.13.3	Abijah led an army of four hundred thousand capable soldiers into battle, and Jeroboam prepared to fight him with eight hundred thousand capable soldiers.
2CH.13.4	Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the mountains of Ephraim and said, “Jeroboam and all Israel, listen to me! 
2CH.13.5	You should know that the L
2CH.13.6	But Jeroboam son of Nebat, one of the officers of Solomon, David’s son, turned against his master. 
2CH.13.7	Then worthless, evil men joined Jeroboam against Rehoboam, Solomon’s son. He was young and didn’t know what to do, so he could not stop them.
2CH.13.8	“Now you people are making plans against the L
2CH.13.9	You have thrown out the Levites and the L

2CH.13.12	God himself is with us as our ruler. His priests blow the trumpet to call us to war against you. Men of Israel, don’t fight against the L
2CH.13.13	But Jeroboam had sent some troops to sneak behind Judah’s army. So while Jeroboam was in front of Judah’s army, Jeroboam’s soldiers were behind them. 
2CH.13.14	When the soldiers of Judah turned around, they saw Jeroboam’s army attacking both in front and back. So they cried out to the L
2CH.13.15	Then the men of Judah gave a battle cry. When they shouted, God caused Jeroboam and the army of Israel to run away from Abijah and the army of Judah. 
2CH.13.16	When the army of Israel ran away from the men of Judah, God handed them over to Judah. 
2CH.13.17	Abijah’s army struck Israel so that five hundred thousand of Israel’s best men were killed. 
2CH.13.18	So at that time the people of Israel were defeated. And the people of Judah won, because they depended on the L
2CH.13.19	Abijah’s army chased Jeroboam’s army and captured from him the towns of Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, and the small villages near them. 
2CH.13.20	Jeroboam never became strong again while Abijah was alive. The L
2CH.13.21	But Abijah became strong. He married fourteen women and was the father of twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters. 
2CH.13.22	Everything else Abijah did—what he said and what he did—is recorded in the writings of the prophet Iddo.
2CH.14.1	Abijah died and was buried in Jerusalem. His son Asa became king in his place, and there was peace in the country for ten years during Asa’s time.
2CH.14.2	Asa did what the L
2CH.14.3	He removed the foreign altars and the places where gods were worshiped. He smashed the stone pillars that honored other gods, and he tore down the Asherah idols. 
2CH.14.4	Asa commanded the people of Judah to follow the L
2CH.14.5	He also removed the places where gods were worshiped and the incense altars from every town in Judah. So the kingdom had peace while Asa was king. 
2CH.14.6	Asa built strong, walled cities in Judah during the time of peace. He had no war in these years, because the L
2CH.14.7	Asa said to the people of Judah, “Let’s build up these towns and put walls around them. Let’s make towers, gates, and bars in the gates. This country is ours, because we have obeyed the L
2CH.14.8	Asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from Judah and two hundred eighty thousand men from Benjamin. The men from Judah carried large shields and spears. The men from Benjamin carried small shields and bows and arrows. All of them were brave fighting men.
2CH.14.9	Then Zerah from Cush came out to fight them with an enormous army and three hundred chariots. They came as far as the town of Mareshah. 
2CH.14.10	So Asa went out to fight Zerah and prepared for battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
2CH.14.11	Asa called out to the L
2CH.14.12	So the L
2CH.14.13	Asa’s army chased them as far as the town of Gerar. So many Cushites were killed that the army could not fight again; they were crushed by the L
2CH.14.14	They destroyed all the towns near Gerar, because the people living in these towns were afraid of the L
2CH.14.15	Asa’s army also attacked the camps where the shepherds lived and took many sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.
2CH.15.1	The Spirit of God entered Azariah son of Oded. 
2CH.15.2	Azariah went to meet Asa and said, “Listen to me, Asa and all you people of Judah and Benjamin. The L
2CH.15.3	For a long time Israel was without the true God and without a priest to teach them and without the teachings. 
2CH.15.4	But when they were in trouble, they turned to the L
2CH.15.5	In those days no one could travel safely. There was much trouble in all the nations. 
2CH.15.6	One nation would destroy another nation, and one city would destroy another city, because God troubled them with all kinds of distress. 
2CH.15.7	But you should be strong. Don’t give up, because you will get a reward for your good work.”
2CH.15.8	Asa felt brave when he heard these words and the message from Azariah son of Oded the prophet. So he removed the hateful idols from all of Judah and Benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of Ephraim. He repaired the L
2CH.15.9	Then Asa gathered all the people from Judah and Benjamin and from the tribes of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were living in Judah. Many people came to Asa even from Israel, because they saw that the L
2CH.15.10	Asa and these people gathered in Jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of Asa’s rule. 
2CH.15.11	At that time they sacrificed to the L
2CH.15.12	Then they made an agreement to obey the L
2CH.15.13	Anyone who refused to obey the L
2CH.15.14	Then Asa and the people made a promise before the L
2CH.15.15	All the people of Judah were happy about the promise, because they had promised with all their heart. They looked for God and found him. So the L
2CH.15.16	King Asa also removed Maacah, his grandmother, from being queen mother, because she had made a terrible Asherah idol. Asa cut down that idol, smashed it into pieces, and burned it in the Kidron Valley. 
2CH.15.17	But the places of worship to gods were not removed from Judah. Even so, Asa was faithful all his life.
2CH.15.18	Asa brought into the Temple of God the gifts he and his father had given: silver, gold, and utensils.
2CH.15.19	There was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s rule.
2CH.16.1	In the thirty-sixth year of Asa’s rule, Baasha king of Israel attacked Judah. He made the town of Ramah strong so he could keep people from leaving or entering Judah, Asa’s country.
2CH.16.2	Asa took silver and gold from the treasuries of the Temple of the L
2CH.16.3	“Let there be a treaty between you and me as there was between my father and your father. I am sending you silver and gold. Break your treaty with Baasha king of Israel so he will leave my land.”
2CH.16.4	Ben-Hadad agreed with King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies to attack the towns of Israel. They defeated the towns of Ijon, Dan, and Abel Beth Maacah, and all the towns in Naphtali where treasures were stored. 
2CH.16.5	When Baasha heard about this, he stopped building up Ramah and left his work. 
2CH.16.6	Then King Asa brought all the people of Judah to Ramah, and they carried away the rocks and wood that Baasha had used. And they used them to build up Geba and Mizpah.
2CH.16.7	At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and said to him, “You depended on the king of Aram to help you and not on the L
2CH.16.8	The Cushites and Libyans had a large and powerful army and many chariots and horsemen. But you depended on the L
2CH.16.9	The L
2CH.16.10	Asa was angry with Hanani the seer because of what he had said; he was so angry that he put Hanani in prison. And Asa was cruel to some of the people at the same time.
2CH.16.11	Everything Asa did as king, from the beginning to the end, is written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.16.12	In the thirty-ninth year of his rule, Asa got a disease in his feet. Though his disease was very bad, he did not ask for help from the L
2CH.16.13	Then Asa died in the forty-first year of his rule. 
2CH.16.14	The people buried Asa in the tomb he had made for himself in Jerusalem. They laid him on a bed filled with spices and different kinds of mixed perfumes, and they made a large fire to honor him.
2CH.17.1	Jehoshaphat, Asa’s son, became king of Judah in his place. Jehoshaphat made Judah strong so they could fight against Israel. 
2CH.17.2	He put troops in all the strong, walled cities of Judah, in the land of Judah, and in the towns of Ephraim that his father Asa had captured.
2CH.17.3	The L
2CH.17.4	but from the God of his father. He obeyed God’s commands and did not live as the people of Israel lived. 
2CH.17.5	The L
2CH.17.6	He wanted very much to obey the L
2CH.17.7	During the third year of his rule, Jehoshaphat sent his officers to teach in the towns of Judah. These officers were Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah. 
2CH.17.8	Jehoshaphat sent with them these Levites: Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-Adonijah. He also sent the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 
2CH.17.9	These leaders, Levites, and priests taught the people in Judah. They took the Book of the Teachings of the L
2CH.17.10	The nations near Judah were afraid of the L
2CH.17.11	Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver to Jehoshaphat as he demanded. Some Arabs brought him flocks: seventy-seven hundred sheep and seventy-seven hundred goats.
2CH.17.12	Jehoshaphat grew more and more powerful. He built strong, walled cities and towns for storing supplies in Judah. 
2CH.17.13	He kept many supplies in the towns of Judah, and he kept trained soldiers in Jerusalem. 
2CH.17.14	These soldiers were listed by families. From the families of Judah, these were the commanders of groups of a thousand men: Adnah was the commander of three hundred thousand soldiers; 
2CH.17.15	Jehohanan was the commander of two hundred eighty thousand soldiers; 
2CH.17.16	Amasiah was the commander of two hundred thousand soldiers. Amasiah son of Zicri had volunteered to serve the L
2CH.17.17	These were the commanders from the families of Benjamin: Eliada, a brave soldier, had two hundred thousand soldiers who used bows and shields. 
2CH.17.18	And Jehozabad had one hundred eighty thousand men armed for war.
2CH.17.19	All these soldiers served King Jehoshaphat. The king also put other men in the strong, walled cities through all of Judah.
2CH.18.1	Jehoshaphat had much wealth and honor, and he made an agreement with King Ahab through marriage. 
2CH.18.2	A few years later Jehoshaphat went to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab sacrificed many sheep and cattle as a great feast to honor Jehoshaphat and the people with him. He encouraged Jehoshaphat to attack Ramoth in Gilead. 
2CH.18.3	Ahab king of Israel asked Jehoshaphat king of Judah, “Will you go with me to attack Ramoth in Gilead?”
2CH.18.3	Jehoshaphat answered, “I will go with you, and my soldiers are yours. We will join you in the battle.” 
2CH.18.4	Jehoshaphat also said to Ahab, “But first we should ask if this is the L
2CH.18.5	So King Ahab called four hundred prophets together and asked them, “Should we go to war against Ramoth in Gilead or not?”
2CH.18.5	They answered, “Go, because God will hand them over to you.”
2CH.18.6	But Jehoshaphat asked, “Isn’t there a prophet of the L
2CH.18.7	Then King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “There is one other prophet. We could ask the L
2CH.18.7	Jehoshaphat said, “King Ahab, you shouldn’t say that!”
2CH.18.8	So Ahab king of Israel told one of his officers to bring Micaiah to him at once.
2CH.18.9	Ahab king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah had on their royal robes and were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor, near the entrance to the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were standing before them speaking their messages. 
2CH.18.10	Zedekiah son of Kenaanah had made some iron horns. He said to Ahab, “This is what the L
2CH.18.11	All the other prophets said the same thing, “Attack Ramoth in Gilead and win, because the L
2CH.18.12	The messenger who had gone to get Micaiah said to him, “All the other prophets are saying King Ahab will win. You should agree with them and give the king a good answer.”
2CH.18.13	But Micaiah answered, “As surely as the L
2CH.18.14	When Micaiah came to Ahab, the king asked him, “Micaiah, should we attack Ramoth in Gilead or not?”
2CH.18.14	Micaiah answered, “Attack and win! They will be handed over to you.”
2CH.18.15	But Ahab said to Micaiah, “How many times do I have to tell you to speak only the truth to me in the name of the L
2CH.18.16	So Micaiah answered, “I saw the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd. The L
2CH.18.17	Then Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I told you! He never prophesies anything good about me, but only bad.”
2CH.18.18	But Micaiah said, “Hear the message from the L
2CH.18.19	The L
2CH.18.19	“Some said one thing; some said another. 
2CH.18.20	Then one spirit came and stood before the L
2CH.18.20	“The L
2CH.18.21	“The spirit answered, ‘I will go to Ahab’s prophets and make them tell lies.’
2CH.18.21	“So the L

2CH.18.24	Micaiah answered, “You will find out on the day you go to hide in an inside room.”
2CH.18.25	Then Ahab king of Israel ordered, “Take Micaiah and send him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Joash, the king’s son. 
2CH.18.26	Tell them I said to put this man in prison and give him only bread and water until I return safely from the battle.”
2CH.18.27	Micaiah said, “Ahab, if you come back safely from the battle, the L
2CH.18.28	So Ahab king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went to Ramoth in Gilead. 
2CH.18.29	King Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, “I will go into battle, but I will wear other clothes so no one will recognize me. But you wear your royal clothes.” So Ahab wore other clothes, and they went into battle.
2CH.18.30	The king of Aram ordered his chariot commanders, “Don’t fight with anyone—important or unimportant—except the king of Israel.” 
2CH.18.31	When these commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they thought he was the king of Israel, so they turned to attack him. But Jehoshaphat began shouting, and the L
2CH.18.32	When they saw he was not King Ahab, they stopped chasing him.
2CH.18.33	By chance, a soldier shot an arrow which hit Ahab king of Israel between the pieces of his armor. King Ahab said to his chariot driver, “Turn around and get me out of the battle, because I am hurt!” 
2CH.18.34	The battle continued all day. King Ahab held himself up in his chariot and faced the Arameans until evening. Then he died at sunset.
2CH.19.1	Jehoshaphat king of Judah came back safely to his palace in Jerusalem. 
2CH.19.2	Jehu son of Hanani, a seer, went out to meet him and said to the king, “Why did you help evil people? Why do you love those who hate the L
2CH.19.3	But there is some good in you. You took the Asherah idols out of this country, and you have tried to obey God.”
2CH.19.4	Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem. He went out again to be with the people, from Beersheba to the mountains of Ephraim, and he turned them back to the L
2CH.19.5	Jehoshaphat appointed judges in all the land, in each of the strong, walled cities of Judah. 
2CH.19.6	Jehoshaphat said to them, “Watch what you do, because you are not judging for people but for the L
2CH.19.7	Now let each of you fear the L
2CH.19.8	And in Jerusalem Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites, priests, and leaders of Israelite families to be judges. They were to decide cases about the law of the L
2CH.19.9	Jehoshaphat commanded them, “You must always serve the L
2CH.19.10	Your people living in the cities will bring you cases about killing, about the teachings, commands, rules, or some other law. In all these cases you must warn the people not to sin against the L
2CH.19.11	“Amariah, the leading priest, will be over you in all cases about the L
2CH.20.1	Later the Moabites, Ammonites, and some Meunites came to start a war with Jehoshaphat. 
2CH.20.2	Messengers came and told Jehoshaphat, “A large army is coming against you from Edom, from the other side of the Dead Sea. They are already in Hazazon Tamar!” (Hazazon Tamar is also called En Gedi.) 
2CH.20.3	Jehoshaphat was afraid, so he decided to ask the L
2CH.20.4	The people of Judah came together to ask the L
2CH.20.5	The people of Judah and Jerusalem met in front of the new courtyard in the Temple of the L
2CH.20.6	and he said, “L
2CH.20.7	Our God, you forced out the people who lived in this land as your people Israel moved in. And you gave this land forever to the descendants of your friend Abraham. 
2CH.20.8	They lived in this land and built a Temple for you. They said, 
2CH.20.9	‘If trouble comes upon us, or war, punishment, sickness, or hunger, we will stand before you and before this Temple where you have chosen to be worshiped. We will cry out to you when we are in trouble. Then you will hear and save us.’
2CH.20.10	“But now here are men from Ammon, Moab, and Edom. You wouldn’t let the Israelites enter their lands when the Israelites came from Egypt. So the Israelites turned away and did not destroy them. 
2CH.20.11	But see how they repay us for not destroying them! They have come to force us out of your land, which you gave us as our own. 
2CH.20.12	Our God, punish those people. We have no power against this large army that is attacking us. We don’t know what to do, so we look to you for help.”
2CH.20.13	All the men of Judah stood before the L
2CH.20.14	Then the Spirit of the L
2CH.20.15	He said, “Listen to me, King Jehoshaphat and all you people living in Judah and Jerusalem. The L
2CH.20.16	Tomorrow go down there and fight those people. They will come up through the Pass of Ziz. You will find them at the end of the ravine that leads to the Desert of Jeruel. 
2CH.20.17	You won’t need to fight in this battle. Just stand strong in your places, and you will see the L
2CH.20.18	Jehoshaphat bowed facedown on the ground. All the people of Judah and Jerusalem bowed down before the L
2CH.20.19	Then some Levites from the Kohathite and Korahite people stood up and praised the L
2CH.20.20	Jehoshaphat’s army went out into the Desert of Tekoa early in the morning. As they were starting out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Listen to me, people of Judah and Jerusalem. Have faith in the L
2CH.20.21	Jehoshaphat listened to the people’s advice. Then he chose men to be singers to the L
2CH.20.21	“Thank the L
2CH.20.21	because his love continues forever.”
2CH.20.22	As they began to sing and praise God, the L
2CH.20.23	The Ammonites and Moabites attacked the Edomites, destroying them completely. After they had killed the Edomites, they killed each other.
2CH.20.24	When the men from Judah came to a place where they could see the desert, they looked at the enemy’s large army. But they only saw dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped. 
2CH.20.25	When Jehoshaphat and his army came to take their valuables, they found many supplies, much clothing, and other valuable things. There was more than they could carry away; there was so much it took three days to gather it all. 
2CH.20.26	On the fourth day Jehoshaphat and his army met in the Valley of Beracah and praised the L
2CH.20.27	Then Jehoshaphat led all the men from Judah and Jerusalem back to Jerusalem. The L
2CH.20.28	They entered Jerusalem with harps, lyres, and trumpets and went to the Temple of the L
2CH.20.29	When all the kingdoms of the lands around them heard how the L
2CH.20.30	So Jehoshaphat’s kingdom was not at war. His God gave him peace from all the countries around him.
2CH.20.31	Jehoshaphat ruled over the country of Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. His mother’s name was Azubah daughter of Shilhi. 
2CH.20.32	Jehoshaphat was good like his father Asa, and he did what the L
2CH.20.33	But the places where gods were worshiped were not removed, and the people did not really want to follow the God of their ancestors.
2CH.20.34	The other things Jehoshaphat did as king, from the beginning to the end, are written in the records of Jehu son of Hanani, which are in the book of the kings of Israel.
2CH.20.35	Later, Jehoshaphat king of Judah made a treaty with Ahaziah king of Israel, which was a wrong thing to do. 
2CH.20.36	Jehoshaphat agreed with Ahaziah to build trading ships, which they built in the town of Ezion Geber. 
2CH.20.37	Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu from the town of Mareshah spoke against Jehoshaphat. He said, “Jehoshaphat, because you joined with Ahaziah, the L
2CH.21.1	Jehoshaphat died and was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, the city of David. Then his son Jehoram became king in his place. 
2CH.21.2	Jehoram’s brothers were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah. They were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Judah. 
2CH.21.3	Jehoshaphat gave his sons many gifts of silver, gold, and valuable things, and he gave them strong, walled cities in Judah. But Jehoshaphat gave the kingdom to Jehoram, because he was the first son.
2CH.21.4	When Jehoram took control of his father’s kingdom, he killed all his brothers with a sword and also killed some of the leaders of Judah. 
2CH.21.5	He was thirty-two years old when he began to rule, and he ruled eight years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.21.6	He followed in the ways of the kings of Israel, just as the family of Ahab had done, because he married Ahab’s daughter. Jehoram did what the L
2CH.21.7	But the L
2CH.21.8	In Jehoram’s time, Edom broke away from Judah’s rule and chose their own king. 
2CH.21.9	So Jehoram went to Edom with all his commanders and chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but Jehoram got up and attacked the Edomites at night. 
2CH.21.10	From then until now the country of Edom has fought against the rule of Judah. At the same time the people of Libnah also broke away from Jehoram because Jehoram left the L
2CH.21.11	Jehoram also built places to worship gods on the hills in Judah. He led the people of Jerusalem to sin, and he led the people of Judah away from the L
2CH.21.12	Then Jehoram received this letter from Elijah the prophet:
2CH.21.12	This is what the L
2CH.21.13	But you have lived as the kings of Israel lived, leading the people of Judah and Jerusalem to sin against God, as Ahab and his family did. You have killed your brothers, and they were better than you. 
2CH.21.14	So now the L
2CH.21.15	You will have a terrible disease in your intestines that will become worse every day. Finally it will cause your intestines to come out.”
2CH.21.16	The L
2CH.21.17	So the Philistines and Arabs attacked Judah and carried away all the wealth of Jehoram’s palace, as well as his sons and wives. Only Jehoram’s youngest son, Ahaziah, was left.
2CH.21.18	After these things happened, the L
2CH.21.19	After he was sick for two years, Jehoram’s intestines came out because of the disease, and he died in terrible pain. The people did not make a fire to honor Jehoram as they had done for his ancestors.
2CH.21.20	Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled eight years in Jerusalem. No one was sad when he died. He was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the graves for the kings.
2CH.22.1	The people of Jerusalem chose Ahaziah, Jehoram’s youngest son, to be king in his place. The robbers who had come with the Arabs to attack Jehoram’s camp had killed all of Jehoram’s older sons. So Ahaziah began to rule Judah. 
2CH.22.2	Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he ruled one year in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Athaliah, a granddaughter of Omri. 
2CH.22.3	Ahaziah followed the ways of Ahab’s family, because his mother encouraged him to do wrong. 
2CH.22.4	Ahaziah did what the L
2CH.22.5	Following their advice, Ahaziah went with Joram son of Ahab to Ramoth in Gilead, where they fought against Hazael king of Aram. The Arameans wounded Joram. 
2CH.22.6	So Joram returned to Jezreel to heal from the wounds he received at Ramoth when he fought Hazael king of Aram.
2CH.22.6	Ahaziah son of Jehoram and king of Judah went down to visit Joram son of Ahab at Jezreel because he had been wounded.
2CH.22.7	God caused Ahaziah’s death when he went to visit Joram. Ahaziah arrived and went out with Joram to meet Jehu son of Nimshi, whom the L
2CH.22.8	While Jehu was punishing Ahab’s family, he found the leaders of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah’s relatives who served Ahaziah, and Jehu killed them all. 
2CH.22.9	Then Jehu looked for Ahaziah. Jehu’s men caught him hiding in Samaria, so they brought him to Jehu. Then they killed and buried him. They said, “Ahaziah is a descendant of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat obeyed the L
2CH.22.10	When Ahaziah’s mother, Athaliah, saw that her son was dead, she killed all the royal family in Judah. 
2CH.22.11	But Jehosheba, King Jehoram’s daughter, took Joash, Ahaziah’s son. She stole him from among the other sons of the king who were going to be murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom. So Jehosheba, who was King Jehoram’s daughter and Ahaziah’s sister and the wife of Jehoiada the priest, hid Joash so Athaliah could not kill him. 
2CH.22.12	He hid with them in the Temple of God for six years. During that time Athaliah ruled the land.
2CH.23.1	In the seventh year Jehoiada decided to do something. He made an agreement with the commanders of the groups of a hundred men: Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zicri. 
2CH.23.2	They went around in Judah and gathered the Levites from all the towns, and they gathered the leaders of the families of Judah. Then they went to Jerusalem. 
2CH.23.3	All the people together made an agreement with the king in the Temple of God.
2CH.23.3	Jehoiada said to them, “The king’s son will rule, as the L
2CH.23.4	Now this is what you must do: You priests and Levites go on duty on the Sabbath. A third of you will guard the doors. 
2CH.23.5	A third of you will be at the king’s palace, and a third of you will be at the Foundation Gate. All the other people will stay in the courtyards of the Temple of the L
2CH.23.6	Don’t let anyone come into the Temple of the L
2CH.23.7	The Levites must stay near the king, each man with his weapon in his hand. If anyone tries to enter the Temple, kill him. Stay close to the king when he goes in and when he goes out.”
2CH.23.8	The Levites and all the people of Judah obeyed everything Jehoiada the priest had commanded. He did not excuse anyone from the groups of the priests. So each commander took his men who came on duty on the Sabbath with those who went off duty on the Sabbath. 
2CH.23.9	Jehoiada gave the commanders of a hundred men the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to King David and that were kept in the Temple of God. 
2CH.23.10	Then Jehoiada told the soldiers where to stand with weapon in hand. There were guards from the south side of the Temple to the north side. They stood by the altar and the Temple and around the king.
2CH.23.11	Jehoiada and his sons brought out the king’s son and put the crown on him and gave him a copy of the agreement. Then they appointed him king and poured olive oil on him and shouted, “Long live the king!”
2CH.23.12	When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king, she went to them at the Temple of the L
2CH.23.13	She looked, and there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance. The officers and the trumpeters were standing beside him, and all the people of the land were happy and blowing trumpets. The singers were playing musical instruments and leading praises. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and screamed, “Traitors! Traitors!”
2CH.23.14	Jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of a hundred men, who led the army. He said, “Surround her with soldiers and take her out of the Temple area. Kill with a sword anyone who follows her.” He had said, “Don’t put Athaliah to death in the Temple of the L
2CH.23.15	So they caught her when she came to the entrance of the Horse Gate near the palace. There they put her to death.
2CH.23.16	Then Jehoiada made an agreement with the people and the king that they would be the L
2CH.23.17	All the people went to the temple of Baal and tore it down, smashing the altars and idols. They killed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars.
2CH.23.18	Then Jehoiada chose the priests, who were Levites, to be responsible for the Temple of the L
2CH.23.19	Jehoiada put guards at the gates of the Temple of the L
2CH.23.20	Jehoiada took with him the commanders of a hundred men, the important men, the rulers of the people, and all the people of the land to take the king out of the Temple of the L
2CH.23.21	So all the people of the land were very happy, and Jerusalem had peace, because Athaliah had been put to death with the sword.
2CH.24.1	Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he ruled forty years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Zibiah, and she was from Beersheba. 
2CH.24.2	Joash did what the L
2CH.24.3	Jehoiada chose two wives for Joash, and Joash had sons and daughters.
2CH.24.4	Later, Joash decided to repair the Temple of the L
2CH.24.5	He called the priests and the Levites together and said to them, “Go to the towns of Judah and gather the money all the Israelites have to pay every year. Use it to repair the Temple of your God. Do this now.” But the Levites did not hurry.
2CH.24.6	So King Joash called for Jehoiada the leading priest and said to him, “Why haven’t you made the Levites bring in from Judah and Jerusalem the tax money that Moses, the L
2CH.24.7	In the past the sons of wicked Athaliah had broken into the Temple of God and used its holy things for worshiping the Baal idols.
2CH.24.8	King Joash commanded that a box for contributions be made. They put it outside, at the gate of the Temple of the L
2CH.24.9	Then the Levites made an announcement in Judah and Jerusalem, telling people to bring to the L
2CH.24.10	All the officers and people were happy to bring their money, and they put it in the box until the box was full. 
2CH.24.11	When the Levites would take the box to the king’s officers, they would see that it was full of money. Then the king’s royal secretary and the leading priest’s officer would come and take out the money and return the box to its place. They did this often and gathered much money. 
2CH.24.12	King Joash and Jehoiada gave the money to the people who worked on the Temple of the L
2CH.24.13	The people worked hard, and the work to repair the Temple went well. They rebuilt the Temple of God to be as it was before, but even stronger. 
2CH.24.14	When the workers finished, they brought the money that was left to King Joash and Jehoiada. They used that money to make utensils for the Temple of the L
2CH.24.15	Jehoiada grew old and lived many years. Then he died when he was one hundred thirty years old. 
2CH.24.16	Jehoiada was buried in Jerusalem with the kings, because he had done much good in Judah for God and his Temple.
2CH.24.17	After Jehoiada died, the officers of Judah came and bowed down to King Joash, and he listened to them. 
2CH.24.18	The king and these leaders stopped worshiping in the Temple of the L
2CH.24.19	Even though the L
2CH.24.20	Then the Spirit of God entered Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. Zechariah stood before the people and said, “This is what God says: ‘Why do you disobey the L
2CH.24.21	But the king and his officers made plans against Zechariah. At the king’s command they threw stones at him in the courtyard of the Temple of the L
2CH.24.22	King Joash did not remember Jehoiada’s kindness to him, so Joash killed Zechariah, Jehoiada’s son. Before Zechariah died, he said, “May the L
2CH.24.23	At the end of the year, the Aramean army came against Joash. They attacked Judah and Jerusalem, killed all the leaders of the people, and sent all the valuable things to their king in Damascus. 
2CH.24.24	The Aramean army came with only a small group of men, but the L
2CH.24.25	When the Arameans left, Joash was badly wounded. His own officers made plans against him because he had killed Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. So they killed Joash in his own bed. He died and was buried in Jerusalem but not in the graves of the kings.
2CH.24.26	The officers who made plans against Joash were Jozabad and Jehozabad. Jozabad was the son of Shimeath, a woman from Ammon. And Jehozabad was the son of Shimrith, a woman from Moab. 
2CH.24.27	The story of Joash’s sons, the great prophecies against him, and how he repaired the Temple of God are written in the book of the kings. Joash’s son Amaziah became king in his place.
2CH.25.1	Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddin, and she was from Jerusalem. 
2CH.25.2	Amaziah did what the L
2CH.25.3	As soon as Amaziah took strong control of the kingdom, he executed the officers who had murdered his father the king. 
2CH.25.4	But Amaziah did not put to death their children. He obeyed what was written in the Book of Moses, where the L
2CH.25.5	Amaziah gathered the people of Judah together. He grouped all the people of Judah and Benjamin by families, and he put commanders over groups of a thousand and over groups of a hundred. He counted the men who were twenty years old and older. In all there were three hundred thousand soldiers ready to fight and skilled with spears and shields. 
2CH.25.6	Amaziah also hired one hundred thousand soldiers from Israel for about seventy-five hundred pounds of silver. 
2CH.25.7	But a man of God came to Amaziah and said, “My king, don’t let the army of Israel go with you. The L
2CH.25.8	You can make yourself strong for war, but God will defeat you. He has the power to help you or to defeat you.”
2CH.25.9	Amaziah said to the man of God, “But what about the seventy-five hundred pounds of silver I paid to the Israelite army?”
2CH.25.9	The man of God answered, “The L
2CH.25.10	So Amaziah sent the Israelite army back home to Ephraim. They were very angry with the people of Judah and went home angry.
2CH.25.11	Then Amaziah became very brave and led his army to the Valley of Salt in the country of Edom. There Amaziah’s army killed ten thousand Edomites. 
2CH.25.12	The army of Judah also captured ten thousand and took them to the top of a cliff and threw them off so that they split open.
2CH.25.13	At the same time the Israelite troops that Amaziah had not let fight in the war were robbing towns in Judah. From Samaria to Beth Horon they killed three thousand people and took many valuable things.
2CH.25.14	When Amaziah came home after defeating the Edomites, he brought back the idols they worshiped and started to worship them himself. He bowed down to them and offered sacrifices to them. 
2CH.25.15	The L
2CH.25.16	As the prophet spoke, Amaziah said to him, “We never gave you the job of advising the king. Stop, or you will be killed.”
2CH.25.16	The prophet stopped speaking except to say, “I know that God has decided to destroy you because you have done this. You did not listen to my advice.”
2CH.25.17	Amaziah king of Judah talked with those who advised him. Then he sent a message to Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, who was the son of Jehu king of Israel. Amaziah said to Jehoash, “Come, let’s meet face to face.”
2CH.25.18	Then Jehoash king of Israel answered Amaziah king of Judah, “A thornbush in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar tree in Lebanon. It said, ‘Let your daughter marry my son.’ But then a wild animal from Lebanon came by, walking on and crushing the thornbush. 
2CH.25.19	You say to yourself that you have defeated Edom, but you have become proud, and you brag. But you stay at home! Don’t ask for trouble, or you and Judah will be defeated.”
2CH.25.20	But Amaziah would not listen. God caused this to happen so that Jehoash would defeat Judah, because Judah asked for help from the gods of Edom. 
2CH.25.21	So Jehoash king of Israel went to attack. He and Amaziah king of Judah faced each other in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah. 
2CH.25.22	Israel defeated Judah, and every man of Judah ran away to his home. 
2CH.25.23	At Beth Shemesh Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of Judah. (Amaziah was the son of Joash, who was the son of Ahaziah.) Then Jehoash brought him to Jerusalem. Jehoash broke down the wall of Jerusalem, from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, about six hundred feet. 
2CH.25.24	He took all the gold and silver and all the utensils from the Temple of God that Obed-Edom had taken care of. He also took the treasures from the palace and some hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.
2CH.25.25	Amaziah son of Joash, the king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel. 
2CH.25.26	The other things Amaziah did as king, from the beginning to the end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.25.27	When Amaziah stopped obeying the L
2CH.25.28	They brought his body back on horses, and he was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem, the city of David.
2CH.26.1	Then all the people of Judah made Uzziah king in place of his father Amaziah. Uzziah was sixteen years old. 
2CH.26.2	He rebuilt the town of Elath and made it part of Judah again after Amaziah died.
2CH.26.3	Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he ruled fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jecoliah, and she was from Jerusalem. 
2CH.26.4	He did what the L
2CH.26.5	Uzziah obeyed God while Zechariah was alive, because he taught Uzziah how to respect and obey God. And as long as Uzziah obeyed the L
2CH.26.6	Uzziah fought a war against the Philistines. He tore down the walls around their towns of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod and built new towns near Ashdod and in other places among the Philistines. 
2CH.26.7	God helped Uzziah fight the Philistines, the Arabs living in Gur Baal, and the Meunites. 
2CH.26.8	Also, the Ammonites made the payments Uzziah demanded. He was very powerful, so his name became famous all the way to the border of Egypt.
2CH.26.9	Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and where the wall turned, and he made them strong. 
2CH.26.10	He also built towers in the desert and dug many wells, because he had many cattle on the western hills and in the plains. He had people who worked his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands, because he loved the land.
2CH.26.11	Uzziah had an army of trained soldiers. They were counted and put in groups by Jeiel the royal secretary and Maaseiah the officer. Hananiah, one of the king’s commanders, was their leader. 
2CH.26.12	There were twenty-six hundred leaders over the soldiers. 
2CH.26.13	They were in charge of an army of three hundred seven thousand five hundred men who fought with great power to help the king against the enemy. 
2CH.26.14	Uzziah gave his army shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and stones for their slings. 
2CH.26.15	In Jerusalem Uzziah made cleverly designed devices. These devices on the towers and corners of the city walls were used to shoot arrows and large rocks. So Uzziah became famous in faraway places, because he had much help until he became powerful.
2CH.26.16	But when Uzziah became powerful, his pride led to his ruin. He was unfaithful to the L
2CH.26.17	Azariah and eighty other brave priests who served the L
2CH.26.18	They told him he was wrong and said to him, “You don’t have the right to burn incense to the L
2CH.26.19	Uzziah was standing beside the altar for incense in the Temple of the L
2CH.26.20	Azariah, the leading priest, and all the other priests looked at him and saw the skin disease on his forehead. So they hurried him out of the Temple. Uzziah also rushed out, because the L
2CH.26.21	So King Uzziah had the skin disease until the day he died. He had to live in a separate house and could not enter the Temple of the L
2CH.26.22	The other things Uzziah did as king, from beginning to end, were written down by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
2CH.26.23	Uzziah died and was buried near his ancestors in a graveyard that belonged to the kings. This was because people said, “He had a skin disease.” And his son Jotham became king in his place.
2CH.27.1	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jerusha daughter of Zadok. 
2CH.27.2	Jotham did what the L
2CH.27.3	Jotham rebuilt the Upper Gate of the Temple of the L
2CH.27.4	He also built towns in the hill country of Judah, as well as walled cities and towers in the forests.
2CH.27.5	Jotham also fought the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. So each year for three years they gave Jotham about seventy-five hundred pounds of silver, about sixty-two thousand bushels of wheat, and about sixty-two thousand bushels of barley. 
2CH.27.6	Jotham became powerful, because he always obeyed the L
2CH.27.7	The other things Jotham did while he was king and all his wars are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. 
2CH.27.8	Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.27.9	Jotham died and was buried in Jerusalem, the city of David. Then Jotham’s son Ahaz became king in his place.
2CH.28.1	Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he ruled sixteen years in Jerusalem. Unlike his ancestor David, he did not do what the L
2CH.28.2	Ahaz did the same things the kings of Israel had done. He made metal idols to worship Baal. 
2CH.28.3	He burned incense in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and made his children pass through the fire. He did the same hateful sins as the nations had done whom the L
2CH.28.4	Ahaz offered sacrifices and burned incense at the places where gods were worshiped, and on the hills, and under every green tree.
2CH.28.5	So the L
2CH.28.5	He also handed over Ahaz to Pekah king of Israel, and Pekah’s army killed many soldiers of Ahaz. 
2CH.28.6	The army of Pekah son of Remaliah killed one hundred twenty thousand brave soldiers from Judah in one day. Pekah defeated them because they had left the L
2CH.28.7	Zicri, a warrior from Ephraim, killed King Ahaz’s son Maaseiah. He also killed Azrikam, the officer in charge of the palace, and Elkanah, who was second in command to the king. 
2CH.28.8	The Israelite army captured two hundred thousand of their own relatives. They took women, sons and daughters, and many valuable things from Judah and carried them back to Samaria. 
2CH.28.9	But a prophet of the L
2CH.28.10	Now you plan to make the people of Judah and Jerusalem your slaves, but you also have sinned against the L
2CH.28.11	Now listen to me. Send back your brothers and sisters whom you captured, because the L
2CH.28.12	Then some of the leaders in Ephraim—Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai—met the Israelite soldiers coming home from war. 
2CH.28.13	They warned the soldiers, “Don’t bring the prisoners from Judah here. If you do, we will be guilty of sin against the L
2CH.28.14	So the soldiers left the prisoners and valuable things in front of the officers and people there. 
2CH.28.15	The leaders who were named took the prisoners and gave those who were naked the clothes that the Israelite army had taken. They gave the prisoners clothes, sandals, food, drink, and medicine. They put the weak prisoners on donkeys and took them back to their families in Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned home to Samaria.
2CH.28.16+2CH.28.17	At that time the Edomites came again and attacked Judah and carried away prisoners. So King Ahaz sent to the king of Assyria for help. 
2CH.28.18	The Philistines also robbed the towns in the western hills and in southern Judah. They captured the towns of Beth Shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco, Timnah, and Gimzo, and the villages around them. Then the Philistines lived in those towns. 
2CH.28.19	The L
2CH.28.20	Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria came to Ahaz, but he gave Ahaz trouble instead of help. 
2CH.28.21	Ahaz took some valuable things from the Temple of the L
2CH.28.22	During Ahaz’s troubles he was even more unfaithful to the L
2CH.28.23	He offered sacrifices to the gods of the people of Damascus, who had defeated him. He thought, “The gods of the kings of Aram helped them. If I offer sacrifices to them, they will help me also.” But this brought ruin to Ahaz and all Israel.
2CH.28.24	Ahaz gathered the things from the Temple of God and broke them into pieces. Then he closed the doors of the Temple of the L
2CH.28.25	In every town in Judah, Ahaz made places for burning sacrifices to worship other gods. So he made the L
2CH.28.26	The other things Ahaz did as king, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.28.27	Ahaz died and was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but not in the graves of the kings of Israel. Ahaz’s son Hezekiah became king in his place.
2CH.29.1	Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he ruled twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Abijah daughter of Zechariah. 
2CH.29.2	Hezekiah did what the L
2CH.29.3	Hezekiah opened the doors of the Temple of the L
2CH.29.4	Hezekiah brought in the priests and Levites and gathered them in the courtyard on the east side of the Temple. 
2CH.29.5	Hezekiah said, “Listen to me, Levites. Make yourselves ready for the L
2CH.29.6	Our ancestors were unfaithful to God and did what the L
2CH.29.7	They shut the doors of the porch of the Temple, and they let the fire go out in the lamps. They stopped burning incense and offering burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of Israel. 
2CH.29.8	So the L
2CH.29.9	That is why our ancestors were killed in battle and our sons, daughters, and wives were taken captive. 
2CH.29.10	Now I, Hezekiah, have decided to make an agreement with the L
2CH.29.11	My sons, don’t waste any more time. The L
2CH.29.12	These are the Levites who started to work. From the Kohathite family there were Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah. From the Merarite family there were Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel. From the Gershonite family there were Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah. 
2CH.29.13	From Elizaphan’s family there were Shimri and Jeiel. From Asaph’s family there were Zechariah and Mattaniah. 
2CH.29.14	From Heman’s family there were Jehiel and Shimei. From Jeduthun’s family there were Shemaiah and Uzziel.
2CH.29.15	These Levites gathered their brothers together and made themselves holy for service in the Temple. Then they went into the Temple of the L
2CH.29.16	When the priests went into the Temple of the L
2CH.29.17	Beginning on the first day of the first month, they made the Temple holy for the L
2CH.29.18	Then they went to King Hezekiah and said, “We have purified the entire Temple of the L
2CH.29.19	When Ahaz was king, he was unfaithful to God and removed some things from the Temple. But we have put them back and made them holy for the L
2CH.29.20	Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the leaders of the city and went up to the Temple of the L
2CH.29.21	They brought seven bulls, seven male sheep, seven lambs, and seven male goats. These animals were an offering to remove the sin of the people and the kingdom of Judah and to make the Temple ready for service to God. King Hezekiah commanded the priests, the descendants of Aaron, to offer these animals on the L
2CH.29.22	So the priests killed the bulls and sprinkled their blood on the altar. They killed the sheep and sprinkled their blood on the altar. Then they killed the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar. 
2CH.29.23	Then the priests brought the male goats for the sin offering before the king and the people there. After the king and the people put their hands on the goats, 
2CH.29.24	the priests killed them. With the goats’ blood they made an offering on the altar to remove the sins of the Israelites so they would belong to God. The king had said that the burnt offering and sin offering should be made for all Israel.
2CH.29.25	King Hezekiah put the Levites in the Temple of the L
2CH.29.26	So the Levites stood ready with David’s instruments of music, and the priests stood ready with their trumpets.
2CH.29.27	Then Hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the singing to the L
2CH.29.28	All the people worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpeters blew their trumpets until the burnt offering was finished.
2CH.29.29	When the sacrifices were completed, King Hezekiah and everyone with him bowed down and worshiped. 
2CH.29.30	King Hezekiah and his officers ordered the Levites to praise the L
2CH.29.31	Then Hezekiah said, “Now that you people of Judah have given yourselves to the L
2CH.29.32	For burnt offerings they brought a total of seventy bulls, one hundred male sheep, and two hundred lambs; all these animals were sacrificed as burnt offerings to the L
2CH.29.33	The holy offerings totaled six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats. 
2CH.29.34	There were not enough priests to skin all the animals for the burnt offerings. So their relatives the Levites helped them until the work was finished and other priests could be made holy. The Levites had been more careful to make themselves holy for the L
2CH.29.35	There were many burnt offerings along with the fat of fellowship offerings and drink offerings. So the service in the Temple of the L
2CH.29.36	And Hezekiah and the people were very happy that God had made it happen so quickly for his people.
2CH.30.1	King Hezekiah sent messages to all the people of Israel and Judah, and he wrote letters to the people of Ephraim and Manasseh. Hezekiah invited all these people to come to the Temple of the L
2CH.30.2	King Hezekiah, his officers, and all the people in Jerusalem agreed to celebrate the Passover in the second month. 
2CH.30.3	They could not celebrate it at the normal time, because not enough priests had made themselves ready to serve the L
2CH.30.4	This plan satisfied King Hezekiah and all the people. 
2CH.30.5	So they made an announcement everywhere in Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, telling the people to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover for the L
2CH.30.6	At the king’s command, the messengers took letters from him and his officers all through Israel and Judah. This is what the letters said:
2CH.30.6	People of Israel, return to the L
2CH.30.7	Don’t be like your ancestors or your relatives. They turned against the L
2CH.30.8	Don’t be stubborn as your ancestors were, but obey the L
2CH.30.9	Come back to the L
2CH.30.10	The messengers went to every town in Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the way to Zebulun, but the people laughed at them and made fun of them. 
2CH.30.11	But some men from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun were sorry for what they had done and went to Jerusalem. 
2CH.30.12	And God united all the people of Judah in obeying King Hezekiah and his officers, because their command had come from the L
2CH.30.13	In the second month a large crowd came together in Jerusalem to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread. 
2CH.30.14	The people removed the altars and incense altars to gods in Jerusalem and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
2CH.30.15	They killed the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and the Levites were ashamed, so they made themselves holy and brought burnt offerings into the Temple of the L
2CH.30.16	They took their regular places in the Temple as the Teachings of Moses, the man of God, commanded. The Levites gave the blood of the sacrifices to the priests, who sprinkled it on the altar. 
2CH.30.17	Since many people in the crowd had not made themselves holy, the Levites killed the Passover lambs for everyone who was not clean. The Levites made each lamb holy for the L
2CH.30.18+2CH.30.19	Although many people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not purified themselves for the feast, they ate the Passover even though it was against the law. So Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “L
2CH.30.20	The L
2CH.30.21	The Israelites in Jerusalem celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy to the L
2CH.30.22	Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites who showed they understood well how to do their service for the L
2CH.30.23	Then all the people agreed to stay seven more days, so they celebrated with joy for seven more days. 
2CH.30.24	Hezekiah king of Judah gave one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep to the people. The officers gave one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep to the people. Many priests made themselves holy. 
2CH.30.25	All the people of Judah, the priests, the Levites, those who came from Israel, the foreigners from Israel, and the foreigners living in Judah were very happy. 
2CH.30.26	There was much joy in Jerusalem, because there had not been a celebration like this since the time of Solomon son of David and king of Israel. 
2CH.30.27	The priests and Levites stood up and blessed the people, and God heard them because their prayer reached heaven, his holy home.
2CH.31.1	When the Passover celebration was finished, all the Israelites in Jerusalem went out to the towns of Judah. There they smashed the stone pillars used to worship gods. They cut down the Asherah idols and destroyed the altars and places for worshiping gods in all of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh. After they had destroyed all of them, the Israelites returned to their own towns and homes.
2CH.31.2	King Hezekiah appointed groups of priests and Levites for their special duties. They were to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings, to worship, and to give thanks and praise at the gates of the L
2CH.31.3	Hezekiah gave some of his own animals for the burnt offerings, which were given every morning and evening, on Sabbath days, during New Moons, and at other feasts commanded in the L
2CH.31.4	Hezekiah commanded the people living in Jerusalem to give the priests and Levites the portion that belonged to them. Then the priests and Levites could give all their time to the L
2CH.31.5	As soon as the king’s command went out to the Israelites, they gave freely of the first portion of their grain, new wine, oil, honey, and everything they grew in their fields. They brought a large amount, one-tenth of everything. 
2CH.31.6	The people of Israel and Judah who lived in Judah also brought one-tenth of their cattle and sheep and one-tenth of the holy things that were given to the L
2CH.31.7	The people began the piles in the third month and finished in the seventh month. 
2CH.31.8	When Hezekiah and his officers came and saw the piles, they praised the L
2CH.31.9	Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites about the piles.

2CH.31.13	Conaniah and his brother Shimei were over these supervisors: Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. King Hezekiah and Azariah the officer in charge of the Temple of God had chosen them.
2CH.31.14	Kore son of Imnah the Levite was in charge of the special gifts the people wanted to give to God. He was responsible for giving out the contributions made to the L
2CH.31.15	Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah helped Kore in the towns where the priests lived. They gave from what was collected to the other groups of priests, both young and old.
2CH.31.16	From what was collected, these men also gave to the males three years old and older who had their names in the Levite family histories. They were to enter the Temple of the L
2CH.31.17	The priests were given their part of the collection, by families, as listed in the family histories. The Levites twenty years old and older were given their part of the collection, based on their responsibilities and their groups. 
2CH.31.18	The Levites’ babies, wives, sons, and daughters also got part of the collection. This was done for all the Levites who were listed in the family histories, because they always kept themselves ready to serve the L
2CH.31.19	Some of Aaron’s descendants, the priests, lived on the farmlands near the towns or in the towns. Men were chosen by name to give part of the collection to these priests. All the males and those named in the family histories of the Levites received part of the collection.
2CH.31.20	This is what King Hezekiah did in Judah. He did what was good and right and obedient before the L
2CH.31.21	Hezekiah tried to obey God in his service of the Temple of God, and he tried to obey God’s teachings and commands. He gave himself fully to his work for God. So he had success.
2CH.32.1	After Hezekiah did all these things to serve the L
2CH.32.2	Hezekiah knew that Sennacherib had come to Jerusalem to attack it. 
2CH.32.3	So Hezekiah and his officers and army commanders decided to cut off the water from the springs outside the city. So the officers and commanders helped Hezekiah. 
2CH.32.4	Many people came and cut off all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land. They said, “The king of Assyria will not find much water when he comes here.” 
2CH.32.5	Then Hezekiah made Jerusalem stronger. He rebuilt all the broken parts of the wall and put towers on it. He also built another wall outside the first one and strengthened the area that was filled in on the east side of the old part of Jerusalem. He also made many weapons and shields.
2CH.32.6	Hezekiah put army commanders over the people and met with them at the open place near the city gate. Hezekiah encouraged them, saying, 
2CH.32.7	“Be strong and brave. Don’t be afraid or worried because of the king of Assyria or his large army. There is a greater power with us than with him. 
2CH.32.8	He only has men, but we have the L
2CH.32.9	After this King Sennacherib of Assyria and all his army surrounded and attacked Lachish. Then he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah in Jerusalem:
2CH.32.10	Sennacherib king of Assyria says this: “You have nothing to trust in to help you. It is no use for you to stay in Jerusalem under attack. 
2CH.32.11	Hezekiah says to you, ‘The L

2CH.32.13	“You know what my ancestors and I have done to all the people in other nations. The gods of those nations could not save their people from my power. 
2CH.32.14	My ancestors destroyed those nations; none of their gods could save them from me. So your god cannot save you from my power. 
2CH.32.15	Do not let Hezekiah fool you or trick you, and do not believe him. No god of any nation or kingdom has been able to save his people from me or my ancestors. Your god is even less able to save you from me.”
2CH.32.16	Sennacherib’s officers said worse things against the L
2CH.32.17	King Sennacherib also wrote letters insulting the L
2CH.32.18	Then the king’s officers shouted in Hebrew, calling out to the people of Jerusalem who were on the city wall. The officers wanted to scare the people away so they could capture Jerusalem. 
2CH.32.19	They spoke about the God of Jerusalem as though he were like the gods the people of the world worshiped, which are made by human hands.
2CH.32.20	King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz prayed to heaven about this. 
2CH.32.21	Then the L
2CH.32.22	So the L
2CH.32.23	Many people brought gifts for the L
2CH.32.24	At that time Hezekiah became so sick he almost died. When he prayed to the L
2CH.32.25	But Hezekiah did not thank God for his kindness, because he was so proud. So the L
2CH.32.26	But later Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem were sorry and stopped being proud, so the L
2CH.32.27	Hezekiah had many riches and much honor. He made treasuries for his silver, gold, gems, spices, shields, and other valuable things. 
2CH.32.28	He built storage buildings for grain, new wine, and oil and stalls for all the cattle and pens for the sheep. 
2CH.32.29	He also built many towns. He had many flocks and herds, because God had given Hezekiah much wealth.
2CH.32.30	It was Hezekiah who cut off the upper pool of the Gihon spring and made those waters flow straight down to the west side of the older part of Jerusalem. And Hezekiah was successful in everything he did. 
2CH.32.31	But one time the leaders of Babylon sent messengers to Hezekiah, asking him about a strange sign that had happened in the land. When they came, God left Hezekiah alone to test him so he could know everything that was in Hezekiah’s heart.
2CH.32.32	Hezekiah’s love for God and the other things he did as king are written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. This is in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel. 
2CH.32.33	Hezekiah died and was buried on a hill, where the graves of David’s ancestors are. All the people of Judah and Jerusalem honored Hezekiah when he died, and his son Manasseh became king in his place.
2CH.33.1	Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he was king for fifty-five years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.2	He did what the L
2CH.33.3	Manasseh’s father, Hezekiah, had torn down the places where gods were worshiped, but Manasseh rebuilt them. He also built altars for the Baal gods, and he made Asherah idols and worshiped all the stars of the sky and served them. 
2CH.33.4	The L
2CH.33.5	He built altars to worship the stars in the two courtyards of the Temple of the L
2CH.33.6	He made his children pass through fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. He practiced magic and witchcraft and told the future by explaining signs and dreams. He got advice from mediums and fortune-tellers. He did many things the L
2CH.33.7	Manasseh carved an idol and put it in the Temple of God. God had said to David and his son Solomon about the Temple, “I will be worshiped forever in this Temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel. 
2CH.33.8	I will never again make the Israelites leave the land I gave to their ancestors. But they must obey everything I have commanded them in all the teachings, rules, and commands I gave them through Moses.” 
2CH.33.9	But Manasseh led the people of Judah and Jerusalem to do wrong. They did more evil than the nations the L
2CH.33.10	The L
2CH.33.11	So the L
2CH.33.12	As Manasseh suffered, he begged the L
2CH.33.13	When Manasseh prayed, the L
2CH.33.14	After that happened, Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of Jerusalem and made it higher. It was in the valley on the west side of the Gihon spring and went to the entrance of the Fish Gate and around the hill of Ophel. Then he put commanders in all the strong, walled cities in Judah.
2CH.33.15	Manasseh removed the idols of other nations, including the idol in the Temple of the L
2CH.33.16	Then he set up the L
2CH.33.17	The people continued to offer sacrifices at the places of worship, but their sacrifices were only to the L
2CH.33.18	The other things Manasseh did as king, his prayer to his God, and what the seers said to him in the name of the L
2CH.33.19	Manasseh’s prayer and God’s pity for him, his sins, his unfaithfulness, the places he built for worshiping gods and the Asherah idols before he humbled himself—all are written in the book of the seers. 
2CH.33.20	Manasseh died and was buried in his palace. Then Manasseh’s son Amon became king in his place.
2CH.33.21	Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he was king for two years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.33.22	He did what the L
2CH.33.23	Amon did not humble himself before the L
2CH.33.24	King Amon’s officers made plans against him and killed him in his palace. 
2CH.33.25	Then the people of the land killed all those who had made plans to kill King Amon, and they made his son Josiah king in his place.
2CH.34.1	Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he ruled thirty-one years in Jerusalem. 
2CH.34.2	He did what the L
2CH.34.3	In his eighth year as king while he was still young, Josiah began to obey the God of his ancestor David. In his twelfth year as king, Josiah began to remove from Judah and Jerusalem the gods, the places for worshiping gods, the Asherah idols, and the wooden and metal idols. 
2CH.34.4	The people tore down the altars for the Baal gods as Josiah directed. Then Josiah cut down the incense altars that were above them. He broke up the Asherah idols and the wooden and metal idols and beat them into powder. Then he sprinkled the powder on the graves of the people who had offered sacrifices to these gods. 
2CH.34.5	He burned the bones of their priests on their own altars. So Josiah removed idol worship from Judah and Jerusalem, 
2CH.34.6	and from the towns in the areas of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon all the way to Naphtali, and in the ruins near these towns. 
2CH.34.7	Josiah broke down the altars and Asherah idols and beat the idols into powder. He cut down all the incense altars in all of Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
2CH.34.8	In Josiah’s eighteenth year as king, he made Judah and the Temple pure again. He sent Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the city leader, and Joah son of Joahaz the recorder to repair the Temple of the L
2CH.34.9	These men went to Hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money the Levite gatekeepers had gathered from the people of Manasseh, Ephraim, and all the Israelites who were left alive, and also from all the people of Judah, Benjamin, and Jerusalem. This is the money they had brought into the Temple of God. 
2CH.34.10	Then the Levites gave it to the supervisors of the work on the Temple of the L
2CH.34.11	They gave money to carpenters and builders to buy cut stone and wood. The wood was used to rebuild the buildings and to make beams for them, because the kings of Judah had let the buildings fall into ruin. 
2CH.34.12	The men did their work well. Their supervisors were Jahath and Obadiah, who were Levites from the family of Merari, and Zechariah and Meshullam, who were from the family of Kohath. These Levites were all skilled musicians. 
2CH.34.13	They were also in charge of the workers who carried loads and all the other workers. Some Levites worked as secretaries, officers, and gatekeepers.
2CH.34.14	The Levites brought out the money that was in the Temple of the L
2CH.34.15	Hilkiah said to Shaphan the royal secretary, “I’ve found the Book of the Teachings in the Temple of the L
2CH.34.16	Shaphan took the book to the king and reported to Josiah, “Your officers are doing everything you told them to do. 
2CH.34.17	They have paid out the money that was in the Temple of the L
2CH.34.18	Then Shaphan the royal secretary told the king, “Hilkiah the priest has given me a book.” And Shaphan read from the book to the king.
2CH.34.19	When the king heard the words of the Teachings, he tore his clothes to show how upset he was. 
2CH.34.20	He gave orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the royal secretary, and Asaiah, the king’s servant. These were the orders: 
2CH.34.21	“Go and ask the L
2CH.34.22	So Hilkiah and those the king sent with him went to talk to Huldah the prophetess. She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, who took care of the king’s clothes. Huldah lived in Jerusalem, in the new area of the city.
2CH.34.23	She said to them, “This is what the L
2CH.34.24	‘This is what the L
2CH.34.25	The people of Judah have left me and have burned incense to other gods. They have made me angry by all the evil things they have made. So I will punish them in my anger, which will not be put out.’ 
2CH.34.26	Tell the king of Judah, who sent you to ask the L
2CH.34.27	When you heard my words against this place and its people, you became sorry for what you had done and you humbled yourself before me. You tore your clothes to show how upset you were, and you cried in my presence. This is why I have heard you, says the L
2CH.34.28	So I will let you die and be buried in peace. You won’t see all the trouble I will bring to this place and the people living here.’ ”
2CH.34.28	So they took her message back to the king.
2CH.34.29	Then the king gathered all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem together. 
2CH.34.30	He went up to the Temple of the L
2CH.34.31	The king stood by his pillar and made an agreement in the presence of the L
2CH.34.32	Then Josiah made all the people in Jerusalem and Benjamin promise to accept the agreement. So the people of Jerusalem obeyed the agreement of God, the God of their ancestors.
2CH.34.33	And Josiah threw out the hateful idols from all the land that belonged to the Israelites. He led everyone in Israel to serve the L
2CH.35.1	King Josiah celebrated the Passover to the L
2CH.35.2	Josiah chose the priests to do their duties, and he encouraged them as they served in the Temple of the L
2CH.35.3	The Levites taught the Israelites and were made holy for service to the L
2CH.35.4	Prepare yourselves by your family groups for service, and do the jobs that King David and his son Solomon gave you to do.
2CH.35.5	“Stand in the holy place with a group of the Levites for each family group of the people. 
2CH.35.6	Kill the Passover lambs, and make yourselves holy to the L
2CH.35.7	Josiah gave the Israelites thirty thousand sheep and goats to kill for the Passover sacrifices, and he gave them three thousand cattle. They were all his own animals.
2CH.35.8	Josiah’s officers also gave willingly to the people, the priests, and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the officers in charge of the Temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred lambs and goats and three hundred cattle for Passover sacrifices. 
2CH.35.9	Conaniah, his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad gave the Levites five thousand sheep and goats and five hundred cattle for Passover sacrifices. These men were leaders of the Levites.
2CH.35.10	When everything was ready for the Passover service, the priests and Levites went to their places, as the king had commanded. 
2CH.35.11	The Passover lambs were killed. Then the Levites skinned the animals and gave the blood to the priests, who sprinkled it on the altar. 
2CH.35.12	Then they gave the animals for the burnt offerings to the different family groups so the burnt offerings could be offered to the L
2CH.35.13	The Levites roasted the Passover sacrifices over the fire as they were commanded, and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, kettles, and pans. Then they quickly gave the meat to the people. 
2CH.35.14	After this was finished, the Levites prepared meat for themselves and for the priests, the descendants of Aaron. The priests worked until night, offering the burnt offerings and burning the fat of the sacrifices.
2CH.35.15	The Levite singers from Asaph’s family stood in the places chosen for them by King David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king’s seer. The gatekeepers at each gate did not have to leave their places, because their fellow Levites had prepared everything for them for the Passover.
2CH.35.16	So everything was done that day for the worship of the L
2CH.35.17	The Israelites who were there celebrated the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days. 
2CH.35.18	The Passover had not been celebrated like this in Israel since the prophet Samuel was alive. None of the kings of Israel had ever celebrated a Passover like it was celebrated by King Josiah, the priests, the Levites, the people of Judah and Israel who were there, and the people of Jerusalem. 
2CH.35.19	This Passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year Josiah was king.
2CH.35.20	After Josiah did all this for the Temple, Neco king of Egypt led an army to attack Carchemish, a town on the Euphrates River. And Josiah marched out to fight against Neco. 
2CH.35.21	But Neco sent messengers to Josiah, saying, “King Josiah, there should not be war between us. I did not come to fight you, but my enemies. God told me to hurry, and he is on my side. So don’t fight God, or he will destroy you.”
2CH.35.22	But Josiah did not go away. He wore different clothes so no one would know who he was. Refusing to listen to what Neco said at God’s command, Josiah went to fight on the plain of Megiddo. 
2CH.35.23	In the battle King Josiah was shot by archers. He told his servants, “Take me away because I am badly wounded.” 
2CH.35.24	So they took him out of his chariot and put him in another chariot and carried him to Jerusalem. There he died and was buried in the graves where his ancestors were buried. All the people of Judah and Jerusalem were very sad because he was dead.
2CH.35.25	Jeremiah wrote some sad songs about Josiah. Even to this day all the men and women singers remember and honor Josiah with these songs. It became a custom in Israel to sing these songs that are written in the collection of sad songs.
2CH.35.26+2CH.35.27	The other things Josiah did as king, from beginning to end, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. It tells how he loved what was written in the L
2CH.36.1	The people of Judah chose Josiah’s son Jehoahaz and made him king in Jerusalem in his father’s place.
2CH.36.2	Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he was king in Jerusalem for three months. 
2CH.36.3	Then King Neco of Egypt removed Jehoahaz from being king in Jerusalem. Neco made the people of Judah pay about seventy-five hundred pounds of silver and about seventy-five pounds of gold. 
2CH.36.4	The king of Egypt made Jehoahaz’s brother Eliakim the king of Judah and Jerusalem and changed his name to Jehoiakim. But Neco took his brother Jehoahaz to Egypt.
2CH.36.5	Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he was king in Jerusalem for eleven years. He did what the L
2CH.36.6	King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked Judah, captured Jehoiakim, put bronze chains on him, and took him to Babylon. 
2CH.36.7	Nebuchadnezzar removed some of the things from the Temple of the L
2CH.36.8	The other things Jehoiakim did as king, the hateful things he did, and everything he was guilty of doing, are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah. And Jehoiakim’s son Jehoiachin became king in his place.
2CH.36.9	Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king of Judah, and he was king in Jerusalem for three months and ten days. He did what the L
2CH.36.10	In the spring King Nebuchadnezzar sent for Jehoiachin and brought him and some valuable treasures from the Temple of the L
2CH.36.11	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king of Judah, and he was king in Jerusalem for eleven years. 
2CH.36.12	Zedekiah did what the L
2CH.36.13	Zedekiah turned against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had forced him to swear in God’s name to be loyal to him. But Zedekiah became stubborn and refused to obey the L
2CH.36.14	Also, all the leaders of the priests and the people of Judah became more wicked, following the evil example of the other nations. The L
2CH.36.15	The L
2CH.36.16	But they made fun of God’s prophets and hated God’s messages. They refused to listen to the prophets until, finally, the L
2CH.36.17	So God brought the king of Babylon to attack them. The king killed the young men even when they were in the Temple. He had no mercy on the young men or women, the old men or those who were sick. God handed all of them over to Nebuchadnezzar. 
2CH.36.18	Nebuchadnezzar carried away to Babylon all the things from the Temple of God, both large and small, and all the treasures from the Temple of the L
2CH.36.19	Nebuchadnezzar and his army set fire to God’s Temple and broke down Jerusalem’s wall and burned all the palaces. They took or destroyed every valuable thing in Jerusalem.
2CH.36.20	Nebuchadnezzar took captive to Babylon the people who were left alive, and he forced them to be slaves for him and his descendants. They remained there as slaves until the Persian kingdom defeated Babylon. 
2CH.36.21	And so what the L

EZR.1.4	Those who stay behind, wherever they live, should support those who want to go. Give them silver and gold, supplies and cattle, and special gifts for the Temple of God in Jerusalem.
EZR.1.5	Then the family leaders of Judah and Benjamin and the priests and Levites got ready to go to Jerusalem—everyone God had caused to want to go to Jerusalem to build the Temple of the L
EZR.1.6	All their neighbors helped them, giving them things made of silver and gold, along with supplies, cattle, valuable gifts, and special gifts for the Temple. 
EZR.1.7	Also, King Cyrus brought out the bowls and pans that belonged in the Temple of the L
EZR.1.8	Cyrus king of Persia had Mithredath the treasurer bring them and count them out for Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah.
EZR.1.9	He listed thirty gold dishes, one thousand silver dishes, twenty-nine pans, 
EZR.1.10	thirty gold bowls, four hundred ten matching silver bowls, and one thousand other pieces.
EZR.1.11	There was a total of fifty-four hundred pieces of gold and silver. Sheshbazzar brought all these things along when the captives went from Babylon to Jerusalem.

EZR.2.59	Some people came to Jerusalem from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove that their ancestors came from Israel. 
EZR.2.60	They were the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda—652.
EZR.2.61	Also these priests: the descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai, who had married a daughter of Barzillai from Gilead and was called by her family name.
EZR.2.62	These people searched for their family records but could not find them. So they could not be priests, because they were thought to be unclean. 
EZR.2.63	The governor ordered them not to eat any of the food offered to God until a priest had settled this matter by using the Urim and Thummim.
EZR.2.64	The total number of those who returned was 42,360. 
EZR.2.65	This is not counting their 7,337 male and female servants and the 200 male and female singers they had with them. 
EZR.2.66	They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 
EZR.2.67	435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
EZR.2.68	When they arrived at the Temple of the L
EZR.2.69	They gave as much as they could to the treasury to rebuild the Temple—about 1,100 pounds of gold, about 6,000 pounds of silver, and 100 pieces of clothing for the priests.
EZR.2.70	All the Israelites settled in their hometowns. The priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and Temple servants, along with some of the other people, settled in their own towns as well.
EZR.3.1	In the seventh month, after the Israelites were settled in their hometowns, they met together in Jerusalem. 
EZR.3.2	Then Jeshua son of Jozadak and his fellow priests joined Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and began to build the altar of the God of Israel where they could offer burnt offerings, just as it is written in the Teachings of Moses, the man of God. 
EZR.3.3	Even though they were afraid of the people living around them, they built the altar where it had been before. And they offered burnt offerings on it to the L
EZR.3.4	Then, to obey what was written, they celebrated the Feast of Shelters. They offered the right number of sacrifices for each day of the festival. 
EZR.3.5	After the Feast of Shelters, they had regular sacrifices every day, as well as sacrifices for the New Moon and all the festivals commanded by the L
EZR.3.6	On the first day of the seventh month they began to bring burnt offerings to the L
EZR.3.7	Then they gave money to the bricklayers and carpenters. They also gave food, wine, and oil to the cities of Sidon and Tyre so they would float cedar logs from Lebanon to the seacoast town of Joppa. Cyrus king of Persia had given permission for this.
EZR.3.8	In the second month of the second year after their arrival at the Temple of God in Jerusalem, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jozadak, their fellow priests and Levites, and all who had returned from captivity to Jerusalem began to work. They chose Levites twenty years old and older to be in charge of the building of the Temple of the L
EZR.3.9	These men were in charge of the work of building the Temple of God: Jeshua and his sons and brothers; Kadmiel and his sons who were the descendants of Hodaviah; and the sons of Henadad and their sons and brothers. They were all Levites.
EZR.3.10	The builders finished laying the foundation of the Temple of the L
EZR.3.11	With praise and thanksgiving, they sang to the L
EZR.3.11	“He is good;
EZR.3.11	his love for Israel continues forever.”
EZR.3.11	And then all the people shouted loudly, “Praise the L
EZR.3.12	But many of the older priests, Levites, and family leaders who had seen the first Temple cried when they saw the foundation of this Temple. Most of the other people were shouting with joy. 
EZR.3.13	The people made so much noise it could be heard far away, and no one could tell the difference between the joyful shouting and the sad crying.
EZR.4.1	When the enemies of the people of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned captives were building a Temple for the L
EZR.4.2	they came to Zerubbabel and the leaders of the families. The enemies said, “Let us help you build, because we are like you and want to worship your God. We have been offering sacrifices to him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us here.”
EZR.4.3	But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the leaders of Israel answered, “You will not help us build a Temple to our God. We will build it ourselves for the L
EZR.4.4	Then the people around them tried to discourage the people of Judah by making them afraid to build. 
EZR.4.5	Their enemies hired others to delay the building plans during the time Cyrus was king of Persia. And it continued to the time Darius was king of Persia.
EZR.4.6	When Xerxes first became king, those enemies wrote a letter against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.4.7	When Artaxerxes became king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and those with them wrote a letter to Artaxerxes. It was written in the Aramaic language and translated.
EZR.4.8	Rehum the governor and Shimshai the governor’s secretary wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king. It said:
EZR.4.9	This letter is from Rehum the governor, Shimshai the secretary, and their fellow workers—the judges and important officers over the men who came from Tripolis, Persia, Erech, and Babylon, the Elamite people of Susa, 
EZR.4.10	and those whom the great and honorable Ashurbanipal forced out of their countries and settled in the city of Samaria and in other places of the Trans-Euphrates.
EZR.4.11	(This is a copy of the letter they sent to Artaxerxes.)
EZR.4.11	To King Artaxerxes.
EZR.4.11	From your servants who live in Trans-Euphrates.
EZR.4.12	King Artaxerxes, you should know that the Jewish people who came to us from you have gone to Jerusalem to rebuild that evil city that refuses to obey. They are fixing the walls and repairing the foundations of the buildings.
EZR.4.13	Now, King Artaxerxes, you should know that if Jerusalem is built and its walls are fixed, Jerusalem will not pay taxes of any kind. Then the amount of money your government collects will be less. 
EZR.4.14	Since we must be loyal to the government, we don’t want to see the king dishonored. So we are writing to let the king know. 
EZR.4.15	We suggest you search the records of the kings who ruled before you. You will find out that the city of Jerusalem refuses to obey and makes trouble for kings and areas controlled by Persia. Since long ago it has been a place where disobedience has started. That is why it was destroyed. 
EZR.4.16	We want you to know, King Artaxerxes, that if this city is rebuilt and its walls fixed, you will be left with nothing in Trans-Euphrates.
EZR.4.17	King Artaxerxes sent this answer:
EZR.4.17	To Rehum the governor and Shimshai the secretary, to all their fellow workers living in Samaria, and to those in other places in Trans-Euphrates.
EZR.4.17	Greetings.
EZR.4.18	The letter you sent to us has been translated and read to me. 
EZR.4.19	I ordered the records to be searched, and it was done. We found that Jerusalem has a history of disobedience to kings and has been a place of problems and trouble. 
EZR.4.20	Jerusalem has had powerful kings who have ruled over the whole area of Trans-Euphrates, and taxes of all kinds have been paid to them. 
EZR.4.21	Now, give an order for those men to stop work. The city of Jerusalem will not be rebuilt until I say so. 
EZR.4.22	Make sure you do this, because if they continue, it will hurt the government.
EZR.4.23	A copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes sent was read to Rehum and Shimshai the secretary and the others. Then they quickly went to the Jewish people in Jerusalem and forced them to stop building.
EZR.4.24	So the work on the Temple of God in Jerusalem stopped until the second year Darius was king of Persia.
EZR.5.1	The prophets Haggai and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo, prophesied to the Jewish people in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them. 
EZR.5.2	Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jozadak started working again to rebuild the Temple of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were there, helping them.
EZR.5.3	At that time Tattenai, the governor of Trans-Euphrates, and Shethar-Bozenai, and their fellow workers went to the Jewish people and asked, “Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and fix these walls?” 
EZR.5.4	They also asked, “What are the names of the men working on this building?” 
EZR.5.5	But their God was watching over the elders of the Jewish people. The builders were not stopped until a report could go to King Darius and his written answer could be received.
EZR.5.6	This is a copy of the letter that was sent to King Darius by Tattenai, the governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and the other important officers of Trans-Euphrates. 
EZR.5.7	This is what was said in the report they sent to him:
EZR.5.7	To King Darius.
EZR.5.7	Greetings. May you have peace.
EZR.5.8	King Darius, you should know that we went to the district of Judah where the Temple of the great God is. The people are building that Temple with large stones, and they are putting timbers in the walls. They are working very hard and are building very fast.
EZR.5.9	We asked their elders, “Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and these walls?” 
EZR.5.10	We also asked for their names, and we wrote down the names of their leaders so you would know who they are.
EZR.5.11	This is the answer they gave to us: “We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth. We are rebuilding the Temple that a great king of Israel built and finished many years ago. 
EZR.5.12	But our ancestors made the God of heaven angry, so he handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who destroyed this Temple and took the people to Babylon as captives.
EZR.5.13	“Later, in the first year Cyrus was king of Babylon, he gave a special order for this Temple to be rebuilt. 
EZR.5.14	Cyrus brought out from the temple in Babylon the gold and silver bowls and pans that came from the Temple of God. Nebuchadnezzar had taken them from the Temple in Jerusalem and had put them in the temple in Babylon.
EZR.5.14	“Then King Cyrus gave them to Sheshbazzar, his appointed governor. 
EZR.5.15	Cyrus said to him, ‘Take these gold and silver bowls and pans, and put them back in the Temple in Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple of God where it was.’ 
EZR.5.16	So Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem. From that day until now the work has been going on, but it is not yet finished.”
EZR.5.17	Now, if the king wishes, let a search be made in the royal records of Babylon. See if King Cyrus gave an order to rebuild this Temple in Jerusalem. Then let the king write us and tell us what he has decided.
EZR.6.1	So King Darius gave an order to search the records kept in the treasury in Babylon. 
EZR.6.2	A scroll was found in Ecbatana, the capital city of Media. This is what was written on it:
EZR.6.2	Note:
EZR.6.3	King Cyrus gave an order about the Temple of God in Jerusalem in the first year he was king. This was the order:
EZR.6.3	“Let the Temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices. Let its foundations be laid; it should be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide. 
EZR.6.4	It must have three layers of large stones and then one layer of timbers. The costs should be paid from the king’s treasury. 
EZR.6.5	The gold and silver utensils from the Temple of God should be put back in their places. Nebuchadnezzar took them from the Temple in Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon, but they are to be put back in the Temple of God in Jerusalem.”
EZR.6.6	Now then, Tattenai, governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and all the officers of that area, stay away from there. 
EZR.6.7	Do not bother the work on that Temple of God. Let the governor of the Jewish people and the Jewish elders rebuild this Temple where it was before.
EZR.6.8	Also, I order you to do this for those elders of the Jewish people who are building this Temple: The cost of the building is to be fully paid from the royal treasury, from taxes collected from Trans-Euphrates. Do this so the work will not stop. 
EZR.6.9	Give those people anything they need—young bulls, male sheep, or lambs for burnt offerings to the God of heaven, or wheat, salt, wine, or olive oil. Give the priests in Jerusalem anything they ask for every day without fail. 
EZR.6.10	Then they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the God of heaven, and they may pray for the life of the king and his sons.
EZR.6.11	Also, I give this order: If anyone changes this order, a wood beam is to be pulled from his house and driven through his body. Because of his crime, make his house a pile of ruins. 
EZR.6.12	God has chosen Jerusalem as the place he is to be worshiped. May he punish any king or person who tries to change this order and destroy this Temple.
EZR.6.12	I, Darius, have given this order. Let it be obeyed quickly and carefully.
EZR.6.13	So, Tattenai, the governor of Trans-Euphrates, Shethar-Bozenai, and their fellow workers carried out King Darius’ order quickly and carefully. 
EZR.6.14	The Jewish elders continued to build and were successful because of the preaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, a descendant of Iddo. They finished building the Temple as the God of Israel had commanded and as kings Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes of Persia had ordered. 
EZR.6.15	The Temple was finished on the third day of the month of Adar in the sixth year Darius was king.
EZR.6.16	Then the people of Israel celebrated and gave the Temple to God to honor him. Everybody was happy: the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the Jewish people who had returned from captivity. 
EZR.6.17	They gave the Temple to God by offering a hundred bulls, two hundred male sheep, and four hundred lambs as sacrifices. And as an offering to forgive the sins of all Israel, they offered twelve male goats, one goat for each tribe in Israel. 
EZR.6.18	Then they put the priests and the Levites into their separate groups. Each group had a certain time to serve God in the Temple at Jerusalem as it is written in the Book of Moses.
EZR.6.19	The Jewish people who returned from captivity celebrated the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
EZR.6.20	The priests and Levites had made themselves clean. Then the Levites killed the Passover lambs for all the people who had returned from captivity, for their relatives the priests, and for themselves. 
EZR.6.21	So all the people of Israel who returned from captivity ate the Passover lamb. So did the people who had given up the unclean ways of their non-Jewish neighbors in order to worship the L
EZR.6.22	For seven days they celebrated the Feast of Unleavened Bread in a very joyful way. The L
EZR.7.1	After these things during the rule of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra came up from Babylon. Ezra was the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah, 
EZR.7.2	the son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub, 
EZR.7.3	the son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth, 
EZR.7.4	the son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki, 
EZR.7.5	the son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the high priest. 
EZR.7.6	This Ezra came to Jerusalem from Babylon. He was a teacher and knew well the Teachings of Moses that had been given by the L
EZR.7.7	In the seventh year of King Artaxerxes more Israelites came to Jerusalem. Among them were priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and Temple servants.
EZR.7.8	Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the fifth month of Artaxerxes’ seventh year as king. 
EZR.7.9	Ezra had left Babylon on the first day of the first month, and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, because God was helping him. 
EZR.7.10	Ezra had worked hard to know and obey the Teachings of the L
EZR.7.11	King Artaxerxes had given a letter to Ezra, a priest and teacher who taught about the commands and laws the L
EZR.7.12	From Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven.
EZR.7.12	Greetings.
EZR.7.13	Now I give this order: Any Israelite in my kingdom who wishes may go with you to Jerusalem, including priests and Levites. 
EZR.7.14	Ezra, you are sent by the king and the seven people who advise him to ask how Judah and Jerusalem are obeying the Law of your God, which you are carrying with you. 
EZR.7.15	Also take with you the silver and gold that the king and those who advise him have given freely to the God of Israel, whose Temple is in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.16	Also take the silver and gold you receive from the area of Babylon. Take the offerings the Israelites and their priests have given as gifts for the Temple of your God in Jerusalem. 
EZR.7.17	With this money buy bulls, male sheep, and lambs, and the grain offerings and drink offerings that go with those sacrifices. Then sacrifice them on the altar in the Temple of your God in Jerusalem.
EZR.7.18	You and your fellow Jews may spend the silver and gold left over as you want and as God wishes. 
EZR.7.19	Take to the God of Jerusalem all the utensils for worship in the Temple of your God, 
EZR.7.20	which we have given you. Use the royal treasury to pay for anything else you need for the Temple of your God.
EZR.7.21	Now I, King Artaxerxes, give this order to all the men in charge of the treasury of Trans-Euphrates: Give Ezra, a priest and a teacher of the Law of the God of heaven, whatever he asks for. 
EZR.7.22	Give him up to seventy-five hundred pounds of silver, six hundred bushels of wheat, six hundred gallons of wine, and six hundred gallons of olive oil. And give him as much salt as he wants. 
EZR.7.23	Carefully give him whatever the God of heaven wants for the Temple of the God of heaven. We do not want God to be angry with the king and his sons. 
EZR.7.24	Remember, you must not make these people pay taxes of any kind: priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, Temple servants, and other workers in this Temple of God.
EZR.7.25	And you, Ezra, use the wisdom you have from your God to choose judges and lawmakers to rule the Jewish people of Trans-Euphrates. They know the laws of your God, and you may teach anyone who does not know them. 
EZR.7.26	Whoever does not obey the law of your God or of the king must be punished. He will be killed, or sent away, or have his property taken away, or be put in jail.
EZR.7.27	Praise the L
EZR.7.28	The L
EZR.8.1	These are the leaders of the family groups and those who were listed with them who came back with me from Babylon during the rule of King Artaxerxes.
EZR.8.2	From the descendants of Phinehas: Gershom.
EZR.8.2	From the descendants of Ithamar: Daniel.
EZR.8.2	From the descendants of David: Hattush 
EZR.8.3	of the descendants of Shecaniah.
EZR.8.3	From the descendants of Parosh: Zechariah, with one hundred fifty men.
EZR.8.4	From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Eliehoenai son of Zerahiah, with two hundred men.
EZR.8.5	From the descendants of Zattu: Shecaniah son of Jahaziel, with three hundred men.
EZR.8.6	From the descendants of Adin: Ebed son of Jonathan, with fifty men.
EZR.8.7	From the descendants of Elam: Jeshaiah son of Athaliah, with seventy men.
EZR.8.8	From the descendants of Shephatiah: Zebadiah son of Michael, with eighty men.
EZR.8.9	From the descendants of Joab: Obadiah son of Jehiel, with two hundred eighteen men.
EZR.8.10	From the descendants of Bani: Shelomith son of Josiphiah, with one hundred sixty men.
EZR.8.11	From the descendants of Bebai: Zechariah son of Bebai, with twenty-eight men.
EZR.8.12	From the descendants of Azgad: Johanan son of Hakkatan, with one hundred ten men.
EZR.8.13	From the descendants of Adonikam, these were the last ones: Eliphelet, Jeuel, and Shemaiah, with sixty men.
EZR.8.14	From the descendants of Bigvai: Uthai and Zaccur, with seventy men.
EZR.8.15	I called all those people together at the canal that flows toward Ahava, where we camped for three days. I checked all the people and the priests, but I did not find any Levites. 
EZR.8.16	So I called these leaders: Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam. And I called Joiarib and Elnathan, who were teachers. 
EZR.8.17	I sent these men to Iddo, the leader at Casiphia, and told them what to say to Iddo and his relatives, who are the Temple servants in Casiphia. I sent them to bring servants to us for the Temple of our God. 
EZR.8.18	Our God was helping us, so Iddo’s relatives gave us Sherebiah, a wise man from the descendants of Mahli son of Levi, who was the son of Israel. And they brought Sherebiah’s sons and brothers, for a total of eighteen men. 
EZR.8.19	And they brought to us Hashabiah and Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and his brothers and nephews. In all there were twenty men. 
EZR.8.20	They also brought two hundred twenty of the Temple servants, a group David and the officers had set up to help the Levites. All of those men were listed by name.
EZR.8.21	There by the Ahava Canal, I announced we would all fast and deny ourselves before our God. We would ask God for a safe trip for ourselves, our children, and all our possessions. 
EZR.8.22	I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road. We had said to the king, “Our God helps everyone who obeys him, but he is very angry with all who reject him.” 
EZR.8.23	So we fasted and prayed to our God about our trip, and he answered our prayers.
EZR.8.24	Then I chose twelve of the priests who were leaders, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their relatives. 
EZR.8.25	I weighed the offering of silver and gold and the utensils given for the Temple of our God, and I gave them to the twelve priests I had chosen. The king, the people who advised him, his officers, and all the Israelites there with us had given these things for the Temple. 
EZR.8.26	I weighed out and gave them about fifty thousand pounds of silver, about seventy-five hundred pounds of silver objects, and about seventy-five hundred pounds of gold. 
EZR.8.27	I gave them twenty gold bowls that weighed about nineteen pounds and two fine pieces of polished bronze that were as valuable as gold.
EZR.8.28	Then I said to the priests, “You and these utensils belong to the L
EZR.8.29	Guard these things carefully. In Jerusalem, weigh them in front of the leading priests, Levites, and the leaders of the family groups of Israel in the rooms of the Temple of the L
EZR.8.30	So the priests and Levites accepted the silver, the gold, and the utensils that had been weighed to take them to the Temple of our God in Jerusalem.
EZR.8.31	On the twelfth day of the first month we left the Ahava Canal and started toward Jerusalem. Our God helped us and protected us from enemies and robbers along the way. 
EZR.8.32	Finally we arrived in Jerusalem where we rested three days.
EZR.8.33	On the fourth day we weighed out the silver, the gold, and the utensils in the Temple of our God. We handed them to the priest Meremoth son of Uriah. Eleazar son of Phinehas was with him, as were the Levites Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui. 
EZR.8.34	We checked everything by number and by weight, and the total weight was written down.
EZR.8.35	Then the captives who returned made burnt offerings to the God of Israel. They sacrificed twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six male sheep, and seventy-seven lambs. For a sin offering there were twelve male goats. All this was a burnt offering to the L
EZR.8.36	They took King Artaxerxes’ orders to the royal officers and to the governors of Trans-Euphrates. Then these men gave help to the people and the Temple of God.
EZR.9.1	After these things had been done, the leaders came to me and said, “Ezra, the Israelites, including the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the people around us. Those neighbors do evil things, as the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites did. 
EZR.9.2	The Israelite men and their sons have married these women. They have mixed the people who belong to God with the people around them. The leaders and officers of Israel have led the rest of the Israelites to do this unfaithful thing.”
EZR.9.3	When I heard this, I angrily tore my robe and coat, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down in shock. 
EZR.9.4	Everyone who trembled in fear at the word of the God of Israel gathered around me because of the unfaithfulness of the captives who had returned. I sat there in shock until the evening sacrifice.
EZR.9.5	At the evening sacrifice I got up from where I had shown my shame. My robe and coat were torn, and I fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the L
EZR.9.6	I prayed,
EZR.9.6	“My God, I am too ashamed and embarrassed to lift up my face to you, my God, because our sins are so many. They are higher than our heads. Our guilt even reaches up to the sky. 
EZR.9.7	From the days of our ancestors until now, our guilt has been great. Because of our sins, we, our kings, and our priests have been punished by the sword and captivity. Foreign kings have taken away our things and shamed us, even as it is today.
EZR.9.8	“But now, for a short time, the L
EZR.9.9	Even though we are slaves, our God has not left us. He caused the kings of Persia to be kind to us and has given us new life. We can rebuild the Temple and repair its ruins. And he has given us a wall to protect us in Judah and Jerusalem.
EZR.9.10	“But now, our God, what can we say after you have done all this? We have disobeyed your commands 
EZR.9.11	that you gave through your servants the prophets. You said, ‘The land you are entering to own is ruined; the people living there have spoiled it by the evil they do. Their evil filled the land with uncleanness from one end to the other. 
EZR.9.12	So do not let your daughters marry their sons, and do not let their daughters marry your sons. Do not wish for their peace or success. Then you will be strong and eat the good things of the land. Then you can leave this land to your descendants forever.’
EZR.9.13	“What has happened to us is our own fault. We have done evil things, and our guilt is great. But you, our God, have punished us less than we deserve; you have left a few of us alive. 
EZR.9.14	We should not again break your commands by allowing marriages with these wicked people. If we did, you would get angry enough to destroy us, and none of us would be left alive. 
EZR.9.15	L
EZR.10.1	As Ezra was praying and confessing and crying and throwing himself down in front of the Temple, a large group of Israelite men, women, and children gathered around him who were also crying loudly. 
EZR.10.2	Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel the Elamite said to Ezra, “We have been unfaithful to our God by marrying women from the peoples around us. But even so, there is still hope for Israel. 
EZR.10.3	Now let us make an agreement before our God. We will send away all these women and their children as you and those who respect the commands of our God advise. Let it be done to obey God’s Teachings. 
EZR.10.4	Get up, Ezra. You are in charge, and we will support you. Have courage and do it.”
EZR.10.5	So Ezra got up and made the priests, Levites, and all the people of Israel promise to do what was suggested; and they promised. 
EZR.10.6	Then Ezra left the Temple and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. While Ezra was there, he did not eat or drink, because he was still sad about the unfaithfulness of the captives who had returned.
EZR.10.7	They sent an order in Judah and Jerusalem for all the captives who had returned to meet together in Jerusalem. 
EZR.10.8	Whoever did not come to Jerusalem within three days would lose his property and would no longer be a member of the community of the returned captives. That was the decision of the officers and elders.
EZR.10.9	So within three days all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered in Jerusalem. It was the twentieth day of the ninth month. All the men were sitting in the open place in front of the Temple and were upset because of the meeting and because it was raining. 
EZR.10.10	Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, “You have been unfaithful and have married non-Jewish women. You have made Israel more guilty. 
EZR.10.11	Now, confess it to the L
EZR.10.12	Then the whole group answered Ezra with a loud voice, “Ezra, you’re right! We must do what you say. 
EZR.10.13	But there are many people here, and it’s the rainy season. We can’t stand outside, and this problem can’t be solved in a day or two, because we have sinned badly. 
EZR.10.14	Let our officers make a decision for the whole group. Then let everyone in our towns who has married a non-Jewish woman meet with the elders and judges of each town at a planned time, until the hot anger of our God turns away from us.” 
EZR.10.15	Only Jonathan son of Asahel, Jahzeiah son of Tikvah, Meshullam, and Shabbethai the Levite were against the plan.
EZR.10.16	So the returned captives did what was suggested. Ezra the priest chose men who were leaders of the family groups and named one from each family division. On the first day of the tenth month they sat down to study each case. 
EZR.10.17	By the first day of the first month, they had finished with all the men who had married non-Jewish women.
EZR.10.18	These are the descendants of the priests who had married foreign women:
EZR.10.18	From the descendants of Jeshua son of Jozadak and Jeshua’s brothers: Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
EZR.10.19	(They all promised to divorce their wives, and each one brought a male sheep from the flock as a penalty offering.)
EZR.10.20	From the descendants of Immer: Hanani and Zebadiah.
EZR.10.21	From the descendants of Harim: Maaseiah, Elijah, Shemaiah, Jehiel, and Uzziah.

EZR.10.24	Among the singers: Eliashib.
EZR.10.24	Among the gatekeepers: Shallum, Telem, and Uri.
EZR.10.25	And among the other Israelites, these married non-Jewish women:
EZR.10.25	From the descendants of Parosh: Ramiah, Izziah, Malkijah, Mijamin, Eleazar, Malkijah, and Benaiah.
EZR.10.26	From the descendants of Elam: Mattaniah, Zechariah, Jehiel, Abdi, Jeremoth, and Elijah.
EZR.10.27	From the descendants of Zattu: Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, Jeremoth, Zabad, and Aziza.
EZR.10.28	From the descendants of Bebai: Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and Athlai.
EZR.10.29	From the descendants of Bani: Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth.
EZR.10.30	From the descendants of Pahath-Moab: Adna, Kelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh.
EZR.10.31	From the descendants of Harim: Eliezer, Ishijah, Malkijah, Shemaiah, Shimeon, 
EZR.10.32	Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.
EZR.10.33	From the descendants of Hashum: Mattenai, Mattattah, Zabad, Eliphelet, Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.
EZR.10.34	From the descendants of Bani: Maadai, Amram, Uel, 
EZR.10.35	Benaiah, Bedeiah, Keluhi, 
EZR.10.36	Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib, 
EZR.10.37	Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasu.
EZR.10.38	From the descendants of Binnui: Shimei, 
EZR.10.39	Shelemiah, Nathan, Adaiah, 
EZR.10.40	Macnadebai, Shashai, Sharai, 
EZR.10.41	Azarel, Shelemiah, Shemariah, 
EZR.10.42	Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.
EZR.10.43	From the descendants of Nebo: Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.
EZR.10.44	All these men had married non-Jewish women, and some of them had children by these wives.
NEH.1.1	These are the words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah.
NEH.1.1	In the month of Kislev in the twentieth year, I, Nehemiah, was in the capital city of Susa. 
NEH.1.2	One of my brothers named Hanani came with some other men from Judah. I asked them about Jerusalem and the Jewish people who lived through the captivity.
NEH.1.3	They answered me, “Those who are left from the captivity are back in Judah, but they are in much trouble and are full of shame. The wall around Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned.”
NEH.1.4	When I heard these things, I sat down and cried for several days. I was sad and fasted. I prayed to the God of heaven, 
NEH.1.5	“L
NEH.1.6	Look and listen carefully. Hear the prayer that I, your servant, am praying to you day and night for your servants, the Israelites. I confess the sins we Israelites have done against you. My father’s family and I have sinned against you. 
NEH.1.7	We have been wicked toward you and have not obeyed the commands, rules, and laws you gave your servant Moses.
NEH.1.8	“Remember what you taught your servant Moses, saying, ‘If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations. 
NEH.1.9	But if you return to me and obey my commands, I will gather your people from the far ends of the earth. And I will bring them from captivity to where I have chosen to be worshiped.’
NEH.1.10	“They are your servants and your people, whom you have saved with your great strength and power. 
NEH.1.11	Lord, listen carefully to the prayer of your servant and the prayers of your servants who love to honor you. Give me, your servant, success today; allow this king to show kindness to me.”
NEH.1.11	I was the one who served wine to the king.
NEH.2.1	It was the month of Nisan in the twentieth year Artaxerxes was king. He wanted some wine, so I took some and gave it to the king. I had not been sad in his presence before. 
NEH.2.2	So the king said, “Why does your face look sad even though you are not sick? Your heart must be sad.”
NEH.2.2	Then I was very afraid. 
NEH.2.3	I said to the king, “May the king live forever! My face is sad because the city where my ancestors are buried lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire.”
NEH.2.4	Then the king said to me, “What do you want?”
NEH.2.4	First I prayed to the God of heaven. 
NEH.2.5	Then I answered the king, “If you are willing and if I have pleased you, send me to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so I can rebuild it.”
NEH.2.6	The queen was sitting next to the king. He asked me, “How long will your trip take, and when will you get back?” It pleased the king to send me, so I set a time.
NEH.2.7	I also said to him, “If you are willing, give me letters for the governors of Trans-Euphrates. Tell them to let me pass safely through their lands on my way to Judah. 
NEH.2.8	And may I have a letter for Asaph, the keeper of the king’s forest, telling him to give me timber? I will need it to make boards for the gates of the palace, which is by the Temple, and for the city wall, and for the house in which I will live.” So the king gave me the letters, because God was showing kindness to me. 
NEH.2.9	Then I went to the governors of Trans-Euphrates and gave them the king’s letters. The king had also sent army officers and soldiers on horses with me.
NEH.2.10	When Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite officer heard about this, they were upset that someone had come to help the Israelites.
NEH.2.11	I went to Jerusalem and stayed there three days. 
NEH.2.12	Then at night I started out with a few men. I had not told anyone what God had caused me to do for Jerusalem. There were no animals with me except the one I was riding.
NEH.2.13	I went out at night through the Valley Gate. I rode toward the Dragon Well and the Trash Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that had been broken down and the gates that had been destroyed by fire. 
NEH.2.14	Then I rode on toward the Fountain Gate and the King’s Pool, but there was not enough room for the animal I was riding to pass through. 
NEH.2.15	So I went up the valley at night, inspecting the wall. Finally, I turned and went back in through the Valley Gate. 
NEH.2.16	The guards did not know where I had gone or what I was doing. I had not yet said anything to the Jewish people, the priests, the important men, the officers, or any of the others who would do the work.
NEH.2.17	Then I said to them, “You can see the trouble we have here. Jerusalem is a pile of ruins, and its gates have been burned. Come, let’s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so we won’t be full of shame any longer.” 
NEH.2.18	I also told them how God had been kind to me and what the king had said to me.
NEH.2.18	Then they answered, “Let’s start rebuilding.” So they began to work hard.
NEH.2.19	But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite officer, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they made fun of us and laughed at us. They said, “What are you doing? Are you turning against the king?”
NEH.2.20	But I answered them, “The God of heaven will give us success. We, his servants, will start rebuilding, but you have no share, claim, or memorial in Jerusalem.”
NEH.3.1	Eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the Sheep Gate. They gave it to the Lord’s service and set its doors in place. They worked as far as the Tower of the Hundred and gave it to the Lord’s service. Then they went on to the Tower of Hananel. 
NEH.3.2	Next to them, the people of Jericho built part of the wall, and Zaccur son of Imri built next to them.
NEH.3.3	The sons of Hassenaah rebuilt the Fish Gate, laying its boards and setting its doors, bolts, and bars in place. 
NEH.3.4	Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, made repairs next to them. Meshullam son of Berekiah, the son of Meshezabel, made repairs next to Meremoth. And Zadok son of Baana made repairs next to Meshullam. 
NEH.3.5	The people from Tekoa made repairs next to them, but the leading men of Tekoa would not work under their supervisors.
NEH.3.6	Joiada son of Paseah and Meshullam son of Besodeiah repaired the Old Gate. They laid its boards and set its doors, bolts, and bars in place. 
NEH.3.7	Next to them, Melatiah from Gibeon, other men from Gibeon and Mizpah, and Jadon from Meronoth made repairs. These places were ruled by the governor of Trans-Euphrates. 
NEH.3.8	Next to them, Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a goldsmith, made repairs. And next to him, Hananiah, a perfume maker, made repairs. These men rebuilt Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall. 
NEH.3.9	The next part of the wall was repaired by Rephaiah son of Hur, the ruler of half of the district of Jerusalem. 
NEH.3.10	Next to him, Jedaiah son of Harumaph made repairs opposite his own house. And next to him, Hattush son of Hashabneiah made repairs. 
NEH.3.11	Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-Moab repaired another part of the wall and the Tower of the Ovens. 
NEH.3.12	Next to them Shallum son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half of the district of Jerusalem, and his daughters made repairs.
NEH.3.13	Hanun and the people of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate, rebuilding it and setting its doors, bolts, and bars in place. They also repaired the five hundred yards of the wall to the Trash Gate.
NEH.3.14	Malkijah son of Recab, the ruler of the district of Beth Hakkerem, repaired the Trash Gate. He rebuilt that gate and set its doors, bolts, and bars in place.
NEH.3.15	Shallun son of Col-Hozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate. He rebuilt it, put a roof over it, and set its doors, bolts, and bars in place. He also repaired the wall of the Pool of Siloam next to the King’s Garden all the way to the steps that went down from the older part of the city. 
NEH.3.16	Next to Shallun was Nehemiah son of Azbuk, the ruler of half of the district of Beth Zur. He made repairs opposite the tombs of David and as far as the man-made pool and the House of the Heroes.
NEH.3.17	Next to him, the Levites made repairs, working under Rehum son of Bani. Next to him, Hashabiah, the ruler of half of the district of Keilah, for his district. 
NEH.3.18	Next to him, Binnui son of Henadad and his relatives made repairs. Binnui was the ruler of the other half of the district of Keilah. 
NEH.3.19	Next to them, Ezer son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, repaired another part of the wall. He worked across from the way up to the armory, as far as the bend. 
NEH.3.20	Next to him, Baruch son of Zabbai worked hard on the wall that went from the bend to the entrance to the house of Eliashib, the high priest. 
NEH.3.21	Next to him, Meremoth son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, repaired the wall that went from the entrance to Eliashib’s house to the far end of it.
NEH.3.22	Next to him worked the priests from the surrounding area. 
NEH.3.23	Next to them, Benjamin and Hasshub made repairs in front of their own house. Next to them, Azariah son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made repairs beside his own house. 
NEH.3.24	Next to him, Binnui son of Henadad repaired the wall that went from Azariah’s house to the bend and on to the corner. 
NEH.3.25	Palal son of Uzai worked across from the bend and by the tower on the upper palace, which is near the courtyard of the king’s guard. Next to Palal, Pedaiah son of Parosh made repairs. 
NEH.3.26	The Temple servants who lived on the hill of Ophel made repairs as far as a point opposite the Water Gate. They worked toward the east and the tower that extends from the palace. 
NEH.3.27	Next to them, the people of Tekoa repaired the wall from the great tower that extends from the palace to the wall of Ophel.
NEH.3.28	The priests made repairs above the Horse Gate, each working in front of his own house. 
NEH.3.29	Next to them, Zadok son of Immer made repairs across from his own house. Next to him, Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the guard of the East Gate, made repairs. 
NEH.3.30	Next to him, Hananiah son of Shelemiah, and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, made repairs on another part of the wall. Next to them, Meshullam son of Berekiah made repairs across from where he lived. 
NEH.3.31	Next to him, Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, made repairs. He worked as far as the house of the Temple servants and the traders, which is across from the Inspection Gate, and as far as the room above the corner of the wall. 
NEH.3.32	The goldsmiths and the traders made repairs between the room above the corner of the wall and the Sheep Gate.
NEH.4.1	When Sanballat heard we were rebuilding the wall, he was very angry, even furious. He made fun of the Jewish people. 
NEH.4.2	He said to his friends and those with power in Samaria, “What are these weak Jews doing? Will they rebuild the wall? Will they offer sacrifices? Can they finish it in one day? Can they bring stones back to life from piles of trash and ashes?”
NEH.4.3	Tobiah the Ammonite, who was next to Sanballat, said, “If a fox climbed up on the stone wall they are building, it would break it down.”
NEH.4.4	I prayed, “Hear us, our God. We are hated. Turn the insults of Sanballat and Tobiah back on their own heads. Let them be captured and stolen like valuables. 
NEH.4.5	Do not hide their guilt or take away their sins so that you can’t see them, because they have insulted the builders.”
NEH.4.6	So we rebuilt the wall to half its height, because the people were willing to work.
NEH.4.7	But Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the people from Ashdod were very angry when they heard that the repairs to Jerusalem’s walls were continuing and that the holes in the wall were being closed. 
NEH.4.8	So they all made plans to come to Jerusalem and fight and stir up trouble. 
NEH.4.9	But we prayed to our God and appointed guards to watch for them day and night.
NEH.4.10	The people of Judah said, “The workers are getting tired. There is so much trash we cannot rebuild the wall.”
NEH.4.11	And our enemies said, “The Jews won’t know or see anything until we come among them and kill them and stop the work.”
NEH.4.12	Then the Jewish people who lived near our enemies came and told us ten times, “Everywhere you turn, the enemy will attack us.” 
NEH.4.13	So I put people behind the lowest places along the wall—the open places—and I put families together with their swords, spears, and bows. 
NEH.4.14	Then I looked around and stood up and said to the important men, the leaders, and the rest of the people: “Don’t be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and powerful. Fight for your brothers, your sons and daughters, your wives, and your homes.”
NEH.4.15	Then our enemies heard that we knew about their plans and that God had ruined their plans. So we all went back to the wall, each to his own work.
NEH.4.16	From that day on, half my people worked on the wall. The other half was ready with spears, shields, bows, and armor. The officers stood in back of the people of Judah 
NEH.4.17	who were building the wall. Those who carried materials did their work with one hand and carried a weapon with the other. 
NEH.4.18	Each builder wore his sword at his side as he worked. The man who blew the trumpet to warn the people stayed next to me.
NEH.4.19	Then I said to the important people, the leaders, and everyone else, “This is a very big job. We are spreading out along the wall so that we are far apart. 
NEH.4.20	Wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, assemble there. Our God will fight for us.”
NEH.4.21	So we continued to work with half the men holding spears from sunrise till the stars came out. 
NEH.4.22	At that time I also said to the people, “Let every man and his helper stay inside Jerusalem at night. They can be our guards at night and workmen during the day.” 
NEH.4.23	Neither I, my brothers, my workers, nor the guards with me ever took off our clothes. Each person carried his weapon even when he went for water.
NEH.5.1	The men and their wives complained loudly against their fellow Jews. 
NEH.5.2	Some of them were saying, “We have many sons and daughters in our families. To eat and stay alive, we need grain.”
NEH.5.3	Others were saying, “We are borrowing money against our fields, vineyards, and homes to get grain because there is not much food.”
NEH.5.4	And still others were saying, “We are borrowing money to pay the king’s tax on our fields and vineyards. 
NEH.5.5	We are just like our fellow Jews, and our sons are like their sons. But we have to sell our sons and daughters as slaves. Some of our daughters have already been sold. But there is nothing we can do, because our fields and vineyards already belong to other people.”
NEH.5.6	When I heard their complaints about these things, I was very angry. 
NEH.5.7	After I thought about it, I accused the important people and the leaders, “You are charging your own brothers too much interest.” So I called a large meeting to deal with them. 
NEH.5.8	I said to them, “As much as possible, we have bought freedom for our fellow Jews who had been sold to foreigners. Now you are selling your fellow Jews to us!” The leaders were quiet and had nothing to say.
NEH.5.9	Then I said, “What you are doing is not right. Don’t you fear God? Don’t let our foreign enemies shame us. 
NEH.5.10	I, my brothers, and my men are also lending money and grain to the people. But stop charging them so much for this. 
NEH.5.11	Give back their fields, vineyards, olive trees, and houses right now. Also give back the extra amount you charged—the hundredth part of the money, grain, new wine, and oil.”
NEH.5.12	They said, “We will give it back and not demand anything more from them. We will do as you say.”
NEH.5.12	Then I called for the priests, and I made the important people and leaders take an oath to do what they had said. 
NEH.5.13	Also I shook out the folds of my robe and said, “In this way may God shake out everyone who does not keep his promise. May God shake him out of his house and out of the things that are his. Let that person be shaken out and emptied!”
NEH.5.13	Then the whole group said, “Amen,” and they praised the L
NEH.5.14	I was appointed governor in the land of Judah in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes’ rule. I was governor of Judah for twelve years, until his thirty-second year. During that time neither my brothers nor I ate the food that was allowed for a governor. 
NEH.5.15	But the governors before me had placed a heavy load on the people. They took about one pound of silver from each person, along with food and wine. The governors’ helpers before me also controlled the people, but I did not do that, because I feared God. 
NEH.5.16	I worked on the wall, as did all my men who were gathered there. We did not buy any fields.
NEH.5.17	Also, I fed one hundred fifty Jewish people and officers at my table, as well as those who came from the nations around us. 
NEH.5.18	This is what was prepared every day: one ox, six good sheep, and birds. And every ten days there were all kinds of wine. But I never demanded the food that was due a governor, because the people were already working very hard.
NEH.5.19	Remember to be kind to me, my God, for all the good I have done for these people.
NEH.6.1	Then Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and our other enemies heard that I had rebuilt the wall and that there was not one gap in it. But I had not yet set the doors in the gates. 
NEH.6.2	So Sanballat and Geshem sent me this message: “Come, Nehemiah, let’s meet together in Kephirim on the plain of Ono.”
NEH.6.2	But they were planning to harm me. 
NEH.6.3	So I sent messengers to them with this answer: “I am doing a great work, and I can’t come down. I don’t want the work to stop while I leave to meet you.” 
NEH.6.4	Sanballat and Geshem sent the same message to me four times, and each time I sent back the same answer.
NEH.6.5	The fifth time Sanballat sent his helper to me with the message, and in his hand was an unsealed letter. 
NEH.6.6	This is what was written:
NEH.6.6	A report is going around to all the nations, and Geshem says it is true, that you and the Jewish people are planning to turn against the king and that you are rebuilding the wall. They say you are going to be their king 
NEH.6.7	and that you have appointed prophets to announce in Jerusalem: “There is a king of Judah!” The king will hear about this. So come, let’s discuss this together.
NEH.6.8	So I sent him back this answer: “Nothing you are saying is really happening. You are just making it up in your own mind.”
NEH.6.9	Our enemies were trying to scare us, thinking, “They will get too weak to work. Then the wall will not be finished.”
NEH.6.9	But I prayed, “God, make me strong.”
NEH.6.10	One day I went to the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel. Shemaiah had to stay at home. He said, “Nehemiah, let’s meet in the Temple of God. Let’s go inside the Temple and close the doors, because men are coming at night to kill you.”
NEH.6.11	But I said, “Should a man like me run away? Should I run for my life into the Temple? I will not go.” 
NEH.6.12	I knew that God had not sent him but that Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to prophesy against me. 
NEH.6.13	They paid him to frighten me so I would do this and sin. Then they could give me a bad name to shame me.
NEH.6.14	I prayed, “My God, remember Tobiah and Sanballat and what they have done. Also remember the prophetess Noadiah and the other prophets who have been trying to frighten me.”
NEH.6.15	The wall of Jerusalem was completed on the twenty-fifth day of the month of Elul. It took fifty-two days to rebuild. 
NEH.6.16	When all our enemies heard about it and all the nations around us saw it, they were shamed. They then understood that the work had been done with the help of our God.
NEH.6.17	Also in those days the important people of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and he answered them. 
NEH.6.18	Many Jewish people had promised to be faithful to Tobiah, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah son of Arah. And Tobiah’s son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah. 
NEH.6.19	These important people kept telling me about the good things Tobiah was doing, and then they would tell Tobiah what I said about him. So Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.
NEH.7.1	After the wall had been rebuilt and I had set the doors in place, the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were chosen. 
NEH.7.2	I put my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah, the commander of the palace, in charge of Jerusalem. Hananiah was honest and feared God more than most people. 
NEH.7.3	I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem should not be opened until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are still on duty, have them shut and bolt the doors. Appoint people who live in Jerusalem as guards, and put some at guard posts and some near their own houses.”
NEH.7.4	The city was large and roomy, but there were few people in it, and the houses had not yet been rebuilt. 
NEH.7.5	Then my God caused me to gather the important people, the leaders, and the common people so I could register them by families. I found the family history of those who had returned first. This is what I found written there:
NEH.7.6	These are the people of the area who returned from captivity, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken away. They returned to Jerusalem and Judah, each going back to his own town. 
NEH.7.7	These people returned with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.
NEH.7.7	These are the people from Israel:

NEH.7.24	the descendants of Hariph—112; 
NEH.7.25	the descendants of Gibeon—95.
NEH.7.26	These are the people from the towns of Bethlehem and Netophah—188; 
NEH.7.27	of Anathoth—128; 
NEH.7.28	of Beth Azmaveth—42; 
NEH.7.29	of Kiriath Jearim, Kephirah, and Beeroth—743;

NEH.7.40	the descendants of Immer—1,052; 
NEH.7.41	the descendants of Pashhur—1,247; 
NEH.7.42	the descendants of Harim—1,017.
NEH.7.43	These are the Levites: the descendants of Jeshua (through Kadmiel through the family of Hodaviah)—74.
NEH.7.44	These are the singers: the descendants of Asaph—148.
NEH.7.45	These are the gatekeepers: the descendants of Shallum, Ater, Talmon, Akkub, Hatita, and Shobai—138.
NEH.7.46	These are the Temple servants: the descendants of Ziha, Hasupha, Tabbaoth, 
NEH.7.47	Keros, Sia, Padon, 
NEH.7.48	Lebana, Hagaba, Shalmai, 
NEH.7.49	Hanan, Giddel, Gahar, 
NEH.7.50	Reaiah, Rezin, Nekoda, 
NEH.7.51	Gazzam, Uzza, Paseah, 
NEH.7.52	Besai, Meunim, Nephussim, 
NEH.7.53	Bakbuk, Hakupha, Harhur, 
NEH.7.54	Bazluth, Mehida, Harsha, 
NEH.7.55	Barkos, Sisera, Temah, 
NEH.7.56	Neziah, and Hatipha.
NEH.7.57	These are the descendants of the servants of Solomon: the descendants of Sotai, Sophereth, Perida, 
NEH.7.58	Jaala, Darkon, Giddel, 
NEH.7.59	Shephatiah, Hattil, Pokereth-Hazzebaim, and Amon.
NEH.7.60	The Temple servants and the descendants of the servants of Solomon totaled 392 people.
NEH.7.61	Some people came to Jerusalem from the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon, and Immer, but they could not prove that their ancestors came from Israel. Here are their names and their number: 
NEH.7.62	the descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda—642.
NEH.7.63	And these priests could not prove that their ancestors came from Israel: the descendants of Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai. (He had married a daughter of Barzillai from Gilead and was called by her family name.)
NEH.7.64	These people searched for their family records, but they could not find them. So they could not be priests, because they were thought to be unclean. 
NEH.7.65	The governor ordered them not to eat any of the holy food until a priest settled this matter by using the Urim and Thummim.
NEH.7.66	The total number of those who returned was 42,360. 
NEH.7.67	This is not counting their 7,337 male and female servants and the 245 male and female singers with them. 
NEH.7.68	They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 
NEH.7.69	435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
NEH.7.70	Some of the family leaders gave to the work. The governor gave to the treasury about 19 pounds of gold, 50 bowls, and 530 pieces of clothing for the priests. 
NEH.7.71	Some of the family leaders gave about 375 pounds of gold and about 2,660 pounds of silver to the treasury for the work. 
NEH.7.72	The total of what the other people gave was about 375 pounds of gold, about 2,250 pounds of silver, and 67 pieces of clothing for the priests. 
NEH.7.73	So these people all settled in their own towns: the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Temple servants, and all the other people of Israel.
NEH.7.73	By the seventh month the Israelites were settled in their own towns.
NEH.8.1	All the people of Israel gathered together in the square by the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the teacher to bring out the Book of the Teachings of Moses, which the L
NEH.8.2	So on the first day of the seventh month, Ezra the priest brought out the Teachings for the crowd. Men, women, and all who could listen and understand had gathered. 
NEH.8.3	At the square by the Water Gate Ezra read the Teachings out loud from early morning until noon to the men, women, and everyone who could listen and understand. All the people listened carefully to the Book of the Teachings.
NEH.8.4	Ezra the teacher stood on a high wooden platform that had been built just for this time. On his right were Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah. And on his left were Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
NEH.8.5	Ezra opened the book in full view of everyone, because he was above them. As he opened it, all the people stood up. 
NEH.8.6	Ezra praised the L
NEH.8.7	These Levites explained the Teachings to the people as they stood there: Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah. 
NEH.8.8	They read from the Book of the Teachings of God and explained what it meant so the people understood what was being read.
NEH.8.9	Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and teacher, and the Levites who were teaching said to all the people, “This is a holy day to the L
NEH.8.10	Nehemiah said, “Go and enjoy good food and sweet drinks. Send some to people who have none, because today is a holy day to the Lord. Don’t be sad, because the joy of the L
NEH.8.11	The Levites helped calm the people, saying, “Be quiet, because this is a holy day. Don’t be sad.”
NEH.8.12	Then all the people went away to eat and drink, to send some of their food to others, and to celebrate with great joy. They finally understood what they had been taught.
NEH.8.13	On the second day of the month, the leaders of all the families, the priests, and the Levites met with Ezra the teacher. They gathered to study the words of the Teachings. 
NEH.8.14	This is what they found written in the Teachings: The L
NEH.8.15	The people were supposed to preach this message and spread it through all their towns and in Jerusalem: “Go out into the mountains, and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees, myrtle trees, palms, and shade trees. Make shelters with them, as it is written.”
NEH.8.16	So the people went out and got tree branches. They built shelters on their roofs, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of the Temple, in the square by the Water Gate, and in the square next to the Gate of Ephraim. 
NEH.8.17	The whole group that had come back from captivity built shelters and lived in them. The Israelites had not done this since the time of Joshua son of Nun. And they were very happy.
NEH.8.18	Ezra read to them every day from the Book of the Teachings, from the first day to the last. The people of Israel celebrated the feast for seven days, and then on the eighth day the people gathered as the law said.
NEH.9.1	On the twenty-fourth day of that same month, the people of Israel gathered. They fasted, and they wore rough cloth and put dust on their heads to show their sadness. 
NEH.9.2	Those people whose ancestors were from Israel had separated themselves from all foreigners. They stood and confessed their sins and their ancestors’ sins. 
NEH.9.3	For a fourth of the day they stood where they were and read from the Book of the Teachings of the L
NEH.9.4	These Levites were standing on the stairs: Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani. They called out to the L
NEH.9.5	Then these Levites spoke: Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah. They said, “Stand up and praise the L
NEH.9.5	“Blessed be your wonderful name.
NEH.9.5	It is more wonderful than all blessing and praise.
NEH.9.6	You are the only L
NEH.9.6	You made the heavens, even the highest heavens,
NEH.9.6	with all the stars.
NEH.9.6	You made the earth and everything on it,
NEH.9.6	the seas and everything in them;
NEH.9.6	you give life to everything.
NEH.9.6	The heavenly army worships you.
NEH.9.7	“You are the L
NEH.9.7	the God who chose Abram
NEH.9.7	and brought him out of Ur in Babylonia
NEH.9.7	and named him Abraham.
NEH.9.8	You found him faithful to you,
NEH.9.8	so you made an agreement with him
NEH.9.8	to give his descendants the land of the Canaanites,
NEH.9.8	Hittites, Amorites,
NEH.9.8	Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites.
NEH.9.8	You have kept your promise,
NEH.9.8	because you do what is right.
NEH.9.9	“You saw our ancestors suffering in Egypt
NEH.9.9	and heard them cry out at the Red Sea.
NEH.9.10	You did signs and miracles against the king of Egypt,
NEH.9.10	and against all his officers and all his people,
NEH.9.10	because you knew how proud they were.
NEH.9.10	You became as famous as you are today.
NEH.9.11	You divided the sea in front of our ancestors;
NEH.9.11	they walked through on dry ground.
NEH.9.11	But you threw the people chasing them into the deep water,
NEH.9.11	like a stone thrown into mighty waters.
NEH.9.12	You led our ancestors with a pillar of cloud by day
NEH.9.12	and with a pillar of fire at night.
NEH.9.12	It lit the way
NEH.9.12	they were supposed to go.
NEH.9.13	You came down to Mount Sinai
NEH.9.13	and spoke from heaven to our ancestors.
NEH.9.13	You gave them fair rules and true teachings,
NEH.9.13	good orders and commands.
NEH.9.14	You told them about your holy Sabbath
NEH.9.14	and gave them commands, orders, and teachings
NEH.9.14	through your servant Moses.
NEH.9.15	When they were hungry, you gave them bread from heaven.
NEH.9.15	When they were thirsty, you brought them water from the rock.
NEH.9.15	You told them to enter and take over
NEH.9.15	the land you had promised to give them.
NEH.9.16	“But our ancestors were proud and stubborn
NEH.9.16	and did not obey your commands.
NEH.9.17	They refused to listen;
NEH.9.17	they forgot the miracles you did for them.
NEH.9.17	So they became stubborn and turned against you,
NEH.9.17	choosing a leader to take them back to slavery.
NEH.9.17	But you are a forgiving God.
NEH.9.17	You are kind and full of mercy.
NEH.9.17	You do not become angry quickly, and you have great love.
NEH.9.17	So you did not leave them.
NEH.9.18	Our ancestors even made an idol of a calf for themselves.
NEH.9.18	They said, ‘This is your god, Israel,
NEH.9.18	who brought you up out of Egypt.’
NEH.9.18	They spoke against you.
NEH.9.19	“You have great mercy,
NEH.9.19	so you did not leave them in the desert.
NEH.9.19	The pillar of cloud guided them by day,
NEH.9.19	and the pillar of fire led them at night,
NEH.9.19	lighting the way they were to go.
NEH.9.20	You gave your good Spirit to teach them.
NEH.9.20	You gave them manna to eat
NEH.9.20	and water when they were thirsty.
NEH.9.21	You took care of them for forty years in the desert;
NEH.9.21	they needed nothing.
NEH.9.21	Their clothes did not wear out,
NEH.9.21	and their feet did not swell.
NEH.9.22	“You gave them kingdoms and nations;
NEH.9.22	you gave them more land.
NEH.9.22	They took over the country of Sihon king of Heshbon
NEH.9.22	and the country of Og king of Bashan.
NEH.9.23	You made their children as many as the stars in the sky,
NEH.9.23	and you brought them into the land
NEH.9.23	that you told their ancestors to enter and take over.
NEH.9.24	So their children went into the land and took over.
NEH.9.24	The Canaanites lived there, but you defeated them for our ancestors.
NEH.9.24	You handed over to them the Canaanites, their kings, and the people of the land.
NEH.9.24	Our ancestors could do what they wanted with them.
NEH.9.25	They captured strong, walled cities and fertile land.
NEH.9.25	They took over houses full of good things,
NEH.9.25	wells that were already dug,
NEH.9.25	vineyards, olive trees, and many fruit trees.
NEH.9.25	They ate until they were full and grew fat;
NEH.9.25	they enjoyed your great goodness.
NEH.9.26	“But they were disobedient and turned against you
NEH.9.26	and ignored your teachings.
NEH.9.26	Your prophets warned them to come back to you,
NEH.9.26	but they killed those prophets
NEH.9.26	and spoke against you.
NEH.9.27	So you handed them over to their enemies,
NEH.9.27	and their enemies treated them badly.
NEH.9.27	But in this time of trouble our ancestors cried out to you,
NEH.9.27	and you heard from heaven.
NEH.9.27	You had great mercy
NEH.9.27	and gave them saviors who saved them from the power of their enemies.
NEH.9.28	But as soon as they had rest,
NEH.9.28	they again did what was evil.
NEH.9.28	So you left them to their enemies
NEH.9.28	who ruled over them.
NEH.9.28	When they cried out to you again,
NEH.9.28	you heard from heaven.
NEH.9.28	Because of your mercy, you saved them again and again.
NEH.9.29	You warned them to return to your teachings,
NEH.9.29	but they were proud and did not obey your commands.
NEH.9.29	If someone obeys your laws, he will live,
NEH.9.29	but they sinned against your laws.
NEH.9.29	They were stubborn, unwilling, and disobedient.
NEH.9.30	You were patient with them for many years
NEH.9.30	and warned them by your Spirit through the prophets,
NEH.9.30	but they did not pay attention.
NEH.9.30	So you handed them over to other countries.
NEH.9.31	But because your mercy is great, you did not kill them all or leave them.
NEH.9.31	You are a kind and merciful God.
NEH.9.32	“And so, our God, you are the great and mighty and wonderful God.
NEH.9.32	You keep your agreement of love.
NEH.9.32	Do not let all our trouble seem unimportant to you.
NEH.9.32	This trouble has come to us, to our kings and our leaders,
NEH.9.32	to our priests and prophets,
NEH.9.32	to our ancestors and all your people
NEH.9.32	from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
NEH.9.33	You have been fair in everything that has happened to us;
NEH.9.33	you have been loyal, but we have been wicked.
NEH.9.34	Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors did not obey your teachings;
NEH.9.34	they did not pay attention to the commands and warnings you gave them.
NEH.9.35	Even when our ancestors were living in their kingdom,
NEH.9.35	enjoying all the good things you had given them,
NEH.9.35	enjoying the land that was fertile and full of room,
NEH.9.35	they did not stop their evil ways.
NEH.9.36	“Look, we are slaves today
NEH.9.36	in the land you gave our ancestors.
NEH.9.36	They were to enjoy its fruit and its good things,
NEH.9.36	but look, we are slaves here.
NEH.9.37	The land’s great harvest belongs to the kings you have put over us
NEH.9.37	because of our sins.
NEH.9.37	Those kings rule over us and our cattle as they please,
NEH.9.37	so we are in much trouble.
NEH.9.38	“Because of all this, we are making an agreement in writing, and our leaders, Levites, and priests are putting their seals on it.”
NEH.10.1	These are the men who sealed the agreement:
NEH.10.1	Nehemiah the governor, son of Hacaliah.
NEH.10.1	Zedekiah, 
NEH.10.2	Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah, 
NEH.10.3	Pashhur, Amariah, Malkijah,

NEH.10.6	Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch, 
NEH.10.7	Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin, 
NEH.10.8	Maaziah, Bilgai, and Shemaiah. These are the priests.
NEH.10.9	These are the Levites who sealed it: Jeshua son of Azaniah, Binnui of the sons of Henadad, Kadmiel, 
NEH.10.10	and their fellow Levites: Shebaniah, Hodiah, Kelita, Pelaiah, Hanan, 
NEH.10.11	Mica, Rehob, Hashabiah, 
NEH.10.12	Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah, 
NEH.10.13	Hodiah, Bani, and Beninu.
NEH.10.14	These are the leaders of the people who sealed the agreement: Parosh, Pahath-Moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, 
NEH.10.15	Bunni, Azgad, Bebai, 
NEH.10.16	Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin, 
NEH.10.17	Ater, Hezekiah, Azzur, 
NEH.10.18	Hodiah, Hashum, Bezai, 
NEH.10.19	Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai, 
NEH.10.20	Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir, 
NEH.10.21	Meshezabel, Zadok, Jaddua,

NEH.10.26	Ahiah, Hanan, Anan, 
NEH.10.27	Malluch, Harim, and Baanah.
NEH.10.28	The rest of the people took an oath. They were the priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, Temple servants, all those who separated themselves from foreigners to keep the Teachings of God, and also their wives and their sons and daughters who could understand. 
NEH.10.29	They joined their fellow Israelites and their leading men in taking an oath, which was tied to a curse in case they broke the oath. They promised to follow the Teachings of God, which they had been given through Moses the servant of God, and to obey all the commands, rules, and laws of the L
NEH.10.30	They said:
NEH.10.30	We promise not to let our daughters marry foreigners nor to let our sons marry their daughters. 
NEH.10.31	Foreigners may bring goods or grain to sell on the Sabbath, but we will not buy on the Sabbath or any holy day. Every seventh year we will not plant, and that year we will forget all that people owe us.
NEH.10.32	We will be responsible for the commands to pay for the service of the Temple of our God. We will give an eighth of an ounce of silver each year. 
NEH.10.33	It is for the bread that is set out on the table; the regular grain offerings and burnt offerings; the offerings on the Sabbaths, New Moon festivals, and special feasts; the holy offerings; the offerings to remove the sins of the Israelites so they will belong to God; and for the work of the Temple of our God.
NEH.10.34	We, the priests, the Levites, and the people, have thrown lots to decide at what time of year each family must bring wood to the Temple. The wood is for burning on the altar of the L
NEH.10.35	We also will bring the first fruits from our crops and the first fruits of every tree to the Temple each year.
NEH.10.36	We will bring to the Temple our firstborn sons and cattle and the firstborn of our herds and flocks, as it is written in the Teachings. We will bring them to the priests who are serving in the Temple.
NEH.10.37	We will bring to the priests at the storerooms of the Temple the first of our ground meal, our offerings, the fruit from all our trees, and our new wine and oil. And we will bring a tenth of our crops to the Levites, who will collect these things in all the towns where we work. 
NEH.10.38	A priest of Aaron’s family must be with the Levites when they receive the tenth of the people’s crops. The Levites must bring a tenth of all they receive to the Temple of our God to put in the storerooms of the treasury. 
NEH.10.39	The people of Israel and the Levites are to bring to the storerooms the gifts of grain, new wine, and oil. That is where the utensils for the Temple are kept and where the priests who are serving, the gatekeepers, and singers stay.
NEH.10.39	We will not ignore the Temple of our God.
NEH.11.1	The leaders of Israel lived in Jerusalem. But the rest of the people threw lots to choose one person out of every ten to come and live in Jerusalem, the holy city. The other nine could stay in their own cities. 
NEH.11.2	The people blessed those who volunteered to live in Jerusalem.
NEH.11.3	These are the area leaders who lived in Jerusalem. (Some people lived on their own land in the cities of Judah. These included Israelites, priests, Levites, Temple servants, and descendants of Solomon’s servants. 
NEH.11.4	Others from the families of Judah and Benjamin lived in Jerusalem.)
NEH.11.4	These are the descendants of Judah who moved into Jerusalem. There was Athaiah son of Uzziah. (Uzziah was the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah. Amariah was the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalalel. Mahalalel was a descendant of Perez.)

NEH.11.8	Following him were Gabbai and Sallai, for a total of 928 men. 
NEH.11.9	Joel son of Zicri was appointed over them, and Judah son of Hassenuah was second in charge of the new area of the city.
NEH.11.10	These are the priests who moved into Jerusalem. There was Jedaiah son of Joiarib, Jakin, 
NEH.11.11	and Seraiah son of Hilkiah, the supervisor in the Temple. (Hilkiah was the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok. Zadok was the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub.) 
NEH.11.12	And there were others with them who did the work for the Temple. All together there were 822 men. Also there was Adaiah son of Jeroham. (Jeroham was the son of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi. Amzi was the son of Zechariah, the son of Pashhur. Pashhur was the son of Malkijah.)

NEH.11.16	And there were Shabbethai and Jozabad, two of the leaders of the Levites who were in charge of the work outside the Temple. 
NEH.11.17	There was Mattaniah son of Mica. (Mica was the son of Zabdi, the son of Asaph.) Mattaniah was the director who led the people in thanksgiving and prayer. There was Bakbukiah, who was second in charge over his fellow Levites. And there was Abda son of Shammua. (Shammua was the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.) 
NEH.11.18	All together 284 Levites lived in the holy city of Jerusalem.
NEH.11.19	The gatekeepers who moved into Jerusalem were Akkub, Talmon, and others with them. There was a total of 172 men who guarded the city gates.
NEH.11.20	The other Israelites, priests, and Levites lived on their own land in all the cities of Judah.
NEH.11.21	The Temple servants lived on the hill of Ophel, and Ziha and Gishpa were in charge of them.
NEH.11.22	Uzzi son of Bani was appointed over the Levites in Jerusalem. (Bani was the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah. Mattaniah was the son of Mica.) Uzzi was one of Asaph’s descendants, who were the singers responsible for the service of the Temple. 
NEH.11.23	The singers were under the king’s orders, which regulated them day by day.
NEH.11.24	Pethahiah son of Meshezabel was the king’s spokesman. (Meshezabel was a descendant of Zerah, the son of Judah.)
NEH.11.25	Some of the people of Judah lived in villages with their surrounding fields. They lived in Kiriath Arba and its surroundings, in Dibon and its surroundings, in Jekabzeel and its surroundings, 
NEH.11.26	in Jeshua, Moladah, Beth Pelet, 
NEH.11.27	Hazar Shual, Beersheba and its surroundings,

NEH.11.29	in En Rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,

NEH.12.8	The Levites were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah. Mattaniah and his relatives were in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 
NEH.12.9	Bakbukiah and Unni, their relatives, stood across from them in the services.
NEH.12.10	Jeshua was the father of Joiakim. Joiakim was the father of Eliashib. Eliashib was the father of Joiada. 
NEH.12.11	Joiada was the father of Jonathan, and Jonathan was the father of Jaddua.
NEH.12.12	In the days of Joiakim, these priests were the leaders of the families of priests: Meraiah, from Seraiah’s family; Hananiah, from Jeremiah’s family; 
NEH.12.13	Meshullam, from Ezra’s family; Jehohanan, from Amariah’s family; 
NEH.12.14	Jonathan, from Malluch’s family; Joseph, from Shecaniah’s family; 
NEH.12.15	Adna, from Harim’s family; Helkai, from Meremoth’s family; 
NEH.12.16	Zechariah, from Iddo’s family; Meshullam, from Ginnethon’s family; 
NEH.12.17	Zicri, from Abijah’s family; Piltai, from Miniamin’s and Moadiah’s families; 
NEH.12.18	Shammua, from Bilgah’s family; Jehonathan, from Shemaiah’s family; 
NEH.12.19	Mattenai, from Joiarib’s family; Uzzi, from Jedaiah’s family; 
NEH.12.20	Kallai, from Sallu’s family; Eber, from Amok’s family; 
NEH.12.21	Hashabiah, from Hilkiah’s family; and Nethanel, from Jedaiah’s family.
NEH.12.22	The leaders of the families of the Levites and the priests were written down in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, while Darius the Persian was king. 
NEH.12.23	The family leaders among the Levites were written down in the history book, but only up to the time of Johanan son of Eliashib. 
NEH.12.24	The leaders of the Levites were Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua son of Kadmiel, and their relatives. Their relatives stood across from them and gave praise and thanksgiving to God. One group answered the other group, as David, the man of God, had commanded.
NEH.12.25	These were the gatekeepers who guarded the storerooms next to the gates: Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub. 
NEH.12.26	They served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, the son of Jozadak. They also served in the days of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and teacher.
NEH.12.27	When the wall of Jerusalem was offered as a gift to God, they asked the Levites to come from wherever they lived to Jerusalem to celebrate with joy the gift of the wall. They were to celebrate with songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps, and lyres. 
NEH.12.28	They also brought together singers from all around Jerusalem, from the Netophathite villages, 
NEH.12.29	from Beth Gilgal, and from the areas of Geba and Azmaveth. The singers had built villages for themselves around Jerusalem. 
NEH.12.30	The priests and Levites made themselves pure, and they also made the people, the gates, and the wall of Jerusalem pure.
NEH.12.31	I had the leaders of Judah go up on top of the wall, and I appointed two large choruses to give thanks. One chorus went to the right on top of the wall, toward the Trash Gate. 
NEH.12.32	Behind them went Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah. 
NEH.12.33	Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
NEH.12.34	Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah also went. 
NEH.12.35	Some priests with trumpets also went, along with Zechariah son of Jonathan. (Jonathan was the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah. Mattaniah was the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur. Zaccur was the son of Asaph.) 
NEH.12.36	Zechariah’s relatives also went. They were Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani. These men played the musical instruments of David, the man of God, and Ezra the teacher walked in front of them. 
NEH.12.37	They went from the Fountain Gate straight up the steps to the highest part of the wall by the older part of the city. They went on above the house of David to the Water Gate on the east.
NEH.12.38	The second chorus went to the left, while I followed them on top of the wall with half the people. We went from the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, 
NEH.12.39	over the Gate of Ephraim to the Old Gate and the Fish Gate, to the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred. We went as far as the Sheep Gate and stopped at the Gate of the Guard.
NEH.12.40	The two choruses took their places at the Temple. Half of the leaders and I did also. 
NEH.12.41	These priests were there with their trumpets: Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah. 
NEH.12.42	These people were also there: Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. The choruses sang, led by Jezrahiah. 
NEH.12.43	The people offered many sacrifices that day and were happy because God had given them great joy. The women and children were happy. The sound of happiness in Jerusalem could be heard far away.
NEH.12.44	At that time the leaders appointed men to be in charge of the storerooms. These rooms were for the gifts, the first fruits, and the ten percent that the people brought. The Teachings said they should bring a share for the priests and Levites from the fields around the towns. The people of Judah were happy to do this for the priests and Levites who served. 
NEH.12.45	They performed the service of their God in making things pure. The singers and gatekeepers also did their jobs, as David had commanded his son Solomon. 
NEH.12.46	Earlier, in the time of David and Asaph, there was a leader of the singers and of the songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
NEH.12.47	So it was in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah. All the people of Israel gave something to the singers and gatekeepers, and they also set aside part for the Levites. Then the Levites set aside part for the descendants of Aaron.
NEH.13.1	On that day they read the Book of Moses to the people, and they found that it said no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be allowed in the meeting to worship. 
NEH.13.2	The Ammonites and Moabites had not welcomed the Israelites with food and water. Instead, they had hired Balaam to put a curse on Israel. (But our God turned the curse into a blessing.) 
NEH.13.3	When the people heard this teaching, they separated all foreigners from Israel.
NEH.13.4	Before that happened, Eliashib the priest, who was in charge of the Temple storerooms, was friendly with Tobiah. 
NEH.13.5	Eliashib let Tobiah use one of the large storerooms. Earlier it had been used for grain offerings, incense, the utensils, and the tenth offerings of grain, new wine, and olive oil that belonged to the Levites, singers, and gatekeepers. It had also been used for gifts for the priests.
NEH.13.6	I was not in Jerusalem when this happened. I had gone back to Artaxerxes king of Babylon in the thirty-second year he was king. Finally I asked the king to let me leave. 
NEH.13.7	When I returned to Jerusalem, I found out the evil Eliashib had done by letting Tobiah have a room in the Temple courtyard. 
NEH.13.8	I was very upset at this, so I threw all of Tobiah’s goods out of the room. 
NEH.13.9	I ordered the rooms to be purified, and I brought back the utensils for God’s Temple, the grain offerings, and the incense.
NEH.13.10	Then I found out the people were not giving the Levites their shares. So the Levites and singers who served had gone back to their own farms. 
NEH.13.11	I argued with the officers, saying, “Why haven’t you taken care of the Temple?” Then I gathered the Levites and singers and put them back at their places.
NEH.13.12	All the people of Judah then brought to the storerooms a tenth of their crops, new wine, and olive oil. 
NEH.13.13	I put these men in charge of the storerooms: Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the teacher, and Pedaiah a Levite. I made Hanan son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah, their helper. Everyone knew they were honest. They gave out the portions that went to their relatives.
NEH.13.14	Remember me, my God, for this. Do not ignore my love for the Temple and its service.
NEH.13.15	In those days I saw people in Judah working in the winepresses on the Sabbath day. They were bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys. And they were bringing loads of wine, grapes, and figs into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I warned them about selling food on that day. 
NEH.13.16	People from the city of Tyre who were living in Jerusalem brought in fish and other things and sold them there on the Sabbath day to the people of Judah. 
NEH.13.17	I argued with the important men of Judah and said to them, “What is this evil thing you are doing? You are ruining the Sabbath day. 
NEH.13.18	This is just what your ancestors did. So our God did terrible things to us and this city. Now you are making him even more angry at Israel by ruining the Sabbath day.”
NEH.13.19	So I ordered that the doors be shut at sunset before the Sabbath and not be opened until the Sabbath was over. I put my servants at the gates so no load could come in on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.20	Once or twice traders and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside Jerusalem. 
NEH.13.21	So I warned them, “Why are you spending the night by the wall? If you do it again, I will force you away.” After that, they did not come back on the Sabbath. 
NEH.13.22	Then I ordered the Levites to purify themselves and to guard the city gates to make sure the Sabbath remained holy.
NEH.13.22	Remember me, my God, for this. Have mercy on me because of your great love.
NEH.13.23	In those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
NEH.13.24	Half their children were speaking the language of Ashdod or some other place, and they couldn’t speak the language of Judah. 
NEH.13.25	I argued with those people, put curses on them, hit some of them, and pulled out their hair. I forced them to make a promise to God, saying, “Do not let your daughters marry the sons of foreigners, and do not take the daughters of foreigners as wives for your sons or yourselves. 
NEH.13.26	Foreign women made King Solomon of Israel sin. There was never a king like him in any of the nations. God loved Solomon and made him king over all Israel, but foreign women made him sin. 
NEH.13.27	And now you are not obedient when you do this evil thing. You are unfaithful to our God when you marry foreign wives.”
NEH.13.28	Joiada was the son of Eliashib the high priest. One of Joiada’s sons married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, so I sent him away from me.
NEH.13.29	Remember them, my God, because they made the priesthood unclean and the agreement of the priests and Levites unclean.
NEH.13.30	So I purified them of everything that was foreign. I appointed duties for the priests and Levites, giving each man his own job. 
NEH.13.31	I also made sure wood was brought for the altar at regular times and that the first fruits were brought.
NEH.13.31	Remember me, my God; be kind to me.
EST.1.1	This is what happened during the time of King Xerxes, the king who ruled the one hundred twenty-seven states from India to Cush. 
EST.1.2	In those days King Xerxes ruled from his capital city of Susa. 
EST.1.3	In the third year of his rule, he gave a banquet for all his important men and royal officers. The army leaders from the countries of Persia and Media and the important men from all Xerxes’ empire were there.
EST.1.4	The banquet lasted one hundred eighty days. All during that time King Xerxes was showing off the great wealth of his kingdom and his own great riches and glory. 
EST.1.5	When the one hundred eighty days were over, the king gave another banquet. It was held in the courtyard of the palace garden for seven days, and it was for everybody in the palace at Susa, from the greatest to the least. 
EST.1.6	The courtyard had fine white curtains and purple drapes that were tied to silver rings on marble pillars by white and purple cords. And there were gold and silver couches on a floor set with tiles of white marble, shells, and gems. 
EST.1.7	Wine was served in gold cups of various kinds. And there was plenty of the king’s wine, because he was very generous. 
EST.1.8	The king commanded that the guests be permitted to drink as much as they wished. He told the wine servers to serve each man what he wanted.
EST.1.9	Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
EST.1.10	On the seventh day of the banquet, King Xerxes was very happy, because he had been drinking much wine. He gave a command to the seven eunuchs who served him—Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas. 
EST.1.11	He commanded them to bring him Queen Vashti, wearing her royal crown. She was to come to show her beauty to the people and important men, because she was very beautiful. 
EST.1.12	The eunuchs told Queen Vashti about the king’s command, but she refused to come. Then the king became very angry; his anger was like a burning fire.
EST.1.13	It was a custom for the king to ask advice from experts about law and order. So King Xerxes spoke with the wise men who would know the right thing to do. 
EST.1.14	The wise men the king usually talked to were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, seven of the important men of Persia and Media. These seven had special privileges to see the king and had the highest rank in the kingdom. 
EST.1.15	The king asked them, “What does the law say must be done to Queen Vashti? She has not obeyed the command of King Xerxes, which the eunuchs took to her.”
EST.1.16	Then Memucan said to the king and the other important men, “Queen Vashti has not done wrong to the king alone. She has also done wrong to all the important men and all the people in all the empire of King Xerxes. 
EST.1.17	All the wives of the important men of Persia and Media will hear about the queen’s actions. Then they will no longer honor their husbands. They will say, ‘King Xerxes commanded Queen Vashti to be brought to him, but she refused to come.’ 
EST.1.18	Today the wives of the important men of Persia and Media have heard about the queen’s actions. So they will speak in the same way to their husbands, and there will be no end to disrespect and anger.
EST.1.19	“So, our king, if it pleases you, give a royal order, and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be changed. The law should say Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Xerxes. Also let the king give her place as queen to someone who is better than she is. 
EST.1.20	And let the king’s order be announced everywhere in his enormous kingdom. Then all the women will respect their husbands, from the greatest to the least.”
EST.1.21	The king and his important men were happy with this advice, so King Xerxes did as Memucan suggested. 
EST.1.22	He sent letters to all the states of the kingdom in the writing of each state and in the language of each group of people. These letters announced that each man was to be the ruler of his own family.
EST.2.1	Later, when King Xerxes was not so angry, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and his order about her. 
EST.2.2	Then the king’s personal servants suggested, “Let a search be made for beautiful young girls for the king. 
EST.2.3	Let the king choose supervisors in every state of his kingdom to bring every beautiful young girl to the palace at Susa. They should be taken to the women’s quarters and put under the care of Hegai, the king’s eunuch in charge of the women. And let beauty treatments be given to them. 
EST.2.4	Then let the girl who most pleases the king become queen in place of Vashti.” The king liked this idea, so he did as they said.
EST.2.5	Now there was a Jewish man in the palace of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair. Jair was the son of Shimei, the son of Kish. Mordecai was from the tribe of Benjamin, 
EST.2.6	which had been taken captive from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. They were part of the group taken into captivity with Jehoiachin king of Judah. 
EST.2.7	Mordecai had a cousin named Hadassah, who had no father or mother, so Mordecai took care of her. Hadassah was also called Esther, and she had a very pretty figure and face. Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter when her father and mother died.
EST.2.8	When the king’s command and order had been heard, many girls had been brought to the palace in Susa and put under the care of Hegai. Esther was also taken to the king’s palace and put under the care of Hegai, who was in charge of the women. 
EST.2.9	Esther pleased Hegai, and he liked her. So Hegai quickly began giving Esther her beauty treatments and special food. He gave her seven servant girls chosen from the king’s palace. Then he moved her and her seven servant girls to the best part of the women’s quarters.
EST.2.10	Esther did not tell anyone about her family or who her people were, because Mordecai had told her not to. 
EST.2.11	Every day Mordecai walked back and forth near the courtyard where the king’s women lived to find out how Esther was and what was happening to her.
EST.2.12	Before a girl could take her turn with King Xerxes, she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments that were ordered for the women. For six months she was treated with oil and myrrh and for six months with perfumes and cosmetics. 
EST.2.13	Then she was ready to go to the king. Anything she asked for was given to her to take with her from the women’s quarters to the king’s palace. 
EST.2.14	In the evening she would go to the king’s palace, and in the morning she would return to another part of the women’s quarters. There she would be placed under the care of Shaashgaz, the king’s eunuch in charge of the slave women. The girl would not go back to the king again unless he was pleased with her and asked for her by name.
EST.2.15	The time came for Esther daughter of Abihail, Mordecai’s uncle, who had been adopted by Mordecai, to go to the king. She asked for only what Hegai suggested she should take. (Hegai was the king’s eunuch who was in charge of the women.) Everyone who saw Esther liked her. 
EST.2.16	So Esther was taken to King Xerxes in the royal palace in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth, during Xerxes’ seventh year as king.
EST.2.17	And the king was pleased with Esther more than with any of the other virgins. He liked her more than any of the others, so he put a royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti. 
EST.2.18	Then the king gave a great banquet for Esther and invited all his important men and royal officers. He announced a holiday for all the empire and had the government give away gifts.
EST.2.19	Now Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate when the girls were gathered the second time. 
EST.2.20	Esther still had not told anyone about her family or who her people were, just as Mordecai had commanded her. She obeyed Mordecai just as she had done when she was under his care.
EST.2.21	Now Bigthana and Teresh were two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the doorway. While Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, they became angry and began to make plans to kill King Xerxes. 
EST.2.22	But Mordecai found out about their plans and told Queen Esther. Then Esther told the king how Mordecai had discovered the evil plan. 
EST.2.23	When the report was investigated, it was found to be true, and the two officers who had planned to kill the king were hanged. All this was written down in the daily court record in the king’s presence.
EST.3.1	After these things happened, King Xerxes honored Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite. He gave him a new rank that was higher than all the important men. 
EST.3.2	All the royal officers at the king’s gate would bow down and kneel before Haman, as the king had ordered. But Mordecai would not bow down or show him honor.
EST.3.3	Then the royal officers at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why don’t you obey the king’s command?” 
EST.3.4	And they said this to him every day. When he did not listen to them, they told Haman about it. They wanted to see if Haman would accept Mordecai’s behavior because Mordecai had told them he was Jewish.
EST.3.5	When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down to him or honor him, he became very angry. 
EST.3.6	He thought of himself as too important to try to kill only Mordecai. He had been told who the people of Mordecai were, so he looked for a way to destroy all of Mordecai’s people, the Jews, in all of Xerxes’ kingdom.
EST.3.7	It was in the first month of the twelfth year of King Xerxes’ rule—the month of Nisan. Pur (that is, the lot) was thrown before Haman to choose a day and a month. So the twelfth month, the month of Adar, was chosen.
EST.3.8	Then Haman said to King Xerxes, “There is a certain group of people scattered among the other people in all the states of your kingdom. Their customs are different from those of all the other people, and they do not obey the king’s laws. It is not right for you to allow them to continue living in your kingdom. 
EST.3.9	If it pleases the king, let an order be given to destroy those people. Then I will pay seven hundred fifty thousand pounds of silver to those who do the king’s business, and they will put it into the royal treasury.”
EST.3.10	So the king took his signet ring off and gave it to Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of the Jewish people. 
EST.3.11	Then the king said to Haman, “The money and the people are yours. Do with them as you please.”
EST.3.12	On the thirteenth day of the first month, the royal secretaries were called, and they wrote out all of Haman’s orders. They wrote to the king’s governors and to the captains of the soldiers in each state and to the important men of each group of people. The orders were written in the writing of each state and in the language of each people. They were written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with his signet ring. 
EST.3.13	Letters were sent by messengers to all the king’s empire ordering them to destroy, kill, and completely wipe out all the Jewish people. That meant young and old, women and little children, too. It was to happen on a single day—the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which was Adar. And they could take everything the Jewish people owned. 
EST.3.14	A copy of the order was given out as a law in every state so all the people would be ready for that day.
EST.3.15	The messengers set out, hurried by the king’s command, as soon as the order was given in the palace at Susa. The king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa was in confusion.
EST.4.1	When Mordecai heard about all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on rough cloth and ashes, and went out into the city crying loudly and painfully. 
EST.4.2	But Mordecai went only as far as the king’s gate, because no one was allowed to enter that gate dressed in rough cloth. 
EST.4.3	As the king’s order reached every area, there was great sadness and loud crying among the Jewish people. They fasted and cried out loud, and many of them lay down on rough cloth and ashes to show how sad they were.
EST.4.4	When Esther’s servant girls and eunuchs came to her and told her about Mordecai, she was very upset and afraid. She sent clothes for Mordecai to put on instead of the rough cloth, but he would not wear them. 
EST.4.5	Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs chosen by the king to serve her. Esther ordered him to find out what was bothering Mordecai and why.
EST.4.6	So Hathach went to Mordecai, who was in the city square in front of the king’s gate. 
EST.4.7	Mordecai told Hathach everything that had happened to him, and he told Hathach about the amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the king’s treasury for the killing of the Jewish people. 
EST.4.8	Mordecai also gave him a copy of the order to kill the Jewish people, which had been given in Susa. He wanted Hathach to show it to Esther and to tell her about it. And Mordecai told him to order Esther to go into the king’s presence to beg for mercy and to plead with him for her people.
EST.4.9	Hathach went back and reported to Esther everything Mordecai had said. 
EST.4.10	Then Esther told Hathach to tell Mordecai, 
EST.4.11	“All the royal officers and people of the royal states know that no man or woman may go to the king in the inner courtyard without being called. There is only one law about this: Anyone who enters must be put to death unless the king holds out his gold scepter. Then that person may live. And I have not been called to go to the king for thirty days.”
EST.4.12	Esther’s message was given to Mordecai. 
EST.4.13	Then Mordecai sent back word to Esther: “Just because you live in the king’s palace, don’t think that out of all the Jewish people you alone will escape. 
EST.4.14	If you keep quiet at this time, someone else will help and save the Jewish people, but you and your father’s family will all die. And who knows, you may have been chosen queen for just such a time as this.”
EST.4.15	Then Esther sent this answer to Mordecai: 
EST.4.16	“Go and get all the Jewish people in Susa together. For my sake, fast; do not eat or drink for three days, night and day. I and my servant girls will also fast. Then I will go to the king, even though it is against the law, and if I die, I die.”
EST.4.17	So Mordecai went away and did everything Esther had told him to do.
EST.5.1	On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner courtyard of the king’s palace, facing the king’s hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall, facing the doorway. 
EST.5.2	When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, he was pleased. He held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand, so Esther went forward and touched the end of it.
EST.5.3	The king asked, “What is it, Queen Esther? What do you want to ask me? I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.”
EST.5.4	Esther answered, “My king, if it pleases you, come today with Haman to a banquet that I have prepared for you.”
EST.5.5	Then the king said, “Bring Haman quickly so we may do what Esther asks.”
EST.5.5	So the king and Haman went to the banquet Esther had prepared for them. 
EST.5.6	As they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, “Now, what are you asking for? I will give it to you. What is it you want? I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.”
EST.5.7	Esther answered, “This is what I want and what I ask for. 
EST.5.8	My king, if you are pleased with me and if it pleases you, give me what I ask for and do what I want. Come with Haman tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for you. Then I will answer your question about what I want.”
EST.5.9	Haman left the king’s palace that day happy and content. But when he saw Mordecai at the king’s gate and saw that Mordecai did not stand up or tremble with fear before him, Haman became very angry with Mordecai. 
EST.5.10	But he controlled his anger and went home.
EST.5.10	Then Haman called together his friends and his wife, Zeresh. 
EST.5.11	He told them how wealthy he was and how many sons he had. He also told them all the ways the king had honored him and how the king had placed him higher than his important men and his royal officers. 
EST.5.12	He also said, “I’m the only person Queen Esther invited to come with the king to the banquet she gave. And tomorrow also the queen has asked me to be her guest with the king. 
EST.5.13	But all this does not really make me happy when I see that Jew Mordecai sitting at the king’s gate.”
EST.5.14	Then Haman’s wife, Zeresh, and all his friends said, “Have a seventy-five foot platform built, and in the morning ask the king to have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go to the banquet with the king and be happy.” Haman liked this suggestion, so he ordered the platform to be built.
EST.6.1	That same night the king could not sleep. So he gave an order for the daily court record to be brought in and read to him. 
EST.6.2	It was found recorded that Mordecai had warned the king about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s officers who guarded the doorway and who had planned to kill the king.
EST.6.3	The king asked, “What honor and reward have been given to Mordecai for this?”
EST.6.3	The king’s personal servants answered, “Nothing has been done for Mordecai.”
EST.6.4	The king said, “Who is in the courtyard?” Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king’s palace. He had come to ask the king about hanging Mordecai on the platform he had prepared.
EST.6.5	The king’s personal servants said, “Haman is standing in the courtyard.”
EST.6.5	The king said, “Bring him in.”
EST.6.6	So Haman came in. And the king asked him, “What should be done for a man whom the king wants very much to honor?”
EST.6.6	And Haman thought to himself, “Whom would the king want to honor more than me?” 
EST.6.7	So he answered the king, “This is what you could do for the man you want very much to honor. 
EST.6.8	Have the servants bring a royal robe that the king himself has worn. And also bring a horse with a royal crown on its head, a horse that the king himself has ridden. 
EST.6.9	Let the robe and the horse be given to one of the king’s most important men. Let the servants put the robe on the man the king wants to honor, and let them lead him on the horse through the city streets. As they are leading him, let them announce: ‘This is what is done for the man whom the king wants to honor!’ ”
EST.6.10	The king commanded Haman, “Go quickly. Take the robe and the horse just as you have said, and do all this for Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king’s gate. Do not leave out anything you have suggested.”
EST.6.11	So Haman took the robe and the horse, and he put the robe on Mordecai. Then he led him on horseback through the city streets, announcing before Mordecai: “This is what is done for the man whom the king wants to honor!”
EST.6.12	Then Mordecai returned to the king’s gate, but Haman hurried home with his head covered, because he was embarrassed and ashamed. 
EST.6.13	He told his wife, Zeresh, and all his friends everything that had happened to him.
EST.6.13	Haman’s wife and the men who gave him advice said, “You are starting to lose power to Mordecai. Since he is a Jew, you cannot win against him. You will surely be ruined.” 
EST.6.14	While they were still talking, the king’s eunuchs came to Haman’s house and made him hurry to the banquet Esther had prepared.
EST.7.1	So the king and Haman went in to eat with Queen Esther. 
EST.7.2	As they were drinking wine on the second day, the king asked Esther again, “What are you asking for? I will give it to you. What is it you want? I will give you as much as half of my kingdom.”
EST.7.3	Then Queen Esther answered, “My king, if you are pleased with me, and if it pleases you, let me live. This is what I ask. And let my people live, too. This is what I want. 
EST.7.4	My people and I have been sold to be destroyed, to be killed and completely wiped out. If we had been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because that would not be enough of a problem to bother the king.”
EST.7.5	Then King Xerxes asked Queen Esther, “Who is he, and where is he? Who has done such a thing?”
EST.7.6	Esther said, “Our enemy and foe is this wicked Haman!”
EST.7.6	Then Haman was filled with terror before the king and queen. 
EST.7.7	The king was very angry, so he got up, left his wine, and went out into the palace garden. But Haman stayed inside to beg Queen Esther to save his life. He could see that the king had already decided to kill him.
EST.7.8	When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall, he saw Haman falling on the couch where Esther was lying. The king said, “Will he even attack the queen while I am in the house?”
EST.7.8	As soon as the king said that, servants came in and covered Haman’s face. 
EST.7.9	Harbona, one of the eunuchs there serving the king, said, “Look, a seventy-five foot platform stands near Haman’s house. This is the one Haman had prepared for Mordecai, who gave the warning that saved the king.”
EST.7.9	The king said, “Hang Haman on it!” 
EST.7.10	So they hanged Haman on the platform he had prepared for Mordecai. Then the king was not so angry anymore.
EST.8.1	That same day King Xerxes gave Queen Esther everything Haman, the enemy of the Jewish people, had left when he died. And Mordecai came in to see the king, because Esther had told the king how he was related to her. 
EST.8.2	Then the king took off his signet ring that he had taken back from Haman, and he gave it to Mordecai. Esther put Mordecai in charge of everything Haman left when he died.
EST.8.3	Once again Esther spoke to the king. She fell at the king’s feet and cried and begged him to stop the evil plan that Haman the Agagite had planned against the Jews. 
EST.8.4	The king held out the gold scepter to Esther. So Esther got up and stood in front of him.
EST.8.5	She said, “My king, if you are pleased with me, and if it pleases you to do this, if you think it is the right thing to do, and if you are happy with me, let an order be written to cancel the letters Haman wrote. Haman the Agagite sent messages to destroy all the Jewish people in all of your kingdom. 
EST.8.6	I could not stand to see that terrible thing happen to my people. I could not stand to see my family killed.”
EST.8.7	King Xerxes answered Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, “Because Haman was against the Jewish people, I have given his things to Esther, and my soldiers have hanged him. 
EST.8.8	Now, in the king’s name, write another order to the Jewish people as it seems best to you. Then seal the order with the king’s signet ring, because no letter written in the king’s name and sealed with his signet ring can be canceled.”
EST.8.9	At that time the king’s secretaries were called. This was the twenty-third day of the third month, which is Sivan. The secretaries wrote out all of Mordecai’s orders to the Jews, to the governors, to the captains of the soldiers in each state, and to the important men of the one hundred twenty-seven states that reached from India to Cush. They wrote in the writing of each state and in the language of each people. They also wrote to the Jewish people in their own writing and language. 
EST.8.10	Mordecai wrote orders in the name of King Xerxes and sealed the letters with the king’s signet ring. Then he sent the king’s orders by messengers on fast horses, horses that were raised just for the king.
EST.8.11	These were the king’s orders: The Jewish people in every city have the right to gather together to protect themselves. They may destroy, kill, and completely wipe out the army of any state or people who attack them. And they are to do the same to the women and children of that army. They may also take by force the property of their enemies. 
EST.8.12	The one day set for the Jewish people to do this in all the empire of King Xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. 
EST.8.13	A copy of the king’s order was to be sent out as a law in every state. It was to be made known to the people of every nation living in the kingdom so the Jewish people would be ready on that set day to strike back at their enemies.
EST.8.14	The messengers hurried out, riding on the royal horses, because the king commanded those messengers to hurry. And the order was also given in the palace at Susa.
EST.8.15	Mordecai left the king’s presence wearing royal clothes of blue and white and a large gold crown. He also had a purple robe made of the best linen. And the people of Susa shouted for joy. 
EST.8.16	It was a time of happiness, joy, gladness, and honor for the Jewish people. 
EST.8.17	As the king’s order went to every state and city, there was joy and gladness among the Jewish people. In every state and city to which the king’s order went, they were having feasts and celebrating. And many people through all the empire became Jews, because they were afraid of the Jewish people.
EST.9.1	The order the king had commanded was to be done on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar. That was the day the enemies of the Jewish people had hoped to defeat them, but that was changed. So the Jewish people themselves defeated those who hated them. 
EST.9.2	The Jews met in their cities in all the empire of King Xerxes in order to attack those who wanted to harm them. No one was strong enough to fight against them, because all the other people living in the empire were afraid of them. 
EST.9.3	All the important men of the states, the governors, captains of the soldiers, and the king’s officers helped the Jewish people, because they were afraid of Mordecai. 
EST.9.4	Mordecai was very important in the king’s palace. He was famous in all the empire, because he was becoming a leader of more and more people.
EST.9.5	And, with their swords, the Jewish people defeated all their enemies, killing and destroying them. And they did what they wanted with those people who hated them. 
EST.9.6	In the palace at Susa, they killed and destroyed five hundred men. 
EST.9.7	They also killed: Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
EST.9.8	Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
EST.9.9	Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
EST.9.10	the ten sons of Haman, son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jewish people. But the Jewish people did not take their belongings.
EST.9.11	On that day the number killed in the palace at Susa was reported to the king. 
EST.9.12	The king said to Queen Esther, “The Jewish people have killed and destroyed five hundred people in the palace at Susa, and they have also killed Haman’s ten sons. What have they done in the rest of the king’s empire! Now what else are you asking? I will do it! What else do you want? It will be done!”
EST.9.13	Esther answered, “If it pleases the king, give the Jewish people who are in Susa permission to do again tomorrow what the king ordered for today. And let the bodies of Haman’s ten sons be hanged on the platform.”
EST.9.14	So the king ordered that it be done. A law was given in Susa, and the bodies of the ten sons of Haman were hanged. 
EST.9.15	The Jewish people in Susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. They killed three hundred people in Susa, but they did not take their belongings.
EST.9.16	At that same time, all the Jewish people in the king’s empire also met to protect themselves and get rid of their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of those who hated them, but they did not take their belongings. 
EST.9.17	This happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. On the fourteenth day they rested and made it a day of joyful feasting.
EST.9.18	But the Jewish people in Susa met on the thirteenth and fourteenth days of the month of Adar. Then they rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of joyful feasting.
EST.9.19	This is why the Jewish people who live in the country and small villages celebrate on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. It is a day of joyful feasting and a day for exchanging gifts.
EST.9.20	Mordecai wrote down everything that had happened. Then he sent letters to all the Jewish people in all the empire of King Xerxes, far and near. 
EST.9.21	He told them to celebrate every year on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of Adar, 
EST.9.22	because that was when the Jewish people got rid of their enemies. They were also to celebrate it as the month their sadness was turned to joy and their crying for the dead was turned into celebration. He told them to celebrate those days as days of joyful feasting and as a time for giving food to each other and presents to the poor.
EST.9.23	So the Jewish people agreed to do what Mordecai had written to them, and they agreed to hold the celebration every year. 
EST.9.24	Haman son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, was the enemy of all the Jewish people. He had made an evil plan against the Jewish people to destroy them, and he had thrown the Pur (that is, the lot) to choose a day to ruin and destroy them. 
EST.9.25	But when the king learned of the evil plan, he sent out written orders that the evil plans Haman had made against the Jewish people would be used against him. And those orders said that Haman and his sons should be hanged on the platform. 
EST.9.26	So these days were called Purim, which comes from the word “Pur” (the lot). Because of everything written in this letter and what they had seen and what happened to them, 
EST.9.27	the Jewish people set up this custom. They and their descendants and all those who join them are always to celebrate these two days every year. They should do it in the right way and at the time Mordecai had ordered them in the letter. 
EST.9.28	These two days should be remembered and celebrated from now on in every family, in every state, and in every city. These days of Purim should always be celebrated by the Jewish people, and their descendants should always remember to celebrate them, too.
EST.9.29	So Queen Esther daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote this second letter about Purim. Using the power they had, they wrote to prove the first letter was true. 
EST.9.30	And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jewish people in the one hundred twenty-seven states of the kingdom of Xerxes, writing them a message of peace and truth. 
EST.9.31	He wrote to set up these days of Purim at the chosen times. Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had sent out the order for the Jewish people, just as they had set up things for themselves and their descendants: On these two days the people should fast and cry loudly. 
EST.9.32	Esther’s letter set up the rules for Purim, and they were written down in the records.
EST.10.1	King Xerxes demanded taxes everywhere, even from the cities on the seacoast. 
EST.10.2	And all the great things Xerxes did by his power and strength are written in the record books of the kings of Media and Persia. Also written in those record books are all the things done by Mordecai, whom the king made great. 
EST.10.3	Mordecai the Jew was second in importance to King Xerxes, and he was the most important man among the Jewish people. His fellow Jews respected him very much, because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the safety of all the Jewish people. 
JOB.1.1	A man named Job lived in the land of Uz. He was an honest and innocent man; he honored God and stayed away from evil. 
JOB.1.2	Job had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.1.3	He owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred teams of oxen, and five hundred female donkeys. He also had a large number of servants. He was the greatest man among all the people of the East.
JOB.1.4	Job’s sons took turns holding feasts in their homes and invited their sisters to eat and drink with them. 
JOB.1.5	After a feast was over, Job would send and have them made clean. Early in the morning Job would offer a burnt offering for each of them, because he thought, “My children may have sinned and cursed God in their hearts.” Job did this every time.
JOB.1.6	One day the angels came to show themselves before the L
JOB.1.7	The L
JOB.1.7	Satan answered the L
JOB.1.8	Then the L
JOB.1.9	But Satan answered the L
JOB.1.10	You have put a wall around him, his family, and everything he owns. You have blessed the things he has done. His flocks and herds are so large they almost cover the land. 
JOB.1.11	But reach out your hand and destroy everything he has, and he will curse you to your face.”
JOB.1.12	The L
JOB.1.13	One day Job’s sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine together at the oldest brother’s house. 
JOB.1.14	A messenger came to Job and said, “The oxen were plowing and the donkeys were eating grass nearby, 
JOB.1.15	when the Sabeans attacked and carried them away. They killed the servants with swords, and I am the only one who escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.16	The messenger was still speaking when another messenger arrived and said, “Lightning from God fell from the sky. It burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.17	The second messenger was still speaking when another messenger arrived and said, “The Babylonians sent three groups of attackers that swept down and stole your camels and killed the servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.18	The third messenger was still speaking when another messenger arrived and said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine together at the oldest brother’s house. 
JOB.1.19	Suddenly a great wind came from the desert, hitting all four corners of the house at once. The house fell in on the young people, and they are all dead. I am the only one who escaped to tell you!”
JOB.1.20	When Job heard this, he got up and tore his robe and shaved his head to show how sad he was. Then he bowed down to the ground to worship God. 
JOB.1.21	He said:
JOB.1.21	“I was naked when I was born,
JOB.1.21	and I will be naked when I die.
JOB.1.21	The L
JOB.1.21	and he has taken them away.
JOB.1.21	Praise the name of the L
JOB.1.22	In all this Job did not sin or blame God.
JOB.2.1	On another day the angels came to show themselves before the L
JOB.2.2	The L
JOB.2.2	Satan answered the L
JOB.2.3	Then the L
JOB.2.4	“One skin for another!” Satan answered. “A man will give all he has to save his own life. 
JOB.2.5	But reach out your hand and destroy his flesh and bones, and he will curse you to your face.”
JOB.2.6	The L
JOB.2.7	So Satan left the L
JOB.2.8	Job took a piece of broken pottery to scrape himself, and he sat in ashes in misery.
JOB.2.9	Job’s wife said to him, “Why are you trying to stay innocent? Curse God and die!”
JOB.2.10	Job answered, “You are talking like a foolish woman. Should we take only good things from God and not trouble?” In spite of all this Job did not sin in what he said.
JOB.2.11	Now Job had three friends: Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. When these friends heard about Job’s troubles, they agreed to meet and visit him. They wanted to show their concern and to comfort him. 
JOB.2.12	They saw Job from far away, but he looked so different they almost didn’t recognize him. They began to cry loudly and tore their robes and put dirt on their heads to show how sad they were. 
JOB.2.13	Then they sat on the ground with Job seven days and seven nights. No one said a word to him because they saw how much he was suffering.
JOB.3.1	After seven days Job cried out and cursed the day he had been born, 
JOB.3.2	saying:
JOB.3.3	“Let the day I was born be destroyed,
JOB.3.3	and the night it was said, ‘A boy is born!’
JOB.3.4	Let that day turn to darkness.
JOB.3.4	Don’t let God care about it.
JOB.3.4	Don’t let light shine on it.
JOB.3.5	Let darkness and gloom have that day.
JOB.3.5	Let a cloud hide it.
JOB.3.5	Let thick darkness cover its light.
JOB.3.6	Let thick darkness capture that night.
JOB.3.6	Don’t count it among the days of the year
JOB.3.6	or put it in any of the months.
JOB.3.7	Let that night be empty,
JOB.3.7	with no shout of joy to be heard.
JOB.3.8	Let those who curse days curse that day.
JOB.3.8	Let them prepare to wake up the sea monster Leviathan.
JOB.3.9	Let that day’s morning stars never appear;
JOB.3.9	let it wait for daylight that never comes.
JOB.3.9	Don’t let it see the first light of dawn,
JOB.3.10	because it allowed me to be born
JOB.3.10	and did not hide trouble from my eyes.
JOB.3.11	“Why didn’t I die as soon as I was born?
JOB.3.11	Why didn’t I die when I came out of the womb?
JOB.3.12	Why did my mother’s knees receive me,
JOB.3.12	and my mother’s breasts feed me?
JOB.3.13	If they had not been there,
JOB.3.13	I would be lying dead in peace;
JOB.3.13	I would be asleep and at rest
JOB.3.14	with kings and wise men of the earth
JOB.3.14	who built places for themselves that are now ruined.
JOB.3.15	I would be asleep with rulers
JOB.3.15	who filled their houses with gold and silver.
JOB.3.16	Why was I not buried like a child born dead,
JOB.3.16	like a baby who never saw the light of day?
JOB.3.17	In the grave the wicked stop making trouble,
JOB.3.17	and the weary workers are at rest.
JOB.3.18	In the grave there is rest for the captives
JOB.3.18	who no longer hear the shout of the slave driver.
JOB.3.19	People great and small are in the grave,
JOB.3.19	and the slave is freed from his master.
JOB.3.20	“Why is light given to those in misery?
JOB.3.20	Why is life given to those who are so unhappy?
JOB.3.21	They want to die, but death does not come.
JOB.3.21	They search for death more than for hidden treasure.
JOB.3.22	They are very happy
JOB.3.22	when they get to the grave.
JOB.3.23	They cannot see where they are going.
JOB.3.23	God has hidden the road ahead.
JOB.3.24	I make sad sounds as I eat;
JOB.3.24	my groans pour out like water.
JOB.3.25	Everything I feared and dreaded
JOB.3.25	has happened to me.
JOB.3.26	I have no peace or quietness.
JOB.3.26	I have no rest, only trouble.”
JOB.4.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
JOB.4.2	“If someone tried to speak with you, would you be upset?
JOB.4.2	I cannot keep from speaking.
JOB.4.3	Think about the many people you have taught
JOB.4.3	and the weak hands you have made strong.
JOB.4.4	Your words have comforted those who fell,
JOB.4.4	and you have strengthened those who could not stand.
JOB.4.5	But now trouble comes to you, and you are discouraged;
JOB.4.5	trouble hits you, and you are terrified.
JOB.4.6	You should have confidence because you respect God;
JOB.4.6	you should have hope because you are innocent.
JOB.4.7	“Remember that the innocent will not die;
JOB.4.7	honest people will never be destroyed.
JOB.4.8	I have noticed that people who plow evil
JOB.4.8	and plant trouble, harvest it.
JOB.4.9	God’s breath destroys them,
JOB.4.9	and a blast of his anger kills them.
JOB.4.10	Lions may roar and growl,
JOB.4.10	but when the teeth of a strong lion are broken,
JOB.4.11	that lion dies of hunger.
JOB.4.11	The cubs of the mother lion are scattered.
JOB.4.12	“A word was brought to me in secret,
JOB.4.12	and my ears heard a whisper of it.
JOB.4.13	It was during a nightmare
JOB.4.13	when people are in deep sleep.
JOB.4.14	I was trembling with fear;
JOB.4.14	all my bones were shaking.
JOB.4.15	A spirit glided past my face,
JOB.4.15	and the hair on my body stood on end.
JOB.4.16	The spirit stopped,
JOB.4.16	but I could not see what it was.
JOB.4.16	A shape stood before my eyes,
JOB.4.16	and I heard a quiet voice.
JOB.4.17	It said, ‘Can a human be more right than God?
JOB.4.17	Can a person be pure before his maker?
JOB.4.18	God does not trust his angels;
JOB.4.18	he blames them for mistakes.
JOB.4.19	So he puts even more blame on people who live in clay houses,
JOB.4.19	whose foundations are made of dust,
JOB.4.19	who can be crushed like a moth.
JOB.4.20	Between dawn and sunset many people are broken to pieces;
JOB.4.20	without being noticed, they die and are gone forever.
JOB.4.21	The ropes of their tents are pulled up,
JOB.4.21	and they die without wisdom.’
JOB.5.1	“Call if you want to, Job, but no one will answer you.
JOB.5.1	You can’t turn to any of the holy ones.
JOB.5.2	Anger kills the fool,
JOB.5.2	and jealousy slays the stupid.
JOB.5.3	I have seen a fool succeed,
JOB.5.3	but I cursed his home immediately.
JOB.5.4	His children are far from safety
JOB.5.4	and are crushed in court with no defense.
JOB.5.5	The hungry eat his harvest,
JOB.5.5	even taking what grew among the thorns,
JOB.5.5	and thirsty people want his wealth.
JOB.5.6	Hard times do not come up from the ground,
JOB.5.6	and trouble does not grow from the earth.
JOB.5.7	People produce trouble
JOB.5.7	as surely as sparks fly upward.
JOB.5.8	“But if I were you, I would call on God
JOB.5.8	and bring my problem before him.
JOB.5.9	God does wonders that cannot be understood;
JOB.5.9	he does so many miracles they cannot be counted.
JOB.5.10	He gives rain to the earth
JOB.5.10	and sends water on the fields.
JOB.5.11	He makes the humble person important
JOB.5.11	and lifts the sad to places of safety.
JOB.5.12	He ruins the plans of those who trick others
JOB.5.12	so they have no success.
JOB.5.13	He catches the wise in their own clever traps
JOB.5.13	and sweeps away the plans of those who try to trick others.
JOB.5.14	Darkness covers them up in the daytime;
JOB.5.14	even at noon they feel around in the dark.
JOB.5.15	God saves the needy from their lies
JOB.5.15	and from the harm done by powerful people.
JOB.5.16	So the poor have hope,
JOB.5.16	while those who are unfair are silenced.
JOB.5.17	“The one whom God corrects is happy,
JOB.5.17	so do not hate being corrected by the Almighty.
JOB.5.18	God hurts, but he also bandages up;
JOB.5.18	he injures, but his hands also heal.
JOB.5.19	He will save you from six troubles;
JOB.5.19	even seven troubles will not harm you.
JOB.5.20	God will buy you back from death in times of hunger,
JOB.5.20	and in battle he will save you from the sword.
JOB.5.21	You will be protected from the tongue that strikes like a whip,
JOB.5.21	and you will not be afraid when destruction comes.
JOB.5.22	You will laugh at destruction and hunger,
JOB.5.22	and you will not fear the wild animals,
JOB.5.23	because you will have an agreement with the stones in the field,
JOB.5.23	and the wild animals will be at peace with you.
JOB.5.24	You will know that your tent is safe,
JOB.5.24	because you will check the things you own and find nothing missing.
JOB.5.25	You will know that you will have many children,
JOB.5.25	and your descendants will be like the grass on the earth.
JOB.5.26	You will come to the grave with all your strength,
JOB.5.26	like bundles of grain gathered at the right time.
JOB.5.27	“We have checked this, and it is true,
JOB.5.27	so hear it and decide what it means to you.”
JOB.6.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.6.2	“I wish my suffering could be weighed
JOB.6.2	and my misery put on scales.
JOB.6.3	My sadness would be heavier than the sand of the seas.
JOB.6.3	No wonder my words seem careless.
JOB.6.4	The arrows of the Almighty are in me;
JOB.6.4	my spirit drinks in their poison;
JOB.6.4	God’s terrors are gathered against me.
JOB.6.5	A wild donkey does not bray when it has grass to eat,
JOB.6.5	and an ox is quiet when it has feed.
JOB.6.6	Tasteless food is not eaten without salt,
JOB.6.6	and there is no flavor in the white of an egg.
JOB.6.7	I refuse to touch it;
JOB.6.7	such food makes me sick.
JOB.6.8	“How I wish that I might have what I ask for
JOB.6.8	and that God would give me what I hope for.
JOB.6.9	How I wish God would crush me
JOB.6.9	and reach out his hand to destroy me.
JOB.6.10	Then I would have this comfort
JOB.6.10	and be glad even in this unending pain,
JOB.6.10	because I would know I did not reject the words of the Holy One.
JOB.6.11	“I do not have the strength to wait.
JOB.6.11	There is nothing to hope for,
JOB.6.11	so why should I be patient?
JOB.6.12	I do not have the strength of stone;
JOB.6.12	my flesh is not bronze.
JOB.6.13	I have no power to help myself,
JOB.6.13	because success has been taken away from me.
JOB.6.14	“They say, ‘A person’s friends should be kind to him when he is in trouble,
JOB.6.14	even if he stops fearing the Almighty.’
JOB.6.15	But my brothers cannot be counted on.
JOB.6.15	They are like streams that do not always flow,
JOB.6.15	streams that sometimes run over.
JOB.6.16	They are made dark by melting ice
JOB.6.16	and rise with melting snow.
JOB.6.17	But they stop flowing in the dry season;
JOB.6.17	they disappear when it is hot.
JOB.6.18	Travelers turn away from their paths
JOB.6.18	and go into the desert and die.
JOB.6.19	The groups of travelers from Tema look for water,
JOB.6.19	and the traders of Sheba look hopefully.
JOB.6.20	They are upset because they had been sure;
JOB.6.20	when they arrive, they are disappointed.
JOB.6.21	You also have been no help.
JOB.6.21	You see something terrible, and you are afraid.
JOB.6.22	I have never said, ‘Give me a gift.
JOB.6.22	Use your wealth to pay my debt.
JOB.6.23	Save me from the enemy’s power.
JOB.6.23	Buy me back from the clutches of cruel people.’
JOB.6.24	“Teach me, and I will be quiet.
JOB.6.24	Show me where I have been wrong.
JOB.6.25	Honest words are painful,
JOB.6.25	but your arguments prove nothing.
JOB.6.26	Do you mean to correct what I say?
JOB.6.26	Will you treat the words of a troubled man as if they were only wind?
JOB.6.27	You would even gamble for orphans
JOB.6.27	and would trade away your friend.
JOB.6.28	“But now please look at me.
JOB.6.28	I would not lie to your face.
JOB.6.29	Change your mind; do not be unfair;
JOB.6.29	think again, because my innocence is being questioned.
JOB.6.30	What I am saying is not wicked;
JOB.6.30	I can tell the difference between right and wrong.
JOB.7.1	“People have a hard task on earth,
JOB.7.1	and their days are like those of a laborer.
JOB.7.2	They are like a slave wishing for the evening shadows,
JOB.7.2	like a laborer waiting to be paid.
JOB.7.3	But I am given months that are empty,
JOB.7.3	and nights of misery have been given to me.
JOB.7.4	When I lie down, I think, ‘How long until I get up?’
JOB.7.4	The night is long, and I toss until dawn.
JOB.7.5	My body is covered with worms and scabs,
JOB.7.5	and my skin is broken and full of sores.
JOB.7.6	“My days go by faster than a weaver’s tool,
JOB.7.6	and they come to an end without hope.
JOB.7.7	Remember, God, that my life is only a breath.
JOB.7.7	My eyes will never see happy times again.
JOB.7.8	Those who see me now will see me no more;
JOB.7.8	you will look for me, but I will be gone.
JOB.7.9	As a cloud disappears and is gone,
JOB.7.9	people go to the grave and never return.
JOB.7.10	They will never come back to their houses again,
JOB.7.10	and their places will not know them anymore.
JOB.7.11	“So I will not stay quiet;
JOB.7.11	I will speak out in the suffering of my spirit.
JOB.7.11	I will complain because I am so unhappy.
JOB.7.12	I am not the sea or the sea monster.
JOB.7.12	So why have you set a guard over me?
JOB.7.13	Sometimes I think my bed will comfort me
JOB.7.13	or that my couch will stop my complaint.
JOB.7.14	Then you frighten me with dreams
JOB.7.14	and terrify me with visions.
JOB.7.15	My throat prefers to be choked;
JOB.7.15	my bones welcome death.
JOB.7.16	I hate my life; I don’t want to live forever.
JOB.7.16	Leave me alone, because my days have no meaning.
JOB.7.17	“Why do you make people so important
JOB.7.17	and give them so much attention?
JOB.7.18	You examine them every morning
JOB.7.18	and test them every moment.
JOB.7.19	Will you never look away from me
JOB.7.19	or leave me alone even long enough to swallow?
JOB.7.20	If I have sinned, what have I done to you,
JOB.7.20	you watcher of humans?
JOB.7.20	Why have you made me your target?
JOB.7.20	Have I become a heavy load for you?
JOB.7.21	Why don’t you pardon my wrongs
JOB.7.21	and forgive my sins?
JOB.7.21	I will soon lie down in the dust of death.
JOB.7.21	Then you will search for me, but I will be no more.”
JOB.8.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
JOB.8.2	“How long will you say such things?
JOB.8.2	Your words are no more than wind.
JOB.8.3	God does not twist justice;
JOB.8.3	the Almighty does not make wrong what is right.
JOB.8.4	Your children sinned against God,
JOB.8.4	and he punished them for their sins.
JOB.8.5	But you should ask God for help
JOB.8.5	and pray to the Almighty for mercy.
JOB.8.6	If you are good and honest,
JOB.8.6	he will stand up for you
JOB.8.6	and bring you back where you belong.
JOB.8.7	Where you began will seem unimportant,
JOB.8.7	because your future will be so successful.
JOB.8.8	“Ask old people;
JOB.8.8	find out what their ancestors learned,
JOB.8.9	because we were only born yesterday and know nothing.
JOB.8.9	Our days on earth are only a shadow.
JOB.8.10	Those people will teach you and tell you
JOB.8.10	and speak about what they know.
JOB.8.11	Papyrus plants cannot grow where there is no swamp,
JOB.8.11	and reeds cannot grow tall without water.
JOB.8.12	While they are still growing and not yet cut,
JOB.8.12	they will dry up quicker than grass.
JOB.8.13	That is what will happen to those who forget God;
JOB.8.13	the hope of the wicked will be gone.
JOB.8.14	What they hope in is easily broken;
JOB.8.14	what they trust is like a spider’s web.
JOB.8.15	They lean on the spider’s web, but it breaks.
JOB.8.15	They grab it, but it does not hold up.
JOB.8.16	They are like well-watered plants in the sunshine
JOB.8.16	that spread their roots all through the garden.
JOB.8.17	They wrap their roots around a pile of rocks
JOB.8.17	and look for a place among the stones.
JOB.8.18	But if a plant is torn from its place,
JOB.8.18	then that place rejects it and says, ‘I never saw you.’
JOB.8.19	Now joy has gone away;
JOB.8.19	other plants grow up from the same dirt.
JOB.8.20	“Surely God does not reject the innocent
JOB.8.20	or give strength to those who do evil.
JOB.8.21	God will yet fill your mouth with laughter
JOB.8.21	and your lips with shouts of joy.
JOB.8.22	Your enemies will be covered with shame,
JOB.8.22	and the tents of the wicked will be gone.”
JOB.9.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.9.2	“Yes, I know that this is true,
JOB.9.2	but how can anyone be right in the presence of God?
JOB.9.3	Someone might want to argue with God,
JOB.9.3	but no one could answer God,
JOB.9.3	not one time out of a thousand.
JOB.9.4	God’s wisdom is deep, and his power is great;
JOB.9.4	no one can fight him without getting hurt.
JOB.9.5	God moves mountains without anyone knowing it
JOB.9.5	and turns them over when he is angry.
JOB.9.6	He shakes the earth out of its place
JOB.9.6	and makes its foundations tremble.
JOB.9.7	He commands the sun not to shine
JOB.9.7	and shuts off the light of the stars.
JOB.9.8	He alone stretches out the skies
JOB.9.8	and walks on the waves of the sea.
JOB.9.9	It is God who made the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades
JOB.9.9	and the groups of stars in the southern sky.
JOB.9.10	He does wonders that cannot be understood;
JOB.9.10	he does so many miracles they cannot be counted.
JOB.9.11	When he passes me, I cannot see him;
JOB.9.11	when he goes by me, I do not recognize him.
JOB.9.12	If he snatches something away, no one can stop him
JOB.9.12	or say to him, ‘What are you doing?’
JOB.9.13	God will not hold back his anger.
JOB.9.13	Even the helpers of the monster Rahab lie at his feet in fear.
JOB.9.14	So how can I argue with God,
JOB.9.14	or even find words to argue with him?
JOB.9.15	Even if I were right, I could not answer him;
JOB.9.15	I could only beg God, my Judge, for mercy.
JOB.9.16	If I called to him and he answered,
JOB.9.16	I still don’t believe he would listen to me.
JOB.9.17	He would crush me with a storm
JOB.9.17	and multiply my wounds for no reason.
JOB.9.18	He would not let me catch my breath
JOB.9.18	but would overwhelm me with misery.
JOB.9.19	When it comes to strength, God is stronger than I;
JOB.9.19	when it comes to justice, no one can accuse him.
JOB.9.20	Even if I were right, my own mouth would say I was wrong;
JOB.9.20	if I were innocent, my mouth would say I was guilty.
JOB.9.21	“I am innocent,
JOB.9.21	but I don’t care about myself.
JOB.9.21	I hate my own life.
JOB.9.22	It is all the same. That is why I say,
JOB.9.22	‘God destroys both the innocent and the guilty.’
JOB.9.23	If the whip brings sudden death,
JOB.9.23	God will laugh at the suffering of the innocent.
JOB.9.24	When the land falls into the hands of evil people,
JOB.9.24	he covers the judges’ faces so they can’t see it.
JOB.9.24	If it is not God who does this, then who is it?
JOB.9.25	“My days go by faster than a runner;
JOB.9.25	they fly away without my seeing any joy.
JOB.9.26	They glide past like paper boats.
JOB.9.26	They attack like eagles swooping down to feed.
JOB.9.27	Even though I say, ‘I will forget my complaint;
JOB.9.27	I will change the look on my face and smile,’
JOB.9.28	I still dread all my suffering.
JOB.9.28	I know you will hold me guilty.
JOB.9.29	I have already been found guilty,
JOB.9.29	so why should I struggle for no reason?
JOB.9.30	I might wash myself with soap
JOB.9.30	and scrub my hands with strong soap,
JOB.9.31	but you would push me into a dirty pit,
JOB.9.31	and even my clothes would hate me.
JOB.9.32	“God is not human like me, so I cannot answer him.
JOB.9.32	We cannot meet each other in court.
JOB.9.33	I wish there were someone to make peace between us,
JOB.9.33	someone to decide our case.
JOB.9.34	Maybe he could remove God’s punishment
JOB.9.34	so his terror would no longer frighten me.
JOB.9.35	Then I could speak without being afraid,
JOB.9.35	but I am not able to do that.
JOB.10.1	“I hate my life,
JOB.10.1	so I will complain without holding back;
JOB.10.1	I will speak because I am so unhappy.
JOB.10.2	I will say to God: Do not hold me guilty,
JOB.10.2	but tell me what you have against me.
JOB.10.3	Does it make you happy to trouble me?
JOB.10.3	Don’t you care about me, the work of your hands?
JOB.10.3	Are you happy with the plans of evil people?
JOB.10.4	Do you have human eyes
JOB.10.4	that see as we see?
JOB.10.5	Are your days like the days of humans,
JOB.10.5	and your years like our years?
JOB.10.6	You look for the evil I have done
JOB.10.6	and search for my sin.
JOB.10.7	You know I am not guilty,
JOB.10.7	but no one can save me from your power.
JOB.10.8	“Your hands shaped and made me.
JOB.10.8	Do you now turn around and destroy me?
JOB.10.9	Remember that you molded me like a piece of clay.
JOB.10.9	Will you now turn me back into dust?
JOB.10.10	You formed me inside my mother
JOB.10.10	like cheese formed from milk.
JOB.10.11	You dressed me with skin and flesh;
JOB.10.11	you sewed me together with bones and muscles.
JOB.10.12	You gave me life and showed me kindness,
JOB.10.12	and in your care you watched over my life.
JOB.10.13	“But in your heart you hid other plans.
JOB.10.13	I know this was in your mind.
JOB.10.14	If I sinned, you would watch me
JOB.10.14	and would not let my sin go unpunished.
JOB.10.15	How terrible it will be for me if I am guilty!
JOB.10.15	Even if I am right, I cannot lift my head.
JOB.10.15	I am full of shame
JOB.10.15	and experience only pain.
JOB.10.16	If I hold up my head, you hunt me like a lion
JOB.10.16	and again show your terrible power against me.
JOB.10.17	You bring new witnesses against me
JOB.10.17	and increase your anger against me.
JOB.10.17	Your armies come against me.
JOB.10.18	“So why did you allow me to be born?
JOB.10.18	I wish I had died before anyone saw me.
JOB.10.19	I wish I had never lived,
JOB.10.19	but had been carried straight from birth to the grave.
JOB.10.20	The few days of my life are almost over.
JOB.10.20	Leave me alone so I can have a moment of joy.
JOB.10.21	Soon I will leave; I will not return
JOB.10.21	from the land of darkness and gloom,
JOB.10.22	the land of darkest night,
JOB.10.22	from the land of gloom and confusion,
JOB.10.22	where even the light is darkness.”
JOB.11.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
JOB.11.2	“Should these words go unanswered?
JOB.11.2	Is this talker in the right?
JOB.11.3	Your lies do not make people quiet;
JOB.11.3	people should correct you when you make fun of God.
JOB.11.4	You say, ‘My teachings are right,
JOB.11.4	and I am clean in God’s sight.’
JOB.11.5	I wish God would speak
JOB.11.5	and open his lips against you
JOB.11.6	and tell you the secrets of wisdom,
JOB.11.6	because wisdom has two sides.
JOB.11.6	Know this: God has even forgotten some of your sin.
JOB.11.7	“Can you understand the secrets of God?
JOB.11.7	Can you search the limits of the Almighty?
JOB.11.8	His limits are higher than the heavens; you cannot reach them!
JOB.11.8	They are deeper than the grave; you cannot understand them!
JOB.11.9	His limits are longer than the earth
JOB.11.9	and wider than the sea.
JOB.11.10	“If God comes along and puts you in prison
JOB.11.10	or calls you into court, no one can stop him.
JOB.11.11	God knows who is evil,
JOB.11.11	and when he sees evil, he takes note of it.
JOB.11.12	A fool cannot become wise
JOB.11.12	any more than a wild donkey can be born tame.
JOB.11.13	“You must give your whole heart to him
JOB.11.13	and hold out your hands to him for help.
JOB.11.14	Put away the sin that is in your hand;
JOB.11.14	let no evil remain in your tent.
JOB.11.15	Then you can lift up your face without shame,
JOB.11.15	and you can stand strong without fear.
JOB.11.16	You will forget your trouble
JOB.11.16	and remember it only as water gone by.
JOB.11.17	Your life will be as bright as the noonday sun,
JOB.11.17	and darkness will seem like morning.
JOB.11.18	You will feel safe because there is hope;
JOB.11.18	you will look around and rest in safety.
JOB.11.19	You will lie down, and no one will scare you.
JOB.11.19	Many people will want favors from you.
JOB.11.20	But the wicked will not be able to see,
JOB.11.20	so they will not escape.
JOB.11.20	Their only hope will be to die.”
JOB.12.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.12.2	“You really think you are the only wise people
JOB.12.2	and that when you die, wisdom will die with you!
JOB.12.3	But my mind is as good as yours;
JOB.12.3	you are not better than I am.
JOB.12.3	Everyone knows all these things.
JOB.12.4	My friends all laugh at me
JOB.12.4	when I call on God and expect him to answer me;
JOB.12.4	they laugh at me even though I am right and innocent!
JOB.12.5	Those who are comfortable don’t care that others have trouble;
JOB.12.5	they think it right that those people should have troubles.
JOB.12.6	The tents of robbers are not bothered,
JOB.12.6	and those who make God angry are safe.
JOB.12.6	They have their god in their pocket.
JOB.12.7	“But ask the animals, and they will teach you,
JOB.12.7	or ask the birds of the air, and they will tell you.
JOB.12.8	Speak to the earth, and it will teach you,
JOB.12.8	or let the fish of the sea tell you.
JOB.12.9	Every one of these knows
JOB.12.9	that the hand of the L
JOB.12.10	The life of every creature
JOB.12.10	and the breath of all people are in God’s hand.
JOB.12.11	The ear tests words
JOB.12.11	as the tongue tastes food.
JOB.12.12	Older people are wise,
JOB.12.12	and long life brings understanding.
JOB.12.13	“But only God has wisdom and power,
JOB.12.13	good advice and understanding.
JOB.12.14	What he tears down cannot be rebuilt;
JOB.12.14	anyone he puts in prison cannot be let out.
JOB.12.15	If God holds back the waters, there is no rain;
JOB.12.15	if he lets the waters go, they flood the land.
JOB.12.16	He is strong and victorious;
JOB.12.16	both the one who fools others and the one who is fooled belong to him.
JOB.12.17	God leads the wise away as captives
JOB.12.17	and turns judges into fools.
JOB.12.18	He takes off chains that kings put on
JOB.12.18	and puts a garment on their bodies.
JOB.12.19	He leads priests away naked
JOB.12.19	and destroys the powerful.
JOB.12.20	He makes trusted people be silent
JOB.12.20	and takes away the wisdom of elders.
JOB.12.21	He brings disgrace on important people
JOB.12.21	and takes away the weapons of the strong.
JOB.12.22	He uncovers the deep things of darkness
JOB.12.22	and brings dark shadows into the light.
JOB.12.23	He makes nations great and then destroys them;
JOB.12.23	he makes nations large and then scatters them.
JOB.12.24	He takes understanding away from the leaders of the earth
JOB.12.24	and makes them wander through a pathless desert.
JOB.12.25	They feel around in darkness with no light;
JOB.12.25	he makes them stumble like drunks.
JOB.13.1	“Now my eyes have seen all this;
JOB.13.1	my ears have heard and understood it.
JOB.13.2	What you know, I also know.
JOB.13.2	You are not better than I am.
JOB.13.3	But I want to speak to the Almighty
JOB.13.3	and to argue my case with God.
JOB.13.4	But you smear me with lies.
JOB.13.4	You are worthless doctors, all of you!
JOB.13.5	I wish you would just stop talking;
JOB.13.5	then you would really be wise!
JOB.13.6	Listen to my argument,
JOB.13.6	and hear the pleading of my lips.
JOB.13.7	You should not speak evil in the name of God;
JOB.13.7	you cannot speak God’s truth by telling lies.
JOB.13.8	You should not unfairly choose his side against mine;
JOB.13.8	you should not argue the case for God.
JOB.13.9	You will not do well if he examines you;
JOB.13.9	you cannot fool God as you might fool humans.
JOB.13.10	God would surely scold you
JOB.13.10	if you unfairly took one person’s side.
JOB.13.11	His bright glory would scare you,
JOB.13.11	and you would be very much afraid of him.
JOB.13.12	Your wise sayings are worth no more than ashes,
JOB.13.12	and your arguments are as weak as clay.
JOB.13.13	“Be quiet and let me speak.
JOB.13.13	Let things happen to me as they will.
JOB.13.14	Why should I put myself in danger
JOB.13.14	and take my life in my own hands?
JOB.13.15	Even if God kills me, I have hope in him;
JOB.13.15	I will still defend my ways to his face.
JOB.13.16	This is my salvation.
JOB.13.16	The wicked cannot come before him.
JOB.13.17	Listen carefully to my words;
JOB.13.17	let your ears hear what I say.
JOB.13.18	See, I have prepared my case,
JOB.13.18	and I know I will be proved right.
JOB.13.19	No one can accuse me of doing wrong.
JOB.13.19	If someone can, I will be quiet and die.
JOB.13.20	“God, please just give me these two things,
JOB.13.20	and then I will not hide from you:
JOB.13.21	Take your punishment away from me,
JOB.13.21	and stop frightening me with your terrors.
JOB.13.22	Then call me, and I will answer,
JOB.13.22	or let me speak, and you answer.
JOB.13.23	How many evil things and sins have I done?
JOB.13.23	Show me my wrong and my sin.
JOB.13.24	Don’t hide your face from me;
JOB.13.24	don’t think of me as your enemy.
JOB.13.25	Don’t punish a leaf that is blown by the wind;
JOB.13.25	don’t chase after straw.
JOB.13.26	You write down cruel things against me
JOB.13.26	and make me suffer for my boyhood sins.
JOB.13.27	You put my feet in chains
JOB.13.27	and keep close watch wherever I go.
JOB.13.27	You even mark the soles of my feet.
JOB.13.28	“Everyone wears out like something rotten,
JOB.13.28	like clothing eaten by moths.
JOB.14.1	“All of us born to women
JOB.14.1	live only a few days and have lots of trouble.
JOB.14.2	We grow up like flowers and then dry up and die.
JOB.14.2	We are like a passing shadow that does not last.
JOB.14.3	Lord, do you need to watch me like this?
JOB.14.3	Must you bring me before you to be judged?
JOB.14.4	No one can bring something clean from something dirty.
JOB.14.5	Our time is limited.
JOB.14.5	You have given us only so many months to live
JOB.14.5	and have set limits we cannot go beyond.
JOB.14.6	So look away from us and leave us alone
JOB.14.6	until we put in our time like a laborer.
JOB.14.7	“If a tree is cut down,
JOB.14.7	there is hope that it will grow again
JOB.14.7	and will send out new branches.
JOB.14.8	Even if its roots grow old in the ground,
JOB.14.8	and its stump dies in the dirt,
JOB.14.9	at the smell of water it will bud
JOB.14.9	and put out new shoots like a plant.
JOB.14.10	But we die, and our bodies are laid in the ground;
JOB.14.10	we take our last breath and are gone.
JOB.14.11	Water disappears from a lake,
JOB.14.11	and a river loses its water and dries up.
JOB.14.12	In the same way, we lie down and do not rise again;
JOB.14.12	we will not get up or be awakened
JOB.14.12	until the heavens disappear.
JOB.14.13	“I wish you would hide me in the grave;
JOB.14.13	hide me until your anger is gone.
JOB.14.13	I wish you would set a time
JOB.14.13	and then remember me!
JOB.14.14	Will the dead live again?
JOB.14.14	All my days are a struggle;
JOB.14.14	I will wait until my change comes.
JOB.14.15	You will call, and I will answer you;
JOB.14.15	you will desire the creature your hands have made.
JOB.14.16	Then you will count my steps,
JOB.14.16	but you will not keep track of my sin.
JOB.14.17	My wrongs will be closed up in a bag,
JOB.14.17	and you will cover up my sin.
JOB.14.18	“A mountain washes away and crumbles;
JOB.14.18	and a rock can be moved from its place.
JOB.14.19	Water washes over stones and wears them down,
JOB.14.19	and rushing waters wash away the dirt.
JOB.14.19	In the same way, you destroy hope.
JOB.14.20	You defeat people forever, and they are gone;
JOB.14.20	you change their appearance and send them away.
JOB.14.21	Their children are honored, but they do not know it;
JOB.14.21	their children are disgraced, but they do not see it.
JOB.14.22	They only feel the pain of their body
JOB.14.22	and feel sorry for themselves.”
JOB.15.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
JOB.15.2	“A wise person would not answer with empty words
JOB.15.2	or fill his stomach with the hot east wind.
JOB.15.3	He would not argue with useless words
JOB.15.3	or make speeches that have no value.
JOB.15.4	But you even destroy respect for God
JOB.15.4	and limit the worship of him.
JOB.15.5	Your sin teaches your mouth what to say;
JOB.15.5	you use words to trick others.
JOB.15.6	It is your own mouth, not mine, that shows you are wicked;
JOB.15.6	your own lips testify against you.
JOB.15.7	“You are not the first man ever born;
JOB.15.7	you are not older than the hills.
JOB.15.8	You did not listen in on God’s secret council.
JOB.15.8	But you limit wisdom to yourself.
JOB.15.9	You don’t know any more than we know.
JOB.15.9	You don’t understand any more than we understand.
JOB.15.10	Old people with gray hair are on our side;
JOB.15.10	they are even older than your father.
JOB.15.11	Is the comfort God gives you not enough for you,
JOB.15.11	even when words are spoken gently to you?
JOB.15.12	Has your heart carried you away from God?
JOB.15.12	Why do your eyes flash with anger?
JOB.15.13	Why do you speak out your anger against God?
JOB.15.13	Why do these words pour out of your mouth?
JOB.15.14	“How can anyone be pure?
JOB.15.14	How can someone born to a woman be good?
JOB.15.15	God places no trust in his holy ones,
JOB.15.15	and even the heavens are not pure in his eyes.
JOB.15.16	How much less pure is one who is terrible and rotten
JOB.15.16	and drinks up evil as if it were water!
JOB.15.17	“Listen to me, and I will tell you about it;
JOB.15.17	I will tell you what I have seen.
JOB.15.18	These are things wise men have told;
JOB.15.18	their ancestors told them, and they have hidden nothing.
JOB.15.19	(The land was given to their fathers only,
JOB.15.19	and no foreigner lived among them.)
JOB.15.20	The wicked suffer pain all their lives;
JOB.15.20	the cruel suffer during all the years saved up for them.
JOB.15.21	Terrible sounds fill their ears,
JOB.15.21	and when things seem to be going well, robbers attack them.
JOB.15.22	Evil people give up trying to escape from the darkness;
JOB.15.22	it has been decided that they will die by the sword.
JOB.15.23	They wander around and will become food for vultures.
JOB.15.23	They know darkness will soon come.
JOB.15.24	Worry and suffering terrify them;
JOB.15.24	they overwhelm them, like a king ready to attack,
JOB.15.25	because they shake their fists at God
JOB.15.25	and try to get their own way against the Almighty.
JOB.15.26	They stubbornly charge at God
JOB.15.26	with thick, strong shields.
JOB.15.27	“Although the faces of the wicked are thick with fat,
JOB.15.27	and their bellies are fat with flesh,
JOB.15.28	they will live in towns that are ruined,
JOB.15.28	in houses where no one lives,
JOB.15.28	which are crumbling into ruins.
JOB.15.29	The wicked will no longer get rich,
JOB.15.29	and the riches they have will not last;
JOB.15.29	the things they own will no longer spread over the land.
JOB.15.30	They will not escape the darkness.
JOB.15.30	A flame will dry up their branches;
JOB.15.30	God’s breath will carry the wicked away.
JOB.15.31	The wicked should not fool themselves by trusting what is useless.
JOB.15.31	If they do, they will get nothing in return.
JOB.15.32	Their branches will dry up before they finish growing
JOB.15.32	and will never turn green.
JOB.15.33	They will be like a vine whose grapes are pulled off before they are ripe,
JOB.15.33	like an olive tree that loses its blossoms.
JOB.15.34	People without God can produce nothing.
JOB.15.34	Fire will destroy the tents of those who take money to do evil,
JOB.15.35	who plan trouble and give birth to evil,
JOB.15.35	whose hearts plan ways to trick others.”
JOB.16.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.16.2	“I have heard many things like these.
JOB.16.2	You are all painful comforters!
JOB.16.3	Will your long-winded speeches never end?
JOB.16.3	What makes you keep on arguing?
JOB.16.4	I also could speak as you do
JOB.16.4	if you were in my place.
JOB.16.4	I could make great speeches against you
JOB.16.4	and shake my head at you.
JOB.16.5	But, instead, I would encourage you,
JOB.16.5	and my words would bring you relief.
JOB.16.6	“Even if I speak, my pain is not less,
JOB.16.6	and if I don’t speak, it still does not go away.
JOB.16.7	God, you have surely taken away my strength
JOB.16.7	and destroyed my whole family.
JOB.16.8	You have made me thin and weak,
JOB.16.8	and this shows I have done wrong.
JOB.16.9	God attacks me and tears me with anger;
JOB.16.9	he grinds his teeth at me;
JOB.16.9	my enemy stares at me with his angry eyes.
JOB.16.10	People open their mouths to make fun of me
JOB.16.10	and hit my cheeks to insult me.
JOB.16.10	They join together against me.
JOB.16.11	God has turned me over to evil people
JOB.16.11	and has handed me over to the wicked.
JOB.16.12	Everything was fine with me,
JOB.16.12	but God broke me into pieces;
JOB.16.12	he held me by the neck and crushed me.
JOB.16.12	He has made me his target;
JOB.16.13	his archers surround me.
JOB.16.13	He stabs my kidneys without mercy;
JOB.16.13	he spills my blood on the ground.
JOB.16.14	Again and again God attacks me;
JOB.16.14	he runs at me like a soldier.
JOB.16.15	“I have sewed rough cloth over my skin to show my sadness
JOB.16.15	and have buried my face in the dust.
JOB.16.16	My face is red from crying;
JOB.16.16	I have dark circles around my eyes.
JOB.16.17	Yet my hands have never done anything cruel,
JOB.16.17	and my prayer is pure.
JOB.16.18	“Earth, please do not cover up my blood.
JOB.16.18	Don’t let my cry ever stop being heard!
JOB.16.19	Even now I have one who speaks for me in heaven;
JOB.16.19	the one who is on my side is high above.
JOB.16.20	The one who speaks for me is my friend.
JOB.16.20	My eyes pour out tears to God.
JOB.16.21	He begs God on behalf of a human
JOB.16.21	as a person begs for his friend.
JOB.16.22	“Only a few years will pass
JOB.16.22	before I go on the journey of no return.
JOB.17.1	My spirit is broken;
JOB.17.1	the days of my life are almost gone.
JOB.17.1	The grave is waiting for me.
JOB.17.2	Those who laugh at me surround me;
JOB.17.2	I watch them insult me.
JOB.17.3	“God, make me a promise.
JOB.17.3	No one will make a pledge for me.
JOB.17.4	You have closed their minds to understanding.
JOB.17.4	Do not let them win over me.
JOB.17.5	People might speak against their friends for money,
JOB.17.5	but if they do, the eyes of their children go blind.
JOB.17.6	“God has made my name a curse word;
JOB.17.6	people spit in my face.
JOB.17.7	My sight has grown weak because of my sadness,
JOB.17.7	and my body is as thin as a shadow.
JOB.17.8	Honest people are upset about this;
JOB.17.8	innocent people are upset with those who do wrong.
JOB.17.9	But those who do right will continue to do right,
JOB.17.9	and those whose hands are not dirty with sin will grow stronger.
JOB.17.10	“But, all of you, come and try again!
JOB.17.10	I do not find a wise person among you.
JOB.17.11	My days are gone, and my plans have been destroyed,
JOB.17.11	along with the desires of my heart.
JOB.17.12	These men think night is day;
JOB.17.12	when it is dark, they say, ‘Light is near.’
JOB.17.13	If the only home I hope for is the grave,
JOB.17.13	if I spread out my bed in darkness,
JOB.17.14	if I say to the grave, ‘You are my father,’
JOB.17.14	and to the worm, ‘You are my mother’ or ‘You are my sister,’
JOB.17.15	where, then, is my hope?
JOB.17.15	Who can see any hope for me?
JOB.17.16	Will hope go down to the gates of death?
JOB.17.16	Will we go down together into the dust?”
JOB.18.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
JOB.18.2	“When will you stop these speeches?
JOB.18.2	Be sensible, and then we can talk.
JOB.18.3	You think of us as cattle,
JOB.18.3	as if we are stupid.
JOB.18.4	You tear yourself to pieces in your anger.
JOB.18.4	Should the earth be vacant just for you?
JOB.18.4	Should the rocks move from their places?
JOB.18.5	“The lamp of the wicked will be put out,
JOB.18.5	and the flame in their lamps will stop burning.
JOB.18.6	The light in their tents will grow dark,
JOB.18.6	and the lamps by their sides will go out.
JOB.18.7	Their strong steps will grow weak;
JOB.18.7	they will fall into their own evil traps.
JOB.18.8	Their feet will be caught in a net
JOB.18.8	when they walk into its web.
JOB.18.9	A trap will catch them by the heel
JOB.18.9	and hold them tight.
JOB.18.10	A trap for them is hidden on the ground,
JOB.18.10	right in their path.
JOB.18.11	Terrible things startle them from every side
JOB.18.11	and chase them at every step.
JOB.18.12	Hunger takes away their strength,
JOB.18.12	and disaster is at their side.
JOB.18.13	Disease eats away parts of their skin;
JOB.18.13	death gnaws at their arms and legs.
JOB.18.14	They are torn from the safety of their tents
JOB.18.14	and dragged off to Death, the King of Terrors.
JOB.18.15	Their tents are set on fire,
JOB.18.15	and sulfur is scattered over their homes.
JOB.18.16	Their roots dry up below ground,
JOB.18.16	and their branches die above ground.
JOB.18.17	People on earth will not remember them;
JOB.18.17	their names will be forgotten in the land.
JOB.18.18	They will be driven from light into darkness
JOB.18.18	and chased out of the world.
JOB.18.19	They have no children or descendants among their people,
JOB.18.19	and no one will be left alive where they once lived.
JOB.18.20	People of the west will be shocked at what has happened to them,
JOB.18.20	and people of the east will be very frightened.
JOB.18.21	Surely this is what will happen to the wicked;
JOB.18.21	such is the place of one who does not know God.”
JOB.19.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.19.2	“How long will you hurt me
JOB.19.2	and crush me with your words?
JOB.19.3	You have insulted me ten times now
JOB.19.3	and attacked me without shame.
JOB.19.4	Even if I have sinned,
JOB.19.4	it is my worry alone.
JOB.19.5	If you want to make yourselves look better than I,
JOB.19.5	you can blame me for my suffering.
JOB.19.6	Then know that God has wronged me
JOB.19.6	and pulled his net around me.
JOB.19.7	“I shout, ‘I have been wronged!’
JOB.19.7	But I get no answer.
JOB.19.7	I scream for help
JOB.19.7	but I get no justice.
JOB.19.8	God has blocked my way so I cannot pass;
JOB.19.8	he has covered my paths with darkness.
JOB.19.9	He has taken away my honor
JOB.19.9	and removed the crown from my head.
JOB.19.10	He beats me down on every side until I am gone;
JOB.19.10	he destroys my hope like a fallen tree.
JOB.19.11	His anger burns against me,
JOB.19.11	and he treats me like an enemy.
JOB.19.12	His armies gather;
JOB.19.12	they prepare to attack me.
JOB.19.12	They camp around my tent.
JOB.19.13	“God has made my brothers my enemies,
JOB.19.13	and my friends have become strangers.
JOB.19.14	My relatives have gone away,
JOB.19.14	and my friends have forgotten me.
JOB.19.15	My guests and my female servants treat me like a stranger;
JOB.19.15	they look at me as if I were a foreigner.
JOB.19.16	I call for my servant, but he does not answer,
JOB.19.16	even when I beg him with my own mouth.
JOB.19.17	My wife can’t stand my breath,
JOB.19.17	and my own family dislikes me.
JOB.19.18	Even the little boys hate me
JOB.19.18	and talk about me when I leave.
JOB.19.19	All my close friends hate me;
JOB.19.19	even those I love have turned against me.
JOB.19.20	I am nothing but skin and bones;
JOB.19.20	I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
JOB.19.21	Pity me, my friends, pity me,
JOB.19.21	because the hand of God has hit me.
JOB.19.22	Why do you chase me as God does?
JOB.19.22	Haven’t you hurt me enough?
JOB.19.23	“How I wish my words were written down,
JOB.19.23	written on a scroll.
JOB.19.24	I wish they were carved with an iron pen into lead,
JOB.19.24	or carved into stone forever.
JOB.19.25	I know that my Defender lives,
JOB.19.25	and in the end he will stand upon the earth.
JOB.19.26	Even after my skin has been destroyed,
JOB.19.26	in my flesh I will see God.
JOB.19.27	I will see him myself;
JOB.19.27	I will see him with my very own eyes.
JOB.19.27	How my heart wants that to happen!
JOB.19.28	“If you say, ‘We will continue to trouble Job,
JOB.19.28	because the problem lies with him,’
JOB.19.29	you should be afraid of the sword yourselves.
JOB.19.29	God’s anger will bring punishment by the sword.
JOB.19.29	Then you will know there is judgment.”
JOB.20.1	Then Zophar the Naamathite answered:
JOB.20.2	“My troubled thoughts cause me to answer,
JOB.20.2	because I am very upset.
JOB.20.3	You correct me and I am insulted,
JOB.20.3	but I understand how to answer you.
JOB.20.4	“You know how it has been for a long time,
JOB.20.4	ever since people were first put on the earth.
JOB.20.5	The happiness of evil people is brief,
JOB.20.5	and the joy of the wicked lasts only a moment.
JOB.20.6	Their pride may be as high as the heavens,
JOB.20.6	and their heads may touch the clouds,
JOB.20.7	but they will be gone forever, like their own dung.
JOB.20.7	People who knew them will say, ‘Where are they?’
JOB.20.8	They will fly away like a dream
JOB.20.8	and not be found again;
JOB.20.8	they will be chased away like a vision in the night.
JOB.20.9	Those who saw them will not see them again;
JOB.20.9	the places where they lived will see them no more.
JOB.20.10	Their children will have to pay back the poor,
JOB.20.10	and they will have to give up their wealth.
JOB.20.11	They had the strength of their youth in their bones,
JOB.20.11	but it will lie with them in the dust of death.
JOB.20.12	“Evil may taste sweet in their mouths,
JOB.20.12	and they may hide it under their tongues.
JOB.20.13	They cannot stand to let go of it;
JOB.20.13	they keep it in their mouths.
JOB.20.14	But their food will turn sour in their stomachs,
JOB.20.14	like the poison of a snake inside them.
JOB.20.15	They have swallowed riches, but they will spit them out;
JOB.20.15	God will make them vomit their riches up.
JOB.20.16	They will suck the poison of snakes,
JOB.20.16	and the snake’s fangs will kill them.
JOB.20.17	They will not admire the sparkling streams
JOB.20.17	or the rivers flowing with honey and cream.
JOB.20.18	They must give back what they worked for without eating it;
JOB.20.18	they will not enjoy the money they made from their trading,
JOB.20.19	because they troubled the poor and left them with nothing.
JOB.20.19	They have taken houses they did not build.
JOB.20.20	“Evil people never lack an appetite,
JOB.20.20	and nothing escapes their selfishness.
JOB.20.21	But nothing will be left for them to eat;
JOB.20.21	their riches will not continue.
JOB.20.22	When they still have plenty, trouble will catch up to them,
JOB.20.22	and great misery will come down on them.
JOB.20.23	When the wicked fill their stomachs,
JOB.20.23	God will send his burning anger against them,
JOB.20.23	and blows of punishment will fall on them like rain.
JOB.20.24	The wicked may run away from an iron weapon,
JOB.20.24	but a bronze arrow will stab them.
JOB.20.25	They will pull the arrows out of their backs
JOB.20.25	and pull the points out of their livers.
JOB.20.25	Terrors will come over them;
JOB.20.26	total darkness waits for their treasure.
JOB.20.26	A fire not fanned by people will destroy them
JOB.20.26	and burn up what is left of their tents.
JOB.20.27	The heavens will show their guilt,
JOB.20.27	and the earth will rise up against them.
JOB.20.28	A flood will carry their houses away,
JOB.20.28	swept away on the day of God’s anger.
JOB.20.29	This is what God plans for evil people;
JOB.20.29	this is what he has decided they will receive.”
JOB.21.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.21.2	“Listen carefully to my words,
JOB.21.2	and let this be the way you comfort me.
JOB.21.3	Be patient while I speak.
JOB.21.3	After I have finished, you may continue to make fun of me.
JOB.21.4	“My complaint is not just against people;
JOB.21.4	I have reason to be impatient.
JOB.21.5	Look at me and be shocked;
JOB.21.5	put your hand over your mouth in shock.
JOB.21.6	When I think about this, I am terribly afraid
JOB.21.6	and my body shakes.
JOB.21.7	Why do evil people live a long time?
JOB.21.7	They grow old and become more powerful.
JOB.21.8	They see their children around them;
JOB.21.8	they watch them grow up.
JOB.21.9	Their homes are safe and without fear;
JOB.21.9	God does not punish them.
JOB.21.10	Their bulls never fail to mate;
JOB.21.10	their cows have healthy calves.
JOB.21.11	They send out their children like a flock;
JOB.21.11	their little ones dance about.
JOB.21.12	They sing to the music of tambourines and harps,
JOB.21.12	and the sound of the flute makes them happy.
JOB.21.13	Evil people enjoy successful lives
JOB.21.13	and then go peacefully to the grave.
JOB.21.14	They say to God, ‘Leave us alone!
JOB.21.14	We don’t want to know your ways.
JOB.21.15	Who is the Almighty that we should serve him?
JOB.21.15	What would we gain by praying to him?’
JOB.21.16	The success of the wicked is not their own doing.
JOB.21.16	Their way of thinking is different from mine.
JOB.21.17	Yet how often are the lamps of evil people turned off?
JOB.21.17	How often does trouble come to them?
JOB.21.17	How often do they suffer God’s angry punishment?
JOB.21.18	How often are they like straw in the wind
JOB.21.18	or like chaff that is blown away by a storm?
JOB.21.19	It is said, ‘God saves up a person’s punishment for his children.’
JOB.21.19	But God should punish the wicked themselves so they will know it.
JOB.21.20	Their eyes should see their own destruction,
JOB.21.20	and they should suffer the anger of the Almighty.
JOB.21.21	They do not care about the families they leave behind
JOB.21.21	when their lives have come to an end.
JOB.21.22	“No one can teach knowledge to God;
JOB.21.22	he is the one who judges even the most important people.
JOB.21.23	One person dies while he still has all his strength,
JOB.21.23	feeling completely safe and comfortable.
JOB.21.24	His body was well fed,
JOB.21.24	and his bones were strong and healthy.
JOB.21.25	But another person dies with an unhappy heart,
JOB.21.25	never enjoying any happiness.
JOB.21.26	They are buried next to each other,
JOB.21.26	and worms cover them both.
JOB.21.27	“I know very well your thoughts
JOB.21.27	and your plans to wrong me.
JOB.21.28	You ask about me, ‘Where is this great man’s house?
JOB.21.28	Where are the tents where the wicked live?’
JOB.21.29	Have you never asked those who travel?
JOB.21.29	Have you never listened to their stories?
JOB.21.30	On the day of God’s anger and punishment,
JOB.21.30	it is the wicked who are spared.
JOB.21.31	Who will accuse them to their faces?
JOB.21.31	Who will pay them back for the evil they have done?
JOB.21.32	They are carried to their graves,
JOB.21.32	and someone keeps watch over their tombs.
JOB.21.33	The dirt in the valley seems sweet to them.
JOB.21.33	Everybody follows after them,
JOB.21.33	and many people go before them.
JOB.21.34	“So how can you comfort me with this nonsense?
JOB.21.34	Your answers are only lies!”
JOB.22.1	Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered:
JOB.22.2	“Can anyone be of real use to God?
JOB.22.2	Can even a wise person do him good?
JOB.22.3	Does it help the Almighty for you to be good?
JOB.22.3	Does he gain anything if you are innocent?
JOB.22.4	Does God punish you for respecting him?
JOB.22.4	Does he bring you into court for this?
JOB.22.5	No! It is because your evil is without limits
JOB.22.5	and your sins have no end.
JOB.22.6	You took your brothers’ things for a debt they didn’t owe;
JOB.22.6	you took clothes from people and left them naked.
JOB.22.7	You did not give water to tired people,
JOB.22.7	and you kept food from the hungry.
JOB.22.8	You were a powerful man who owned land;
JOB.22.8	you were honored and lived in the land.
JOB.22.9	But you sent widows away empty-handed,
JOB.22.9	and you mistreated orphans.
JOB.22.10	That is why traps are all around you
JOB.22.10	and sudden danger frightens you.
JOB.22.11	That is why it is so dark you cannot see
JOB.22.11	and a flood of water covers you.
JOB.22.12	“God is in the highest part of heaven.
JOB.22.12	See how high the highest stars are!
JOB.22.13	But you ask, ‘What does God know?
JOB.22.13	Can he judge us through the dark clouds?
JOB.22.14	Thick clouds cover him so he cannot see us
JOB.22.14	as he walks around high up in the sky.’
JOB.22.15	Are you going to stay on the old path
JOB.22.15	where evil people walk?
JOB.22.16	They were carried away before their time was up,
JOB.22.16	and their foundations were washed away by a flood.
JOB.22.17	They said to God, ‘Leave us alone!
JOB.22.17	The Almighty can do nothing to us.’
JOB.22.18	But it was God who filled their houses with good things.
JOB.22.18	Their way of thinking is different from mine.
JOB.22.19	“Good people can watch and be glad;
JOB.22.19	the innocent can laugh at them and say,
JOB.22.20	‘Surely our enemies are destroyed,
JOB.22.20	and fire burns up their wealth.’
JOB.22.21	“Obey God and be at peace with him;
JOB.22.21	this is the way to happiness.
JOB.22.22	Accept teaching from his mouth,
JOB.22.22	and keep his words in your heart.
JOB.22.23	If you return to the Almighty, you will be blessed again.
JOB.22.23	So remove evil from your house.
JOB.22.24	Throw your gold nuggets into the dust
JOB.22.24	and your fine gold among the rocks in the ravines.
JOB.22.25	Then the Almighty will be your gold
JOB.22.25	and the best silver for you.
JOB.22.26	You will find pleasure in the Almighty,
JOB.22.26	and you will look up to him.
JOB.22.27	You will pray to him, and he will hear you,
JOB.22.27	and you will keep your promises to him.
JOB.22.28	Anything you decide will be done,
JOB.22.28	and light will shine on your ways.
JOB.22.29	When people are made humble and you say, ‘Have courage,’
JOB.22.29	then the humble will be saved.
JOB.22.30	Even a guilty person will escape
JOB.22.30	and be saved because your hands are clean.”
JOB.23.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.23.2	“My complaint is still bitter today.
JOB.23.2	I groan because God’s heavy hand is on me.
JOB.23.3	I wish I knew where to find God
JOB.23.3	so I could go to where he lives.
JOB.23.4	I would present my case before him
JOB.23.4	and fill my mouth with arguments.
JOB.23.5	I would learn how he would answer me
JOB.23.5	and would think about what he would say.
JOB.23.6	Would he not argue strongly against me?
JOB.23.6	No, he would really listen to me.
JOB.23.7	Then an honest person could present his case to God,
JOB.23.7	and I would be saved forever by my judge.
JOB.23.8	“If I go to the east, God is not there;
JOB.23.8	if I go to the west, I do not see him.
JOB.23.9	When he is at work in the north, I catch no sight of him;
JOB.23.9	when he turns to the south, I cannot see him.
JOB.23.10	But God knows the way that I take,
JOB.23.10	and when he has tested me, I will come out like gold.
JOB.23.11	My feet have closely followed his steps;
JOB.23.11	I have stayed in his way;
JOB.23.11	I did not turn aside.
JOB.23.12	I have never left the commands he has spoken;
JOB.23.12	I have treasured his words more than my own.
JOB.23.13	“But he is the only God.
JOB.23.13	Who can come against him?
JOB.23.13	He does anything he wants.
JOB.23.14	He will do to me what he said he would do,
JOB.23.14	and he has many plans like this.
JOB.23.15	That is why I am frightened of him;
JOB.23.15	when I think of this, I am afraid of him.
JOB.23.16	God has made me afraid;
JOB.23.16	the Almighty terrifies me.
JOB.23.17	But I am not hidden by the darkness,
JOB.23.17	by the thick darkness that covers my face.
JOB.24.1	“I wish the Almighty would set a time for judging.
JOB.24.1	Those who know God do not see such a day.
JOB.24.2	Wicked people take other people’s land;
JOB.24.2	they steal flocks and take them to new pastures.
JOB.24.3	They chase away the orphan’s donkey
JOB.24.3	and take the widow’s ox when she has no money.
JOB.24.4	They push needy people off the path;
JOB.24.4	all the poor of the land hide from them.
JOB.24.5	The poor become like wild donkeys in the desert
JOB.24.5	who go about their job of finding food.
JOB.24.5	The desert gives them food for their children.
JOB.24.6	They gather hay and straw in the fields
JOB.24.6	and pick up leftover grapes from the vineyard of the wicked.
JOB.24.7	They spend the night naked, because they have no clothes,
JOB.24.7	nothing to cover themselves in the cold.
JOB.24.8	They are soaked from mountain rains
JOB.24.8	and stay near the large rocks because they have no shelter.
JOB.24.9	The fatherless child is grabbed from its mother’s breast;
JOB.24.9	they take a poor mother’s baby to pay for what she owes.
JOB.24.10	So the poor go around naked without any clothes;
JOB.24.10	they carry bundles of grain but still go hungry;
JOB.24.11	they crush olives to get oil
JOB.24.11	and grapes to get wine, but they still go thirsty.
JOB.24.12	Dying people groan in the city,
JOB.24.12	and the injured cry out for help,
JOB.24.12	but God accuses no one of doing wrong.
JOB.24.13	“Those who fight against the light
JOB.24.13	do not know God’s ways
JOB.24.13	or stay in his paths.
JOB.24.14	When the day is over, the murderers get up
JOB.24.14	to kill the poor and needy.
JOB.24.14	At night they go about like thieves.
JOB.24.15	Those who are guilty of adultery watch for the night,
JOB.24.15	thinking, ‘No one will see us,’
JOB.24.15	and they keep their faces covered.
JOB.24.16	In the dark, evil people break into houses.
JOB.24.16	In the daytime they shut themselves up in their own houses,
JOB.24.16	because they want nothing to do with the light.
JOB.24.17	Darkness is like morning to all these evil people
JOB.24.17	who make friends with the terrors of darkness.
JOB.24.18	“They are like foam floating on the water.
JOB.24.18	Their part of the land is cursed;
JOB.24.18	no one uses the road that goes by their vineyards.
JOB.24.19	As heat and dryness quickly melt the snow,
JOB.24.19	so the grave quickly takes away the sinners.
JOB.24.20	Their mothers forget them,
JOB.24.20	and worms will eat their bodies.
JOB.24.20	They will not be remembered,
JOB.24.20	so wickedness is broken in pieces like a stick.
JOB.24.21	These evil people abuse women who cannot have children
JOB.24.21	and show no kindness to widows.
JOB.24.22	But God drags away the strong by his power.
JOB.24.22	Even though they seem strong, they do not know how long they will live.
JOB.24.23	God may let these evil people feel safe,
JOB.24.23	but he is watching their ways.
JOB.24.24	For a little while they are important, and then they die;
JOB.24.24	they are laid low and buried like everyone else;
JOB.24.24	they are cut off like the heads of grain.
JOB.24.25	If this is not true, who can prove I am wrong?
JOB.24.25	Who can show that my words are worth nothing?”
JOB.25.1	Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:
JOB.25.2	“God rules and he must be honored;
JOB.25.2	he set up order in his high heaven.
JOB.25.3	No one can count God’s armies.
JOB.25.3	His light shines on all people.
JOB.25.4	So no one can be good in the presence of God,
JOB.25.4	and no one born to a woman can be pure.
JOB.25.5	Even the moon is not bright
JOB.25.5	and the stars are not pure in his eyes.
JOB.25.6	People are much less! They are like insects.
JOB.25.6	They are only worms!”
JOB.26.1	Then Job answered:
JOB.26.2	“You are no help to the helpless!
JOB.26.2	You have not aided the weak!
JOB.26.3	Your advice lacks wisdom!
JOB.26.3	You have shown little understanding!
JOB.26.4	Who has helped you say these words?
JOB.26.4	And where did you get these ideas?
JOB.26.5	“The spirits of the dead tremble,
JOB.26.5	those who are beneath and in the waters.
JOB.26.6	Death is naked before God;
JOB.26.6	destruction is uncovered before him.
JOB.26.7	God stretches the northern sky out over empty space
JOB.26.7	and hangs the earth on nothing.
JOB.26.8	He wraps up the waters in his thick clouds,
JOB.26.8	but the clouds do not break under their weight.
JOB.26.9	He covers the face of the moon,
JOB.26.9	spreading his clouds over it.
JOB.26.10	He draws the horizon like a circle on the water
JOB.26.10	at the place where light and darkness meet.
JOB.26.11	Heaven’s foundations shake
JOB.26.11	when he thunders at them.
JOB.26.12	With his power he quiets the sea;
JOB.26.12	by his wisdom he destroys Rahab, the sea monster.
JOB.26.13	He breathes, and the sky clears.
JOB.26.13	His hand stabs the fleeing snake.
JOB.26.14	And these are only a small part of God’s works.
JOB.26.14	We only hear a small whisper of him.
JOB.26.14	Who could understand God’s thundering power?”
JOB.27.1	And Job continued speaking:
JOB.27.2	“As surely as God lives, who has taken away my rights,
JOB.27.2	the Almighty, who has made me unhappy,
JOB.27.3	as long as I am alive
JOB.27.3	and God’s breath of life is in my nose,
JOB.27.4	my lips will not speak evil,
JOB.27.4	and my tongue will not tell a lie.
JOB.27.5	I will never agree you are right;
JOB.27.5	until I die, I will never stop saying I am innocent.
JOB.27.6	I will insist that I am right; I will not back down.
JOB.27.6	My conscience will never bother me.
JOB.27.7	“Let my enemies be like evil people,
JOB.27.7	my foes like those who are wrong.
JOB.27.8	What hope do the wicked have when they die,
JOB.27.8	when God takes their life away?
JOB.27.9	God will not listen to their cries
JOB.27.9	when trouble comes to them.
JOB.27.10	They will not find joy in the Almighty,
JOB.27.10	even though they call out to God all the time.
JOB.27.11	“I will teach you about the power of God
JOB.27.11	and will not hide the ways of the Almighty.
JOB.27.12	You have all seen this yourselves.
JOB.27.12	So why are we having all this talk that means nothing?
JOB.27.13	“Here is what God has planned for evil people,
JOB.27.13	and what the Almighty will give to cruel people:
JOB.27.14	They may have many children, but the sword will kill them.
JOB.27.14	Their children who are left will never have enough to eat.
JOB.27.15	Then they will die of disease and be buried,
JOB.27.15	and the widows will not even cry for them.
JOB.27.16	The wicked may heap up silver like piles of dirt
JOB.27.16	and have so many clothes they are like piles of clay.
JOB.27.17	But good people will wear what evil people have gathered,
JOB.27.17	and the innocent will divide up their silver.
JOB.27.18	The houses the wicked build are like a spider’s web,
JOB.27.18	like a hut that a guard builds.
JOB.27.19	The wicked are rich when they go to bed,
JOB.27.19	but they are rich for the last time;
JOB.27.19	when they open their eyes, everything is gone.
JOB.27.20	Fears come over them like a flood,
JOB.27.20	and a storm snatches them away in the night.
JOB.27.21	The east wind will carry them away, and then they are gone,
JOB.27.21	because it sweeps them out of their place.
JOB.27.22	The wind will hit them without mercy
JOB.27.22	as they try to run away from its power.
JOB.27.23	It will be as if the wind is clapping its hands;
JOB.27.23	it will whistle at them as they run from their place.
JOB.28.1	“There are mines where people dig silver
JOB.28.1	and places where gold is made pure.
JOB.28.2	Iron is taken from the ground,
JOB.28.2	and copper is melted out of rocks.
JOB.28.3	Miners bring lights
JOB.28.3	and search deep into the mines
JOB.28.3	for ore in thick darkness.
JOB.28.4	Miners dig a tunnel far from where people live,
JOB.28.4	where no one has ever walked;
JOB.28.4	they work far from people, swinging and swaying from ropes.
JOB.28.5	Food grows on top of the earth,
JOB.28.5	but below ground things are changed as if by fire.
JOB.28.6	Sapphires are found in rocks,
JOB.28.6	and gold dust is also found there.
JOB.28.7	No hawk knows that path;
JOB.28.7	the falcon has not seen it.
JOB.28.8	Proud animals have not walked there,
JOB.28.8	and no lions cross over it.
JOB.28.9	Miners hit the rocks of flint
JOB.28.9	and dig away at the bottom of the mountains.
JOB.28.10	They cut tunnels through the rock
JOB.28.10	and see all the treasures there.
JOB.28.11	They search for places where rivers begin
JOB.28.11	and bring things hidden out into the light.
JOB.28.12	“But where can wisdom be found,
JOB.28.12	and where does understanding live?
JOB.28.13	People do not understand the value of wisdom;
JOB.28.13	it cannot be found among those who are alive.
JOB.28.14	The deep ocean says, ‘It’s not in me;’
JOB.28.14	the sea says, ‘It’s not in me.’
JOB.28.15	Wisdom cannot be bought with gold,
JOB.28.15	and its cost cannot be weighed in silver.
JOB.28.16	Wisdom cannot be bought with fine gold
JOB.28.16	or with valuable onyx or sapphire gems.
JOB.28.17	Gold and crystal are not as valuable as wisdom,
JOB.28.17	and you cannot buy it with jewels of gold.
JOB.28.18	Coral and jasper are not worth talking about,
JOB.28.18	and the price of wisdom is much greater than rubies.
JOB.28.19	The topaz from Cush cannot compare to wisdom;
JOB.28.19	it cannot be bought with the purest gold.
JOB.28.20	“So where does wisdom come from,
JOB.28.20	and where does understanding live?
JOB.28.21	It is hidden from the eyes of every living thing,
JOB.28.21	even from the birds of the air.
JOB.28.22	The places of destruction and death say,
JOB.28.22	‘We have heard reports about it.’
JOB.28.23	Only God understands the way to wisdom,
JOB.28.23	and he alone knows where it lives,
JOB.28.24	because he looks to the farthest parts of the earth
JOB.28.24	and sees everything under the sky.
JOB.28.25	When God gave power to the wind
JOB.28.25	and measured the water,
JOB.28.26	when he made rules for the rain
JOB.28.26	and set a path for a thunderstorm to follow,
JOB.28.27	then he looked at wisdom and decided its worth;
JOB.28.27	he set wisdom up and tested it.
JOB.28.28	Then he said to humans,
JOB.28.28	‘The fear of the Lord is wisdom;
JOB.28.28	to stay away from evil is understanding.’ ”
JOB.29.1	Job continued to speak:
JOB.29.2	“How I wish for the months that have passed
JOB.29.2	and the days when God watched over me.
JOB.29.3	God’s lamp shined on my head,
JOB.29.3	and I walked through darkness by his light.
JOB.29.4	I wish for the days when I was strong,
JOB.29.4	when God’s close friendship blessed my house.
JOB.29.5	The Almighty was still with me,
JOB.29.5	and my children were all around me.
JOB.29.6	It was as if my path were covered with cream
JOB.29.6	and the rocks poured out olive oil for me.
JOB.29.7	I would go to the city gate
JOB.29.7	and sit in the public square.
JOB.29.8	When the young men saw me, they would step aside,
JOB.29.8	and the old men would stand up in respect.
JOB.29.9	The leading men stopped speaking
JOB.29.9	and covered their mouths with their hands.
JOB.29.10	The voices of the important men were quiet,
JOB.29.10	as if their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths.
JOB.29.11	Anyone who heard me spoke well of me,
JOB.29.11	and those who saw me praised me,
JOB.29.12	because I saved the poor who called out
JOB.29.12	and the orphan who had no one to help.
JOB.29.13	The dying person blessed me,
JOB.29.13	and I made the widow’s heart sing.
JOB.29.14	I put on right living as if it were clothing;
JOB.29.14	I wore fairness like a robe and a turban.
JOB.29.15	I was eyes for the blind
JOB.29.15	and feet for the lame.
JOB.29.16	I was like a father to needy people,
JOB.29.16	and I took the side of strangers who were in trouble.
JOB.29.17	I broke the fangs of evil people
JOB.29.17	and snatched the captives from their teeth.
JOB.29.18	“I thought, ‘I will live for as many days as there are grains of sand,
JOB.29.18	and I will die in my own house.
JOB.29.19	My roots will reach down to the water.
JOB.29.19	The dew will lie on the branches all night.
JOB.29.20	New honors will come to me continually,
JOB.29.20	and I will always have great strength.’
JOB.29.21	“People listened to me carefully
JOB.29.21	and waited quietly for my advice.
JOB.29.22	After I finished speaking, they spoke no more.
JOB.29.22	My words fell very gently on their ears.
JOB.29.23	They waited for me as they would for rain
JOB.29.23	and drank in my words like spring rain.
JOB.29.24	I smiled at them when they doubted,
JOB.29.24	and my approval was important to them.
JOB.29.25	I chose the way for them and was their leader.
JOB.29.25	I lived like a king among his army,
JOB.29.25	like a person who comforts sad people.
JOB.30.1	“But now those who are younger than I
JOB.30.1	make fun of me.
JOB.30.1	I would not have even let their fathers
JOB.30.1	sit with my sheep dogs.
JOB.30.2	What use did I have for their strength
JOB.30.2	since they had lost their strength to work?
JOB.30.3	They were thin from hunger
JOB.30.3	and wandered the dry and ruined land at night.
JOB.30.4	They gathered desert plants among the brush
JOB.30.4	and ate the root of the broom tree.
JOB.30.5	They were forced to live away from people;
JOB.30.5	people shouted at them as if they were thieves.
JOB.30.6	They lived in dried up streambeds,
JOB.30.6	in caves, and among the rocks.
JOB.30.7	They howled like animals among the bushes
JOB.30.7	and huddled together in the brush.
JOB.30.8	They are worthless people without names
JOB.30.8	and were forced to leave the land.
JOB.30.9	“Now they make fun of me with songs;
JOB.30.9	my name is a joke among them.
JOB.30.10	They hate me and stay far away from me,
JOB.30.10	but they do not mind spitting in my face.
JOB.30.11	God has taken away my strength and made me suffer,
JOB.30.11	so they attack me with all their anger.
JOB.30.12	On my right side they rise up like a mob.
JOB.30.12	They lay traps for my feet
JOB.30.12	and prepare to attack me.
JOB.30.13	They break up my road
JOB.30.13	and work to destroy me,
JOB.30.13	and no one helps me.
JOB.30.14	They come at me as if through a hole in the wall,
JOB.30.14	and they roll in among the ruins.
JOB.30.15	Great fears overwhelm me.
JOB.30.15	They blow my honor away as if by a great wind,
JOB.30.15	and my safety disappears like a cloud.
JOB.30.16	“Now my life is almost over;
JOB.30.16	my days are full of suffering.
JOB.30.17	At night my bones ache;
JOB.30.17	gnawing pains never stop.
JOB.30.18	In his great power God grabs hold of my clothing
JOB.30.18	and chokes me with the collar of my coat.
JOB.30.19	He throws me into the mud,
JOB.30.19	and I become like dirt and ashes.
JOB.30.20	“I cry out to you, God, but you do not answer;
JOB.30.20	I stand up, but you just look at me.
JOB.30.21	You have turned on me without mercy;
JOB.30.21	with your powerful hand you attacked me.
JOB.30.22	You snatched me up and threw me into the wind
JOB.30.22	and tossed me about in the storm.
JOB.30.23	I know you will bring me down to death,
JOB.30.23	to the place where all living people must go.
JOB.30.24	“Surely no one would hurt those who are ruined
JOB.30.24	when they cry for help in their time of trouble.
JOB.30.25	I cried for those who were in trouble;
JOB.30.25	I have been very sad for poor people.
JOB.30.26	But when I hoped for good, only evil came to me;
JOB.30.26	when I looked for light, darkness came.
JOB.30.27	I never stop being upset;
JOB.30.27	days of suffering are ahead of me.
JOB.30.28	I have turned black, but not by the sun.
JOB.30.28	I stand up in public and cry for help.
JOB.30.29	I have become a brother to wild dogs
JOB.30.29	and a friend to ostriches.
JOB.30.30	My skin has become black and peels off,
JOB.30.30	as my body burns with fever.
JOB.30.31	My harp is tuned to sing a sad song,
JOB.30.31	and my flute is tuned to moaning.
JOB.31.1	“But I made an agreement with my eyes
JOB.31.1	not to look with desire at a girl.
JOB.31.2	What has God above promised for people?
JOB.31.2	What has the Almighty planned from on high?
JOB.31.3	It is ruin for evil people
JOB.31.3	and disaster for those who do wrong.
JOB.31.4	God sees my ways
JOB.31.4	and counts every step I take.
JOB.31.5	“If I have been dishonest
JOB.31.5	or lied to others,
JOB.31.6	then let God weigh me on honest scales.
JOB.31.6	Then he will know I have done nothing wrong.
JOB.31.7	If I have turned away from doing what is right,
JOB.31.7	or my heart has been led by my eyes to do wrong,
JOB.31.7	or my hands have been made unclean,
JOB.31.8	then let other people eat what I have planted,
JOB.31.8	and let my crops be plowed up.
JOB.31.9	“If I have desired another woman
JOB.31.9	or have waited at my neighbor’s door for his wife,
JOB.31.10	then let my wife grind another man’s grain,
JOB.31.10	and let other men have sexual relations with her.
JOB.31.11	That would be shameful,
JOB.31.11	a sin to be punished.
JOB.31.12	It is like a fire that burns and destroys;
JOB.31.12	all I have done would be plowed up.
JOB.31.13	“If I have been unfair to my male and female slaves
JOB.31.13	when they had a complaint against me,
JOB.31.14	how could I tell God what I did?
JOB.31.14	What will I answer when he asks me to explain what I’ve done?
JOB.31.15	God made me in my mother’s womb, and he also made them;
JOB.31.15	the same God formed both of us in our mothers’ wombs.
JOB.31.16	“I have never refused the appeals of the poor
JOB.31.16	or let widows give up hope while looking for help.
JOB.31.17	I have not kept my food to myself
JOB.31.17	but have given it to the orphans.
JOB.31.18	Since I was young, I have been like a father to the orphans.
JOB.31.18	From my birth I guided the widows.
JOB.31.19	I have not let anyone die for lack of clothes
JOB.31.19	or let a needy person go without a coat.
JOB.31.20	That person’s heart blessed me,
JOB.31.20	because I warmed him with the wool of my sheep.
JOB.31.21	I have never hurt an orphan
JOB.31.21	even when I knew I could win in court.
JOB.31.22	If I have, then let my arm fall off my shoulder
JOB.31.22	and be broken at the joint.
JOB.31.23	I fear destruction from God,
JOB.31.23	and I fear his majesty, so I could not do such things.
JOB.31.24	“I have not put my trust in gold
JOB.31.24	or said to pure gold, ‘You are my security.’
JOB.31.25	I have not celebrated my great wealth
JOB.31.25	or the riches my hands had gained.
JOB.31.26	I have not thought about worshiping the sun in its brightness
JOB.31.26	nor admired the moon moving in glory
JOB.31.27	so that my heart was pulled away from God.
JOB.31.27	My hand has never offered the sun and moon a kiss of worship.
JOB.31.28	If I had, these also would have been sins to be punished,
JOB.31.28	because I would have been unfaithful to God.
JOB.31.29	“I have not been happy when my enemies fell
JOB.31.29	or laughed when they had trouble.
JOB.31.30	I have not let my mouth sin
JOB.31.30	by cursing my enemies’ life.
JOB.31.31	The servants of my house have always said,
JOB.31.31	‘All have eaten what they want of Job’s food.’
JOB.31.32	No stranger ever had to spend the night in the street,
JOB.31.32	because I always let travelers stay in my home.
JOB.31.33	I have not hidden my sin as others do,
JOB.31.33	secretly keeping my guilt to myself.
JOB.31.34	I was not so afraid of the crowd
JOB.31.34	that I kept quiet and stayed inside
JOB.31.34	because I feared being hated by other families.
JOB.31.35	(“How I wish a court would hear my case!
JOB.31.35	Here I sign my name to show I have told the truth.
JOB.31.35	Now let the Almighty answer me;
JOB.31.35	let the one who accuses me write it down.
JOB.31.36	I would wear the writing on my shoulder;
JOB.31.36	I would put it on like a crown.
JOB.31.37	I would explain to God every step I took,
JOB.31.37	and I would come near to him like a prince.)
JOB.31.38	“If my land cries out against me
JOB.31.38	and its plowed rows are not wet with tears,
JOB.31.39	if I have taken the land’s harvest without paying
JOB.31.39	or have broken the spirit of those who worked the land,
JOB.31.40	then let thorns come up instead of wheat,
JOB.31.40	and let weeds come up instead of barley.”
JOB.31.40	The words of Job are finished.
JOB.32.1	These three men stopped trying to answer Job, because he was so sure he was right. 
JOB.32.2	But Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, from the family of Ram, became very angry with Job, because Job claimed he was right instead of God. 
JOB.32.3	Elihu was also angry with Job’s three friends who had no answer to show that Job was wrong, yet continued to blame him. 
JOB.32.4	Elihu had waited before speaking to Job, because the three friends were older than he was. 
JOB.32.5	But when Elihu saw that the three men had nothing more to say, he became very angry.
JOB.32.6	So Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said this:
JOB.32.6	“I am young,
JOB.32.6	and you are old.
JOB.32.6	That is why I was afraid
JOB.32.6	to tell you what I know.
JOB.32.7	I thought, ‘Older people should speak,
JOB.32.7	and those who have lived many years should teach wisdom.’
JOB.32.8	But it is the spirit in a person,
JOB.32.8	the breath of the Almighty, that gives understanding.
JOB.32.9	It is not just older people who are wise;
JOB.32.9	they are not the only ones who understand what is right.
JOB.32.10	So I say, listen to me.
JOB.32.10	I too will tell you what I know.
JOB.32.11	I waited while you three spoke,
JOB.32.11	and listened to your explanations.
JOB.32.11	While you looked for words to use,
JOB.32.12	I paid close attention to you.
JOB.32.12	But not one of you has proved Job wrong;
JOB.32.12	none of you has answered his arguments.
JOB.32.13	Don’t say, ‘We have found wisdom;
JOB.32.13	only God will show Job to be wrong, not people.’
JOB.32.14	Job has not spoken his words against me,
JOB.32.14	so I will not use your arguments to answer Job.
JOB.32.15	“These three friends are defeated and have no more to say;
JOB.32.15	words have failed them.
JOB.32.16	Now they are standing there with no answers for Job.
JOB.32.16	Now that they are quiet, must I wait to speak?
JOB.32.17	No, I too will speak
JOB.32.17	and tell what I know.
JOB.32.18	I am full of words,
JOB.32.18	and the spirit in me causes me to speak.
JOB.32.19	I am like wine that has been bottled up;
JOB.32.19	I am ready to burst like a new leather wine bag.
JOB.32.20	I must speak so I will feel relief;
JOB.32.20	I must open my mouth and answer.
JOB.32.21	I will be fair to everyone
JOB.32.21	and not flatter anyone.
JOB.32.22	I don’t know how to flatter,
JOB.32.22	and if I did, my Maker would quickly take me away.
JOB.33.1	“Now, Job, listen to my words.
JOB.33.1	Pay attention to everything I say.
JOB.33.2	I open my mouth
JOB.33.2	and am ready to speak.
JOB.33.3	My words come from an honest heart,
JOB.33.3	and I am sincere in saying what I know.
JOB.33.4	The Spirit of God created me,
JOB.33.4	and the breath of the Almighty gave me life.
JOB.33.5	Answer me if you can;
JOB.33.5	get yourself ready and stand before me.
JOB.33.6	I am just like you before God;
JOB.33.6	I too am made out of clay.
JOB.33.7	Don’t be afraid of me;
JOB.33.7	I will not be hard on you.
JOB.33.8	“But I heard what you have said;
JOB.33.8	I heard every word.
JOB.33.9	You said, ‘I am pure and without sin;
JOB.33.9	I am innocent and free from guilt.
JOB.33.10	But God has found fault with me;
JOB.33.10	he considers me his enemy.
JOB.33.11	He locks my feet in chains
JOB.33.11	and closely watches everywhere I go.’
JOB.33.12	“But I tell you, you are not right in saying this,
JOB.33.12	because God is greater than we are.
JOB.33.13	Why do you accuse God
JOB.33.13	of not answering anyone?
JOB.33.14	God does speak—sometimes one way and sometimes another—
JOB.33.14	even though people may not understand it.
JOB.33.15	He speaks in a dream or a vision of the night
JOB.33.15	when people are in a deep sleep,
JOB.33.15	lying on their beds.
JOB.33.16	He speaks in their ears
JOB.33.16	and frightens them with warnings
JOB.33.17	to turn them away from doing wrong
JOB.33.17	and to keep them from being proud.
JOB.33.18	God does this to save people from death,
JOB.33.18	to keep them from dying.
JOB.33.19	People may be corrected while in bed in great pain;
JOB.33.19	they may have continual pain in their very bones.
JOB.33.20	They may be in such pain that they even hate food,
JOB.33.20	even the very best meal.
JOB.33.21	Their body becomes so thin there is almost nothing left of it,
JOB.33.21	and their bones that were hidden now stick out.
JOB.33.22	They are near death,
JOB.33.22	and their life is almost over.
JOB.33.23	“But there may be an angel to speak for him,
JOB.33.23	one out of a thousand, who will tell him what to do.
JOB.33.24	The angel will beg for mercy and say:
JOB.33.24	‘Save him from death.
JOB.33.24	I have found a way to pay for his life.’
JOB.33.25	Then his body is made new like a child’s.
JOB.33.25	It will return to the way it was when he was young.
JOB.33.26	That person will pray to God, and God will listen to him.
JOB.33.26	He will see God’s face and will shout with happiness.
JOB.33.26	And God will set things right for him again.
JOB.33.27	Then he will say to others,
JOB.33.27	‘I sinned and twisted what was right,
JOB.33.27	but I did not receive the punishment I should have received.
JOB.33.28	God bought my life back from death,
JOB.33.28	and I will continue to enjoy life.’
JOB.33.29	“God does all these things to a person
JOB.33.29	two or even three times
JOB.33.30	so he won’t die as punishment for his sins
JOB.33.30	and so he may still enjoy life.
JOB.33.31	“Job, pay attention and listen to me;
JOB.33.31	be quiet, and I will speak.
JOB.33.32	If you have anything to say, answer me;
JOB.33.32	speak up, because I want to prove you right.
JOB.33.33	But if you have nothing to say, then listen to me;
JOB.33.33	be quiet, and I will teach you wisdom.”
JOB.34.1	Then Elihu said:
JOB.34.2	“Hear my words, you wise men;
JOB.34.2	listen to me, you who know a lot.
JOB.34.3	The ear tests words
JOB.34.3	as the tongue tastes food.
JOB.34.4	Let’s decide for ourselves what is right,
JOB.34.4	and let’s learn together what is good.
JOB.34.5	“Job says, ‘I am not guilty,
JOB.34.5	and God has refused me a fair trial.
JOB.34.6	Instead of getting a fair trial,
JOB.34.6	I am called a liar.
JOB.34.6	I have been seriously hurt,
JOB.34.6	even though I have not sinned.’
JOB.34.7	There is no other man like Job;
JOB.34.7	he takes insults as if he were drinking water.
JOB.34.8	He keeps company with those who do evil
JOB.34.8	and spends time with wicked men,
JOB.34.9	because he says, ‘It is no use
JOB.34.9	to try to please God.’
JOB.34.10	“So listen to me, you who can understand.
JOB.34.10	God can never do wrong!
JOB.34.10	It is impossible for the Almighty to do evil.
JOB.34.11	God pays people back for what they have done
JOB.34.11	and gives them what their actions deserve.
JOB.34.12	Truly God will never do wrong;
JOB.34.12	the Almighty will never twist what is right.
JOB.34.13	No one chose God to rule over the earth
JOB.34.13	or put him in charge of the whole world.
JOB.34.14	If God should decide
JOB.34.14	to take away life and breath,
JOB.34.15	then everyone would die together
JOB.34.15	and turn back into dust.
JOB.34.16	“If you can understand, hear this;
JOB.34.16	listen to what I have to say.
JOB.34.17	Can anyone govern who hates what is right?
JOB.34.17	How can you blame God who is both fair and powerful?
JOB.34.18	God is the one who says to kings, ‘You are worthless,’
JOB.34.18	or to important people, ‘You are evil.’
JOB.34.19	He is not nicer to princes than other people,
JOB.34.19	nor kinder to rich people than poor people,
JOB.34.19	because he made them all with his own hands.
JOB.34.20	They can die in a moment, in the middle of the night.
JOB.34.20	They are struck down, and then they pass away;
JOB.34.20	powerful people die without help.
JOB.34.21	“God watches where people go;
JOB.34.21	he sees every step they take.
JOB.34.22	There is no dark place or deep shadow
JOB.34.22	where those who do evil can hide from him.
JOB.34.23	He does not set a time
JOB.34.23	for people to come before him for judging.
JOB.34.24	Without asking questions, God breaks powerful people into pieces
JOB.34.24	and puts others in their place.
JOB.34.25	Because God knows what people do,
JOB.34.25	he defeats them in the night, and they are crushed.
JOB.34.26	He punishes them for the evil they do
JOB.34.26	so that everyone else can watch,
JOB.34.27	because they stopped following God
JOB.34.27	and did not care about any of his ways.
JOB.34.28	The cry of the poor comes to God;
JOB.34.28	he hears the cry of the needy.
JOB.34.29	But if God keeps quiet, who can blame him?
JOB.34.29	If he hides his face, who can see him?
JOB.34.29	God still rules over both nations and persons alike.
JOB.34.30	He keeps the wicked from ruling
JOB.34.30	and from trapping others.
JOB.34.31	“But suppose someone says to God,
JOB.34.31	‘I am guilty, but I will not sin anymore.
JOB.34.32	Teach me what I cannot see.
JOB.34.32	If I have done wrong, I will not do it again.’
JOB.34.33	So, Job, should God reward you as you want
JOB.34.33	when you refuse to change?
JOB.34.33	You must decide, not I,
JOB.34.33	so tell me what you know.
JOB.34.34	“Those who understand speak,
JOB.34.34	and the wise who hear me say,
JOB.34.35	‘Job speaks without knowing what is true;
JOB.34.35	his words show he does not understand.’
JOB.34.36	I wish Job would be tested completely,
JOB.34.36	because he answered like an evil man!
JOB.34.37	Job now adds to his sin by turning against God.
JOB.34.37	He claps his hands in protest,
JOB.34.37	speaking more and more against God.”
JOB.35.1	Then Elihu said:
JOB.35.2	“Do you think this is fair?
JOB.35.2	You say, ‘God will show that I am right,’
JOB.35.3	but you also ask, ‘What’s the use?
JOB.35.3	I don’t gain anything by not sinning.’
JOB.35.4	“I will answer you
JOB.35.4	and your friends who are with you.
JOB.35.5	Look up at the sky
JOB.35.5	and see the clouds so high above you.
JOB.35.6	If you sin, it does nothing to God;
JOB.35.6	even if your sins are many, they do nothing to him.
JOB.35.7	If you are good, you give nothing to God;
JOB.35.7	he receives nothing from your hand.
JOB.35.8	Your evil ways only hurt others like yourself,
JOB.35.8	and the good you do only helps other human beings.
JOB.35.9	“People cry out when they are in trouble;
JOB.35.9	they beg for relief from powerful people.
JOB.35.10	But no one asks, ‘Where is God, my Maker,
JOB.35.10	who gives us songs in the night,
JOB.35.11	who makes us smarter than the animals of the earth
JOB.35.11	and wiser than the birds of the air?’
JOB.35.12	God does not answer evil people when they cry out,
JOB.35.12	because the wicked are proud.
JOB.35.13	God does not listen to their useless begging;
JOB.35.13	the Almighty pays no attention to them.
JOB.35.14	He will listen to you even less
JOB.35.14	when you say that you do not see him,
JOB.35.14	that your case is before him,
JOB.35.14	that you must wait for him,
JOB.35.15	that his anger never punishes,
JOB.35.15	and that he doesn’t notice evil.
JOB.35.16	So Job is only speaking nonsense,
JOB.35.16	saying many words without knowing what is true.”
JOB.36.1	Elihu continued:
JOB.36.2	“Listen to me a little longer, and I will show you
JOB.36.2	that there is more to be said for God.
JOB.36.3	What I know comes from far away.
JOB.36.3	I will show that my Maker is right.
JOB.36.4	You can be sure that my words are not false;
JOB.36.4	one who really knows is with you.
JOB.36.5	“God is powerful, but he does not hate people;
JOB.36.5	he is powerful and sure of what he wants to do.
JOB.36.6	He will not keep evil people alive,
JOB.36.6	but he gives the poor their rights.
JOB.36.7	He always watches over those who do right;
JOB.36.7	he sets them on thrones with kings
JOB.36.7	and they are honored forever.
JOB.36.8	If people are bound in chains,
JOB.36.8	or if trouble, like ropes, ties them up,
JOB.36.9	God tells them what they have done,
JOB.36.9	that they have sinned in their pride.
JOB.36.10	God makes them listen to his warning
JOB.36.10	and commands them to change from doing evil.
JOB.36.11	If they obey and serve him,
JOB.36.11	the rest of their lives will be successful,
JOB.36.11	and the rest of their years will be happy.
JOB.36.12	But if they do not listen,
JOB.36.12	they will die by the sword,
JOB.36.12	and they will die without knowing why.
JOB.36.13	“Those who have wicked hearts hold on to anger.
JOB.36.13	Even when God punishes them, they do not cry for help.
JOB.36.14	They die while they are still young,
JOB.36.14	and their lives end in disgrace.
JOB.36.15	But God saves those who suffer through their suffering;
JOB.36.15	he gets them to listen through their pain.
JOB.36.16	“God is gently calling you from the jaws of trouble
JOB.36.16	to an open place of freedom
JOB.36.16	where he has set your table full of the best food.
JOB.36.17	But now you are being punished like the wicked;
JOB.36.17	you are getting justice.
JOB.36.18	Be careful! Don’t be led away from God by riches;
JOB.36.18	don’t let much money turn you away.
JOB.36.19	Neither your wealth nor all your great strength
JOB.36.19	will keep you out of trouble.
JOB.36.20	Don’t wish for the night
JOB.36.20	when people are taken from their homes.
JOB.36.21	Be careful not to turn to evil,
JOB.36.21	which you seem to want more than suffering.
JOB.36.22	“God is great and powerful;
JOB.36.22	no other teacher is like him.
JOB.36.23	No one has planned his ways for him;
JOB.36.23	no one can say to God, ‘You have done wrong.’
JOB.36.24	Remember to praise his work,
JOB.36.24	about which people have sung.
JOB.36.25	Everybody has seen it;
JOB.36.25	people look at it from far off.
JOB.36.26	God is so great, greater than we can understand!
JOB.36.26	No one knows how old he is.
JOB.36.27	“He evaporates the drops of water from the earth
JOB.36.27	and turns them into rain.
JOB.36.28	The rain then pours down from the clouds,
JOB.36.28	and showers fall on people.
JOB.36.29	No one understands how God spreads out the clouds
JOB.36.29	or how he sends thunder from where he lives.
JOB.36.30	Watch how God scatters his lightning around him,
JOB.36.30	lighting up the deepest parts of the sea.
JOB.36.31	This is the way God governs the nations;
JOB.36.31	this is how he gives us enough food.
JOB.36.32	God fills his hands with lightning
JOB.36.32	and commands it to strike its target.
JOB.36.33	His thunder announces the coming storm,
JOB.36.33	and even the cattle know it is near.
JOB.37.1	“At the sound of his thunder, my heart pounds
JOB.37.1	as if it will jump out of my chest.
JOB.37.2	Listen! Listen to the thunder of God’s voice
JOB.37.2	and to the rumbling that comes from his mouth.
JOB.37.3	He turns his lightning loose under the whole sky
JOB.37.3	and sends it to the farthest parts of the earth.
JOB.37.4	After that you can hear the roar
JOB.37.4	when he thunders with a great sound.
JOB.37.4	He does not hold back the flashing
JOB.37.4	when his voice is heard.
JOB.37.5	God’s voice thunders in wonderful ways;
JOB.37.5	he does great things we cannot understand.
JOB.37.6	He says to the snow, ‘Fall on the earth,’
JOB.37.6	and to the shower, ‘Be a heavy rain.’
JOB.37.7	With it, he stops everyone from working
JOB.37.7	so everyone knows it is the work of God.
JOB.37.8	The animals take cover from the rain
JOB.37.8	and stay in their dens.
JOB.37.9	The storm comes from where it was stored;
JOB.37.9	the cold comes with the strong winds.
JOB.37.10	The breath of God makes ice,
JOB.37.10	and the wide waters become frozen.
JOB.37.11	He fills the clouds with water
JOB.37.11	and scatters his lightning through them.
JOB.37.12	At his command they swirl around
JOB.37.12	over the whole earth,
JOB.37.12	doing whatever he commands.
JOB.37.13	He uses the clouds to punish people
JOB.37.13	or to water his earth and show his love.
JOB.37.14	“Job, listen to this:
JOB.37.14	Stop and notice God’s miracles.
JOB.37.15	Do you know how God controls the clouds
JOB.37.15	and makes his lightning flash?
JOB.37.16	Do you know how the clouds hang in the sky?
JOB.37.16	Do you know the miracles of God, who knows everything?
JOB.37.17	You suffer in your clothes
JOB.37.17	when the land is silenced by the hot, south wind.
JOB.37.18	You cannot stretch out the sky like God
JOB.37.18	and make it look as hard as polished bronze.
JOB.37.19	Tell us what we should say to him;
JOB.37.19	we cannot get our arguments ready because we do not have enough understanding.
JOB.37.20	Should God be told that I want to speak?
JOB.37.20	Would a person ask to be swallowed up?
JOB.37.21	No one can look at the sun
JOB.37.21	when it is bright in the sky
JOB.37.21	after the wind has blown all the clouds away.
JOB.37.22	God comes out of the north in golden light,
JOB.37.22	in overwhelming greatness.
JOB.37.23	The Almighty is too high for us to reach.
JOB.37.23	He has great strength;
JOB.37.23	he is always right and never punishes unfairly.
JOB.37.24	That is why people honor him;
JOB.37.24	he does not respect those who say they are wise.”
JOB.38.1	Then the L
JOB.38.2	“Who is this that makes my purpose unclear
JOB.38.2	by saying things that are not true?
JOB.38.3	Be strong like a man!
JOB.38.3	I will ask you questions,
JOB.38.3	and you must answer me.
JOB.38.4	Where were you when I made the earth’s foundation?
JOB.38.4	Tell me, if you understand.
JOB.38.5	Who marked off how big it should be? Surely you know!
JOB.38.5	Who stretched a ruler across it?
JOB.38.6	What were the earth’s foundations set on,
JOB.38.6	or who put its cornerstone in place
JOB.38.7	while the morning stars sang together
JOB.38.7	and all the angels shouted with joy?
JOB.38.8	“Who shut the doors to keep the sea in
JOB.38.8	when it broke through and was born,
JOB.38.9	when I made the clouds like a coat for the sea
JOB.38.9	and wrapped it in dark clouds,
JOB.38.10	when I put limits on the sea
JOB.38.10	and put its doors and bars in place,
JOB.38.11	when I said to the sea, ‘You may come this far, but no farther;
JOB.38.11	this is where your proud waves must stop’?
JOB.38.12	“Have you ever ordered the morning to begin,
JOB.38.12	or shown the dawn where its place was
JOB.38.13	in order to take hold of the earth by its edges
JOB.38.13	and shake evil people out of it?
JOB.38.14	At dawn the earth changes like clay being pressed by a seal;
JOB.38.14	the hills and valleys stand out like folds in a coat.
JOB.38.15	Light is not given to evil people;
JOB.38.15	their arm is raised to do harm, but it is broken.
JOB.38.16	“Have you ever gone to where the sea begins
JOB.38.16	or walked in the valleys under the sea?
JOB.38.17	Have the gates of death been opened to you?
JOB.38.17	Have you seen the gates of the deep darkness?
JOB.38.18	Do you understand how wide the earth is?
JOB.38.18	Tell me, if you know all these things.
JOB.38.19	“What is the path to light’s home,
JOB.38.19	and where does darkness live?
JOB.38.20	Can you take them to their places?
JOB.38.20	Do you know the way to their homes?
JOB.38.21	Surely you know, if you were already born when all this happened!
JOB.38.21	Have you lived that many years?
JOB.38.22	“Have you ever gone into the storehouse of the snow
JOB.38.22	or seen the storehouses for hail,
JOB.38.23	which I save for times of trouble,
JOB.38.23	for days of war and battle?
JOB.38.24	Where is the place from which light comes?
JOB.38.24	Where is the place from which the east winds blow over the earth?
JOB.38.25	Who cuts a waterway for the heavy rains
JOB.38.25	and sets a path for the thunderstorm?
JOB.38.26	Who waters the land where no one lives,
JOB.38.26	the desert that has no one in it?
JOB.38.27	Who sends rain to satisfy the empty land
JOB.38.27	so the grass begins to grow?
JOB.38.28	Does the rain have a father?
JOB.38.28	Who is father to the drops of dew?
JOB.38.29	Who is the mother of the ice?
JOB.38.29	Who gives birth to the frost from the sky
JOB.38.30	when the water becomes hard as stone,
JOB.38.30	and even the surface of the ocean is frozen?
JOB.38.31	“Can you tie up the stars of the Pleiades
JOB.38.31	or loosen the ropes of the stars in Orion?
JOB.38.32	Can you bring out the stars on time
JOB.38.32	or lead out the stars of the Bear with its cubs?
JOB.38.33	Do you know the laws of the sky
JOB.38.33	and understand their rule over the earth?
JOB.38.34	“Can you shout an order to the clouds
JOB.38.34	and cover yourself with a flood of water?
JOB.38.35	Can you send lightning bolts on their way?
JOB.38.35	Do they come to you and say, ‘Here we are’?
JOB.38.36	Who put wisdom inside the mind
JOB.38.36	or understanding in the heart?
JOB.38.37	Who has the wisdom to count the clouds?
JOB.38.37	Who can pour water from the jars of the sky
JOB.38.38	when the dust becomes hard
JOB.38.38	and the clumps of dirt stick together?
JOB.38.39	“Do you hunt food for the female lion
JOB.38.39	to satisfy the hunger of the young lions
JOB.38.40	while they lie in their dens
JOB.38.40	or hide in the bushes waiting to attack?
JOB.38.41	Who gives food to the birds
JOB.38.41	when their young cry out to God
JOB.38.41	and wander about without food?
JOB.39.1	“Do you know when the mountain goats give birth?
JOB.39.1	Do you watch when the deer gives birth to her fawn?
JOB.39.2	Do you count the months until they give birth
JOB.39.2	and know the right time for them to give birth?
JOB.39.3	They lie down, their young are born,
JOB.39.3	and then the pain of giving birth is over.
JOB.39.4	Their young ones grow big and strong in the wild country.
JOB.39.4	Then they leave their homes and do not return.
JOB.39.5	“Who let the wild donkey go free?
JOB.39.5	Who untied its ropes?
JOB.39.6	I am the one who gave the donkey the desert as its home;
JOB.39.6	I gave it the desert lands as a place to live.
JOB.39.7	The wild donkey laughs at the confusion in the city,
JOB.39.7	and it does not hear the drivers shout.
JOB.39.8	It roams the hills looking for pasture,
JOB.39.8	looking for anything green to eat.
JOB.39.9	“Will the wild ox agree to serve you
JOB.39.9	and stay by your feeding box at night?
JOB.39.10	Can you hold it to the plowed row with a harness
JOB.39.10	so it will plow the valleys for you?
JOB.39.11	Will you depend on the wild ox for its great strength
JOB.39.11	and leave your heavy work for it to do?
JOB.39.12	Can you trust the ox to bring in your grain
JOB.39.12	and gather it to your threshing floor?
JOB.39.13	“The wings of the ostrich flap happily,
JOB.39.13	but they are not like the feathers of the stork.
JOB.39.14	The ostrich lays its eggs on the ground
JOB.39.14	and lets them warm in the sand.
JOB.39.15	It does not stop to think that a foot might step on them and crush them;
JOB.39.15	it does not care that some animal might walk on them.
JOB.39.16	The ostrich is cruel to its young, as if they were not even its own.
JOB.39.16	It does not care that its work is for nothing,
JOB.39.17	because God did not give the ostrich wisdom;
JOB.39.17	God did not give it a share of good sense.
JOB.39.18	But when the ostrich gets up to run, it is so fast
JOB.39.18	that it laughs at the horse and its rider.
JOB.39.19	“Job, are you the one who gives the horse its strength
JOB.39.19	or puts a flowing mane on its neck?
JOB.39.20	Do you make the horse jump like a locust?
JOB.39.20	It scares people with its proud snorting.
JOB.39.21	It paws wildly, enjoying its strength,
JOB.39.21	and charges into battle.
JOB.39.22	It laughs at fear and is afraid of nothing;
JOB.39.22	it does not run away from the sword.
JOB.39.23	The bag of arrows rattles against the horse’s side,
JOB.39.23	along with the flashing spears and swords.
JOB.39.24	With great excitement, the horse races over the ground;
JOB.39.24	and it cannot stand still when it hears the trumpet.
JOB.39.25	When the trumpet blows, the horse snorts, ‘Aha!’
JOB.39.25	It smells the battle from far away;
JOB.39.25	it hears the shouts of commanders and the battle cry.
JOB.39.26	“Is it through your wisdom that the hawk flies
JOB.39.26	and spreads its wings toward the south?
JOB.39.27	Are you the one that commands the eagle to fly
JOB.39.27	and build its nest so high?
JOB.39.28	It lives on a high cliff and stays there at night;
JOB.39.28	the rocky peak is its protected place.
JOB.39.29	From there it looks for its food;
JOB.39.29	its eyes can see it from far away.
JOB.39.30	Its young eat blood,
JOB.39.30	and where there is something dead, the eagle is there.”
JOB.40.1	The L
JOB.40.2	“Will the person who argues with the Almighty correct him?
JOB.40.2	Let the person who accuses God answer him.”
JOB.40.3	Then Job answered the L
JOB.40.4	“I am not worthy; I cannot answer you anything,
JOB.40.4	so I will put my hand over my mouth.
JOB.40.5	I spoke one time, but I will not answer again;
JOB.40.5	I even spoke two times, but I will say nothing more.”
JOB.40.6	Then the L
JOB.40.7	“Be strong, like a man!
JOB.40.7	I will ask you questions,
JOB.40.7	and you must answer me.
JOB.40.8	Would you say that I am unfair?
JOB.40.8	Would you blame me to make yourself look right?
JOB.40.9	Are you as strong as God?
JOB.40.9	Can your voice thunder like his?
JOB.40.10	If so, then decorate yourself with glory and beauty;
JOB.40.10	dress in honor and greatness as if they were clothing.
JOB.40.11	Let your great anger punish;
JOB.40.11	look at the proud and bring them down.
JOB.40.12	Look at the proud and make them humble.
JOB.40.12	Crush the wicked wherever they are.
JOB.40.13	Bury them all in the dirt together;
JOB.40.13	cover their faces in the grave.
JOB.40.14	If you can do that, then I myself will praise you,
JOB.40.14	because you are strong enough to save yourself.
JOB.40.15	“Look at Behemoth,
JOB.40.15	which I made just as I made you.
JOB.40.15	It eats grass like an ox.
JOB.40.16	Look at the strength it has in its body;
JOB.40.16	the muscles of its stomach are powerful.
JOB.40.17	Its tail is like a cedar tree;
JOB.40.17	the muscles of its thighs are woven together.
JOB.40.18	Its bones are like tubes of bronze;
JOB.40.18	its legs are like bars of iron.
JOB.40.19	It is one of the first of God’s works,
JOB.40.19	but its Maker can destroy it.
JOB.40.20	The hills, where the wild animals play,
JOB.40.20	provide food for it.
JOB.40.21	It lies under the lotus plants,
JOB.40.21	hidden by the tall grass in the swamp.
JOB.40.22	The lotus plants hide it in their shadow;
JOB.40.22	the poplar trees by the streams surround it.
JOB.40.23	If the river floods, it will not be afraid;
JOB.40.23	it is safe even if the Jordan River rushes to its mouth.
JOB.40.24	Can anyone blind its eyes and capture it?
JOB.40.24	Can anyone put hooks in its nose?
JOB.41.1	“Can you catch Leviathan on a fish hook
JOB.41.1	or tie its tongue down with a rope?
JOB.41.2	Can you put a cord through its nose
JOB.41.2	or a hook in its jaw?
JOB.41.3	Will it keep begging you for mercy
JOB.41.3	and speak to you with gentle words?
JOB.41.4	Will it make an agreement with you
JOB.41.4	and let you take it as your slave for life?
JOB.41.5	Can you make a pet of Leviathan as you would a bird
JOB.41.5	or put it on a leash for your girls?
JOB.41.6	Will traders try to bargain with you for it?
JOB.41.6	Will they divide it up among the merchants?
JOB.41.7	Can you stick darts all over its skin
JOB.41.7	or fill its head with fishing spears?
JOB.41.8	If you put one hand on it,
JOB.41.8	you will never forget the battle,
JOB.41.8	and you will never do it again!
JOB.41.9	There is no hope of defeating it;
JOB.41.9	just seeing it overwhelms people.
JOB.41.10	No one is brave enough to make it angry,
JOB.41.10	so who would be able to stand up against me?
JOB.41.11	No one has ever given me anything that I must pay back,
JOB.41.11	because everything under the sky belongs to me.
JOB.41.12	“I will speak about Leviathan’s arms and legs,
JOB.41.12	its great strength and well-formed body.
JOB.41.13	No one can tear off its outer hide
JOB.41.13	or poke through its double armor.
JOB.41.14	No one can force open its great jaws;
JOB.41.14	they are filled with frightening teeth.
JOB.41.15	It has rows of shields on its back
JOB.41.15	that are tightly sealed together.
JOB.41.16	Each shield is so close to the next one
JOB.41.16	that no air can go between them.
JOB.41.17	They are joined strongly to one another;
JOB.41.17	they hold on to each other and cannot be separated.
JOB.41.18	When it snorts, flashes of light are thrown out,
JOB.41.18	and its eyes look like the light at dawn.
JOB.41.19	Flames blaze from its mouth;
JOB.41.19	sparks of fire shoot out.
JOB.41.20	Smoke pours out of its nose,
JOB.41.20	as if coming from a large pot over a hot fire.
JOB.41.21	Its breath sets coals on fire,
JOB.41.21	and flames come out of its mouth.
JOB.41.22	There is great strength in its neck.
JOB.41.22	People are afraid and run away.
JOB.41.23	The folds of its skin are tightly joined;
JOB.41.23	they are set and cannot be moved.
JOB.41.24	Its chest is as hard as a rock,
JOB.41.24	even as hard as a grinding stone.
JOB.41.25	The powerful fear its terrible looks
JOB.41.25	and draw back in fear as it moves.
JOB.41.26	The sword that hits it does not hurt it,
JOB.41.26	nor the arrows, darts, and spears.
JOB.41.27	It treats iron as if it were straw
JOB.41.27	and bronze metal as if it were rotten wood.
JOB.41.28	It does not run away from arrows;
JOB.41.28	stones from slings are like chaff to it.
JOB.41.29	Clubs feel like pieces of straw to it,
JOB.41.29	and it laughs when they shake a spear at it.
JOB.41.30	The underside of its body is like broken pieces of pottery.
JOB.41.30	It leaves a trail in the mud like a threshing board.
JOB.41.31	It makes the deep sea bubble like a boiling pot;
JOB.41.31	it stirs up the sea like a pot of oil.
JOB.41.32	When it swims, it leaves a shining path in the water
JOB.41.32	that makes the sea look as if it had white hair.
JOB.41.33	Nothing else on earth is equal to it;
JOB.41.33	it is a creature without fear.
JOB.41.34	It looks down on all those who are too proud;
JOB.41.34	it is king over all proud creatures.”
JOB.42.1	Then Job answered the L
JOB.42.2	“I know that you can do all things
JOB.42.2	and that no plan of yours can be ruined.
JOB.42.3	You asked, ‘Who is this that made my purpose unclear by saying things that are not true?’
JOB.42.3	Surely I spoke of things I did not understand;
JOB.42.3	I talked of things too wonderful for me to know.
JOB.42.4	You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak.
JOB.42.4	I will ask you questions,
JOB.42.4	and you must answer me.’
JOB.42.5	My ears had heard of you before,
JOB.42.5	but now my eyes have seen you.
JOB.42.6	So now I hate myself;
JOB.42.6	I will change my heart and life.
JOB.42.6	I will sit in the dust and ashes.”
JOB.42.7	After the L
JOB.42.8	Now take seven bulls and seven male sheep, and go to my servant Job, and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will listen to his prayer. Then I will not punish you for being foolish. You have not said what is right about me, as my servant Job did.” 
JOB.42.9	So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite did as the L
JOB.42.10	After Job had prayed for his friends, the L
JOB.42.11	Job’s brothers and sisters came to his house, along with everyone who had known him before, and they all ate with him there. They comforted him and made him feel better about the trouble the L
JOB.42.12	The L
JOB.42.13	Job also had seven sons and three daughters. 
JOB.42.14	He named the first daughter Jemimah, the second daughter Keziah, and the third daughter Keren-Happuch. 
JOB.42.15	There were no other women in all the land as beautiful as Job’s daughters. And their father Job gave them land to own along with their brothers.
JOB.42.16	After this, Job lived one hundred forty years. He lived to see his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and great-great-grandchildren. 
JOB.42.17	Then Job died; he was old and had lived many years. 
PSA.1.1	Happy are those who don’t listen to the wicked,
PSA.1.1	who don’t go where sinners go,
PSA.1.1	who don’t do what evil people do.
PSA.1.2	They love the L
PSA.1.2	and they think about those teachings day and night.
PSA.1.3	They are strong, like a tree planted by a river.
PSA.1.3	The tree produces fruit in season,

PSA.1.3	Everything they do will succeed.
PSA.1.4	But wicked people are not like that.
PSA.1.4	They are like chaff that the wind blows away.

PSA.2.2	The kings of the earth prepare to fight,
PSA.2.2	and their leaders make plans together
PSA.2.2	against the L
PSA.2.2	and his appointed one.
PSA.2.3	They say, “Let’s break the chains that hold us back
PSA.2.3	and throw off the ropes that tie us down.”
PSA.2.4	But the one who sits in heaven laughs;
PSA.2.4	the Lord makes fun of them.
PSA.2.5	Then the L
PSA.2.5	and frightens them with his anger.
PSA.2.6	He says, “I have appointed my own king
PSA.2.6	to rule in Jerusalem on my holy mountain, Zion.”
PSA.2.7	Now I will tell you what the L
PSA.2.7	He said to me, “You are my son.
PSA.2.7	Today I have become your father.
PSA.2.8	If you ask me, I will give you the nations;
PSA.2.8	all the people on earth will be yours.
PSA.2.9	You will rule over them with an iron rod.
PSA.2.9	You will break them into pieces like pottery.”
PSA.2.10	So, kings, be wise;

PSA.35.15	they gathered to attack before I knew it.
PSA.35.15	They insulted me without stopping.
PSA.35.16	They made fun of me and were cruel to me
PSA.35.16	and ground their teeth at me in anger.

PSA.36.1	Sin speaks to the wicked in their hearts.
PSA.36.1	They have no fear of God.
PSA.36.2	They think too much of themselves
PSA.36.2	so they don’t see their sin and hate it.
PSA.36.3	Their words are wicked lies;
PSA.36.3	they are no longer wise or good.
PSA.36.4	At night they make evil plans;

PSA.37.7	Don’t be upset when others get rich

PSA.37.9	Evil people will be sent away,
PSA.37.9	but those who trust the L
PSA.37.10	In a little while the wicked will be no more.
PSA.37.10	You may look for them, but they will be gone.
PSA.37.11	People who are not proud will inherit the land
PSA.37.11	and will enjoy complete peace.
PSA.37.12	The wicked make evil plans against good people.
PSA.37.12	They grind their teeth at them in anger.
PSA.37.13	But the Lord laughs at the wicked,
PSA.37.13	because he sees that their day is coming.
PSA.37.14	The wicked draw their swords
PSA.37.14	and bend their bows
PSA.37.14	to kill the poor and helpless,
PSA.37.14	to kill those who are honest.
PSA.37.15	But their swords will stab their own hearts,
PSA.37.15	and their bows will break.
PSA.37.16	It is better to have little and be right
PSA.37.16	than to have much and be wrong.
PSA.37.17	The power of the wicked will be broken,
PSA.37.17	but the L
PSA.37.18	The L

PSA.37.20	The L
PSA.37.20	they will disappear like smoke.
PSA.37.21	The wicked borrow and don’t pay back,
PSA.37.21	but those who do right give freely to others.
PSA.37.22	Those whom the L
PSA.37.22	but those he curses will be sent away.
PSA.37.23	When people’s steps follow the L
PSA.37.23	God is pleased with their ways.

PSA.37.25	I was young, and now I am old,
PSA.37.25	but I have never seen good people left helpless
PSA.37.25	or their children begging for food.
PSA.37.26	Good people always lend freely to others,
PSA.37.26	and their children are a blessing.
PSA.37.27	Stop doing evil and do good,

PSA.37.28	The L

PSA.37.29	and will live in it forever.
PSA.37.30	Good people speak with wisdom,
PSA.37.30	and they say what is fair.
PSA.37.31	The teachings of their God are in their heart,
PSA.37.31	so they do not fail to keep them.
PSA.37.32	The wicked watch for good people
PSA.37.32	so that they may kill them.
PSA.37.33	But the L
PSA.37.33	or let good people be judged guilty.
PSA.37.34	Wait for the L
PSA.37.34	and follow him.
PSA.37.34	He will honor you and give you the land,
PSA.37.34	and you will see the wicked sent away.
PSA.37.35	I saw a wicked and cruel man
PSA.37.35	who looked strong like a healthy tree in good soil.
PSA.37.36	But he died and was gone;
PSA.37.36	I looked for him, but he couldn’t be found.
PSA.37.37	Think of the innocent person,
PSA.37.37	and watch the honest one.
PSA.37.37	The man who has peace
PSA.37.37	will have children to live after him.
PSA.37.38	But sinners will be destroyed;
PSA.37.38	in the end the wicked will die.
PSA.37.39	The L
PSA.37.39	he is their strength in times of trouble.
PSA.37.40	The L
PSA.37.40	he saves them from the wicked,
PSA.37.40	because they trust in him for protection.
PSA.38.1	L
PSA.38.1	Don’t punish me when you are furious.
PSA.38.2	Your arrows have wounded me,
PSA.38.2	and your hand has come down on me.
PSA.38.3	My body is sick from your punishment.
PSA.38.3	Even my bones are not healthy because of my sin.
PSA.38.4	My guilt has overwhelmed me;
PSA.38.4	like a load it weighs me down.
PSA.38.5	My sores stink and become infected
PSA.38.5	because I was foolish.
PSA.38.6	I am bent over and bowed down;
PSA.38.6	I am sad all day long.
PSA.38.7	I am burning with fever,
PSA.38.7	and my whole body is sore.
PSA.38.8	I am weak and faint.
PSA.38.8	I moan from the pain I feel.
PSA.38.9	Lord, you know everything I want;
PSA.38.9	my cries are not hidden from you.
PSA.38.10	My heart pounds, and my strength is gone.
PSA.38.10	I am losing my sight.
PSA.38.11	Because of my wounds, my friends and neighbors avoid me,
PSA.38.11	and my relatives stay far away.
PSA.38.12	Some people set traps to kill me.
PSA.38.12	Those who want to hurt me plan trouble;
PSA.38.12	all day long they think up lies.
PSA.38.13	I am like the deaf; I cannot hear.
PSA.38.13	Like the mute, I cannot speak.
PSA.38.14	I am like those who do not hear,
PSA.38.14	who have no answer to give.
PSA.38.15	I trust you, L
PSA.38.15	You will answer, my Lord and God.
PSA.38.16	I said, “Don’t let them laugh at me
PSA.38.16	or brag when I am defeated.”
PSA.38.17	I am about to die,
PSA.38.17	and I cannot forget my pain.
PSA.38.18	I confess my guilt;
PSA.38.18	I am troubled by my sin.
PSA.38.19	My enemies are strong and healthy,
PSA.38.19	and many hate me for no reason.
PSA.38.20	They repay me with evil for the good I did.
PSA.38.20	They lie about me because I try to do good.
PSA.38.21	L
PSA.38.21	my God, don’t go away.
PSA.38.22	Quickly come and help me,
PSA.38.22	my Lord and Savior.
PSA.39.1	I said, “I will be careful how I act
PSA.39.1	and will not sin by what I say.
PSA.39.1	I will be careful what I say
PSA.39.1	around wicked people.”
PSA.39.2	So I kept very quiet.
PSA.39.2	I didn’t even say anything good,
PSA.39.2	but I became even more upset.
PSA.39.3	I became very angry inside,
PSA.39.3	and as I thought about it, my anger burned.
PSA.39.3	So I spoke:
PSA.39.4	“L
PSA.39.4	and how long I will live.
PSA.39.4	Let me know how long I have.
PSA.39.5	You have given me only a short life;
PSA.39.5	my lifetime is like nothing to you.
PSA.39.5	Everyone’s life is only a breath.
PSA.39.6	People are like shadows moving about.
PSA.39.6	All their work is for nothing;
PSA.39.6	they collect things but don’t know who will get them.
PSA.39.7	“So, Lord, what hope do I have?
PSA.39.7	You are my hope.
PSA.39.8	Save me from all my sins.
PSA.39.8	Don’t let wicked fools make fun of me.
PSA.39.9	I am quiet; I do not open my mouth,
PSA.39.9	because you are the one who has done this.
PSA.39.10	Quit punishing me;
PSA.39.10	your beating is about to kill me.
PSA.39.11	You correct and punish people for their sins;
PSA.39.11	like a moth, you destroy what they love.
PSA.39.11	Everyone’s life is only a breath.
PSA.39.12	“L
PSA.39.12	and listen to my cry.
PSA.39.12	Do not ignore my tears.
PSA.39.12	I am like a visitor with you.
PSA.39.12	Like my ancestors, I’m only here a short time.
PSA.39.13	Leave me alone so I can be happy
PSA.39.13	before I leave and am no more.”
PSA.40.1	I waited patiently for the L
PSA.40.1	He turned to me and heard my cry.
PSA.40.2	He lifted me out of the pit of destruction,
PSA.40.2	out of the sticky mud.
PSA.40.2	He stood me on a rock
PSA.40.2	and made my feet steady.
PSA.40.3	He put a new song in my mouth,
PSA.40.3	a song of praise to our God.
PSA.40.3	Many people will see this and worship him.
PSA.40.3	Then they will trust the L
PSA.40.4	Happy is the person
PSA.40.4	who trusts the L
PSA.40.4	who doesn’t turn to those who are proud
PSA.40.4	or to those who worship false gods.
PSA.40.5	L
PSA.40.5	Your plans for us are many.
PSA.40.5	If I tried to tell them all,
PSA.40.5	there would be too many to count.
PSA.40.6	You do not want sacrifices and offerings.
PSA.40.6	But you have made a hole in my ear
PSA.40.6	to show that my body and life are yours.
PSA.40.6	You do not ask for burnt offerings
PSA.40.6	and sacrifices to take away sins.
PSA.40.7	Then I said, “Look, I have come.
PSA.40.7	It is written about me in the book.
PSA.40.8	My God, I want to do what you want.
PSA.40.8	Your teachings are in my heart.”
PSA.40.9	I will tell about your goodness in the great meeting of your people.
PSA.40.9	L
PSA.40.10	I do not hide your goodness in my heart;
PSA.40.10	I speak about your loyalty and salvation.
PSA.40.10	I do not hide your love and truth
PSA.40.10	from the people in the great meeting.
PSA.40.11	L
PSA.40.11	let your love and truth always protect me.
PSA.40.12	Troubles have surrounded me;
PSA.40.12	there are too many to count.
PSA.40.12	My sins have caught me
PSA.40.12	so that I cannot see a way to escape.
PSA.40.12	I have more sins than hairs on my head,
PSA.40.12	and I have lost my courage.
PSA.40.13	Please, L
PSA.40.13	Hurry, L
PSA.40.14	People are trying to kill me.
PSA.40.14	Shame them and disgrace them.
PSA.40.14	People want to hurt me.
PSA.40.14	Let them run away in disgrace.
PSA.40.15	People are making fun of me.
PSA.40.15	Let them be shamed into silence.
PSA.40.16	But let those who follow you
PSA.40.16	be happy and glad.
PSA.40.16	They love you for saving them.
PSA.40.16	May they always say, “Praise the L
PSA.40.17	Lord, because I am poor and helpless,
PSA.40.17	please remember me.
PSA.40.17	You are my helper and savior.
PSA.40.17	My God, do not wait.

PSA.41.2	He will not let their enemies take them.
PSA.41.3	The L
PSA.41.3	and he will make them well again.
PSA.41.4	I said, “L
PSA.41.4	Heal me, because I have sinned against you.”
PSA.41.5	My enemies are saying evil things about me.
PSA.41.5	They say, “When will he die and be forgotten?”
PSA.41.6	Some people come to see me,
PSA.41.6	but they lie.
PSA.41.6	They just come to get bad news.
PSA.41.6	Then they go and gossip.
PSA.41.7	All my enemies whisper about me
PSA.41.7	and think the worst about me.
PSA.41.8	They say, “He has a terrible disease.
PSA.41.8	He will never get out of bed again.”
PSA.41.9	My best and truest friend, who ate at my table,
PSA.41.9	has even turned against me.
PSA.41.10	L
PSA.41.10	Give me strength so I can pay them back.
PSA.41.11	Because my enemies do not defeat me,
PSA.41.11	I know you are pleased with me.
PSA.41.12	Because I am innocent, you support me
PSA.41.12	and will let me be with you forever.
PSA.41.13	Praise the L
PSA.41.13	He has always been,
PSA.41.13	and he will always be.
PSA.41.13	Amen and amen.
PSA.42.1	As a deer thirsts for streams of water,
PSA.42.1	so I thirst for you, God.
PSA.42.2	I thirst for the living God.
PSA.42.2	When can I go to meet with him?
PSA.42.3	Day and night, my tears have been my food.
PSA.42.3	People are always saying,
PSA.42.3	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.4	When I remember these things,
PSA.42.4	I speak with a broken heart.
PSA.42.4	I used to walk with the crowd
PSA.42.4	and lead them to God’s Temple
PSA.42.4	with songs of praise.
PSA.42.5	Why am I so sad?
PSA.42.5	Why am I so upset?
PSA.42.5	I should put my hope in God
PSA.42.5	and keep praising him,
PSA.42.5	my Savior and 
PSA.42.6	my God.
PSA.42.6	I am very sad.
PSA.42.6	So I remember you where the Jordan River begins,
PSA.42.6	near the peaks of Hermon and Mount Mizar.
PSA.42.7	Troubles have come again and again, sounding like waterfalls.
PSA.42.7	Your waves are crashing all around me.
PSA.42.8	The L
PSA.42.8	At night I have a song,
PSA.42.8	and I pray to my living God.
PSA.42.9	I say to God, my Rock,
PSA.42.9	“Why have you forgotten me?
PSA.42.9	Why am I sad
PSA.42.9	and troubled by my enemies?”
PSA.42.10	My enemies’ insults make me feel
PSA.42.10	as if my bones were broken.
PSA.42.10	They are always saying,
PSA.42.10	“Where is your God?”
PSA.42.11	Why am I so sad?
PSA.42.11	Why am I so upset?
PSA.42.11	I should put my hope in God
PSA.42.11	and keep praising him,
PSA.42.11	my Savior and my God.
PSA.43.1	God, defend me.
PSA.43.1	Argue my case against those who don’t follow you.
PSA.43.1	Save me from liars and those who do evil.
PSA.43.2	God, you are my strength.
PSA.43.2	Why have you rejected me?
PSA.43.2	Why am I sad
PSA.43.2	and troubled by my enemies?
PSA.43.3	Send me your light and truth
PSA.43.3	to guide me.
PSA.43.3	Let them lead me to your holy mountain,
PSA.43.3	to where you live.
PSA.43.4	Then I will go to the altar of God,
PSA.43.4	to God who is my joy and happiness.
PSA.43.4	I will praise you with a harp,
PSA.43.4	God, my God.
PSA.43.5	Why am I so sad?
PSA.43.5	Why am I so upset?
PSA.43.5	I should put my hope in God
PSA.43.5	and keep praising him,
PSA.43.5	my Savior and my God.
PSA.44.1	God, we have heard about you.
PSA.44.1	Our ancestors told us
PSA.44.1	what you did in their days,
PSA.44.1	in days long ago.
PSA.44.2	With your power you forced the nations out of the land
PSA.44.2	and placed our ancestors here.
PSA.44.2	You destroyed those other nations,
PSA.44.2	but you made our ancestors grow strong.
PSA.44.3	It wasn’t their swords that took the land.
PSA.44.3	It wasn’t their power that gave them victory.
PSA.44.3	But it was your great power and strength.
PSA.44.3	You were with them because you loved them.
PSA.44.4	My God, you are my King.
PSA.44.4	Your commands led Jacob’s people to victory.
PSA.44.5	With your help we pushed back our enemies.
PSA.44.5	In your name we trampled those who came against us.
PSA.44.6	I don’t trust my bow to help me,
PSA.44.6	and my sword can’t save me.
PSA.44.7	You saved us from our foes,
PSA.44.7	and you made our enemies ashamed.
PSA.44.8	We will praise God every day;
PSA.44.8	we will praise your name forever.
PSA.44.9	But you have rejected us and shamed us.
PSA.44.9	You don’t march with our armies anymore.
PSA.44.10	You let our enemies push us back,
PSA.44.10	and those who hate us have taken our wealth.
PSA.44.11	You gave us away like sheep to be eaten
PSA.44.11	and have scattered us among the nations.
PSA.44.12	You sold your people for nothing
PSA.44.12	and made no profit on the sale.
PSA.44.13	You made us a joke to our neighbors;
PSA.44.13	those around us laugh and make fun of us.
PSA.44.14	You made us a joke to the other nations;
PSA.44.14	people shake their heads.
PSA.44.15	I am always in disgrace,
PSA.44.15	and I am covered with shame.
PSA.44.16	My enemy is getting even
PSA.44.16	with insults and curses.
PSA.44.17	All these things have happened to us,
PSA.44.17	but we have not forgotten you
PSA.44.17	or failed to keep our agreement with you.
PSA.44.18	Our hearts haven’t turned away from you,
PSA.44.18	and we haven’t stopped following you.
PSA.44.19	But you crushed us in this place where wild dogs live,
PSA.44.19	and you covered us with deep darkness.
PSA.44.20	If we had forgotten our God
PSA.44.20	or lifted our hands in prayer to foreign gods,
PSA.44.21	God would have known,
PSA.44.21	because he knows what is in our hearts.
PSA.44.22	But for you we are in danger of death all the time.
PSA.44.22	People think we are worth no more than sheep to be killed.
PSA.44.23	Wake up, Lord! Why are you sleeping?
PSA.44.23	Get up! Don’t reject us forever.
PSA.44.24	Why do you hide from us?
PSA.44.24	Have you forgotten our pain and troubles?
PSA.44.25	We have been pushed down into the dirt;
PSA.44.25	we are flat on the ground.
PSA.44.26	Get up and help us.
PSA.44.26	Because of your love, save us.
PSA.45.1	Beautiful words fill my mind.
PSA.45.1	I am speaking of royal things.
PSA.45.1	My tongue is like the pen of a skilled writer.
PSA.45.2	You are more handsome than anyone,
PSA.45.2	and you are an excellent speaker,
PSA.45.2	so God has blessed you forever.
PSA.45.3	Put on your sword, powerful warrior.
PSA.45.3	Show your glory and majesty.
PSA.45.4	In your majesty win the victory
PSA.45.4	for what is true and right.
PSA.45.4	Your power will do amazing things.
PSA.45.5	Your sharp arrows will enter
PSA.45.5	the hearts of the king’s enemies.
PSA.45.5	Nations will be defeated before you.
PSA.45.6	God, your throne will last forever and ever.
PSA.45.6	You will rule your kingdom with fairness.
PSA.45.7	You love right and hate evil,
PSA.45.7	so God has chosen you from among your friends;
PSA.45.7	he has set you apart with much joy.
PSA.45.8	Your clothes smell like myrrh, aloes, and cassia.
PSA.45.8	From palaces of ivory
PSA.45.8	music comes to make you happy.
PSA.45.9	Kings’ daughters are among your honored women.
PSA.45.9	Your bride stands at your right side
PSA.45.9	wearing gold from Ophir.
PSA.45.10	Listen to me, daughter; look and pay attention.
PSA.45.10	Forget your people and your father’s family.
PSA.45.11	The king loves your beauty.
PSA.45.11	Because he is your master, you should obey him.
PSA.45.12	People from the city of Tyre have brought a gift.
PSA.45.12	Wealthy people will want to meet you.
PSA.45.13	The princess is very beautiful.
PSA.45.13	Her gown is woven with gold.
PSA.45.14	In her beautiful clothes she is brought to the king.
PSA.45.14	Her bridesmaids follow behind her,
PSA.45.14	and they are also brought to him.
PSA.45.15	They come with happiness and joy;
PSA.45.15	they enter the king’s palace.
PSA.45.16	You will have sons to replace your fathers.
PSA.45.16	You will make them rulers through all the land.
PSA.45.17	I will make your name famous from now on,
PSA.45.17	so people will praise you forever and ever.
PSA.46.1	God is our protection and our strength.
PSA.46.1	He always helps in times of trouble.
PSA.46.2	So we will not be afraid even if the earth shakes,
PSA.46.2	or the mountains fall into the sea,
PSA.46.3	even if the oceans roar and foam,
PSA.46.3	or the mountains shake at the raging sea. 
PSA.46.4	There is a river that brings joy to the city of God,
PSA.46.4	the holy place where God Most High lives.
PSA.46.5	God is in that city, and so it will not be shaken.
PSA.46.5	God will help her at dawn.
PSA.46.6	Nations tremble and kingdoms shake.
PSA.46.6	God shouts and the earth crumbles.
PSA.46.7	The L
PSA.46.7	the God of Jacob is our defender.
PSA.46.8	Come and see what the L
PSA.46.8	the amazing things he has done on the earth.
PSA.46.9	He stops wars everywhere on the earth.

PSA.46.9	and burns up the chariots with fire.
PSA.46.10	God says, “Be still and know that I am God.
PSA.46.10	I will be praised in all the nations;
PSA.46.10	I will be praised throughout the earth.”
PSA.46.11	The L

PSA.48.4	Kings joined together
PSA.48.4	and came to attack the city.
PSA.48.5	But when they saw it, they were amazed.
PSA.48.5	They ran away in fear.
PSA.48.6	Fear took hold of them;
PSA.48.6	they hurt like a woman having a baby.
PSA.48.7	You destroyed the large trading ships
PSA.48.7	with an east wind.
PSA.48.8	First we heard
PSA.48.8	and now we have seen
PSA.48.8	that God will always keep his city safe.
PSA.48.8	It is the city of the L
PSA.48.8	the city of our God.
PSA.48.9	God, we come into your Temple
PSA.48.9	to think about your love.
PSA.48.10	God, your name is known everywhere;
PSA.48.10	all over the earth people praise you.
PSA.48.10	Your right hand is full of goodness.
PSA.48.11	Mount Zion is happy
PSA.48.11	and all the towns of Judah rejoice,
PSA.48.11	because your decisions are fair.
PSA.48.12	Walk around Jerusalem
PSA.48.12	and count its towers.
PSA.48.13	Notice how strong they are.
PSA.48.13	Look at the palaces.
PSA.48.13	Then you can tell your children about them.
PSA.48.14	This God is our God forever and ever.
PSA.48.14	He will guide us from now on.
PSA.49.1	Listen to this, all you nations;
PSA.49.1	listen, all you who live on earth.
PSA.49.2	Listen, both great and small,
PSA.49.2	rich and poor together.
PSA.49.3	What I say is wise,
PSA.49.3	and my heart speaks with understanding.
PSA.49.4	I will pay attention to a wise saying;
PSA.49.4	I will explain my riddle on the harp.
PSA.49.5	Why should I be afraid of bad days?
PSA.49.5	Why should I fear when evil people surround me?
PSA.49.6	They trust in their money
PSA.49.6	and brag about their riches.
PSA.49.7	No one can buy back the life of another.
PSA.49.7	No one can pay God for his own life,
PSA.49.8	because the price of a life is high.
PSA.49.8	No payment is ever enough.
PSA.49.9	Do people live forever?
PSA.49.9	Don’t they all face death?
PSA.49.10	See, even wise people die.
PSA.49.10	Fools and stupid people also die
PSA.49.10	and leave their wealth to others.
PSA.49.11	Their graves will always be their homes.
PSA.49.11	They will live there from now on,
PSA.49.11	even though they named places after themselves.
PSA.49.12	Even rich people do not live forever;
PSA.49.12	like the animals, people die.
PSA.49.13	This is what will happen to those who trust in themselves
PSA.49.13	and to their followers who believe them.
PSA.49.14	Like sheep, they must die,
PSA.49.14	and death will be their shepherd.
PSA.49.14	Honest people will rule over them in the morning,
PSA.49.14	and their bodies will rot in a grave far from home.
PSA.49.15	But God will save my life
PSA.49.15	and will take me from the grave.
PSA.49.16	Don’t be afraid of rich people
PSA.49.16	because their houses are more beautiful.
PSA.49.17	They don’t take anything to the grave;
PSA.49.17	their wealth won’t go down with them.
PSA.49.18	Even though they were praised when they were alive—
PSA.49.18	and people may praise you when you succeed—
PSA.49.19	they will go to where their ancestors are.
PSA.49.19	They will never see light again.
PSA.49.20	Rich people with no understanding
PSA.49.20	are just like animals that die.
PSA.50.1	The God of gods, the L
PSA.50.1	He calls the earth from the rising to the setting sun.
PSA.50.2	God shines from Jerusalem,
PSA.50.2	whose beauty is perfect.
PSA.50.3	Our God comes, and he will not be silent.
PSA.50.3	A fire burns in front of him,
PSA.50.3	and a powerful storm surrounds him.
PSA.50.4	He calls to the sky above and to the earth
PSA.50.4	that he might judge his people.
PSA.50.5	He says, “Gather around, you who worship me,
PSA.50.5	who have made an agreement with me, using a sacrifice.”
PSA.50.6	God is the judge,
PSA.50.6	and even the skies say he is right. 
PSA.50.7	God says, “My people, listen to me;
PSA.50.7	Israel, I will testify against you.
PSA.50.7	I am God, your God.
PSA.50.8	I do not scold you for your sacrifices.
PSA.50.8	You always bring me your burnt offerings.
PSA.50.9	But I do not need bulls from your stalls
PSA.50.9	or goats from your pens,
PSA.50.10	because every animal of the forest is already mine.
PSA.50.10	The cattle on a thousand hills are mine.
PSA.50.11	I know every bird on the mountains,
PSA.50.11	and every living thing in the fields is mine.
PSA.50.12	If I were hungry, I would not tell you,
PSA.50.12	because the earth and everything in it are mine.
PSA.50.13	I don’t eat the meat of bulls
PSA.50.13	or drink the blood of goats.
PSA.50.14	Give an offering to show thanks to God.
PSA.50.14	Give God Most High what you have promised.
PSA.50.15	Call to me in times of trouble.
PSA.50.15	I will save you, and you will honor me.”
PSA.50.16	But God says to the wicked,
PSA.50.16	“Why do you talk about my laws?
PSA.50.16	Why do you mention my agreement?
PSA.50.17	You hate my teachings
PSA.50.17	and turn your back on what I say.
PSA.50.18	When you see a thief, you join him.
PSA.50.18	You take part in adultery.
PSA.50.19	You don’t stop your mouth from speaking evil,
PSA.50.19	and your tongue makes up lies.
PSA.50.20	You speak against your brother
PSA.50.20	and lie about your mother’s son.
PSA.50.21	I have kept quiet while you did these things,
PSA.50.21	so you thought I was just like you.
PSA.50.21	But I will scold you
PSA.50.21	and accuse you to your face.
PSA.50.22	“Think about this, you who forget God.
PSA.50.22	Otherwise, I will tear you apart,
PSA.50.22	and no one will save you.
PSA.50.23	Those people honor me
PSA.50.23	who bring me offerings to show thanks.
PSA.50.23	And I, God, will save those who do that.”
PSA.51.1	God, be merciful to me
PSA.51.1	because you are loving.
PSA.51.1	Because you are always ready to be merciful,
PSA.51.1	wipe out all my wrongs.
PSA.51.2	Wash away all my guilt
PSA.51.2	and make me clean again.
PSA.51.3	I know about my wrongs,
PSA.51.3	and I can’t forget my sin.
PSA.51.4	You are the only one I have sinned against;
PSA.51.4	I have done what you say is wrong.
PSA.51.4	You are right when you speak
PSA.51.4	and fair when you judge.
PSA.51.5	I was brought into this world in sin.
PSA.51.5	In sin my mother gave birth to me.
PSA.51.6	You want me to be completely truthful,
PSA.51.6	so teach me wisdom.
PSA.51.7	Take away my sin, and I will be clean.
PSA.51.7	Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
PSA.51.8	Make me hear sounds of joy and gladness;
PSA.51.8	let the bones you crushed be happy again.
PSA.51.9	Turn your face from my sins
PSA.51.9	and wipe out all my guilt.
PSA.51.10	Create in me a pure heart, God,
PSA.51.10	and make my spirit right again.
PSA.51.11	Do not send me away from you
PSA.51.11	or take your Holy Spirit away from me.
PSA.51.12	Give me back the joy of your salvation.
PSA.51.12	Keep me strong by giving me a willing spirit.
PSA.51.13	Then I will teach your ways to those who do wrong,
PSA.51.13	and sinners will turn back to you.
PSA.51.14	God, save me from the guilt of murder,
PSA.51.14	God of my salvation,
PSA.51.14	and I will sing about your goodness.
PSA.51.15	Lord, let me speak
PSA.51.15	so I may praise you.
PSA.51.16	You are not pleased by sacrifices, or I would give them.
PSA.51.16	You don’t want burnt offerings.
PSA.51.17	The sacrifice God wants is a broken spirit.
PSA.51.17	God, you will not reject a heart that is broken and sorry for sin.
PSA.51.18	Do whatever good you wish for Jerusalem.
PSA.51.18	Rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.
PSA.51.19	Then you will be pleased with right sacrifices and whole burnt offerings,
PSA.51.19	and bulls will be offered on your altar.
PSA.52.1	Mighty warrior, why do you brag about the evil you do?
PSA.52.1	God’s love will continue forever.
PSA.52.2	You think up evil plans.
PSA.52.2	Your tongue is like a sharp razor,
PSA.52.2	making up lies.
PSA.52.3	You love wrong more than right
PSA.52.3	and lies more than truth.
PSA.52.4	You love words that bite
PSA.52.4	and tongues that lie.
PSA.52.5	But God will ruin you forever.
PSA.52.5	He will grab you and throw you out of your tent;
PSA.52.5	he will tear you away from the land of the living.
PSA.52.6	Those who do right will see this and fear God.
PSA.52.6	They will laugh at you and say,
PSA.52.7	“Look what happened to the man
PSA.52.7	who did not depend on God
PSA.52.7	but depended on his money.
PSA.52.7	He grew strong by his evil plans.”
PSA.52.8	But I am like an olive tree
PSA.52.8	growing in God’s Temple.
PSA.52.8	I trust God’s love
PSA.52.8	forever and ever.
PSA.52.9	God, I will thank you forever for what you have done.
PSA.52.9	With those who worship you, I will trust you because you are good.
PSA.53.1	Fools say to themselves,
PSA.53.1	“There is no God.”
PSA.53.1	Fools are evil and do terrible things;
PSA.53.1	none of them does anything good.
PSA.53.2	God looked down from heaven on all people
PSA.53.2	to see if anyone was wise,
PSA.53.2	if anyone was looking to God for help.
PSA.53.3	But all have turned away.
PSA.53.3	Together, everyone has become evil;
PSA.53.3	none of them does anything good.
PSA.53.3	Not a single person.
PSA.53.4	Don’t the wicked understand?
PSA.53.4	They destroy my people as if they were eating bread.
PSA.53.4	They do not ask God for help.
PSA.53.5	The wicked are filled with terror
PSA.53.5	where there had been nothing to fear.
PSA.53.5	God will scatter the bones of your enemies.
PSA.53.5	You will defeat them,
PSA.53.5	because God has rejected them.
PSA.53.6	I pray that victory will come to Israel from Mount Zion!
PSA.53.6	May God bring them back.
PSA.53.6	Then the people of Jacob will rejoice,
PSA.53.6	and the people of Israel will be glad.
PSA.54.1	God, save me because of who you are.
PSA.54.1	By your strength show that I am innocent.
PSA.54.2	Hear my prayer, God;
PSA.54.2	listen to what I say.
PSA.54.3	Strangers turn against me,
PSA.54.3	and cruel people want to kill me.
PSA.54.3	They do not care about God.
PSA.54.4	See, God will help me;
PSA.54.4	the Lord will support me.
PSA.54.5	Let my enemies be punished with their own evil.
PSA.54.5	Destroy them because you are loyal to me.
PSA.54.6	I will offer a sacrifice as a special gift to you.
PSA.54.6	I will thank you, L
PSA.54.7	You have saved me from all my troubles,
PSA.54.7	and I have seen my enemies defeated.
PSA.55.1	God, listen to my prayer
PSA.55.1	and do not ignore my cry for help.
PSA.55.2	Pay attention to me and answer me.
PSA.55.2	I am troubled and upset
PSA.55.3	by what the enemy says
PSA.55.3	and how the wicked look at me.
PSA.55.3	They bring troubles down on me,
PSA.55.3	and in anger they attack me.
PSA.55.4	I am frightened inside;
PSA.55.4	the terror of death has attacked me.
PSA.55.5	I am scared and shaking,
PSA.55.5	and terror grips me.
PSA.55.6	I said, “I wish I had wings like a dove.
PSA.55.6	Then I would fly away and rest.
PSA.55.7	I would wander far away
PSA.55.7	and stay in the desert.
PSA.55.8	I would hurry to my place of escape,
PSA.55.8	far away from the wind and storm.”
PSA.55.9	Lord, destroy and confuse their words,
PSA.55.9	because I see violence and fighting in the city.
PSA.55.10	Day and night they are all around its walls,
PSA.55.10	and evil and trouble are everywhere inside.
PSA.55.11	Destruction is everywhere in the city;
PSA.55.11	trouble and lying never leave its streets.
PSA.55.12	It was not an enemy insulting me.
PSA.55.12	I could stand that.
PSA.55.12	It was not someone who hated me.
PSA.55.12	I could hide from him.
PSA.55.13	But it is you, a person like me,
PSA.55.13	my companion and good friend.
PSA.55.14	We had a good friendship
PSA.55.14	and walked together to God’s Temple.
PSA.55.15	Let death take away my enemies.
PSA.55.15	Let them die while they are still young
PSA.55.15	because evil lives with them.
PSA.55.16	But I will call to God for help,
PSA.55.16	and the L
PSA.55.17	Morning, noon, and night I am troubled and upset,
PSA.55.17	but he will listen to me.
PSA.55.18	Many are against me,
PSA.55.18	but he keeps me safe in battle.
PSA.55.19	God who lives forever
PSA.55.19	will hear me and punish them.
PSA.55.19	But they will not change;
PSA.55.19	they do not fear God.
PSA.55.20	The one who was my friend attacks his friends
PSA.55.20	and breaks his promises.
PSA.55.21	His words are slippery like butter,
PSA.55.21	but war is in his heart.
PSA.55.21	His words are smoother than oil,
PSA.55.21	but they cut like knives.
PSA.55.22	Give your worries to the L
PSA.55.22	and he will take care of you.
PSA.55.22	He will never let good people down.
PSA.55.23	But, God, you will bring down
PSA.55.23	the wicked to the grave.
PSA.55.23	Murderers and liars will live
PSA.55.23	only half a lifetime.
PSA.55.23	But I will trust in you.
PSA.56.1	God, be merciful to me because people are chasing me;
PSA.56.1	the battle has pressed me all day long.
PSA.56.2	My enemies have chased me all day;
PSA.56.2	there are many proud people fighting me.
PSA.56.3	When I am afraid,
PSA.56.3	I will trust you.
PSA.56.4	I praise God for his word.
PSA.56.4	I trust God, so I am not afraid.
PSA.56.4	What can human beings do to me?
PSA.56.5	All day long they twist my words;
PSA.56.5	all their evil plans are against me.
PSA.56.6	They wait. They hide.
PSA.56.6	They watch my steps,
PSA.56.6	hoping to kill me.
PSA.56.7	God, do not let them escape;
PSA.56.7	punish the foreign nations in your anger.
PSA.56.8	You have recorded my troubles.
PSA.56.8	You have kept a list of my tears.
PSA.56.8	Aren’t they in your records?
PSA.56.9	On the day I call for help, my enemies will be defeated.
PSA.56.9	I know that God is on my side.
PSA.56.10	I praise God for his word to me;
PSA.56.10	I praise the L
PSA.56.11	I trust in God. I will not be afraid.
PSA.56.11	What can people do to me?
PSA.56.12	God, I must keep my promises to you.
PSA.56.12	I will give you my offerings to thank you,
PSA.56.13	because you have saved me from death.
PSA.56.13	You have kept me from being defeated.
PSA.56.13	So I will walk with God
PSA.56.13	in light among the living.
PSA.57.1	Be merciful to me, God; be merciful to me
PSA.57.1	because I come to you for protection.
PSA.57.1	Let me hide under the shadow of your wings
PSA.57.1	until the trouble has passed.
PSA.57.2	I cry out to God Most High,
PSA.57.2	to the God who does everything for me.
PSA.57.3	He sends help from heaven and saves me.
PSA.57.3	He punishes those who chase me.
PSA.57.3	God sends me his love and truth.
PSA.57.4	Enemies, like lions, are all around me;
PSA.57.4	I must lie down among them.
PSA.57.4	Their teeth are like spears and arrows,
PSA.57.4	their tongues as sharp as swords.
PSA.57.5	God is supreme over the skies;
PSA.57.5	his majesty covers the earth.
PSA.57.6	They set a trap for me.
PSA.57.6	I am very worried.
PSA.57.6	They dug a pit in my path,
PSA.57.6	but they fell into it themselves.
PSA.57.7	My heart is steady, God; my heart is steady.
PSA.57.7	I will sing and praise you.
PSA.57.8	Wake up, my soul.
PSA.57.8	Wake up, harp and lyre!
PSA.57.8	I will wake up the dawn.
PSA.57.9	Lord, I will praise you among the nations;
PSA.57.9	I will sing songs of praise about you to all the nations.
PSA.57.10	Your great love reaches to the skies,
PSA.57.10	your truth to the clouds.
PSA.57.11	God, you are supreme above the skies.
PSA.57.11	Let your glory be over all the earth.
PSA.58.1	Do you rulers really say what is right?
PSA.58.1	Do you judge people fairly?
PSA.58.2	No, in your heart you plan evil;
PSA.58.2	you think up violent crimes in the land.
PSA.58.3	From birth, evil people turn away from God;
PSA.58.3	they wander off and tell lies as soon as they are born.
PSA.58.4	They are like poisonous snakes,
PSA.58.4	like deaf cobras that stop up their ears
PSA.58.5	so they cannot hear the music of the snake charmer
PSA.58.5	no matter how well he plays.
PSA.58.6	God, break the teeth in their mouths!
PSA.58.6	Tear out the fangs of those lions, L
PSA.58.7	Let them disappear like water that flows away.
PSA.58.7	Let them be cut short like a broken arrow.
PSA.58.8	Let them be like snails that melt as they move.
PSA.58.8	Let them be like a child born dead who never saw the sun.
PSA.58.9	His anger will blow them away alive
PSA.58.9	faster than burning thorns can heat a pot.
PSA.58.10	Good people will be glad when they see him get even.
PSA.58.10	They will wash their feet in the blood of the wicked.
PSA.58.11	Then people will say,
PSA.58.11	“There really are rewards for doing what is right.
PSA.58.11	There really is a God who judges the world.”
PSA.59.1	God, save me from my enemies.
PSA.59.1	Protect me from those who come against me.
PSA.59.2	Save me from those who do evil
PSA.59.2	and from murderers.
PSA.59.3	Look, they are waiting to ambush me.
PSA.59.3	Cruel people attack me,
PSA.59.3	but I have not sinned or done wrong, L
PSA.59.4	I have done nothing wrong, but they are ready to attack me.
PSA.59.4	Wake up to help me, and look.
PSA.59.5	You are the L
PSA.59.5	Arise and punish those people.
PSA.59.5	Do not give those traitors any mercy. 
PSA.59.6	They come back at night.
PSA.59.6	Like dogs they growl and roam around the city.
PSA.59.7	Notice what comes from their mouths.
PSA.59.7	Insults come from their lips,
PSA.59.7	because they say, “Who’s listening?”
PSA.59.8	But, L
PSA.59.8	you make fun of all of them.
PSA.59.9	God, my strength, I am looking to you,
PSA.59.9	because God is my defender.
PSA.59.10	My God loves me, and he goes in front of me.
PSA.59.10	He will help me defeat my enemies.
PSA.59.11	Lord, our protector, do not kill them, or my people will forget.
PSA.59.11	With your power scatter them and defeat them.
PSA.59.12	They sin by what they say;
PSA.59.12	they sin with their words.
PSA.59.12	They curse and tell lies,
PSA.59.12	so let their pride trap them.
PSA.59.13	Destroy them in your anger;
PSA.59.13	destroy them completely!
PSA.59.13	Then they will know
PSA.59.13	that God rules over Israel
PSA.59.13	and to the ends of the earth.
PSA.59.14	They come back at night.
PSA.59.14	Like dogs they growl
PSA.59.14	and roam around the city.
PSA.59.15	They wander about looking for food,
PSA.59.15	and they howl if they do not find enough.
PSA.59.16	But I will sing about your strength.
PSA.59.16	In the morning I will sing about your love.
PSA.59.16	You are my defender,
PSA.59.16	my place of safety in times of trouble.
PSA.59.17	God, my strength, I will sing praises to you.
PSA.59.17	God, my defender, you are the God who loves me.
PSA.60.1	God, you have rejected us and scattered us.
PSA.60.1	You have been angry, but please come back to us.
PSA.60.2	You made the earth shake and crack.
PSA.60.2	Heal its breaks because it is shaking.
PSA.60.3	You have given your people trouble.
PSA.60.3	You made us unable to walk straight, like people drunk with wine.
PSA.60.4	You have raised a banner to gather those who fear you.
PSA.60.4	Now they can stand up against the enemy.
PSA.60.5	Answer us and save us by your power
PSA.60.5	so the people you love will be rescued.
PSA.60.6	God has said from his Temple,
PSA.60.6	“When I win, I will divide Shechem
PSA.60.6	and measure off the Valley of Succoth.
PSA.60.7	Gilead and Manasseh are mine.
PSA.60.7	Ephraim is like my helmet.
PSA.60.7	Judah holds my royal scepter.
PSA.60.8	Moab is like my washbowl.
PSA.60.8	I throw my sandals at Edom.
PSA.60.8	I shout at Philistia.”
PSA.60.9	Who will bring me to the strong, walled city?
PSA.60.9	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.60.10	God, surely you have rejected us;
PSA.60.10	you do not go out with our armies.
PSA.60.11	Help us fight the enemy.
PSA.60.11	Human help is useless,
PSA.60.12	but we can win with God’s help.
PSA.60.12	He will defeat our enemies.
PSA.61.1	God, hear my cry;
PSA.61.1	listen to my prayer.
PSA.61.2	I call to you from the ends of the earth
PSA.61.2	when I am afraid.
PSA.61.2	Carry me away to a high mountain.
PSA.61.3	You have been my protection,
PSA.61.3	like a strong tower against my enemies.
PSA.61.4	Let me live in your Holy Tent forever.
PSA.61.4	Let me find safety in the shelter of your wings.
PSA.61.5	God, you have heard my promises.
PSA.61.5	You have given me what belongs to those who fear you.
PSA.61.6	Give the king a long life;
PSA.61.6	let him live many years.
PSA.61.7	Let him rule in the presence of God forever.
PSA.61.7	Protect him with your love and truth.
PSA.61.8	Then I will praise your name forever,
PSA.61.8	and every day I will keep my promises.
PSA.62.1	I find rest in God;
PSA.62.1	only he can save me.
PSA.62.2	He is my rock and my salvation.
PSA.62.2	He is my defender;
PSA.62.2	I will not be defeated.
PSA.62.3	How long will you attack someone?
PSA.62.3	Will all of you kill that person?
PSA.62.3	Who is like a leaning wall, like a fence ready to fall?
PSA.62.4	They are planning to make that person fall.
PSA.62.4	They enjoy telling lies.
PSA.62.4	With their mouths they bless,
PSA.62.4	but in their hearts they curse.
PSA.62.5	I find rest in God;
PSA.62.5	only he gives me hope.
PSA.62.6	He is my rock and my salvation.
PSA.62.6	He is my defender;
PSA.62.6	I will not be defeated.
PSA.62.7	My honor and salvation come from God.
PSA.62.7	He is my mighty rock and my protection.
PSA.62.8	People, trust God all the time.
PSA.62.8	Tell him all your problems,
PSA.62.8	because God is our protection.
PSA.62.9	The least of people are only a breath,
PSA.62.9	and even the greatest are just a lie.
PSA.62.9	On the scales, they weigh nothing;
PSA.62.9	together they are only a breath.
PSA.62.10	Do not trust in force.
PSA.62.10	Stealing is of no use.
PSA.62.10	Even if you gain more riches,
PSA.62.10	don’t put your trust in them.
PSA.62.11	God has said this,
PSA.62.11	and I have heard it over and over:
PSA.62.11	God is strong.
PSA.62.12	The Lord is loving.
PSA.62.12	You reward people for what they have done.
PSA.63.1	God, you are my God.
PSA.63.1	I search for you.
PSA.63.1	I thirst for you
PSA.63.1	like someone in a dry, empty land
PSA.63.1	where there is no water.
PSA.63.2	I have seen you in the Temple
PSA.63.2	and have seen your strength and glory.
PSA.63.3	Because your love is better than life,
PSA.63.3	I will praise you.
PSA.63.4	I will praise you as long as I live.
PSA.63.4	I will lift up my hands in prayer to your name.
PSA.63.5	I will be content as if I had eaten the best foods.
PSA.63.5	My lips will sing, and my mouth will praise you.
PSA.63.6	I remember you while I’m lying in bed;
PSA.63.6	I think about you through the night.
PSA.63.7	You are my help.
PSA.63.7	Because of your protection, I sing.
PSA.63.8	I stay close to you;
PSA.63.8	you support me with your right hand.
PSA.63.9	Some people are trying to kill me,
PSA.63.9	but they will go down to the grave.
PSA.63.10	They will be killed with swords
PSA.63.10	and eaten by wild dogs.
PSA.63.11	But the king will rejoice in his God.
PSA.63.11	All who make promises in his name will praise him,
PSA.63.11	but the mouths of liars will be shut.
PSA.64.1	God, listen to my complaint.
PSA.64.1	I am afraid of my enemies;
PSA.64.1	protect my life from them.
PSA.64.2	Hide me from those who plan wicked things,
PSA.64.2	from that gang who does evil.
PSA.64.3	They sharpen their tongues like swords
PSA.64.3	and shoot bitter words like arrows.
PSA.64.4	From their hiding places they shoot at innocent people;
PSA.64.4	they shoot suddenly and are not afraid.
PSA.64.5	They encourage each other to do wrong.
PSA.64.5	They talk about setting traps,
PSA.64.5	thinking no one will see them.
PSA.64.6	They plan wicked things and say,
PSA.64.6	“We have a perfect plan.”
PSA.64.6	The mind of human beings is hard to understand.
PSA.64.7	But God will shoot them with arrows;
PSA.64.7	they will suddenly be struck down.
PSA.64.8	Their own words will be used against them.
PSA.64.8	All who see them will shake their heads.
PSA.64.9	Then everyone will fear God.
PSA.64.9	They will tell what God has done,
PSA.64.9	and they will learn from what he has done.
PSA.64.10	Good people will be happy in the L
PSA.64.10	and will find protection in him.
PSA.64.10	Let everyone who is honest praise the L
PSA.65.1	God, you will be praised in Jerusalem.
PSA.65.1	We will keep our promises to you.
PSA.65.2	You hear our prayers.
PSA.65.2	All people will come to you.
PSA.65.3	Our guilt overwhelms us,
PSA.65.3	but you forgive our sins.
PSA.65.4	Happy are the people you choose
PSA.65.4	and invite to stay in your court.
PSA.65.4	We are filled with good things in your house,
PSA.65.4	your holy Temple.
PSA.65.5	You answer us in amazing ways,
PSA.65.5	God our Savior.
PSA.65.5	People everywhere on the earth
PSA.65.5	and beyond the sea trust you.
PSA.65.6	You made the mountains by your strength;
PSA.65.6	you are dressed in power.
PSA.65.7	You stopped the roaring seas,
PSA.65.7	the roaring waves,
PSA.65.7	and the uproar of the nations.
PSA.65.8	Even those people at the ends of the earth fear your miracles.
PSA.65.8	You are praised from where the sun rises to where it sets.
PSA.65.9	You take care of the land and water it;
PSA.65.9	you make it very fertile.
PSA.65.9	The rivers of God are full of water.
PSA.65.9	Grain grows because you make it grow.
PSA.65.10	You send rain to the plowed fields;
PSA.65.10	you fill the rows with water.
PSA.65.10	You soften the ground with rain,
PSA.65.10	and then you bless it with crops.
PSA.65.11	You give the year a good harvest,
PSA.65.11	and you load the wagons with many crops.
PSA.65.12	The desert is covered with grass
PSA.65.12	and the hills with happiness.
PSA.65.13	The pastures are full of flocks,
PSA.65.13	and the valleys are covered with grain.
PSA.65.13	Everything shouts and sings for joy.
PSA.66.1	Everything on earth, shout with joy to God!
PSA.66.2	Sing about his glory!
PSA.66.2	Make his praise glorious!
PSA.66.3	Say to God, “Your works are amazing!
PSA.66.3	Because your power is great,
PSA.66.3	your enemies fall before you.
PSA.66.4	All the earth worships you
PSA.66.4	and sings praises to you.
PSA.66.4	They sing praises to your name.”
PSA.66.5	Come and see what God has done,
PSA.66.5	the amazing things he has done for people.
PSA.66.6	He turned the sea into dry land.
PSA.66.6	The people crossed the river on foot.
PSA.66.6	So let us rejoice because of what he did.
PSA.66.7	He rules forever with his power.
PSA.66.7	He keeps his eye on the nations,
PSA.66.7	so people should not turn against him.
PSA.66.8	You people, praise our God;
PSA.66.8	loudly sing his praise.
PSA.66.9	He protects our lives
PSA.66.9	and does not let us be defeated.
PSA.66.10	God, you have tested us;
PSA.66.10	you have purified us like silver.
PSA.66.11	You let us be trapped
PSA.66.11	and put a heavy load on us.
PSA.66.12	You let our enemies walk on our heads.
PSA.66.12	We went through fire and flood,
PSA.66.12	but you brought us to a place with good things.
PSA.66.13	I will come to your Temple with burnt offerings.
PSA.66.13	I will give you what I promised,
PSA.66.14	things I promised when I was in trouble.
PSA.66.15	I will bring you offerings of fat animals,
PSA.66.15	and I will offer sheep, bulls, and goats.
PSA.66.16	All of you who fear God, come and listen,
PSA.66.16	and I will tell you what he has done for me.
PSA.66.17	I cried out to him with my mouth
PSA.66.17	and praised him with my tongue.
PSA.66.18	If I had known of any sin in my heart,
PSA.66.18	the Lord would not have listened to me.
PSA.66.19	But God has listened;
PSA.66.19	he has heard my prayer.
PSA.66.20	Praise God,
PSA.66.20	who did not ignore my prayer
PSA.66.20	or hold back his love from me.
PSA.67.1	God, have mercy on us and bless us
PSA.67.1	and show us your kindness
PSA.67.2	so the world will learn your ways,
PSA.67.2	and all nations will learn that you can save.
PSA.67.3	God, the people should praise you;
PSA.67.3	all people should praise you.
PSA.67.4	The nations should be glad and sing
PSA.67.4	because you judge people fairly.
PSA.67.4	You guide all the nations on earth.
PSA.67.5	God, the people should praise you;
PSA.67.5	all people should praise you.
PSA.67.6	The land has given its crops.
PSA.67.6	God, our God, blesses us.
PSA.67.7	God blesses us
PSA.67.7	so people all over the earth will fear him.
PSA.68.1	Let God rise up and scatter his enemies;
PSA.68.1	let those who hate him run away from him.
PSA.68.2	Blow them away as smoke
PSA.68.2	is driven away by the wind.
PSA.68.2	As wax melts before a fire,
PSA.68.2	let the wicked be destroyed before God.
PSA.68.3	But those who do right should be glad
PSA.68.3	and should rejoice before God;
PSA.68.3	they should be happy and glad.
PSA.68.4	Sing to God; sing praises to his name.
PSA.68.4	Prepare the way for him
PSA.68.4	who rides through the desert,
PSA.68.4	whose name is the L
PSA.68.4	Rejoice before him.
PSA.68.5	God is in his holy Temple.
PSA.68.5	He is a father to orphans,
PSA.68.5	and he defends the widows.
PSA.68.6	God gives the lonely a home.
PSA.68.6	He leads prisoners out with joy,
PSA.68.6	but those who turn against God will live in a dry land.
PSA.68.7	God, you led your people out
PSA.68.7	when you marched through the desert.
PSA.68.8	The ground shook
PSA.68.8	and the sky poured down rain
PSA.68.8	before God, the God of Mount Sinai,
PSA.68.8	before God, the God of Israel.
PSA.68.9	God, you sent much rain;
PSA.68.9	you refreshed your tired land.
PSA.68.10	Your people settled there.
PSA.68.10	God, in your goodness
PSA.68.10	you took care of the poor.
PSA.68.11	The Lord gave the command,
PSA.68.11	and a great army told the news:
PSA.68.12	“Kings and their armies run away.
PSA.68.12	In camp they divide the wealth taken in war.
PSA.68.13	Those who stayed by the campfires
PSA.68.13	will share the riches taken in battle.”
PSA.68.14	The Almighty scattered kings
PSA.68.14	like snow on Mount Zalmon.
PSA.68.15	The mountains of Bashan are high;
PSA.68.15	the mountains of Bashan have many peaks.
PSA.68.16	Why do you mountains with many peaks look with envy
PSA.68.16	on the mountain that God chose for his home?
PSA.68.16	The L
PSA.68.17	God comes with millions of chariots;
PSA.68.17	the Lord comes from Mount Sinai to his holy place.
PSA.68.18	When you went up to the heights,
PSA.68.18	you led a parade of captives.
PSA.68.18	You received gifts from the people,
PSA.68.18	even from those who turned against you.
PSA.68.18	And the L
PSA.68.19	Praise the Lord, God our Savior,
PSA.68.19	who helps us every day.
PSA.68.20	Our God is a God who saves us;
PSA.68.20	the L
PSA.68.21	God will crush his enemies’ heads,
PSA.68.21	the hairy skulls of those who continue to sin.
PSA.68.22	The Lord said, “I will bring the enemy back from Bashan;
PSA.68.22	I will bring them back from the depths of the sea.
PSA.68.23	Then you can stick your feet in their blood,
PSA.68.23	and your dogs can lick their share.”
PSA.68.24	God, people have seen your victory march;
PSA.68.24	God my King marched into the holy place.
PSA.68.25	The singers are in front and the instruments are behind.
PSA.68.25	In the middle are the girls with the tambourines.
PSA.68.26	Praise God in the meeting place;
PSA.68.26	praise the L
PSA.68.27	There is the smallest tribe, Benjamin, leading them.
PSA.68.27	And there are the leaders of Judah with their group.
PSA.68.27	There also are the leaders of Zebulun and of Naphtali.
PSA.68.28	God, order up your power;
PSA.68.28	show the mighty power you have used for us before.
PSA.68.29	Kings will bring their wealth to you,
PSA.68.29	to your Temple in Jerusalem.
PSA.68.30	Punish Egypt, the beast in the tall grass along the river.
PSA.68.30	Punish the leaders of nations, those bulls among the cows.
PSA.68.30	Defeated, they will bring you their silver.
PSA.68.30	Scatter those nations that love war.
PSA.68.31	Messengers will come from Egypt;
PSA.68.31	the people of Cush will pray to God.
PSA.68.32	Kingdoms of the earth, sing to God;
PSA.68.32	sing praises to the Lord.
PSA.68.33	Sing to the one who rides through the skies, which are from long ago.
PSA.68.33	He speaks with a thundering voice.
PSA.68.34	Announce that God is powerful.
PSA.68.34	He rules over Israel,
PSA.68.34	and his power is in the skies.
PSA.68.35	God, you are wonderful in your Temple.
PSA.68.35	The God of Israel gives his people strength and power.
PSA.68.35	Praise God!
PSA.69.1	God, save me,
PSA.69.1	because the water has risen to my neck.
PSA.69.2	I’m sinking down into the mud,
PSA.69.2	and there is nothing to stand on.
PSA.69.2	I am in deep water,
PSA.69.2	and the flood covers me.
PSA.69.3	I am tired from calling for help;
PSA.69.3	my throat is sore.
PSA.69.3	My eyes are tired from waiting
PSA.69.3	for God to help me.
PSA.69.4	There are more people who hate me for no reason than hairs on my head;
PSA.69.4	powerful enemies want to destroy me for no reason.
PSA.69.4	They make me pay back
PSA.69.4	what I did not steal.
PSA.69.5	God, you know what I have done wrong;
PSA.69.5	I cannot hide my guilt from you.
PSA.69.6	Lord G
PSA.69.6	do not let those who hope in you be ashamed because of me.
PSA.69.6	God of Israel,
PSA.69.6	do not let your worshipers be disgraced because of me.
PSA.69.7	For you, I carry this shame,
PSA.69.7	and my face is covered with disgrace.
PSA.69.8	I am like a stranger to my closest relatives
PSA.69.8	and a foreigner to my mother’s children.
PSA.69.9	My strong love for your Temple completely controls me.
PSA.69.9	When people insult you, it hurts me.
PSA.69.10	When I cry and fast,
PSA.69.10	they make fun of me.
PSA.69.11	When I wear clothes of sadness,
PSA.69.11	they joke about me.
PSA.69.12	They make fun of me in public places,
PSA.69.12	and the drunkards make up songs about me.
PSA.69.13	But I pray to you, L
PSA.69.13	God, because of your great love, answer me.
PSA.69.13	You are truly able to save.

PSA.69.14	and do not let me sink.
PSA.69.14	Save me from those who hate me
PSA.69.14	and from the deep water.
PSA.69.15	Do not let the flood drown me
PSA.69.15	or the deep water swallow me
PSA.69.15	or the grave close its mouth over me.
PSA.69.16	L
PSA.69.16	Because of your great kindness, turn to me.
PSA.69.17	Do not hide from me, your servant.
PSA.69.17	I am in trouble. Hurry to help me!

PSA.69.18	rescue me from my enemies.
PSA.69.19	You see my shame and disgrace.
PSA.69.19	You know all my enemies and what they have said.
PSA.69.20	Insults have broken my heart
PSA.69.20	and left me weak.
PSA.69.20	I looked for sympathy, but there was none;
PSA.69.20	I found no one to comfort me.
PSA.69.21	They put poison in my food
PSA.69.21	and gave me vinegar to drink.
PSA.69.22	Let their own feasts cause their ruin;
PSA.69.22	let their feasts trap them and pay them back.
PSA.69.23	Let their eyes be closed so they cannot see
PSA.69.23	and their backs be forever weak from troubles.
PSA.69.24	Pour your anger out on them;
PSA.69.24	let your anger catch up with them.
PSA.69.25	May their place be empty;
PSA.69.25	leave no one to live in their tents.
PSA.69.26	They chase after those you have hurt,
PSA.69.26	and they talk about the pain of those you have wounded.
PSA.69.27	Charge them with crime after crime,
PSA.69.27	and do not let them have anything good.
PSA.69.28	Wipe their names from the book of life,
PSA.69.28	and do not list them with those who do what is right.
PSA.69.29	I am sad and hurting.
PSA.69.29	God, save me and protect me.
PSA.69.30	I will praise God in a song
PSA.69.30	and will honor him by giving thanks.
PSA.69.31	That will please the L
PSA.69.31	more than sacrificing a bull with horns and hoofs.

PSA.69.33	The L
PSA.69.33	and does not look down on captives.

PSA.69.35	and rebuild the cities of Judah.
PSA.69.35	Then people will live there and own the land.
PSA.69.36	The descendants of his servants will inherit that land,
PSA.69.36	and those who love him will live there.
PSA.70.1	God, come quickly and save me.

PSA.71.3	Be my place of safety
PSA.71.3	where I can always come.
PSA.71.3	Give the command to save me,
PSA.71.3	because you are my rock and my strong, walled city.
PSA.71.4	My God, save me from the power of the wicked
PSA.71.4	and from the hold of evil and cruel people.
PSA.71.5	L
PSA.71.5	L
PSA.71.6	I have depended on you since I was born;

PSA.71.12	My God, hurry to help me.

PSA.71.15	I will tell how you do what is right.
PSA.71.15	I will tell about your salvation all day long,
PSA.71.15	even though it is more than I can tell.
PSA.71.16	I will come and tell about your powerful works, Lord G
PSA.71.16	I will remind people that only you do what is right.
PSA.71.17	God, you have taught me since I was young.
PSA.71.17	To this day I tell about the miracles you do.
PSA.71.18	Even though I am old and gray,
PSA.71.18	do not leave me, God.
PSA.71.18	I will tell the children about your power;
PSA.71.18	I will tell those who live after me about your might.
PSA.71.19	God, your justice reaches to the skies.
PSA.71.19	You have done great things;
PSA.71.19	God, there is no one like you.
PSA.71.20	You have given me many troubles and bad times,
PSA.71.20	but you will give me life again.
PSA.71.20	When I am almost dead,
PSA.71.20	you will keep me alive.
PSA.71.21	You will make me greater than ever,

PSA.71.23	You have saved me.
PSA.71.24	I will tell about your justice all day long.
PSA.71.24	And those who want to hurt me
PSA.71.24	will be ashamed and disgraced.
PSA.72.1	God, give the king your good judgment
PSA.72.1	and the king’s son your goodness.
PSA.72.2	Help him judge your people fairly
PSA.72.2	and decide what is right for the poor.

PSA.73.3	I saw wicked people doing well.
PSA.73.4	They are not suffering;
PSA.73.4	they are healthy and strong.
PSA.73.5	They don’t have troubles like the rest of us;
PSA.73.5	they don’t have problems like other people.
PSA.73.6	They wear pride like a necklace
PSA.73.6	and put on violence as their clothing.
PSA.73.7	They are looking for profits
PSA.73.7	and do not control their selfish desires.
PSA.73.8	They make fun of others and speak evil;
PSA.73.8	proudly they speak of hurting others.
PSA.73.9	They brag to the sky.
PSA.73.9	They say that they own the earth.
PSA.73.10	So their people turn to them
PSA.73.10	and give them whatever they want.
PSA.73.11	They say, “How can God know?
PSA.73.11	What does God Most High know?”
PSA.73.12	These people are wicked,
PSA.73.12	always at ease, and getting richer.
PSA.73.13	So why have I kept my heart pure?
PSA.73.13	Why have I kept my hands from doing wrong?
PSA.73.14	I have suffered all day long;
PSA.73.14	I have been punished every morning.
PSA.73.15	God, if I had decided to talk like this,
PSA.73.15	I would have let your people down.
PSA.73.16	I tried to understand all this,
PSA.73.16	but it was too hard for me to see
PSA.73.17	until I went to the Temple of God.
PSA.73.17	Then I understood what will happen to them.
PSA.73.18	You have put them in danger;
PSA.73.18	you cause them to be destroyed.
PSA.73.19	They are destroyed in a moment;
PSA.73.19	they are swept away by terrors.
PSA.73.20	It will be like waking from a dream.
PSA.73.20	Lord, when you rise up, they will disappear.
PSA.73.21	When my heart was sad
PSA.73.21	and I was angry,
PSA.73.22	I was senseless and stupid.
PSA.73.22	I acted like an animal toward you.
PSA.73.23	But I am always with you;
PSA.73.23	you have held my hand.
PSA.73.24	You guide me with your advice,
PSA.73.24	and later you will receive me in honor.
PSA.73.25	I have no one in heaven but you;
PSA.73.25	I want nothing on earth besides you.
PSA.73.26	My body and my mind may become weak,
PSA.73.26	but God is my strength.
PSA.73.26	He is mine forever.
PSA.73.27	Those who are far from God will die;
PSA.73.27	you destroy those who are unfaithful.
PSA.73.28	But I am close to God, and that is good.
PSA.73.28	The Lord G
PSA.73.28	I will tell all that you have done.
PSA.74.1	God, why have you rejected us for so long?
PSA.74.1	Why are you angry with us, the sheep of your pasture?
PSA.74.2	Remember the people you bought long ago.
PSA.74.2	You saved us, and we are your very own.
PSA.74.2	After all, you live on Mount Zion.
PSA.74.3	Make your way through these old ruins;
PSA.74.3	the enemy wrecked everything in the Temple.
PSA.74.4	Those who were against you shouted in your meeting place
PSA.74.4	and raised their flags there.
PSA.74.5	They came with axes raised
PSA.74.5	as if to cut down a forest of trees.
PSA.74.6	They smashed the carved panels
PSA.74.6	with their axes and hatchets.
PSA.74.7	They burned your Temple to the ground;
PSA.74.7	they have made the place where you live unclean.
PSA.74.8	They thought, “We will completely crush them!”
PSA.74.8	They burned every place where God was worshiped in the land.
PSA.74.9	We do not see any signs.
PSA.74.9	There are no more prophets,
PSA.74.9	and no one knows how long this will last.
PSA.74.10	God, how much longer will the enemy make fun of you?
PSA.74.10	Will they insult you forever?
PSA.74.11	Why do you hold back your power?
PSA.74.11	Bring your power out in the open and destroy them!
PSA.74.12	God, you have been our king for a long time.
PSA.74.12	You bring salvation to the earth.
PSA.74.13	You split open the sea by your power
PSA.74.13	and broke the heads of the sea monster.
PSA.74.14	You smashed the heads of the monster Leviathan
PSA.74.14	and gave it to the desert creatures as food.
PSA.74.15	You opened up the springs and streams
PSA.74.15	and made the flowing rivers run dry.
PSA.74.16	Both the day and the night are yours;
PSA.74.16	you made the sun and the moon.
PSA.74.17	You set all the limits on the earth;
PSA.74.17	you created summer and winter.
PSA.74.18	L
PSA.74.18	Remember how those foolish people made fun of you.
PSA.74.19	Do not give us, your doves, to those wild animals.
PSA.74.19	Never forget your poor people.
PSA.74.20	Remember the agreement you made with us,
PSA.74.20	because violence fills every dark corner of this land.
PSA.74.21	Do not let your suffering people be disgraced.
PSA.74.21	Let the poor and helpless praise you.
PSA.74.22	God, arise and defend yourself.
PSA.74.22	Remember the insults that come from those foolish people all day long.
PSA.74.23	Don’t forget what your enemies said;
PSA.74.23	don’t forget their roar as they rise against you always.
PSA.75.1	God, we thank you;
PSA.75.1	we thank you because you are near.
PSA.75.1	We tell about the miracles you do.
PSA.75.2	You say, “I set the time for trial,
PSA.75.2	and I will judge fairly.
PSA.75.3	The earth with all its people may shake,
PSA.75.3	but I am the one who holds it steady.
PSA.75.4	I say to those who are proud, ‘Don’t brag,’
PSA.75.4	and to the wicked, ‘Don’t show your power.
PSA.75.5	Don’t try to use your power against heaven.
PSA.75.5	Don’t be stubborn.’ ”
PSA.75.6	No one from the east or the west
PSA.75.6	or the desert can judge you.
PSA.75.7	God is the judge;
PSA.75.7	he judges one person as guilty and another as innocent.
PSA.75.8	The L
PSA.75.8	it is full of wine mixed with spices.
PSA.75.8	He pours it out even to the last drop,
PSA.75.8	and the wicked drink it all.
PSA.75.9	I will tell about this forever;
PSA.75.9	I will sing praise to the God of Jacob.
PSA.75.10	He will take all power away from the wicked,
PSA.75.10	but the power of good people will grow.
PSA.76.1	People in Judah know God;
PSA.76.1	his fame is great in Israel.
PSA.76.2	His Tent is in Jerusalem;
PSA.76.2	his home is on Mount Zion.
PSA.76.3	There God broke the flaming arrows,
PSA.76.3	the shields, the swords, and the weapons of war.
PSA.76.4	God, how wonderful you are!
PSA.76.4	You are more splendid than the hills full of animals.
PSA.76.5	The brave soldiers were stripped
PSA.76.5	as they lay asleep in death.
PSA.76.5	Not one warrior
PSA.76.5	had the strength to stop it.
PSA.76.6	God of Jacob, when you spoke strongly,
PSA.76.6	horses and riders fell dead.
PSA.76.7	You are feared;
PSA.76.7	no one can stand against you when you are angry.
PSA.76.8	From heaven you gave the decision,
PSA.76.8	and the earth was afraid and silent.
PSA.76.9	God, you stood up to judge
PSA.76.9	and to save the needy people of the earth.
PSA.76.10	People praise you for your anger against evil.
PSA.76.10	Those who live through your anger are stopped from doing more evil.
PSA.76.11	Make and keep your promises to the L
PSA.76.11	From all around, gifts should come to the God we worship.
PSA.76.12	God breaks the spirits of great leaders;
PSA.76.12	the kings on earth fear him.
PSA.77.1	I cry out to God;
PSA.77.1	I call to God, and he will hear me.
PSA.77.2	I look for the Lord on the day of trouble.
PSA.77.2	All night long I reach out my hands,
PSA.77.2	but I cannot be comforted.
PSA.77.3	When I remember God, I become upset;
PSA.77.3	when I think, I become afraid.
PSA.77.4	You keep my eyes from closing.
PSA.77.4	I am too upset to say anything.
PSA.77.5	I keep thinking about the old days,
PSA.77.5	the years of long ago.
PSA.77.6	At night I remember my songs.
PSA.77.6	I think and I ask myself:
PSA.77.7	“Will the Lord reject us forever?
PSA.77.7	Will he never be kind to us again?
PSA.77.8	Is his love gone forever?
PSA.77.8	Has he stopped speaking for all time?
PSA.77.9	Has God forgotten mercy?
PSA.77.9	Is he too angry to pity us?”
PSA.77.10	Then I say “This is what makes me sad:
PSA.77.10	For years the power of God Most High was with us.”
PSA.77.11	I remember what the L
PSA.77.11	I remember the miracles you did long ago.
PSA.77.12	I think about all the things you did
PSA.77.12	and consider your deeds.
PSA.77.13	God, your ways are holy.
PSA.77.13	No god is as great as our God.
PSA.77.14	You are the God who does miracles;
PSA.77.14	you have shown people your power.
PSA.77.15	By your power you have saved your people,
PSA.77.15	the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
PSA.77.16	God, the waters saw you;
PSA.77.16	they saw you and became afraid;
PSA.77.16	the deep waters shook with fear.
PSA.77.17	The clouds poured down their rain.
PSA.77.17	The sky thundered.
PSA.77.17	Your lightning flashed back and forth like arrows.
PSA.77.18	Your thunder sounded in the whirlwind.
PSA.77.18	Lightning lit up the world.
PSA.77.18	The earth trembled and shook.
PSA.77.19	You made a way through the sea
PSA.77.19	and paths through the deep waters,
PSA.77.19	but your footprints were not seen.
PSA.77.20	You led your people like a flock
PSA.77.20	by using Moses and Aaron.
PSA.78.1	My people, listen to my teaching;
PSA.78.1	listen to what I say.
PSA.78.2	I will speak using stories;
PSA.78.2	I will tell secret things from long ago.
PSA.78.3	We have heard them and known them
PSA.78.3	by what our ancestors have told us.
PSA.78.4	We will not keep them from our children;
PSA.78.4	we will tell those who come later
PSA.78.4	about the praises of the L
PSA.78.4	We will tell about his power
PSA.78.4	and the miracles he has done.
PSA.78.5	The L
PSA.78.5	and gave the teachings to Israel,
PSA.78.5	which he commanded our ancestors
PSA.78.5	to teach to their children.
PSA.78.6	Then their children would know them,
PSA.78.6	even their children not yet born.
PSA.78.6	And they would tell their children.
PSA.78.7	So they would all trust God
PSA.78.7	and would not forget what he had done
PSA.78.7	but would obey his commands.
PSA.78.8	They would not be like their ancestors
PSA.78.8	who were stubborn and disobedient.
PSA.78.8	Their hearts were not loyal to God,
PSA.78.8	and they were not true to him.
PSA.78.9	The men of Ephraim had bows for weapons,
PSA.78.9	but they ran away on the day of battle.
PSA.78.10	They didn’t keep their agreement with God
PSA.78.10	and refused to live by his teachings.
PSA.78.11	They forgot what he had done
PSA.78.11	and the miracles he had shown them.
PSA.78.12	He did miracles while their ancestors watched,
PSA.78.12	in the fields of Zoan in Egypt.
PSA.78.13	He divided the Red Sea and led them through.
PSA.78.13	He made the water stand up like a wall.
PSA.78.14	He led them with a cloud by day
PSA.78.14	and by the light of a fire by night.
PSA.78.15	He split the rocks in the desert
PSA.78.15	and gave them more than enough water, as if from the deep ocean.
PSA.78.16	He brought streams out of the rock
PSA.78.16	and caused water to flow down like rivers.
PSA.78.17	But the people continued to sin against him;
PSA.78.17	in the desert they turned against God Most High.
PSA.78.18	They decided to test God
PSA.78.18	by asking for the food they wanted.
PSA.78.19	Then they spoke against God,
PSA.78.19	saying, “Can God prepare food in the desert?
PSA.78.20	When he hit the rock, water poured out
PSA.78.20	and rivers flowed down.
PSA.78.20	But can he give us bread also?
PSA.78.20	Will he provide his people with meat?”
PSA.78.21	When the L
PSA.78.21	His anger was like fire to the people of Jacob;
PSA.78.21	his anger grew against the people of Israel.
PSA.78.22	They had not believed God
PSA.78.22	and had not trusted him to save them.
PSA.78.23	But he gave a command to the clouds above
PSA.78.23	and opened the doors of heaven.
PSA.78.24	He rained manna down on them to eat;
PSA.78.24	he gave them grain from heaven.
PSA.78.25	So they ate the bread of angels.
PSA.78.25	He sent them all the food they could eat.
PSA.78.26	He sent the east wind from heaven
PSA.78.26	and led the south wind by his power.
PSA.78.27	He rained meat on them like dust.
PSA.78.27	The birds were as many as the sand of the sea.
PSA.78.28	He made the birds fall inside the camp,
PSA.78.28	all around the tents.
PSA.78.29	So the people ate and became very full.
PSA.78.29	God had given them what they wanted.
PSA.78.30	While they were still eating,
PSA.78.30	and while the food was still in their mouths,
PSA.78.31	God became angry with them.
PSA.78.31	He killed some of the healthiest of them;
PSA.78.31	he struck down the best young men of Israel.
PSA.78.32	But they kept on sinning;
PSA.78.32	they did not believe even with the miracles.
PSA.78.33	So he ended their days without meaning
PSA.78.33	and their years in terror.
PSA.78.34	Anytime he killed them, they would look to him for help;
PSA.78.34	they would come back to God and follow him.
PSA.78.35	They would remember that God was their Rock,
PSA.78.35	that God Most High had saved them.
PSA.78.36	But their words were false,
PSA.78.36	and their tongues lied to him.
PSA.78.37	Their hearts were not really loyal to God;
PSA.78.37	they did not keep his agreement.
PSA.78.38	Still God was merciful.
PSA.78.38	He forgave their sins
PSA.78.38	and did not destroy them.
PSA.78.38	Many times he held back his anger
PSA.78.38	and did not stir up all his anger.
PSA.78.39	He remembered that they were only human,
PSA.78.39	like a wind that blows and does not come back.
PSA.78.40	They turned against God so often in the desert
PSA.78.40	and grieved him there.
PSA.78.41	Again and again they tested God
PSA.78.41	and brought pain to the Holy One of Israel.
PSA.78.42	They did not remember his power
PSA.78.42	or the time he saved them from the enemy.
PSA.78.43	They forgot the signs he did in Egypt
PSA.78.43	and his wonders in the fields of Zoan.
PSA.78.44	He turned their rivers to blood
PSA.78.44	so no one could drink the water.
PSA.78.45	He sent flies that bit the people.
PSA.78.45	He sent frogs that destroyed them.
PSA.78.46	He gave their crops to grasshoppers
PSA.78.46	and what they worked for to locusts.
PSA.78.47	He destroyed their vines with hail
PSA.78.47	and their sycamore trees with sleet.
PSA.78.48	He killed their animals with hail
PSA.78.48	and their cattle with lightning.
PSA.78.49	He showed them his hot anger.
PSA.78.49	He sent his strong anger against them,
PSA.78.49	his destroying angels.
PSA.78.50	He found a way to show his anger.
PSA.78.50	He did not keep them from dying
PSA.78.50	but let them die by a terrible disease.
PSA.78.51	God killed all the firstborn sons in Egypt,
PSA.78.51	the oldest son of each family of Ham.
PSA.78.52	But God led his people out like sheep
PSA.78.52	and he guided them like a flock through the desert.
PSA.78.53	He led them to safety so they had nothing to fear,
PSA.78.53	but their enemies drowned in the sea.
PSA.78.54	So God brought them to his holy land,
PSA.78.54	to the mountain country he took with his own power.
PSA.78.55	He forced out the other nations,
PSA.78.55	and he had his people inherit the land.
PSA.78.55	He let the tribes of Israel settle there in tents.
PSA.78.56	But they tested God
PSA.78.56	and turned against God Most High;
PSA.78.56	they did not keep his rules.
PSA.78.57	They turned away and were disloyal just like their ancestors.
PSA.78.57	They were like a crooked bow that does not shoot straight.
PSA.78.58	They made God angry by building places to worship gods;
PSA.78.58	they made him jealous with their idols.
PSA.78.59	When God heard them, he became very angry
PSA.78.59	and rejected the people of Israel completely.
PSA.78.60	He left his dwelling at Shiloh,
PSA.78.60	the Tent where he lived among the people.
PSA.78.61	He let the Ark, his power, be captured;
PSA.78.61	he let the Ark, his glory, be taken by enemies.
PSA.78.62	He let his people be killed;
PSA.78.62	he was very angry with his children.
PSA.78.63	The young men died by fire,
PSA.78.63	and the young women had no one to marry.
PSA.78.64	Their priests fell by the sword,
PSA.78.64	but their widows were not allowed to cry.
PSA.78.65	Then the Lord got up as if he had been asleep;
PSA.78.65	he awoke like a man who had been drunk with wine.
PSA.78.66	He struck down his enemies
PSA.78.66	and disgraced them forever.
PSA.78.67	But God rejected the family of Joseph;
PSA.78.67	he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
PSA.78.68	Instead, he chose the tribe of Judah
PSA.78.68	and Mount Zion, which he loves.
PSA.78.69	And he built his Temple high like the mountains.
PSA.78.69	Like the earth, he built it to last forever.
PSA.78.70	He chose David to be his servant
PSA.78.70	and took him from the sheep pens.
PSA.78.71	He brought him from tending the sheep
PSA.78.71	so he could lead the flock, the people of Jacob,
PSA.78.71	his own people, the people of Israel.
PSA.78.72	And David led them with an innocent heart
PSA.78.72	and guided them with skillful hands.
PSA.79.1	God, nations have come against your chosen people.
PSA.79.1	They have ruined your holy Temple.
PSA.79.1	They have turned Jerusalem into ruins.
PSA.79.2	They have given the bodies of your servants as food to the wild birds.
PSA.79.2	They have given the bodies of those who worship you to the wild animals.
PSA.79.3	They have spilled blood like water all around Jerusalem.
PSA.79.3	No one was left to bury the dead.
PSA.79.4	We are a joke to the other nations;
PSA.79.4	they laugh and make fun of us.
PSA.79.5	L
PSA.79.5	Will you be angry forever?
PSA.79.5	How long will your jealousy burn like a fire?
PSA.79.6	Be angry with the nations that do not know you
PSA.79.6	and with the kingdoms that do not honor you.
PSA.79.7	They have gobbled up the people of Jacob
PSA.79.7	and destroyed their land.
PSA.79.8	Don’t punish us for our past sins.
PSA.79.8	Show your mercy to us soon,
PSA.79.8	because we are helpless!
PSA.79.9	God our Savior, help us
PSA.79.9	so people will praise you.
PSA.79.9	Save us and forgive our sins
PSA.79.9	so people will honor you.
PSA.79.10	Why should the nations say,
PSA.79.10	“Where is their God?”
PSA.79.10	Tell the other nations in our presence
PSA.79.10	that you punish those who kill your servants.
PSA.79.11	Hear the moans of the prisoners.
PSA.79.11	Use your great power
PSA.79.11	to save those sentenced to die.
PSA.79.12	Repay those around us seven times over
PSA.79.12	for their insults to you, Lord.
PSA.79.13	We are your people, the sheep of your flock.
PSA.79.13	We will thank you always;
PSA.79.13	forever and ever we will praise you.
PSA.80.1	Shepherd of Israel, listen to us.
PSA.80.1	You lead the people of Joseph like a flock.
PSA.80.1	You sit on your throne between the gold creatures with wings.
PSA.80.1	Show your greatness 
PSA.80.2	to the people of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh.
PSA.80.2	Use your strength,
PSA.80.2	and come to save us.
PSA.80.3	God, take us back.
PSA.80.3	Show us your kindness so we can be saved.
PSA.80.4	L
PSA.80.4	how long will you be angry
PSA.80.4	at the prayers of your people?
PSA.80.5	You have fed your people with tears;
PSA.80.5	you have made them drink many tears.
PSA.80.6	You made those around us fight over us,
PSA.80.6	and our enemies make fun of us.
PSA.80.7	God All-Powerful, take us back.
PSA.80.7	Show us your kindness so we can be saved.
PSA.80.8	You brought us out of Egypt as if we were a vine.
PSA.80.8	You forced out other nations and planted us in the land.
PSA.80.9	You cleared the ground for us.
PSA.80.9	Like a vine, we took root and filled the land.
PSA.80.10	We covered the mountains with our shade.
PSA.80.10	We had limbs like the mighty cedar tree.
PSA.80.11	Our branches reached the Mediterranean Sea,
PSA.80.11	and our shoots went to the Euphrates River.
PSA.80.12	So why did you pull down our walls?
PSA.80.12	Now everyone who passes by steals from us.
PSA.80.13	Like wild pigs they walk over us;
PSA.80.13	like wild animals they feed on us.
PSA.80.14	God All-Powerful, come back.
PSA.80.14	Look down from heaven and see.
PSA.80.14	Take care of us, your vine.
PSA.80.15	You planted this shoot with your own hands
PSA.80.15	and strengthened this child.
PSA.80.16	Now it is cut down and burned with fire;
PSA.80.16	you destroyed us by your angry looks.
PSA.80.17	With your hand,
PSA.80.17	strengthen the one you have chosen for yourself.
PSA.80.18	Then we will not turn away from you.
PSA.80.18	Give us life again, and we will call to you for help.
PSA.80.19	L
PSA.80.19	Show us your kindness so we can be saved.
PSA.81.1	Sing for joy to God, our strength;
PSA.81.1	shout out loud to the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.2	Begin the music. Play the tambourines.
PSA.81.2	Play pleasant music on the harps and lyres.
PSA.81.3	Blow the trumpet at the time of the New Moon,
PSA.81.3	when the moon is full, when our feast begins.
PSA.81.4	This is the law for Israel;
PSA.81.4	it is the command of the God of Jacob.
PSA.81.5	He gave this rule to the people of Joseph
PSA.81.5	when they went out of the land of Egypt.
PSA.81.5	I heard a language I did not know, saying:
PSA.81.6	“I took the load off their shoulders;
PSA.81.6	I let them put down their baskets.
PSA.81.7	When you were in trouble, you called, and I saved you.
PSA.81.7	I answered you with thunder.
PSA.81.7	I tested you at the waters of Meribah.
PSA.81.8	My people, listen. I am warning you.
PSA.81.8	Israel, please listen to me!
PSA.81.9	You must not have foreign gods;
PSA.81.9	you must not worship any false god.
PSA.81.10	I, the L
PSA.81.10	who brought you out of Egypt.

PSA.82.1	God is in charge of the great meeting;

PSA.82.2	He says, “How long will you defend evil people?
PSA.82.2	How long will you show greater kindness to the wicked?

PSA.89.19	I have raised up a young man from my people.
PSA.89.20	I have found my servant David;
PSA.89.20	I appointed him by pouring holy oil on him.
PSA.89.21	I will steady him with my hand
PSA.89.21	and strengthen him with my arm.
PSA.89.22	No enemy will make him give forced payments,
PSA.89.22	and wicked people will not defeat him.
PSA.89.23	I will crush his enemies in front of him;
PSA.89.23	I will defeat those who hate him.
PSA.89.24	My loyalty and love will be with him.
PSA.89.24	Through me he will be strong.
PSA.89.25	I will give him power over the sea
PSA.89.25	and control over the rivers.
PSA.89.26	He will say to me, ‘You are my father,
PSA.89.26	my God, the Rock, my Savior.’
PSA.89.27	I will make him my firstborn son,
PSA.89.27	the greatest king on earth.
PSA.89.28	My love will watch over him forever,
PSA.89.28	and my agreement with him will never end.
PSA.89.29	I will make his family continue,
PSA.89.29	and his kingdom will last as long as the skies.
PSA.89.30	“If his descendants reject my teachings
PSA.89.30	and do not follow my laws,
PSA.89.31	if they ignore my demands
PSA.89.31	and disobey my commands,
PSA.89.32	then I will punish their sins with a rod
PSA.89.32	and their wrongs with a whip.
PSA.89.33	But I will not hold back my love from David,
PSA.89.33	nor will I stop being loyal.
PSA.89.34	I will not break my agreement
PSA.89.34	nor change what I have said.
PSA.89.35	I have promised by my holiness,
PSA.89.35	I will not lie to David.
PSA.89.36	His family will go on forever.
PSA.89.36	His kingdom will last before me like the sun.
PSA.89.37	It will continue forever, like the moon,
PSA.89.37	like a dependable witness in the sky.”
PSA.89.38	But now you have refused and rejected your appointed king.
PSA.89.38	You have been angry with him.
PSA.89.39	You have abandoned the agreement with your servant
PSA.89.39	and thrown his crown to the ground.
PSA.89.40	You have torn down all his city walls;
PSA.89.40	you have turned his strong cities into ruins.
PSA.89.41	Everyone who passes by steals from him.
PSA.89.41	His neighbors insult him.
PSA.89.42	You have given strength to his enemies
PSA.89.42	and have made them all happy.
PSA.89.43	You have made his sword useless;
PSA.89.43	you did not help him stand in battle.
PSA.89.44	You have kept him from winning
PSA.89.44	and have thrown his throne to the ground.
PSA.89.45	You have cut his life short
PSA.89.45	and covered him with shame.
PSA.89.46	L
PSA.89.46	Will you ignore us forever?
PSA.89.46	How long will your anger burn like a fire?
PSA.89.47	Remember how short my life is.
PSA.89.47	Why did you create us? For nothing?
PSA.89.48	What person alive will not die?
PSA.89.48	Who can escape the grave?
PSA.89.49	Lord, where is your love from times past,
PSA.89.49	which in your loyalty you promised to David?
PSA.89.50	Lord, remember how they insulted your servant;
PSA.89.50	remember how I have suffered the insults of the nations.
PSA.89.51	L
PSA.89.51	and how they insulted your appointed king wherever he went.

PSA.90.3	You say, “Go back into dust, human beings.”
PSA.90.4	To you, a thousand years
PSA.90.4	is like the passing of a day,
PSA.90.4	or like a few hours in the night.
PSA.90.5	While people sleep, you take their lives.

PSA.90.10	They pass quickly, and then we are gone.
PSA.90.11	Who knows the full power of your anger?
PSA.90.11	Your anger is as great as our fear of you should be.

PSA.104.7	When you thundered your orders, it hurried away.
PSA.104.8	The mountains rose; the valleys sank.
PSA.104.8	The water went to the places you made for it.
PSA.104.9	You set borders for the seas that they cannot cross,
PSA.104.9	so water will never cover the earth again.
PSA.104.10	You make springs pour into the ravines;
PSA.104.10	they flow between the mountains.
PSA.104.11	They water all the wild animals;
PSA.104.11	the wild donkeys come there to drink.
PSA.104.12	Wild birds make nests by the water;

PSA.104.13	You water the mountains from above.

PSA.104.21	The lions roar as they attack.
PSA.104.21	They look to God for food.
PSA.104.22	When the sun rises, they leave

PSA.104.24	L
PSA.104.24	with your wisdom you made them all.
PSA.104.24	The earth is full of your riches.

PSA.104.26	Ships travel over the ocean,

PSA.105.16	God ordered a time of hunger in the land,
PSA.105.16	and he destroyed all the food.
PSA.105.17	Then he sent a man ahead of them—
PSA.105.17	Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
PSA.105.18	They put chains around his feet
PSA.105.18	and an iron ring around his neck.
PSA.105.19	Then the time he had spoken of came,

PSA.105.20	The king of Egypt sent for Joseph and freed him;
PSA.105.20	the ruler of the people set him free.
PSA.105.21	He made him the master of his house;
PSA.105.21	Joseph was in charge of his riches.
PSA.105.22	He could order the princes as he wished.
PSA.105.22	He taught the older men to be wise.
PSA.105.23	Then his father Israel came to Egypt;
PSA.105.23	Jacob lived in Egypt.
PSA.105.24	The L
PSA.105.24	and he made them stronger than their enemies.
PSA.105.25	He caused the Egyptians to hate his people
PSA.105.25	and to make plans against his servants.
PSA.105.26	Then he sent his servant Moses,
PSA.105.26	and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
PSA.105.27	They did many signs among the Egyptians
PSA.105.27	and worked wonders in Egypt.
PSA.105.28	The L
PSA.105.28	but the Egyptians turned against what he said.
PSA.105.29	So he changed their water into blood
PSA.105.29	and made their fish die.
PSA.105.30	Then their country was filled with frogs,
PSA.105.30	even in the bedrooms of their rulers.
PSA.105.31	The L
PSA.105.31	and gnats were everywhere in the country.
PSA.105.32	He made hail fall like rain
PSA.105.32	and sent lightning through their land.
PSA.105.33	He struck down their grapevines and fig trees,
PSA.105.33	and he destroyed every tree in the country.
PSA.105.34	He spoke and grasshoppers came;
PSA.105.34	the locusts were too many to count.
PSA.105.35	They ate all the plants in the land
PSA.105.35	and everything the earth produced.
PSA.105.36	The L
PSA.105.36	the oldest son of each family.
PSA.105.37	Then he brought his people out,
PSA.105.37	and they carried with them silver and gold.
PSA.105.37	Not one of his people stumbled.
PSA.105.38	The Egyptians were glad when they left,
PSA.105.38	because the Egyptians were afraid of them.
PSA.105.39	The L
PSA.105.39	and lit up the night with fire.
PSA.105.40	When they asked, he brought them quail
PSA.105.40	and filled them with bread from heaven.
PSA.105.41	God split the rock, and water flowed out;
PSA.105.41	it ran like a river through the desert.
PSA.105.42	He remembered his holy promise
PSA.105.42	to his servant Abraham.
PSA.105.43	So God brought his people out with joy,
PSA.105.43	his chosen ones with singing.
PSA.105.44	He gave them lands of other nations,
PSA.105.44	so they received what others had worked for.
PSA.105.45	This was so they would keep his orders
PSA.105.45	and obey his teachings.
PSA.105.45	Praise the L
PSA.106.1	Praise the L
PSA.106.1	Thank the L
PSA.106.1	His love continues forever.
PSA.106.2	No one can tell all the mighty things the L
PSA.106.2	no one can speak all his praise.
PSA.106.3	Happy are those who do right,
PSA.106.3	who do what is fair at all times.
PSA.106.4	L
PSA.106.4	help me when you save them.
PSA.106.5	Let me see the good things you do for your chosen people.
PSA.106.5	Let me be happy along with your happy nation;
PSA.106.5	let me join your own people in praising you.
PSA.106.6	We have sinned just as our ancestors did.
PSA.106.6	We have done wrong; we have done evil.
PSA.106.7	Our ancestors in Egypt
PSA.106.7	did not learn from your miracles.
PSA.106.7	They did not remember all your kindnesses,
PSA.106.7	so they turned against you at the Red Sea.
PSA.106.8	But the L
PSA.106.8	to show his great power.
PSA.106.9	He commanded the Red Sea, and it dried up.
PSA.106.9	He led them through the deep sea as if it were a desert.
PSA.106.10	He saved them from those who hated them.
PSA.106.10	He saved them from their enemies,
PSA.106.11	and the water covered their foes.
PSA.106.11	Not one of them escaped.
PSA.106.12	Then the people believed what the L
PSA.106.12	and they sang praises to him.
PSA.106.13	But they quickly forgot what he had done;
PSA.106.13	they did not wait for his advice.
PSA.106.14	They became greedy for food in the desert,
PSA.106.14	and they tested God there.
PSA.106.15	So he gave them what they wanted,
PSA.106.15	but he also sent a terrible disease among them.
PSA.106.16	The people in the camp were jealous of Moses
PSA.106.16	and of Aaron, the holy priest of the L
PSA.106.17	Then the ground opened up and swallowed Dathan
PSA.106.17	and closed over Abiram’s group.
PSA.106.18	A fire burned among their followers,
PSA.106.18	and flames burned up the wicked.
PSA.106.19	The people made a gold calf at Mount Sinai
PSA.106.19	and worshiped a metal statue.
PSA.106.20	They exchanged their glorious God
PSA.106.20	for a statue of a bull that eats grass.
PSA.106.21	They forgot the God who saved them,
PSA.106.21	who had done great things in Egypt,
PSA.106.22	who had done miracles in Egypt
PSA.106.22	and amazing things by the Red Sea.
PSA.106.23	So God said he would destroy them.
PSA.106.23	But Moses, his chosen one, stood before him
PSA.106.23	and stopped God’s anger from destroying them.
PSA.106.24	Then they refused to go into the beautiful land of Canaan;
PSA.106.24	they did not believe what God promised.
PSA.106.25	They grumbled in their tents
PSA.106.25	and did not obey the L
PSA.106.26	So he swore to them
PSA.106.26	that they would die in the desert.
PSA.106.27	He said their children would be killed by other nations
PSA.106.27	and that they would be scattered among other countries.
PSA.106.28	They joined in worshiping Baal at Peor
PSA.106.28	and ate meat that had been sacrificed to lifeless statues.
PSA.106.29	They made the L
PSA.106.29	so many people became sick with a terrible disease.
PSA.106.30	But Phinehas prayed to the L
PSA.106.30	and the disease stopped.
PSA.106.31	Phinehas did what was right,
PSA.106.31	and it will be remembered from now on.
PSA.106.32	The people also made the L
PSA.106.32	and Moses was in trouble because of them.
PSA.106.33	The people turned against the Spirit of God,
PSA.106.33	so Moses spoke without stopping to think.
PSA.106.34	The people did not destroy the other nations
PSA.106.34	as the L
PSA.106.35	Instead, they mixed with the other nations
PSA.106.35	and learned their customs.
PSA.106.36	They worshiped other nations’ idols
PSA.106.36	and were trapped by them.
PSA.106.37	They even killed their sons and daughters
PSA.106.37	as sacrifices to demons.
PSA.106.38	They killed innocent people,
PSA.106.38	their own sons and daughters,
PSA.106.38	as sacrifices to the idols of Canaan.
PSA.106.38	So the land was made unholy by their blood.
PSA.106.39	The people became unholy by their sins;
PSA.106.39	they were unfaithful to God in what they did.
PSA.106.40	So the L
PSA.106.40	and hated his own children.
PSA.106.41	He handed them over to other nations
PSA.106.41	and let their enemies rule over them.
PSA.106.42	Their enemies were cruel to them
PSA.106.42	and kept them under their power.
PSA.106.43	The L
PSA.106.43	but they continued to turn against him.
PSA.106.43	So they became even more wicked.
PSA.106.44	But God saw their misery
PSA.106.44	when he heard their cry.
PSA.106.45	He remembered his agreement with them,
PSA.106.45	and he felt sorry for them because of his great love.
PSA.106.46	He caused them to be pitied
PSA.106.46	by those who held them captive.
PSA.106.47	L
PSA.106.47	and bring us back from other nations.
PSA.106.47	Then we will thank you
PSA.106.47	and will gladly praise you.
PSA.106.48	Praise the L
PSA.106.48	He always was and always will be.
PSA.106.48	Let all the people say, “Amen!”
PSA.106.48	Praise the L
PSA.107.1	Thank the L
PSA.107.1	His love continues forever.
PSA.107.2	That is what those whom the L
PSA.107.2	He has saved them from the enemy
PSA.107.3	and has gathered them from other lands,
PSA.107.3	from east and west, north and south.
PSA.107.4	Some people had wandered in the desert lands.
PSA.107.4	They found no city in which to live.
PSA.107.5	They were hungry and thirsty,
PSA.107.5	and they were discouraged.
PSA.107.6	In their misery they cried out to the L
PSA.107.6	and he saved them from their troubles.
PSA.107.7	He led them on a straight road
PSA.107.7	to a city where they could live.
PSA.107.8	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.8	and for the miracles he does for people.
PSA.107.9	He satisfies the thirsty
PSA.107.9	and fills up the hungry.
PSA.107.10	Some sat in gloom and darkness;
PSA.107.10	they were prisoners suffering in chains.
PSA.107.11	They had turned against the words of God
PSA.107.11	and had refused the advice of God Most High.
PSA.107.12	So he broke their pride by hard work.
PSA.107.12	They stumbled, and no one helped.
PSA.107.13	In their misery they cried out to the L
PSA.107.13	and he saved them from their troubles.
PSA.107.14	He brought them out of their gloom and darkness
PSA.107.14	and broke their chains.
PSA.107.15	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.15	and for the miracles he does for people.
PSA.107.16	He breaks down bronze gates
PSA.107.16	and cuts apart iron bars.
PSA.107.17	Some fools turned against God
PSA.107.17	and suffered for the evil they did.
PSA.107.18	They refused to eat anything,
PSA.107.18	so they almost died.
PSA.107.19	In their misery they cried out to the L
PSA.107.19	and he saved them from their troubles.
PSA.107.20	God gave the command and healed them,
PSA.107.20	so they were saved from dying.
PSA.107.21	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.21	and for the miracles he does for people.
PSA.107.22	Let them offer sacrifices to thank him.
PSA.107.22	With joy they should tell what he has done.
PSA.107.23	Others went out to sea in ships
PSA.107.23	and did business on the great oceans.
PSA.107.24	They saw what the L
PSA.107.24	the miracles he did in the deep oceans.
PSA.107.25	He spoke, and a storm came up,
PSA.107.25	which blew up high waves.
PSA.107.26	The ships were tossed as high as the sky and fell low to the depths.
PSA.107.26	The storm was so bad that they lost their courage.
PSA.107.27	They stumbled and fell like people who were drunk.
PSA.107.27	They did not know what to do.
PSA.107.28	In their misery they cried out to the L
PSA.107.28	and he saved them from their troubles.
PSA.107.29	He stilled the storm
PSA.107.29	and calmed the waves.
PSA.107.30	They were happy that it was quiet,
PSA.107.30	and God guided them to the port they wanted.
PSA.107.31	Let them give thanks to the L
PSA.107.31	and for the miracles he does for people.
PSA.107.32	Let them praise his greatness in the meeting of the people;
PSA.107.32	let them praise him in the meeting of the elders.
PSA.107.33	He changed rivers into a desert
PSA.107.33	and springs of water into dry ground.
PSA.107.34	He made fertile land salty,
PSA.107.34	because the people there did evil.
PSA.107.35	He changed the desert into pools of water
PSA.107.35	and dry ground into springs of water.
PSA.107.36	He had the hungry settle there
PSA.107.36	so they could build a city in which to live.
PSA.107.37	They planted seeds in the fields and vineyards,
PSA.107.37	and they had a good harvest.
PSA.107.38	God blessed them, and they grew in number.
PSA.107.38	Their cattle did not become fewer.
PSA.107.39	Because of disaster, troubles, and sadness,
PSA.107.39	their families grew smaller and weaker.
PSA.107.40	He showed he was displeased with their leaders
PSA.107.40	and made them wander in a pathless desert.
PSA.107.41	But he lifted the poor out of their suffering
PSA.107.41	and made their families grow like flocks of sheep.
PSA.107.42	Good people see this and are happy,
PSA.107.42	but the wicked say nothing.
PSA.107.43	Whoever is wise will remember these things
PSA.107.43	and will think about the love of the L
PSA.108.1	God, my heart is steady.
PSA.108.1	I will sing and praise you with all my being.
PSA.108.2	Wake up, harp and lyre!
PSA.108.2	I will wake up the dawn.
PSA.108.3	L
PSA.108.3	I will sing songs of praise about you to all the nations.
PSA.108.4	Your great love reaches to the skies,
PSA.108.4	your truth to the heavens.
PSA.108.5	God, you are supreme above the skies.
PSA.108.5	Let your glory be over all the earth.
PSA.108.6	Answer us and save us by your power
PSA.108.6	so the people you love will be rescued.
PSA.108.7	God has said from his Temple,
PSA.108.7	“When I win, I will divide Shechem
PSA.108.7	and measure off the Valley of Succoth.
PSA.108.8	Gilead and Manasseh are mine.
PSA.108.8	Ephraim is like my helmet.
PSA.108.8	Judah holds my royal scepter.
PSA.108.9	Moab is like my washbowl.
PSA.108.9	I throw my sandals at Edom.
PSA.108.9	I shout at Philistia.”
PSA.108.10	Who will bring me to the strong, walled city?
PSA.108.10	Who will lead me to Edom?
PSA.108.11	God, surely you have rejected us;
PSA.108.11	you do not go out with our armies.
PSA.108.12	Help us fight the enemy.
PSA.108.12	Human help is useless,
PSA.108.13	but we can win with God’s help.
PSA.108.13	He will defeat our enemies.
PSA.109.1	God, I praise you.
PSA.109.1	Do not be silent.
PSA.109.2	Wicked people and liars have spoken against me;
PSA.109.2	they have told lies about me.
PSA.109.3	They have said hateful things about me
PSA.109.3	and attack me for no reason.
PSA.109.4	They attacked me, even though I loved them
PSA.109.4	and prayed for them.
PSA.109.5	I was good to them, but they repay me with evil.
PSA.109.5	I loved them, but they hate me in return.
PSA.109.6	They say about me, “Have an evil person work against him,
PSA.109.6	and let an accuser stand against him.
PSA.109.7	When he is judged, let him be found guilty,
PSA.109.7	and let even his prayers show his guilt.
PSA.109.8	Let his life be cut short,
PSA.109.8	and let another man replace him as leader.
PSA.109.9	Let his children become orphans
PSA.109.9	and his wife a widow.
PSA.109.10	Make his children wander around, begging for food.
PSA.109.10	Let them be forced out of the ruins in which they live.
PSA.109.11	Let the people to whom he owes money take everything he owns,
PSA.109.11	and let strangers steal everything he has worked for.
PSA.109.12	Let no one show him love
PSA.109.12	or have mercy on his orphaned children.
PSA.109.13	Let all his descendants die
PSA.109.13	and be forgotten by those who live after him.
PSA.109.14	L
PSA.109.14	and don’t let the sins of his mother be wiped out.
PSA.109.15	L
PSA.109.15	Then make people forget about them completely.
PSA.109.16	“He did not remember to be loving.
PSA.109.16	He hurt the poor, the needy, and those who were sad
PSA.109.16	until they were nearly dead.
PSA.109.17	He loved to put curses on others,
PSA.109.17	so let those same curses fall on him.
PSA.109.17	He did not like to bless others,
PSA.109.17	so do not let good things happen to him.
PSA.109.18	He cursed others as often as he wore clothes.
PSA.109.18	Cursing others filled his body and his life,
PSA.109.18	like drinking water and using olive oil.
PSA.109.19	So let curses cover him like clothes
PSA.109.19	and wrap around him like a belt.”
PSA.109.20	May the L
PSA.109.20	to those who speak evil against me.
PSA.109.21	But you, Lord G
PSA.109.21	be kind to me so others will know you are good.
PSA.109.21	Because your love is good, save me.
PSA.109.22	I am poor and helpless
PSA.109.22	and very sad.
PSA.109.23	I am dying like an evening shadow;
PSA.109.23	I am shaken off like a locust.
PSA.109.24	My knees are weak from fasting,
PSA.109.24	and I have grown thin.
PSA.109.25	My enemies insult me;

PSA.109.29	Let those who accuse me be disgraced
PSA.109.29	and covered with shame like a coat.
PSA.109.30	I will thank the L
PSA.109.30	I will praise him in front of many people.

PSA.116.9	in the land of the living.
PSA.116.10	I believed, so I said,
PSA.116.10	“I am completely ruined.”
PSA.116.11	In my distress I said,
PSA.116.11	“All people are liars.”
PSA.116.12	What can I give the L
PSA.116.12	for all the good things he has given to me?
PSA.116.13	I will lift up the cup of salvation,
PSA.116.13	and I will pray to the L
PSA.116.14	I will give the L
PSA.116.14	in front of all his people.
PSA.116.15	The death of one that belongs to the L
PSA.116.15	is precious in his sight.
PSA.116.16	L
PSA.116.16	I am your servant and the son of your female servant.
PSA.116.16	You have freed me from my chains.

PSA.118.7	so I will see my enemies defeated.
PSA.118.8	It is better to trust the L
PSA.118.8	than to trust people.
PSA.118.9	It is better to trust the L
PSA.118.9	than to trust princes.

PSA.118.11	They surrounded me on every side,
PSA.118.11	but with the L

PSA.118.12	but they died as quickly as thorns burn.
PSA.118.12	By the L
PSA.118.13	They chased me until I was almost defeated,
PSA.118.13	but the L
PSA.118.14	The L
PSA.118.14	He has saved me.

PSA.120.3	How will he punish you?
PSA.120.4	He will punish you with the sharp arrows of a warrior
PSA.120.4	and with burning coals of wood.
PSA.120.5	How terrible it is for me to live in the land of Meshech,
PSA.120.5	to live among the people of Kedar.
PSA.120.6	I have lived too long
PSA.120.6	with people who hate peace.
PSA.120.7	When I talk peace,

PSA.122.1	I was happy when they said to me,
PSA.122.1	“Let’s go to the Temple of the L
PSA.122.2	Jerusalem, we are standing
PSA.122.2	at your gates.
PSA.122.3	Jerusalem is built as a city

PSA.122.6	Pray for peace in Jerusalem:
PSA.122.6	“May those who love her be safe.
PSA.122.7	May there be peace within her walls
PSA.122.7	and safety within her strong towers.”
PSA.122.8	To help my relatives and friends,

PSA.123.1	L
PSA.123.1	you who live in heaven.

PSA.124.3	When they were angry with us,
PSA.124.3	they would have swallowed us alive.
PSA.124.4	They would have been like a flood drowning us;
PSA.124.4	they would have poured over us like a river.
PSA.124.5	They would have swept us away like a mighty stream.
PSA.124.6	Praise the L
PSA.124.6	who did not let them chew us up.
PSA.124.7	We escaped like a bird
PSA.124.7	from the hunter’s trap.
PSA.124.7	The trap broke,
PSA.124.7	and we escaped.
PSA.124.8	Our help comes from the L

PSA.125.5	Let there be peace in Israel.
PSA.126.1	When the L
PSA.126.1	it seemed as if we were dreaming.
PSA.126.2	Then we were filled with laughter,
PSA.126.2	and we sang happy songs.
PSA.126.2	Then the other nations said,

PSA.129.1	They have treated me badly all my life.
PSA.129.1	(Let Israel repeat this.)
PSA.129.2	They have treated me badly all my life,

PRO.1.1	These are the wise words of Solomon son of David, king of Israel.
PRO.1.2	They teach wisdom and self-control;
PRO.1.2	they will help you understand wise words.
PRO.1.3	They will teach you how to be wise and self-controlled
PRO.1.3	and will teach you to do what is honest and fair and right.
PRO.1.4	They make the uneducated wise
PRO.1.4	and give knowledge and sense to the young.
PRO.1.5	Wise people can also listen and learn;
PRO.1.5	even they can find good advice in these words.
PRO.1.6	Then anyone can understand wise words and stories,
PRO.1.6	the words of the wise and their riddles.
PRO.1.7	Knowledge begins with respect for the L
PRO.1.7	but fools hate wisdom and discipline.
PRO.1.8	My child, listen to your father’s teaching
PRO.1.8	and do not forget your mother’s advice.
PRO.1.9	Their teaching will be like flowers in your hair
PRO.1.9	or a necklace around your neck.
PRO.1.10	My child, if sinners try to lead you into sin,
PRO.1.10	do not follow them.
PRO.1.11	They will say, “Come with us.
PRO.1.11	Let’s ambush and kill someone;
PRO.1.11	let’s attack some innocent people just for fun.
PRO.1.12	Let’s swallow them alive, as death does;
PRO.1.12	let’s swallow them whole, as the grave does.
PRO.1.13	We will take all kinds of valuable things
PRO.1.13	and fill our houses with stolen goods.
PRO.1.14	Come join us,
PRO.1.14	and we will share with you stolen goods.”
PRO.1.15	My child, do not go along with them;
PRO.1.15	do not do what they do.
PRO.1.16	They are eager to do evil
PRO.1.16	and are quick to kill.
PRO.1.17	It is useless to spread out a net
PRO.1.17	right where the birds can see it.
PRO.1.18	But sinners will fall into their own traps;
PRO.1.18	they will only catch themselves!
PRO.1.19	All greedy people end up this way;
PRO.1.19	greed kills selfish people.
PRO.1.20	Wisdom is like a woman shouting in the street;
PRO.1.20	she raises her voice in the city squares.
PRO.1.21	She cries out in the noisy street
PRO.1.21	and shouts at the city gates:
PRO.1.22	“You fools, how long will you be foolish?
PRO.1.22	How long will you make fun of wisdom
PRO.1.22	and hate knowledge?
PRO.1.23	If only you had listened when I corrected you,
PRO.1.23	I would have told you what’s in my heart;
PRO.1.23	I would have told you what I am thinking.
PRO.1.24	I called, but you refused to listen;
PRO.1.24	I held out my hand, but you paid no attention.
PRO.1.25	You did not follow my advice
PRO.1.25	and did not listen when I corrected you.
PRO.1.26	So I will laugh when you are in trouble.
PRO.1.26	I will make fun when disaster strikes you,
PRO.1.27	when disaster comes over you like a storm,
PRO.1.27	when trouble strikes you like a whirlwind,
PRO.1.27	when pain and trouble overwhelm you.
PRO.1.28	“Then you will call to me,
PRO.1.28	but I will not answer.
PRO.1.28	You will look for me,
PRO.1.28	but you will not find me.
PRO.1.29	It is because you rejected knowledge
PRO.1.29	and did not choose to respect the L
PRO.1.30	You did not accept my advice,
PRO.1.30	and you rejected my correction.
PRO.1.31	So you will get what you deserve;
PRO.1.31	you will get what you planned for others.
PRO.1.32	Fools will die because they refuse to listen;
PRO.1.32	they will be destroyed because they do not care.
PRO.1.33	But those who listen to me will live in safety
PRO.1.33	and be at peace, without fear of injury.”
PRO.2.1	My child, listen to what I say
PRO.2.1	and remember what I command you.
PRO.2.2	Listen carefully to wisdom;
PRO.2.2	set your mind on understanding.
PRO.2.3	Cry out for wisdom,
PRO.2.3	and beg for understanding.
PRO.2.4	Search for it like silver,
PRO.2.4	and hunt for it like hidden treasure.
PRO.2.5	Then you will understand respect for the L
PRO.2.5	and you will find that you know God.
PRO.2.6	Only the L
PRO.2.6	he gives knowledge and understanding.
PRO.2.7	He stores up wisdom for those who are honest.
PRO.2.7	Like a shield he protects the innocent.
PRO.2.8	He makes sure that justice is done,
PRO.2.8	and he protects those who are loyal to him.
PRO.2.9	Then you will understand what is honest and fair
PRO.2.9	and what is the good and right thing to do.
PRO.2.10	Wisdom will come into your mind,
PRO.2.10	and knowledge will be pleasing to you.
PRO.2.11	Good sense will protect you;
PRO.2.11	understanding will guard you.
PRO.2.12	It will keep you from the wicked,
PRO.2.12	from those whose words are bad,
PRO.2.13	who don’t do what is right
PRO.2.13	but what is evil.
PRO.2.14	They enjoy doing wrong
PRO.2.14	and are happy to do what is crooked and evil.
PRO.2.15	What they do is wrong,
PRO.2.15	and their ways are dishonest.
PRO.2.16	It will save you from the unfaithful wife
PRO.2.16	who tries to lead you into adultery with pleasing words.
PRO.2.17	She leaves the husband she married when she was young.
PRO.2.17	She ignores the promise she made before God.
PRO.2.18	Her house is on the way to death;
PRO.2.18	those who took that path are now all dead.
PRO.2.19	No one who goes to her comes back
PRO.2.19	or walks the path of life again.
PRO.2.20	But wisdom will help you be good
PRO.2.20	and do what is right.
PRO.2.21	Those who are honest will live in the land,
PRO.2.21	and those who are innocent will remain in it.
PRO.2.22	But the wicked will be removed from the land,
PRO.2.22	and the unfaithful will be thrown out of it.
PRO.3.1	My child, do not forget my teaching,
PRO.3.1	but keep my commands in mind.
PRO.3.2	Then you will live a long time,
PRO.3.2	and your life will be successful.
PRO.3.3	Don’t ever forget kindness and truth.
PRO.3.3	Wear them like a necklace.
PRO.3.3	Write them on your heart as if on a tablet.
PRO.3.4	Then you will be respected
PRO.3.4	and will please both God and people.
PRO.3.5	Trust the L
PRO.3.5	and don’t depend on your own understanding.
PRO.3.6	Remember the L
PRO.3.6	and he will give you success.

PRO.3.9	and the firstfruits from all your crops.
PRO.3.10	Then your barns will be full,
PRO.3.10	and your wine barrels will overflow with new wine.
PRO.3.11	My child, do not reject the L
PRO.3.11	and don’t get angry when he corrects you.
PRO.3.12	The L
PRO.3.12	just as parents correct the child they delight in.
PRO.3.13	Happy is the person who finds wisdom,
PRO.3.13	the one who gets understanding.
PRO.3.14	Wisdom is worth more than silver;
PRO.3.14	it brings more profit than gold.
PRO.3.15	Wisdom is more precious than rubies;
PRO.3.15	nothing you could want is equal to it.
PRO.3.16	With her right hand wisdom offers you a long life,
PRO.3.16	and with her left hand she gives you riches and honor.
PRO.3.17	Wisdom will make your life pleasant
PRO.3.17	and will bring you peace.
PRO.3.18	As a tree produces fruit, wisdom gives life to those who use it,
PRO.3.18	and everyone who uses it will be happy.
PRO.3.19	The L
PRO.3.19	He set the sky in place, using his understanding.
PRO.3.20	With his knowledge, he made springs flow into rivers
PRO.3.20	and the clouds drop rain on the earth.
PRO.3.21	My child, hold on to wisdom and good sense.
PRO.3.21	Don’t let them out of your sight.
PRO.3.22	They will give you life
PRO.3.22	and beauty like a necklace around your neck.
PRO.3.23	Then you will go your way in safety,
PRO.3.23	and you will not get hurt.
PRO.3.24	When you lie down, you won’t be afraid;
PRO.3.24	when you lie down, you will sleep in peace.
PRO.3.25	You won’t be afraid of sudden trouble;
PRO.3.25	you won’t fear the ruin that comes to the wicked,

PRO.3.28	I will give it to you tomorrow.”
PRO.3.29	Don’t make plans to hurt your neighbor
PRO.3.29	who lives nearby and trusts you.
PRO.3.30	Don’t accuse a person for no good reason;
PRO.3.30	don’t accuse someone who has not harmed you.
PRO.3.31	Don’t be jealous of those who use violence,
PRO.3.31	and don’t choose to be like them.
PRO.3.32	The L
PRO.3.32	but he is a friend to those who are honest.
PRO.3.33	The L
PRO.3.33	but he will bless the home of those who do right.
PRO.3.34	The L
PRO.3.34	but he gives grace to those who are not proud.
PRO.3.35	Wise people will receive honor,
PRO.3.35	but fools will be disgraced.
PRO.4.1	My children, listen to your father’s teaching;
PRO.4.1	pay attention so you will understand.
PRO.4.2	What I am telling you is good,
PRO.4.2	so do not forget what I teach you.
PRO.4.3	When I was a young boy in my father’s house
PRO.4.3	and like an only child to my mother,
PRO.4.4	my father taught me and said,
PRO.4.4	“Hold on to my words with all your heart.
PRO.4.4	Keep my commands and you will live.
PRO.4.5	Get wisdom and understanding.
PRO.4.5	Don’t forget or ignore my words.
PRO.4.6	Hold on to wisdom, and it will take care of you.
PRO.4.6	Love it, and it will keep you safe.
PRO.4.7	Wisdom is the most important thing; so get wisdom.
PRO.4.7	If it costs everything you have, get understanding.
PRO.4.8	Treasure wisdom, and it will make you great;
PRO.4.8	hold on to it, and it will bring you honor.
PRO.4.9	It will be like flowers in your hair
PRO.4.9	and like a beautiful crown on your head.”
PRO.4.10	My child, listen and accept what I say.
PRO.4.10	Then you will have a long life.
PRO.4.11	I am guiding you in the way of wisdom,
PRO.4.11	and I am leading you on the right path.
PRO.4.12	Nothing will hold you back;
PRO.4.12	you will not be overwhelmed.
PRO.4.13	Always remember what you have been taught,
PRO.4.13	and don’t let go of it.
PRO.4.13	Keep all that you have learned;
PRO.4.13	it is the most important thing in life.
PRO.4.14	Don’t follow the ways of the wicked;
PRO.4.14	don’t do what evil people do.
PRO.4.15	Avoid their ways, and don’t follow them.
PRO.4.15	Stay away from them and keep on going,
PRO.4.16	because they cannot sleep until they do evil.
PRO.4.16	They cannot rest until they harm someone.
PRO.4.17	They feast on wickedness and cruelty
PRO.4.17	as if they were eating bread and drinking wine.
PRO.4.18	The way of the good person is like the light of dawn,
PRO.4.18	growing brighter and brighter until full daylight.
PRO.4.19	But the wicked walk around in the dark;
PRO.4.19	they can’t even see what makes them stumble.
PRO.4.20	My child, pay attention to my words;
PRO.4.20	listen closely to what I say.
PRO.4.21	Don’t ever forget my words;
PRO.4.21	keep them always in mind.
PRO.4.22	They are the key to life for those who find them;
PRO.4.22	they bring health to the whole body.
PRO.4.23	Be careful what you think,
PRO.4.23	because your thoughts run your life.
PRO.4.24	Don’t use your mouth to tell lies;
PRO.4.24	don’t ever say things that are not true.
PRO.4.25	Keep your eyes focused on what is right,
PRO.4.25	and look straight ahead to what is good.
PRO.4.26	Be careful what you do,
PRO.4.26	and always do what is right.
PRO.4.27	Don’t turn off the road of goodness;
PRO.4.27	keep away from evil paths.
PRO.5.1	My son, pay attention to my wisdom;
PRO.5.1	listen to my words of understanding.
PRO.5.2	Be careful to use good sense,
PRO.5.2	and watch what you say.
PRO.5.3	The words of another man’s wife may seem sweet as honey;
PRO.5.3	they may be as smooth as olive oil.
PRO.5.4	But in the end she will bring you sorrow,
PRO.5.4	causing you pain like a two-edged sword.
PRO.5.5	She is on the way to death;
PRO.5.5	her steps are headed straight to the grave.
PRO.5.6	She gives little thought to life.
PRO.5.6	She doesn’t even know that her ways are wrong.
PRO.5.7	Now, my sons, listen to me,
PRO.5.7	and don’t ignore what I say.
PRO.5.8	Stay away from such a woman.
PRO.5.8	Don’t even go near the door of her house,
PRO.5.9	or you will give your riches to others,
PRO.5.9	and the best years of your life will be given to someone cruel.
PRO.5.10	Strangers will enjoy your wealth,
PRO.5.10	and what you worked so hard for will go to someone else.
PRO.5.11	You will groan at the end of your life
PRO.5.11	when your health is gone.
PRO.5.12	Then you will say, “I hated being told what to do!
PRO.5.12	I would not listen to correction!
PRO.5.13	I would not listen to my teachers
PRO.5.13	or pay attention to my instructors.
PRO.5.14	I came close to being completely ruined
PRO.5.14	in front of a whole group of people.”
PRO.5.15	Be faithful to your own wife,
PRO.5.15	just as you drink water from your own well.
PRO.5.16	Don’t pour your water in the streets;
PRO.5.16	don’t give your love to just any woman.
PRO.5.17	These things are yours alone
PRO.5.17	and shouldn’t be shared with strangers.
PRO.5.18	Be happy with the wife you married when you were young.
PRO.5.18	She gives you joy, as your fountain gives you water.
PRO.5.19	She is as lovely and graceful as a deer.
PRO.5.19	Let her love always make you happy;
PRO.5.19	let her love always hold you captive.
PRO.5.20	My son, don’t be held captive by a woman who takes part in adultery.
PRO.5.20	Don’t fondle a woman who is not your wife.
PRO.5.21	The L
PRO.5.21	and he watches where you go.
PRO.5.22	An evil man will be caught in his wicked ways;
PRO.5.22	the ropes of his sins will tie him up.
PRO.5.23	He will die because he does not control himself,
PRO.5.23	and he will be held captive by his foolishness.
PRO.6.1	My child, be careful about giving a guarantee for somebody else’s loan,
PRO.6.1	about promising to pay what someone else owes.
PRO.6.2	You might get trapped by what you say;
PRO.6.2	you might be caught by your own words.
PRO.6.3	My child, if you have done this and are under your neighbor’s control,
PRO.6.3	here is how to get free.
PRO.6.3	Don’t be proud. Go to your neighbor
PRO.6.3	and beg to be free from your promise.
PRO.6.4	Don’t go to sleep
PRO.6.4	or even rest your eyes,
PRO.6.5	but free yourself like a deer running from a hunter,
PRO.6.5	like a bird flying away from a trapper.
PRO.6.6	Go watch the ants, you lazy person.
PRO.6.6	Watch what they do and be wise.
PRO.6.7	Ants have no commander,
PRO.6.7	no leader or ruler,
PRO.6.8	but they store up food in the summer
PRO.6.8	and gather their supplies at harvest.
PRO.6.9	How long will you lie there, you lazy person?
PRO.6.9	When will you get up from sleeping?
PRO.6.10	You sleep a little; you take a nap.
PRO.6.10	You fold your hands and lie down to rest.
PRO.6.11	So you will be as poor as if you had been robbed;
PRO.6.11	you will have as little as if you had been held up.
PRO.6.12	Some people are wicked and no good.
PRO.6.12	They go around telling lies,
PRO.6.13	winking with their eyes, tapping with their feet,
PRO.6.13	and making signs with their fingers.
PRO.6.14	They make evil plans in their hearts
PRO.6.14	and are always starting arguments.
PRO.6.15	So trouble will strike them in an instant;
PRO.6.15	suddenly they will be so hurt no one can help them.
PRO.6.16	There are six things the L
PRO.6.16	There are seven things he cannot stand:
PRO.6.17	a proud look,
PRO.6.17	a lying tongue,
PRO.6.17	hands that kill innocent people,
PRO.6.18	a mind that thinks up evil plans,
PRO.6.18	feet that are quick to do evil,
PRO.6.19	a witness who lies,
PRO.6.19	and someone who starts arguments among families.
PRO.6.20	My son, keep your father’s commands,
PRO.6.20	and don’t forget your mother’s teaching.
PRO.6.21	Keep their words in mind forever
PRO.6.21	as though you had them tied around your neck.
PRO.6.22	They will guide you when you walk.
PRO.6.22	They will guard you when you sleep.
PRO.6.22	They will speak to you when you are awake.
PRO.6.23	These commands are like a lamp;
PRO.6.23	this teaching is like a light.
PRO.6.23	And the correction that comes from them
PRO.6.23	will help you have life.
PRO.6.24	They will keep you from sinful women
PRO.6.24	and from the pleasing words of another man’s unfaithful wife.
PRO.6.25	Don’t desire her because she is beautiful.
PRO.6.25	Don’t let her capture you by the way she looks at you.
PRO.6.26	A prostitute will treat you like a loaf of bread,
PRO.6.26	and a woman who takes part in adultery may cost you your life.
PRO.6.27	You cannot carry hot coals against your chest
PRO.6.27	without burning your clothes,
PRO.6.28	and you cannot walk on hot coals
PRO.6.28	without burning your feet.
PRO.6.29	The same is true if you have sexual relations with another man’s wife.
PRO.6.29	Anyone who does so will be punished.
PRO.6.30	People don’t hate a thief
PRO.6.30	when he steals because he is hungry.
PRO.6.31	But if he is caught, he must pay back seven times what he stole,
PRO.6.31	and it may cost him everything he owns.
PRO.6.32	A man who takes part in adultery has no sense;
PRO.6.32	he will destroy himself.
PRO.6.33	He will be beaten up and disgraced,
PRO.6.33	and his shame will never go away.
PRO.6.34	Jealousy makes a husband very angry,
PRO.6.34	and he will have no pity when he gets revenge.
PRO.6.35	He will accept no payment for the wrong;
PRO.6.35	he will take no amount of money.
PRO.7.1	My son, remember what I say, and treasure my commands.
PRO.7.2	Obey my commands, and you will live.
PRO.7.2	Guard my teachings as you would your own eyes.
PRO.7.3	Remind yourself of them;
PRO.7.3	write them on your heart as if on a tablet.
PRO.7.4	Treat wisdom as a sister,
PRO.7.4	and make understanding your closest friend.
PRO.7.5	Wisdom and understanding will keep you away from adultery,
PRO.7.5	away from the unfaithful wife and her pleasing words.
PRO.7.6	Once while I was at the window of my house
PRO.7.6	I looked out through the shutters
PRO.7.7	and saw some foolish, young men.
PRO.7.7	I noticed one of them had no wisdom.
PRO.7.8	He was walking down the street near the corner
PRO.7.8	on the road leading to her house.
PRO.7.9	It was the twilight of the evening;
PRO.7.9	the darkness of the night was just beginning.
PRO.7.10	Then the woman approached him,
PRO.7.10	dressed like a prostitute
PRO.7.10	and planning to trick him.
PRO.7.11	She was loud and stubborn
PRO.7.11	and never stayed at home.
PRO.7.12	She was always out in the streets or in the city squares,
PRO.7.12	waiting around on the corners of the streets.
PRO.7.13	She grabbed him and kissed him.
PRO.7.13	Without shame she said to him,
PRO.7.14	“I made my fellowship offering and took some of the meat home.
PRO.7.14	Today I have kept my special promises.
PRO.7.15	So I have come out to meet you;
PRO.7.15	I have been looking for you and have found you.
PRO.7.16	I have covered my bed
PRO.7.16	with colored sheets from Egypt.
PRO.7.17	I have made my bed smell sweet
PRO.7.17	with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
PRO.7.18	Come, let’s make love until morning.
PRO.7.18	Let’s enjoy each other’s love.
PRO.7.19	My husband is not home;
PRO.7.19	he has gone on a long trip.
PRO.7.20	He took a lot of money with him
PRO.7.20	and won’t be home for weeks.”
PRO.7.21	By her clever words she made him give in;
PRO.7.21	by her pleasing words she led him into doing wrong.
PRO.7.22	All at once he followed her,
PRO.7.22	like an ox led to the butcher,
PRO.7.22	like a deer caught in a trap
PRO.7.23	and shot through the liver with an arrow.
PRO.7.23	Like a bird caught in a trap,
PRO.7.23	he didn’t know what he did would kill him.
PRO.7.24	Now, my sons, listen to me;
PRO.7.24	pay attention to what I say.
PRO.7.25	Don’t let yourself be tricked by such a woman;
PRO.7.25	don’t go where she leads you.
PRO.7.26	She has ruined many good men,
PRO.7.26	and many have died because of her.
PRO.7.27	Her house is on the road to death,
PRO.7.27	the road that leads down to the grave.
PRO.8.1	Wisdom calls to you like someone shouting;
PRO.8.1	understanding raises her voice.
PRO.8.2	On the hilltops along the road
PRO.8.2	and at the crossroads, she stands calling.
PRO.8.3	Beside the city gates,
PRO.8.3	at the entrances into the city, she calls out:
PRO.8.4	“Listen, everyone, I’m calling out to you;
PRO.8.4	I am shouting to all people.
PRO.8.5	You who are uneducated, seek wisdom.
PRO.8.5	You who are foolish, get understanding.
PRO.8.6	Listen, because I have important things to say,
PRO.8.6	and what I tell you is right.
PRO.8.7	What I say is true,
PRO.8.7	I refuse to speak evil.
PRO.8.8	Everything I say is honest;
PRO.8.8	nothing I say is crooked or false.
PRO.8.9	People with good sense know what I say is true;
PRO.8.9	and those with knowledge know my words are right.
PRO.8.10	Choose my teachings instead of silver,
PRO.8.10	and knowledge rather than the finest gold.
PRO.8.11	Wisdom is more precious than rubies.
PRO.8.11	Nothing you could want is equal to it.
PRO.8.12	“I am wisdom, and I have good judgment.
PRO.8.12	I also have knowledge and good sense.
PRO.8.13	If you respect the L
PRO.8.13	I hate pride and bragging,
PRO.8.13	evil ways and lies.
PRO.8.14	I have good sense and advice,
PRO.8.14	and I have understanding and power.
PRO.8.15	I help kings to govern
PRO.8.15	and rulers to make fair laws.
PRO.8.16	Princes use me to lead,
PRO.8.16	and so do all important people who judge fairly.
PRO.8.17	I love those who love me,
PRO.8.17	and those who seek me find me.
PRO.8.18	Riches and honor are mine to give.
PRO.8.18	So are wealth and lasting success.
PRO.8.19	What I give is better than the finest gold,
PRO.8.19	better than the purest silver.
PRO.8.20	I do what is right
PRO.8.20	and follow the path of justice.
PRO.8.21	I give wealth to those who love me,
PRO.8.21	filling their houses with treasures.
PRO.8.22	“I, wisdom, was with the L
PRO.8.22	long before he made anything else.
PRO.8.23	I was created in the very beginning,
PRO.8.23	even before the world began.
PRO.8.24	I was born before there were oceans,
PRO.8.24	or springs overflowing with water,
PRO.8.25	before the hills were there,
PRO.8.25	before the mountains were put in place.
PRO.8.26	God had not made the earth or fields,
PRO.8.26	not even the first dust of the earth.
PRO.8.27	I was there when God put the skies in place,
PRO.8.27	when he stretched the horizon over the oceans,
PRO.8.28	when he made the clouds above
PRO.8.28	and put the deep underground springs in place.
PRO.8.29	I was there when he ordered the sea
PRO.8.29	not to go beyond the borders he had set.
PRO.8.29	I was there when he laid the earth’s foundation.
PRO.8.30	I was like a child by his side.
PRO.8.30	I was delighted every day,
PRO.8.30	enjoying his presence all the time,
PRO.8.31	enjoying the whole world,
PRO.8.31	and delighted with all its people.
PRO.8.32	“Now, my children, listen to me,
PRO.8.32	because those who follow my ways are happy.
PRO.8.33	Listen to my teaching, and you will be wise;
PRO.8.33	do not ignore it.
PRO.8.34	Happy are those who listen to me,
PRO.8.34	watching at my door every day,
PRO.8.34	waiting at my open doorway.
PRO.8.35	Those who find me find life,
PRO.8.35	and the L
PRO.8.36	Those who do not find me hurt themselves.
PRO.8.36	Those who hate me love death.”
PRO.9.1	Wisdom has built her house;
PRO.9.1	she has made its seven columns.
PRO.9.2	She has prepared her food and wine;
PRO.9.2	she has set her table.
PRO.9.3	She has sent out her servant girls,
PRO.9.3	and she calls out from the highest place in the city.
PRO.9.4	She says to those who are uneducated,
PRO.9.4	“Come in here, you foolish people!
PRO.9.5	Come and eat my food
PRO.9.5	and drink the wine I have prepared.
PRO.9.6	Stop your foolish ways, and you will live;
PRO.9.6	take the road of understanding.
PRO.9.7	“If you correct someone who makes fun of wisdom, you will be insulted.
PRO.9.7	If you correct an evil person, you will get hurt.
PRO.9.8	Do not correct those who make fun of wisdom, or they will hate you.
PRO.9.8	But correct the wise, and they will love you.
PRO.9.9	Teach the wise, and they will become even wiser;
PRO.9.9	teach good people, and they will learn even more.
PRO.9.10	“Wisdom begins with respect for the L
PRO.9.10	and understanding begins with knowing the Holy One.
PRO.9.11	If you live wisely, you will live a long time;
PRO.9.11	wisdom will add years to your life.
PRO.9.12	The wise person is rewarded by wisdom,
PRO.9.12	but whoever makes fun of wisdom will suffer for it.”
PRO.9.13	Foolishness is like a loud woman;
PRO.9.13	she does not have wisdom or knowledge.
PRO.9.14	She sits at the door of her house
PRO.9.14	at the highest place in the city.
PRO.9.15	She calls out to those who are passing by,
PRO.9.15	who are going along, minding their own business.
PRO.9.16	She says to those who are uneducated,
PRO.9.16	“Come in here, you foolish people!
PRO.9.17	Stolen water is sweeter,
PRO.9.17	and food eaten in secret tastes better.”
PRO.9.18	But these people don’t know that everyone who goes there dies,
PRO.9.18	that her guests end up deep in the grave.
PRO.10.1	These are the wise words of Solomon:
PRO.10.1	Wise children make their father happy,
PRO.10.1	but foolish children make their mother sad.
PRO.10.2	Riches gotten by doing wrong have no value,
PRO.10.2	but right living will save you from death.
PRO.10.3	The L
PRO.10.3	but he keeps evil people from getting what they want.
PRO.10.4	A lazy person will end up poor,
PRO.10.4	but a hard worker will become rich.
PRO.10.5	Those who gather crops on time are wise,
PRO.10.5	but those who sleep through the harvest are a disgrace.
PRO.10.6	Good people will have rich blessings,
PRO.10.6	but the wicked will be overwhelmed by violence.
PRO.10.7	Good people will be remembered as a blessing,
PRO.10.7	but evil people will soon be forgotten.
PRO.10.8	The wise do what they are told,
PRO.10.8	but a talkative fool will be ruined.
PRO.10.9	The honest person will live in safety,
PRO.10.9	but the dishonest will be caught.
PRO.10.10	A wink may get you into trouble,
PRO.10.10	and foolish talk will lead to your ruin.
PRO.10.11	The words of a good person give life, like a fountain of water,
PRO.10.11	but the words of the wicked contain nothing but violence.
PRO.10.12	Hatred stirs up trouble,
PRO.10.12	but love forgives all wrongs.
PRO.10.13	Wise people speak with understanding,
PRO.10.13	but people without wisdom should be punished.
PRO.10.14	The wise don’t tell everything they know,
PRO.10.14	but the foolish talk too much and are ruined.
PRO.10.15	Having lots of money protects the rich,
PRO.10.15	but having no money destroys the poor.
PRO.10.16	Good people are rewarded with life,
PRO.10.16	but evil people are paid with punishment.
PRO.10.17	Whoever accepts correction is on the way to life,
PRO.10.17	but whoever ignores correction will lead others away from life.
PRO.10.18	Whoever hides hate is a liar.
PRO.10.18	Whoever tells lies is a fool.
PRO.10.19	If you talk a lot, you are sure to sin;
PRO.10.19	if you are wise, you will keep quiet.
PRO.10.20	The words of a good person are like pure silver,
PRO.10.20	but an evil person’s thoughts are worth very little.
PRO.10.21	Good people’s words will help many others,
PRO.10.21	but fools will die because they don’t have wisdom.
PRO.10.22	The L
PRO.10.22	and no sorrow comes with it.
PRO.10.23	A foolish person enjoys doing wrong,
PRO.10.23	but a person with understanding enjoys doing what is wise.
PRO.10.24	Evil people will get what they fear most,
PRO.10.24	but good people will get what they want most.
PRO.10.25	A storm will blow the evil person away,
PRO.10.25	but a good person will always be safe.
PRO.10.26	A lazy person affects the one he works for
PRO.10.26	like vinegar on the teeth or smoke in the eyes.
PRO.10.27	Whoever respects the L
PRO.10.27	but the life of an evil person will be cut short.
PRO.10.28	A good person can look forward to happiness,
PRO.10.28	but an evil person can expect nothing.
PRO.10.29	The L
PRO.10.29	but will ruin those who do evil.
PRO.10.30	Good people will always be safe,
PRO.10.30	but evil people will not remain in the land.
PRO.10.31	A good person says wise things,
PRO.10.31	but a liar’s tongue will be stopped.
PRO.10.32	Good people know the right thing to say,
PRO.10.32	but evil people only tell lies.
PRO.11.1	The L
PRO.11.1	but he is pleased with honest weights.
PRO.11.2	Pride leads only to shame;
PRO.11.2	it is wise to be humble.
PRO.11.3	Good people will be guided by honesty;
PRO.11.3	dishonesty will destroy those who are not trustworthy.
PRO.11.4	Riches will not help when it’s time to die,
PRO.11.4	but right living will save you from death.
PRO.11.5	The goodness of the innocent makes life easier,
PRO.11.5	but the wicked will be destroyed by their wickedness.
PRO.11.6	Doing right brings freedom to honest people,
PRO.11.6	but those who are not trustworthy will be caught by their own desires.
PRO.11.7	When the wicked die, hope dies with them;
PRO.11.7	their hope in riches will come to nothing.
PRO.11.8	The good person is saved from trouble;
PRO.11.8	it comes to the wicked instead.
PRO.11.9	With words an evil person can destroy a neighbor,
PRO.11.9	but a good person will escape by being resourceful.
PRO.11.10	When good people succeed, the city is happy.
PRO.11.10	When evil people die, there are shouts of joy.
PRO.11.11	Good people bless and build up their city,
PRO.11.11	but the wicked can destroy it with their words.
PRO.11.12	People without good sense find fault with their neighbors,
PRO.11.12	but those with understanding keep quiet.
PRO.11.13	Gossips can’t keep secrets,
PRO.11.13	but a trustworthy person can.
PRO.11.14	Without leadership a nation falls,
PRO.11.14	but lots of good advice will save it.
PRO.11.15	Whoever guarantees to pay somebody else’s loan will suffer.
PRO.11.15	It is safer to avoid such promises.
PRO.11.16	A kind woman gets respect,
PRO.11.16	but cruel men get only wealth.
PRO.11.17	Kind people do themselves a favor,
PRO.11.17	but cruel people bring trouble on themselves.
PRO.11.18	An evil person really earns nothing,
PRO.11.18	but a good person will surely be rewarded.
PRO.11.19	Those who are truly good will live,
PRO.11.19	but those who chase after evil will die.
PRO.11.20	The L
PRO.11.20	but is pleased with those who are innocent.
PRO.11.21	Evil people will certainly be punished,
PRO.11.21	but those who do right will be set free.
PRO.11.22	A beautiful woman without good sense
PRO.11.22	is like a gold ring in a pig’s snout.
PRO.11.23	Those who do right only wish for good,
PRO.11.23	but the wicked can expect to be defeated by God’s anger.
PRO.11.24	Some people give much but get back even more.
PRO.11.24	Others don’t give what they should and end up poor.
PRO.11.25	Whoever gives to others will get richer;
PRO.11.25	those who help others will themselves be helped.
PRO.11.26	People curse those who keep all the grain,
PRO.11.26	but they bless the one who is willing to sell it.
PRO.11.27	Whoever looks for good will find kindness,
PRO.11.27	but whoever looks for evil will find trouble.
PRO.11.28	Those who trust in riches will be ruined,

PRO.24.7	Foolish people cannot understand wisdom.
PRO.24.7	They have nothing to say in a discussion.
PRO.24.8	Whoever makes evil plans

PRO.24.15	Don’t be wicked and attack a good family’s house;
PRO.24.15	don’t rob the place where they live.
PRO.24.16	Even though good people may be bothered by trouble seven times, they are never defeated,
PRO.24.16	but the wicked are overwhelmed by trouble.
PRO.24.17	Don’t be happy when your enemy is defeated;
PRO.24.17	don’t be glad when he is overwhelmed.
PRO.24.18	The L
PRO.24.18	He may not be angry with them anymore.
PRO.24.19	Don’t envy evil people,

PRO.24.21	Don’t join those people who refuse to obey them.
PRO.24.22	The L
PRO.24.22	Those two can cause great disaster!
PRO.24.23	These are also sayings of the wise:
PRO.24.23	It is not good to take sides when you are the judge.
PRO.24.24	Don’t tell the wicked that they are innocent;
PRO.24.24	people will curse you, and nations will hate you.
PRO.24.25	But things will go well if you punish the guilty,
PRO.24.25	and you will receive rich blessings.
PRO.24.26	An honest answer is as pleasing
PRO.24.26	as a kiss on the lips.
PRO.24.27	First, finish your outside work
PRO.24.27	and prepare your fields.
PRO.24.27	After that, you can build your house.
PRO.24.28	Don’t testify against your neighbor for no good reason.
PRO.24.28	Don’t say things that are false.
PRO.24.29	Don’t say, “I’ll get even;
PRO.24.29	I’ll do to him what he did to me.”
PRO.24.30	I passed by a lazy person’s field
PRO.24.30	and by the vineyard of someone with no sense.
PRO.24.31	Thorns had grown up everywhere.
PRO.24.31	The ground was covered with weeds,
PRO.24.31	and the stone walls had fallen down.
PRO.24.32	I thought about what I had seen;
PRO.24.32	I learned this lesson from what I saw.
PRO.24.33	You sleep a little; you take a nap.
PRO.24.33	You fold your hands and lie down to rest.
PRO.24.34	Soon you will be as poor as if you had been robbed;
PRO.24.34	you will have as little as if you had been held up.
PRO.25.1	These are more wise sayings of Solomon, copied by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah.
PRO.25.2	God is honored for what he keeps secret.
PRO.25.2	Kings are honored for what they can discover.
PRO.25.3	No one can measure the height of the skies or the depth of the earth.
PRO.25.3	So also no one can understand the mind of a king.
PRO.25.4	Remove the scum from the silver,
PRO.25.4	so the silver can be used by the silversmith.
PRO.25.5	Remove wicked people from the king’s presence;
PRO.25.5	then his government will be honest and last a long time.
PRO.25.6	Don’t brag to the king
PRO.25.6	and act as if you are great.
PRO.25.7	It is better for him to give you a higher position
PRO.25.7	than to bring you down in front of the prince.
PRO.25.7	Because of something you have seen,
PRO.25.8	do not quickly take someone to court.
PRO.25.8	What will you do later
PRO.25.8	when your neighbor proves you wrong?
PRO.25.9	If you have an argument with your neighbor,
PRO.25.9	don’t tell other people what was said.
PRO.25.10	Whoever hears it might shame you,
PRO.25.10	and you might not ever be respected again.
PRO.25.11	The right word spoken at the right time
PRO.25.11	is as beautiful as gold apples in a silver bowl.
PRO.25.12	A wise warning to someone who will listen
PRO.25.12	is as valuable as gold earrings or fine gold jewelry.
PRO.25.13	Trustworthy messengers refresh those who send them,
PRO.25.13	like the coolness of snow in the summertime.
PRO.25.14	People who brag about gifts they never give
PRO.25.14	are like clouds and wind that give no rain.
PRO.25.15	With patience you can convince a ruler,
PRO.25.15	and a gentle word can get through to the hard-headed.
PRO.25.16	If you find honey, don’t eat too much,
PRO.25.16	or it will make you throw up.
PRO.25.17	Don’t go to your neighbor’s house too often;
PRO.25.17	too much of you will make him hate you.
PRO.25.18	When you lie about your neighbors,
PRO.25.18	it hurts them as much as a club, a sword, or a sharp arrow.
PRO.25.19	Trusting unfaithful people when you are in trouble
PRO.25.19	is like eating with a broken tooth or walking with a crippled foot.
PRO.25.20	Singing songs to someone who is sad
PRO.25.20	is like taking away his coat on a cold day
PRO.25.20	or pouring vinegar on soda.
PRO.25.21	If your enemy is hungry, feed him.
PRO.25.21	If he is thirsty, give him a drink.
PRO.25.22	Doing this will be like pouring burning coals on his head,
PRO.25.22	and the L
PRO.25.23	As the north wind brings rain,
PRO.25.23	telling gossip brings angry looks.
PRO.25.24	It is better to live in a corner on the roof
PRO.25.24	than inside the house with a quarreling wife.
PRO.25.25	Good news from a faraway place
PRO.25.25	is like a cool drink when you are tired.
PRO.25.26	A good person who gives in to evil
PRO.25.26	is like a muddy spring or a dirty well.
PRO.25.27	It is not good to eat too much honey,
PRO.25.27	nor does it bring you honor to brag about yourself.
PRO.25.28	Those who do not control themselves
PRO.25.28	are like a city whose walls are broken down.
PRO.26.1	It shouldn’t snow in summer or rain at harvest.
PRO.26.1	Neither should a foolish person ever be honored.
PRO.26.2	Curses will not harm someone who is innocent;
PRO.26.2	they are like sparrows or swallows that fly around and never land.
PRO.26.3	Whips are for horses, and harnesses are for donkeys,
PRO.26.3	so paddles are good for fools.
PRO.26.4	Don’t answer fools when they speak foolishly,
PRO.26.4	or you will be just like them.
PRO.26.5	Answer fools when they speak foolishly,
PRO.26.5	or they will think they are really wise.
PRO.26.6	Sending a message by a foolish person
PRO.26.6	is like cutting off your feet or drinking poison.
PRO.26.7	A wise saying spoken by a fool
PRO.26.7	is as useless as the legs of a crippled person.
PRO.26.8	Giving honor to a foolish person
PRO.26.8	is like tying a stone in a slingshot.
PRO.26.9	A wise saying spoken by a fool
PRO.26.9	is like a thorn stuck in the hand of a drunk.
PRO.26.10	Hiring a foolish person or anyone just passing by
PRO.26.10	is like an archer shooting at just anything.
PRO.26.11	A fool who repeats his foolishness
PRO.26.11	is like a dog that goes back to what it has thrown up.
PRO.26.12	There is more hope for a foolish person
PRO.26.12	than for those who think they are wise.
PRO.26.13	The lazy person says, “There’s a lion in the road!
PRO.26.13	There’s a lion in the streets!”
PRO.26.14	Like a door turning back and forth on its hinges,
PRO.26.14	the lazy person turns over and over in bed.
PRO.26.15	Lazy people may put their hands in the dish,
PRO.26.15	but they are too tired to lift the food to their mouths.
PRO.26.16	The lazy person thinks he is wiser
PRO.26.16	than seven people who give sensible answers.
PRO.26.17	Interfering in someone else’s quarrel as you pass by
PRO.26.17	is like grabbing a dog by the ears.
PRO.26.18	Like a madman shooting
PRO.26.18	deadly, burning arrows
PRO.26.19	is the one who tricks a neighbor
PRO.26.19	and then says, “I was just joking.”
PRO.26.20	Without wood, a fire will go out,
PRO.26.20	and without gossip, quarreling will stop.
PRO.26.21	Just as charcoal and wood keep a fire going,
PRO.26.21	a quarrelsome person keeps an argument going.
PRO.26.22	The words of a gossip are like tasty bits of food;
PRO.26.22	people like to gobble them up.
PRO.26.23	Kind words from a wicked mind
PRO.26.23	are like a shiny coating on a clay pot.
PRO.26.24	Those who hate you may try to fool you with their words,
PRO.26.24	but in their minds they are planning evil.
PRO.26.25	People’s words may be kind, but don’t believe them,
PRO.26.25	because their minds are full of evil thoughts.
PRO.26.26	Lies can hide hate,
PRO.26.26	but the evil will be plain to everyone.
PRO.26.27	Whoever digs a pit for others will fall into it.
PRO.26.27	Whoever tries to roll a boulder down on others will be crushed by it.
PRO.26.28	Liars hate the people they hurt,
PRO.26.28	and false praise can ruin others.
PRO.27.1	Don’t brag about tomorrow;
PRO.27.1	you don’t know what may happen then.
PRO.27.2	Don’t praise yourself. Let someone else do it.
PRO.27.2	Let the praise come from a stranger and not from your own mouth.
PRO.27.3	Stone is heavy, and sand is weighty,
PRO.27.3	but a complaining fool is worse than either.
PRO.27.4	Anger is cruel and destroys like a flood,
PRO.27.4	but no one can put up with jealousy!
PRO.27.5	It is better to correct someone openly
PRO.27.5	than to have love and not show it.
PRO.27.6	The slap of a friend can be trusted to help you,
PRO.27.6	but the kisses of an enemy are nothing but lies.
PRO.27.7	When you are full, not even honey tastes good,
PRO.27.7	but when you are hungry, even something bitter tastes sweet.
PRO.27.8	A person who leaves his home
PRO.27.8	is like a bird that leaves its nest.
PRO.27.9	The sweet smell of perfume and oils is pleasant,
PRO.27.9	and so is good advice from a friend.
PRO.27.10	Don’t forget your friend or your parent’s friend.
PRO.27.10	Don’t always go to your family for help when trouble comes.
PRO.27.10	A neighbor close by is better than a family far away.
PRO.27.11	Be wise, my child, and make me happy.
PRO.27.11	Then I can respond to any insult.
PRO.27.12	The wise see danger ahead and avoid it,
PRO.27.12	but fools keep going and get into trouble.
PRO.27.13	Take the coat of someone who promises to pay a stranger’s loan,
PRO.27.13	and keep it until he pays what the stranger owes.
PRO.27.14	If you loudly greet your neighbor early in the morning,
PRO.27.14	he will think of it as a curse.
PRO.27.15	A quarreling wife is as bothersome
PRO.27.15	as a continual dripping on a rainy day.
PRO.27.16	Stopping her is like stopping the wind
PRO.27.16	or trying to grab oil in your hand.
PRO.27.17	As iron sharpens iron,
PRO.27.17	so people can improve each other.
PRO.27.18	Whoever tends a fig tree gets to eat its fruit,
PRO.27.18	and whoever takes care of his master will receive honor.
PRO.27.19	As water reflects your face,
PRO.27.19	so your mind shows what kind of person you are.
PRO.27.20	People will never stop dying and being destroyed,
PRO.27.20	and they will never stop wanting more than they have.
PRO.27.21	A hot furnace tests silver and gold,
PRO.27.21	and people are tested by the praise they receive.
PRO.27.22	Even if you ground up a foolish person like grain in a bowl,
PRO.27.22	you couldn’t remove the foolishness.
PRO.27.23	Be sure you know how your sheep are doing,
PRO.27.23	and pay attention to the condition of your cattle.
PRO.27.24	Riches will not go on forever,
PRO.27.24	nor do governments go on forever.
PRO.27.25	Bring in the hay, and let the new grass appear.
PRO.27.25	Gather the grass from the hills.
PRO.27.26	Make clothes from the lambs’ wool,
PRO.27.26	and sell some goats to buy a field.
PRO.27.27	There will be plenty of goat’s milk
PRO.27.27	to feed you and your family
PRO.27.27	and to make your servant girls healthy.
PRO.28.1	Evil people run even though no one is chasing them,
PRO.28.1	but good people are as brave as a lion.
PRO.28.2	When a country is lawless, it has one ruler after another;
PRO.28.2	but when it is led by a leader with understanding and knowledge, it continues strong.
PRO.28.3	Rulers who mistreat the poor
PRO.28.3	are like a hard rain that destroys the crops.
PRO.28.4	Those who disobey what they have been taught praise the wicked,
PRO.28.4	but those who obey what they have been taught are against them.
PRO.28.5	Evil people do not understand justice,
PRO.28.5	but those who follow the L
PRO.28.6	It is better to be poor and innocent
PRO.28.6	than to be rich and wicked.
PRO.28.7	Children who obey what they have been taught are wise,
PRO.28.7	but friends of troublemakers disgrace their parents.
PRO.28.8	Some people get rich by overcharging others,
PRO.28.8	but their wealth will be given to those who are kind to the poor.
PRO.28.9	If you refuse to obey what you have been taught,
PRO.28.9	your prayers will not be heard.
PRO.28.10	Those who lead good people to do wrong
PRO.28.10	will be ruined by their own evil,
PRO.28.10	but the innocent will be rewarded with good things.
PRO.28.11	Rich people may think they are wise,
PRO.28.11	but the poor with understanding will prove them wrong.
PRO.28.12	When good people triumph, there is great happiness,
PRO.28.12	but when the wicked get control, everybody hides.
PRO.28.13	If you hide your sins, you will not succeed.
PRO.28.13	If you confess and reject them, you will receive mercy.
PRO.28.14	Those who are always respectful will be happy,
PRO.28.14	but those who are stubborn will get into trouble.
PRO.28.15	A wicked ruler is as dangerous to poor people
PRO.28.15	as a roaring lion or a charging bear.
PRO.28.16	A ruler without wisdom will be cruel,
PRO.28.16	but the one who refuses to take dishonest money will rule a long time.
PRO.28.17	Don’t help those who are guilty of murder;
PRO.28.17	let them run until they die.
PRO.28.18	Innocent people will be kept safe,
PRO.28.18	but those who are dishonest will suddenly be ruined.
PRO.28.19	Those who work their land will have plenty of food,
PRO.28.19	but the ones who chase empty dreams instead will end up poor.
PRO.28.20	A truthful person will have many blessings,
PRO.28.20	but those eager to get rich will be punished.
PRO.28.21	It is not good for a judge to take sides,
PRO.28.21	but some will sin for only a piece of bread.
PRO.28.22	Selfish people are in a hurry to get rich
PRO.28.22	and do not realize they soon will be poor.
PRO.28.23	Those who correct others will later be liked
PRO.28.23	more than those who give false praise.
PRO.28.24	Whoever robs father or mother
PRO.28.24	and says, “It’s not wrong,”
PRO.28.24	is just like someone who destroys things.
PRO.28.25	A greedy person causes trouble,
PRO.28.25	but the one who trusts the L
PRO.28.26	Those who trust in themselves are foolish,
PRO.28.26	but those who live wisely will be kept safe.
PRO.28.27	Whoever gives to the poor will have everything he needs,
PRO.28.27	but the one who ignores the poor will receive many curses.
PRO.28.28	When the wicked get control, everybody hides,
PRO.28.28	but when they die, good people do well.
PRO.29.1	Whoever is stubborn after being corrected many times
PRO.29.1	will suddenly be hurt beyond cure.
PRO.29.2	When good people do well, everyone is happy,
PRO.29.2	but when evil people rule, everyone groans.
PRO.29.3	Those who love wisdom make their parents happy,
PRO.29.3	but friends of prostitutes waste their money.
PRO.29.4	If a king is fair, he makes his country strong,
PRO.29.4	but if he takes gifts dishonestly, he tears his country down.
PRO.29.5	Those who give false praise to their neighbors
PRO.29.5	are setting a trap for them.
PRO.29.6	Evil people are trapped by their own sin,
PRO.29.6	but good people can sing and be happy.
PRO.29.7	Good people care about justice for the poor,
PRO.29.7	but the wicked are not concerned.
PRO.29.8	People who make fun of wisdom cause trouble in a city,
PRO.29.8	but wise people calm anger down.
PRO.29.9	When a wise person takes a foolish person to court,
PRO.29.9	the fool only shouts or laughs, and there is no peace.
PRO.29.10	Murderers hate an honest person
PRO.29.10	and try to kill those who do right.
PRO.29.11	Foolish people lose their tempers,
PRO.29.11	but wise people control theirs.
PRO.29.12	If a ruler pays attention to lies,
PRO.29.12	all his officers will become wicked.
PRO.29.13	The poor person and the cruel person are alike
PRO.29.13	in that the L
PRO.29.14	If a king judges poor people fairly,
PRO.29.14	his government will continue forever.
PRO.29.15	Correction and punishment make children wise,
PRO.29.15	but those left alone will disgrace their mother.
PRO.29.16	When there are many wicked people, there is much sin,
PRO.29.16	but those who do right will see them destroyed.
PRO.29.17	Correct your children, and you will be proud;
PRO.29.17	they will give you satisfaction.
PRO.29.18	Where there is no word from God, people are uncontrolled,
PRO.29.18	but those who obey what they have been taught are happy.
PRO.29.19	Words alone cannot correct a servant,
PRO.29.19	because even if they understand, they won’t respond.
PRO.29.20	Do you see people who speak too quickly?
PRO.29.20	There is more hope for a foolish person than for them.
PRO.29.21	If you spoil your servants when they are young,
PRO.29.21	they will bring you grief later on.
PRO.29.22	An angry person causes trouble;
PRO.29.22	a person with a quick temper sins a lot.
PRO.29.23	Pride will ruin people,
PRO.29.23	but those who are humble will be honored.
PRO.29.24	Partners of thieves are their own worst enemies.
PRO.29.24	If they have to testify in court, they are afraid to say anything.
PRO.29.25	Being afraid of people can get you into trouble,
PRO.29.25	but if you trust the L
PRO.29.26	Many people want to speak to a ruler,
PRO.29.26	but justice comes only from the L
PRO.29.27	Good people hate those who are dishonest,
PRO.29.27	and the wicked hate those who are honest.
PRO.30.1	These are the words of Agur son of Jakeh.
PRO.30.1	This is his message to Ithiel and Ucal:
PRO.30.2	“I am the most stupid person there is,
PRO.30.2	and I have no understanding.
PRO.30.3	I have not learned to be wise,
PRO.30.3	and I don’t know much about God, the Holy One.
PRO.30.4	Who has gone up to heaven and come back down?
PRO.30.4	Who can hold the wind in his hand?
PRO.30.4	Who can gather up the waters in his coat?
PRO.30.4	Who has set in place the ends of the earth?
PRO.30.4	What is his name or his son’s name?
PRO.30.4	Tell me, if you know!
PRO.30.5	“Every word of God is true.
PRO.30.5	He guards those who come to him for safety.
PRO.30.6	Do not add to his words,
PRO.30.6	or he will correct you and prove you are a liar.
PRO.30.7	“I ask two things from you, L
PRO.30.7	Don’t refuse me before I die.
PRO.30.8	Keep me from lying and being dishonest.
PRO.30.8	And don’t make me either rich or poor;
PRO.30.8	just give me enough food for each day.
PRO.30.9	If I have too much, I might reject you
PRO.30.9	and say, ‘I don’t know the L
PRO.30.9	If I am poor, I might steal
PRO.30.9	and disgrace the name of my God.
PRO.30.10	“Do not say bad things about servants to their masters,
PRO.30.10	or they will curse you, and you will suffer for it.
PRO.30.11	“Some people curse their fathers
PRO.30.11	and do not bless their mothers.
PRO.30.12	Some people think they are pure,
PRO.30.12	but they are not really free from evil.
PRO.30.13	Some people have such a proud look!
PRO.30.13	They look down on others.
PRO.30.14	Some people have teeth like swords;
PRO.30.14	their jaws seem full of knives.
PRO.30.14	They want to remove the poor from the earth
PRO.30.14	and the needy from the land.
PRO.30.15	“Greed has two daughters
PRO.30.15	named ‘Give’ and ‘Give.’
PRO.30.15	There are three things that are never satisfied,
PRO.30.15	really four that never say, ‘I’ve had enough!’:
PRO.30.16	the cemetery, the childless mother,
PRO.30.16	the land that never gets enough rain,
PRO.30.16	and fire that never says, ‘I’ve had enough!’
PRO.30.17	“If you make fun of your father
PRO.30.17	and refuse to obey your mother,
PRO.30.17	the birds of the valley will peck out your eyes,
PRO.30.17	and the vultures will eat them.
PRO.30.18	“There are three things that are too hard for me,
PRO.30.18	really four I don’t understand:
PRO.30.19	the way an eagle flies in the sky,
PRO.30.19	the way a snake slides over a rock,
PRO.30.19	the way a ship sails on the sea,
PRO.30.19	and the way a man and a woman fall in love.
PRO.30.20	“This is the way of a woman who takes part in adultery:
PRO.30.20	She acts as if she had eaten and washed her face;
PRO.30.20	she says, ‘I haven’t done anything wrong.’
PRO.30.21	“There are three things that make the earth tremble,
PRO.30.21	really four it cannot stand:
PRO.30.22	a servant who becomes a king,
PRO.30.22	a foolish person who has plenty to eat,
PRO.30.23	a hated woman who gets married,
PRO.30.23	and a maid who replaces her mistress.
PRO.30.24	“There are four things on earth that are small,
PRO.30.24	but they are very wise:
PRO.30.25	Ants are not very strong,
PRO.30.25	but they store up food in the summer.
PRO.30.26	Rock badgers are not very powerful,
PRO.30.26	but they can live among the rocks.
PRO.30.27	Locusts have no king,
PRO.30.27	but they all go forward in formation.
PRO.30.28	Lizards can be caught in the hand,
PRO.30.28	but they are found even in kings’ palaces.
PRO.30.29	“There are three things that strut proudly,
PRO.30.29	really four that walk as if they were important:
PRO.30.30	a lion, the proudest animal,
PRO.30.30	which is strong and runs from nothing,
PRO.30.31	a rooster, a male goat,
PRO.30.31	and a king when his army is around him.
PRO.30.32	“If you have been foolish and proud,
PRO.30.32	or if you have planned evil, shut your mouth.
PRO.30.33	Just as stirring milk makes butter,
PRO.30.33	and twisting noses makes them bleed,
PRO.30.33	so stirring up anger causes trouble.”
PRO.31.1	These are the words of King Lemuel, the message his mother taught him:
PRO.31.2	“My son, I gave birth to you.
PRO.31.2	You are the son I prayed for.
PRO.31.3	Don’t waste your strength on women
PRO.31.3	or your time on those who ruin kings.
PRO.31.4	“Kings should not drink wine, Lemuel,
PRO.31.4	and rulers should not desire beer.
PRO.31.5	If they drink, they might forget the law
PRO.31.5	and keep the needy from getting their rights.
PRO.31.6	Give beer to people who are dying
PRO.31.6	and wine to those who are sad.
PRO.31.7	Let them drink and forget their need
PRO.31.7	and remember their misery no more.
PRO.31.8	“Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves;
PRO.31.8	defend the rights of all those who have nothing.
PRO.31.9	Speak up and judge fairly,
PRO.31.9	and defend the rights of the poor and needy.”
PRO.31.10	It is hard to find a good wife,
PRO.31.10	because she is worth more than rubies.
PRO.31.11	Her husband trusts her completely.
PRO.31.11	With her, he has everything he needs.
PRO.31.12	She does him good and not harm
PRO.31.12	for as long as she lives.
PRO.31.13	She looks for wool and flax
PRO.31.13	and likes to work with her hands.
PRO.31.14	She is like a trader’s ship,
PRO.31.14	bringing food from far away.
PRO.31.15	She gets up while it is still dark
PRO.31.15	and prepares food for her family
PRO.31.15	and feeds her servant girls.
PRO.31.16	She inspects a field and buys it.
PRO.31.16	With money she earned, she plants a vineyard.
PRO.31.17	She does her work with energy,
PRO.31.17	and her arms are strong.
PRO.31.18	She knows that what she makes is good.
PRO.31.18	Her lamp burns late into the night.
PRO.31.19	She makes thread with her hands
PRO.31.19	and weaves her own cloth.
PRO.31.20	She welcomes the poor
PRO.31.20	and helps the needy.
PRO.31.21	She does not worry about her family when it snows,
PRO.31.21	because they all have fine clothes to keep them warm.
PRO.31.22	She makes coverings for herself;
PRO.31.22	her clothes are made of linen and other expensive material.
PRO.31.23	Her husband is known at the city meetings,
PRO.31.23	where he makes decisions as one of the leaders of the land.
PRO.31.24	She makes linen clothes and sells them
PRO.31.24	and provides belts to the merchants.
PRO.31.25	She is strong and is respected by the people.
PRO.31.25	She looks forward to the future with joy.
PRO.31.26	She speaks wise words
PRO.31.26	and teaches others to be kind.
PRO.31.27	She watches over her family
PRO.31.27	and never wastes her time.
PRO.31.28	Her children speak well of her.
PRO.31.28	Her husband also praises her,
PRO.31.29	saying, “There are many fine women,
PRO.31.29	but you are better than all of them.”
PRO.31.30	Charm can fool you, and beauty can trick you,
PRO.31.30	but a woman who respects the L
PRO.31.31	Give her the reward she has earned;
PRO.31.31	she should be praised in public for what she has done. 
ECC.1.1	These are the words of the Teacher, a son of David, king in Jerusalem.
ECC.1.2	The Teacher says,
ECC.1.2	“Useless! Useless!
ECC.1.2	Completely useless!
ECC.1.2	Everything is useless.”
ECC.1.3	What do people really gain
ECC.1.3	from all the hard work they do here on earth?
ECC.1.4	People live, and people die,
ECC.1.4	but the earth continues forever.
ECC.1.5	The sun rises, the sun sets,
ECC.1.5	and then it hurries back to where it rises again.
ECC.1.6	The wind blows to the south;
ECC.1.6	it blows to the north.
ECC.1.6	It blows from one direction and then another.
ECC.1.6	Then it turns around and repeats the same pattern, going nowhere.
ECC.1.7	All the rivers flow to the sea,
ECC.1.7	but the sea never becomes full.
ECC.1.8	Everything is boring,
ECC.1.8	so boring that you don’t even want to talk about it.
ECC.1.8	Words come again and again to our ears,
ECC.1.8	but we never hear enough,
ECC.1.8	nor can we ever really see all we want to see.
ECC.1.9	All things continue the way they have been since the beginning.
ECC.1.9	What has happened will happen again;
ECC.1.9	there is nothing new here on earth.
ECC.1.10	Someone might say,
ECC.1.10	“Look, this is new,”
ECC.1.10	but really it has always been here.
ECC.1.10	It was here before we were.
ECC.1.11	People don’t remember what happened long ago,
ECC.1.11	and in the future people will not remember what happens now.
ECC.1.11	Even later, other people will not remember what was done before them.
ECC.1.12	I, the Teacher, was king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
ECC.1.13	I decided to use my wisdom to learn about everything that happens on earth. I learned that God has given us terrible things to face. 
ECC.1.14	I looked at everything done on earth and saw that it is all useless, like chasing the wind.
ECC.1.15	If something is crooked,
ECC.1.15	you can’t make it straight.
ECC.1.15	If something is missing,
ECC.1.15	you can’t say it is there.
ECC.1.16	I said to myself, “I have become very wise and am now wiser than anyone who ruled Jerusalem before me. I know what wisdom and knowledge really are.” 
ECC.1.17	So I decided to find out about wisdom and knowledge and also about foolish thinking, but this turned out to be like chasing the wind.
ECC.1.18	With much wisdom comes much disappointment;
ECC.1.18	the person who gains more knowledge also gains more sorrow.
ECC.2.1	 I said to myself, "I will try having fun. I will enjoy myself." But I found that this is also useless. 
ECC.2.2	 It is foolish to laugh all the time, and having fun doesn't accomplish anything. 
ECC.2.3	 I decided to cheer myself up with wine while my mind was still thinking wisely. I wanted to find a way to enjoy myself and see what was good for people to do during their few days of life. 
ECC.2.4	Then I did great things: I built houses and planted vineyards for myself. 
ECC.2.5	I made gardens and parks, and I planted all kinds of fruit trees in them. 
ECC.2.6	I made pools of water for myself and used them to water my growing trees. 
ECC.2.7	I bought male and female slaves, and slaves were also born in my house. I had large herds and flocks, more than anyone in Jerusalem had ever had before. 
ECC.2.8	I also gathered silver and gold for myself, treasures from kings and other areas. I had male and female singers and all the women a man could ever want. 
ECC.2.9	I became very famous, even greater than anyone who had lived in Jerusalem before me. My wisdom helped me in all this.
ECC.2.10	Anything I saw and wanted, I got for myself;
ECC.2.10	I did not miss any pleasure I desired.
ECC.2.10	I was pleased with everything I did,
ECC.2.10	and this pleasure was the reward for all my hard work.
ECC.2.11	But then I looked at what I had done,
ECC.2.11	and I thought about all the hard work.
ECC.2.11	Suddenly I realized it was useless, like chasing the wind.
ECC.2.11	There is nothing to gain from anything we do here on earth.
ECC.2.12	Then I began to think again about being wise,
ECC.2.12	and also about being foolish and doing crazy things.
ECC.2.12	But after all, what more can anyone do?
ECC.2.12	He can’t do more than what the other king has already done.
ECC.2.13	I saw that being wise is certainly better than being foolish,
ECC.2.13	just as light is better than darkness.
ECC.2.14	Wise people see where they are going,
ECC.2.14	but fools walk around in the dark.
ECC.2.14	Yet I saw that
ECC.2.14	both wise and foolish people end the same way.
ECC.2.15	I thought to myself,
ECC.2.15	“What happens to a fool will happen to me, too,
ECC.2.15	so what is the reward for being wise?”
ECC.2.15	I said to myself,
ECC.2.15	“Being wise is also useless.”
ECC.2.16	The wise person and the fool
ECC.2.16	will both die,
ECC.2.16	and no one will remember either one for long.
ECC.2.16	In the future, both will be forgotten.
ECC.2.17	So I hated life. It made me sad to think that everything here on earth is useless, like chasing the wind. 
ECC.2.18	I hated all the things I had worked for here on earth, because I must leave them to someone who will live after me. 
ECC.2.19	Someone else will control everything for which I worked so hard here on earth, and I don’t know if he will be wise or foolish. This is also useless. 
ECC.2.20	So I became sad about all the hard work I had done here on earth. 
ECC.2.21	People can work hard using all their wisdom, knowledge, and skill, but they will die, and other people will get the things for which they worked. They did not do the work, but they will get everything. This is also unfair and useless. 
ECC.2.22	What do people get for all their work and struggling here on earth? 
ECC.2.23	All of their lives their work is full of pain and sorrow, and even at night their minds don’t rest. This is also useless.
ECC.2.24	The best that people can do is eat, drink, and enjoy their work. I saw that even this comes from God, 
ECC.2.25	because no one can eat or enjoy life without him. 
ECC.2.26	If people please God, God will give them wisdom, knowledge, and joy. But sinners will get only the work of gathering and storing wealth that they will have to give to the ones who please God. So all their work is useless, like chasing the wind.
ECC.3.1	There is a time for everything,
ECC.3.1	and everything on earth has its special season.
ECC.3.2	There is a time to be born
ECC.3.2	and a time to die.
ECC.3.2	There is a time to plant
ECC.3.2	and a time to pull up plants.
ECC.3.3	There is a time to kill
ECC.3.3	and a time to heal.
ECC.3.3	There is a time to destroy
ECC.3.3	and a time to build.
ECC.3.4	There is a time to cry
ECC.3.4	and a time to laugh.
ECC.3.4	There is a time to be sad
ECC.3.4	and a time to dance.
ECC.3.5	There is a time to throw away stones
ECC.3.5	and a time to gather them.
ECC.3.5	There is a time to hug
ECC.3.5	and a time not to hug.
ECC.3.6	There is a time to look for something
ECC.3.6	and a time to stop looking for it.
ECC.3.6	There is a time to keep things
ECC.3.6	and a time to throw things away.
ECC.3.7	There is a time to tear apart
ECC.3.7	and a time to sew together.
ECC.3.7	There is a time to be silent
ECC.3.7	and a time to speak.
ECC.3.8	There is a time to love
ECC.3.8	and a time to hate.
ECC.3.8	There is a time for war
ECC.3.8	and a time for peace.
ECC.3.9	Do people really gain anything from their work? 
ECC.3.10	I saw the hard work God has given people to do. 
ECC.3.11	God has given them a desire to know the future. He does everything just right and on time, but people can never completely understand what he is doing. 
ECC.3.12	So I realize that the best thing for them is to be happy and enjoy themselves as long as they live. 
ECC.3.13	God wants all people to eat and drink and be happy in their work, which are gifts from God. 
ECC.3.14	I know that everything God does will continue forever. People cannot add anything to what God has done, and they cannot take anything away from it. God does it this way to make people respect him.
ECC.3.15	What happens now has happened in the past,
ECC.3.15	and what will happen in the future has happened before.
ECC.3.15	God makes the same things happen again and again.
ECC.3.16	I also saw this here on earth:
ECC.3.16	Where there should have been justice, there was evil;
ECC.3.16	where there should have been right, there was wrong.
ECC.3.17	I said to myself,
ECC.3.17	God has planned a time for every thing and every action,
ECC.3.17	so he will judge both good people and bad.
ECC.3.18	I decided that God leaves it the way it is to test people and to show them they are just like animals. 
ECC.3.19	The same thing happens to animals and to people; they both have the same breath, so they both die. People are no better off than the animals, because everything is useless. 
ECC.3.20	Both end up the same way; both came from dust and both will go back to dust. 
ECC.3.21	Who can be sure that the human spirit goes up to God and that the spirit of an animal goes down into the ground? 
ECC.3.22	So I saw that the best thing people can do is to enjoy their work, because that is all they have. No one can help another person see what will happen in the future.
ECC.4.1	Again I saw all the people who were mistreated here on earth.
ECC.4.1	I saw their tears
ECC.4.1	and that they had no one to comfort them.
ECC.4.1	Cruel people had all the power,
ECC.4.1	and there was no one to comfort those they hurt.
ECC.4.2	I decided that the dead
ECC.4.2	are better off than the living.
ECC.4.3	But those who have never been born
ECC.4.3	are better off still;
ECC.4.3	they have not seen the evil
ECC.4.3	that is done here on earth.
ECC.4.4	I realized the reason people work hard and try to succeed: They are jealous of each other. This, too, is useless, like chasing the wind.
ECC.4.5	Some say it is foolish to fold your hands and do nothing,
ECC.4.5	because you will starve to death.
ECC.4.6	Maybe so, but I say it is better to be content
ECC.4.6	with what little you have.
ECC.4.6	Otherwise, you will always be struggling for more,
ECC.4.6	and that is like chasing the wind.
ECC.4.7	Again I saw something here on earth that was useless:
ECC.4.8	I saw a man who had no family,
ECC.4.8	no son or brother.
ECC.4.8	He always worked hard
ECC.4.8	but was never satisfied with what he had.
ECC.4.8	He never asked himself, “For whom am I working so hard?
ECC.4.8	Why don’t I let myself enjoy life?”
ECC.4.8	This also is very sad and useless.
ECC.4.9	Two people are better than one,
ECC.4.9	because they get more done by working together.
ECC.4.10	If one falls down,
ECC.4.10	the other can help him up.
ECC.4.10	But it is bad for the person who is alone and falls,
ECC.4.10	because no one is there to help.
ECC.4.11	If two lie down together, they will be warm,
ECC.4.11	but a person alone will not be warm.
ECC.4.12	An enemy might defeat one person,
ECC.4.12	but two people together can defend themselves;
ECC.4.12	a rope that is woven of three strings is hard to break.
ECC.4.13	A poor but wise boy is better than a foolish but old king who doesn’t listen to advice. 
ECC.4.14	A boy became king. He had been born poor in the kingdom and had even gone to prison before becoming king. 
ECC.4.15	I watched all the people who live on earth follow him and make him their king. 
ECC.4.16	Many followed him at first, but later, they did not like him, either. So fame and power are useless, like chasing the wind.
ECC.5.1	Be careful when you go to worship at the Temple. It is better to listen than to offer foolish sacrifices without even knowing you are doing wrong.
ECC.5.2	Think before you speak,
ECC.5.2	and be careful about what you say to God.
ECC.5.2	God is in heaven,
ECC.5.2	and you are on the earth,
ECC.5.2	so say only a few words to God.
ECC.5.3	The saying is true: Bad dreams come from too much worrying,
ECC.5.3	and too many words come from foolish people.
ECC.5.4	If you make a promise to God, don’t be slow to keep it. God is not happy with fools, so give God what you promised. 
ECC.5.5	It is better not to promise anything than to promise something and not do it. 
ECC.5.6	Don’t let your words cause you to sin, and don’t say to the priest at the Temple, “I didn’t mean what I promised.” If you do, God will become angry with your words and will destroy everything you have worked for. 
ECC.5.7	Many useless promises are like so many dreams; they mean nothing. You should respect God.
ECC.5.8	In some places you will see poor people mistreated. Don’t be surprised when they are not treated fairly or given their rights. One officer is cheated by a higher officer who in turn is cheated by even higher officers. 
ECC.5.9	The wealth of the country is divided up among them all. Even the king makes sure he gets his share of the profits.
ECC.5.10	Whoever loves money
ECC.5.10	will never have enough money;
ECC.5.10	Whoever loves wealth
ECC.5.10	will not be satisfied with it.
ECC.5.10	This is also useless.
ECC.5.11	The more wealth people have,
ECC.5.11	the more friends they have to help spend it.
ECC.5.11	So what do people really gain?
ECC.5.11	They gain nothing except to look at their riches.
ECC.5.12	Those who work hard sleep in peace;
ECC.5.12	it is not important if they eat little or much.
ECC.5.12	But rich people worry about their wealth
ECC.5.12	and cannot sleep.
ECC.5.13	I have seen real misery here on earth:
ECC.5.13	Money saved is a curse to its owners.
ECC.5.14	They lose it all in a bad deal
ECC.5.14	and have nothing to give to their children.
ECC.5.15	People come into this world with nothing,
ECC.5.15	and when they die they leave with nothing.
ECC.5.15	In spite of all their hard work,
ECC.5.15	they leave just as they came.
ECC.5.16	This, too, is real misery:
ECC.5.16	They leave just as they came.
ECC.5.16	So what do they gain from chasing the wind?
ECC.5.17	All they get are days full of sadness and sorrow,
ECC.5.17	and they end up sick, defeated, and angry.
ECC.5.18	I have seen what is best for people here on earth. They should eat and drink and enjoy their work, because the life God has given them on earth is short. 
ECC.5.19	God gives some people the ability to enjoy the wealth and property he gives them, as well as the ability to accept their state in life and enjoy their work. 
ECC.5.20	They do not worry about how short life is, because God keeps them busy with what they love to do.
ECC.6.1	I have seen something else wrong here on earth that causes serious problems for people. 
ECC.6.2	God gives great wealth, riches, and honor to some people; they have everything they want. But God does not let them enjoy such things; a stranger enjoys them instead. This is useless and very wrong. 
ECC.6.3	A man might have a hundred children and live a long time, but what good is it if he can’t enjoy the good God gives him or have a proper burial? I say a baby born dead is better off than he is. 
ECC.6.4	A baby born dead is useless. It returns to darkness without even a name. 
ECC.6.5	That baby never saw the sun and never knew anything, but it finds more rest than that man. 
ECC.6.6	Even if he lives two thousand years, he doesn’t enjoy the good God gives him. Everyone is going to the same place.
ECC.6.7	People work just to feed themselves,
ECC.6.7	but they never seem to get enough to eat.
ECC.6.8	In this way a wise person
ECC.6.8	is no better off than a fool.
ECC.6.8	Then, too, it does a poor person little good
ECC.6.8	to know how to get along in life.
ECC.6.9	It is better to see what you have
ECC.6.9	than to want more.
ECC.6.9	Wanting more is useless—
ECC.6.9	like chasing the wind.
ECC.6.10	Whatever happens was planned long ago.
ECC.6.10	Everyone knows what people are like.
ECC.6.10	No one can argue with God,
ECC.6.10	who is stronger than anyone.
ECC.6.11	The more you say,
ECC.6.11	the more useless it is.
ECC.6.11	What good does it do?
ECC.6.12	People have only a few useless days of life on the earth; their short life passes like a shadow. Who knows what is best for them while they live? Who can tell them what the future will bring?
ECC.7.1	It is better to have respect than good perfume.
ECC.7.1	The day of death is better than the day of birth.
ECC.7.2	It is better to go to a funeral
ECC.7.2	than to a party.
ECC.7.2	We all must die,
ECC.7.2	and everyone living should think about this.
ECC.7.3	Sorrow is better than laughter,
ECC.7.3	and sadness has a good influence on you.
ECC.7.4	A wise person thinks about death,
ECC.7.4	but a fool thinks only about having a good time.
ECC.7.5	It is better to be criticized by a wise person
ECC.7.5	than to be praised by a fool.
ECC.7.6	The laughter of fools
ECC.7.6	is like the crackling of thorns in a cooking fire.
ECC.7.6	Both are useless.
ECC.7.7	Even wise people are fools
ECC.7.7	if they let money change their thinking.
ECC.7.8	It is better to finish something
ECC.7.8	than to start it.
ECC.7.8	It is better to be patient
ECC.7.8	than to be proud.
ECC.7.9	Don’t become angry quickly,
ECC.7.9	because getting angry is foolish.
ECC.7.10	Don’t ask, “Why was life better in the ‘good old days’?”
ECC.7.10	It is not wise to ask such questions.
ECC.7.11	Wisdom is better when it comes with money.
ECC.7.11	They both help those who are alive.
ECC.7.12	Wisdom is like money:
ECC.7.12	they both help.
ECC.7.12	But wisdom is better,
ECC.7.12	because it can save whoever has it.
ECC.7.13	Look at what God has done:
ECC.7.13	No one can straighten what he has bent.
ECC.7.14	When life is good, enjoy it.
ECC.7.14	But when life is hard, remember:
ECC.7.14	God gives good times and hard times,
ECC.7.14	and no one knows what tomorrow will bring.
ECC.7.15	In my useless life I have seen both of these:
ECC.7.15	I have seen good people die in spite of their goodness
ECC.7.15	and evil people live a long time in spite of their evil.
ECC.7.16	Don’t be too right,
ECC.7.16	and don’t be too wise.
ECC.7.16	Why destroy yourself?
ECC.7.17	Don’t be too wicked,
ECC.7.17	and don’t be foolish.
ECC.7.17	Why die before your time?
ECC.7.18	It is good to grab the one and not let go of the other;
ECC.7.18	those who honor God will hold them both.
ECC.7.19	Wisdom makes a person stronger
ECC.7.19	than ten leaders in a city.
ECC.7.20	Surely there is not a good person on earth
ECC.7.20	who always does good and never sins.
ECC.7.21	Don’t listen to everything people say,
ECC.7.21	or you might hear your servant insulting you.
ECC.7.22	You know that many times
ECC.7.22	you have insulted others.
ECC.7.23	I used wisdom to test all these things.
ECC.7.23	I wanted to be wise,
ECC.7.23	but it was too hard for me.
ECC.7.24	I cannot understand why things are as they are.
ECC.7.24	It is too hard for anyone to understand.
ECC.7.25	I studied and tried very hard to find wisdom,
ECC.7.25	to find some meaning for everything.
ECC.7.25	I learned that it is foolish to be evil,
ECC.7.25	and it is crazy to act like a fool.
ECC.7.26	I found that some women are worse than death
ECC.7.26	and are as dangerous as traps.
ECC.7.26	Their love is like a net,
ECC.7.26	and their arms hold men like chains.
ECC.7.26	A man who pleases God will be saved from them,
ECC.7.26	but a sinner will be caught by them.
ECC.7.27	The Teacher says, “This is what I learned:
ECC.7.27	I added all these things together
ECC.7.27	to find some meaning for everything.
ECC.7.28	While I was searching,
ECC.7.28	I did not find one man among the thousands I found.
ECC.7.28	Nor did I find a woman among all these.
ECC.7.29	One thing I have learned:
ECC.7.29	God made people good,
ECC.7.29	but they have found all kinds of ways to be bad.”
ECC.8.1	No one is like the wise person
ECC.8.1	who can understand what things mean.
ECC.8.1	Wisdom brings happiness;
ECC.8.1	it makes sad faces happy.
ECC.8.2	Obey the king’s command, because you made a promise to God. 
ECC.8.3	Don’t be too quick to leave the king. Don’t support something that is wrong, because the king does whatever he pleases. 
ECC.8.4	What the king says is law; no one tells him what to do.
ECC.8.5	Whoever obeys the king’s command will be safe.
ECC.8.5	A wise person does the right thing at the right time.
ECC.8.6	There is a right time and a right way for everything,
ECC.8.6	yet people often have many troubles.
ECC.8.7	They do not know what the future holds,
ECC.8.7	and no one can tell them what will happen.
ECC.8.8	No one can control the wind
ECC.8.8	or stop his own death.
ECC.8.8	No soldier is released in times of war,
ECC.8.8	and evil does not set free those who do evil.
ECC.8.9	I saw all of this as I considered all that is done here on earth. Sometimes people harm those they control. 
ECC.8.10	I saw the funerals of evil people who used to go in and out of the holy place. They were honored in the same towns where they had done evil. This is useless, too.
ECC.8.11	When evil people are not punished right away, it makes others want to do evil, too. 
ECC.8.12	Though a sinner might do a hundred evil things and might live a long time, I know it will be better for those who honor God. 
ECC.8.13	I also know it will not go well for evil people, because they do not honor God. Like a shadow, they will not last. 
ECC.8.14	Sometimes something useless happens on earth. Bad things happen to good people, and good things happen to bad people. I say that this is also useless. 
ECC.8.15	So I decided it was more important to enjoy life. The best that people can do here on earth is to eat, drink, and enjoy life, because these joys will help them do the hard work God gives them here on earth.
ECC.8.16	I tried to understand all that happens on earth. I saw how busy people are, working day and night and hardly ever sleeping. 
ECC.8.17	I also saw all that God has done. Nobody can understand what God does here on earth. No matter how hard people try to understand it, they cannot. Even if wise people say they understand, they cannot; no one can really understand it.
ECC.9.1	I thought about all this and tried to understand it. I saw that God controls good people and wise people and what they do, but no one knows if they will experience love or hate.
ECC.9.2	Good and bad people end up the same—
ECC.9.2	those who are right and those who are wrong,
ECC.9.2	those who are good and those who are evil,
ECC.9.2	those who are clean and those who are unclean,
ECC.9.2	those who sacrifice and those who do not.
ECC.9.2	The same things happen to a good person
ECC.9.2	as happen to a sinner,
ECC.9.2	to a person who makes promises to God
ECC.9.2	and to one who does not.
ECC.9.3	This is something wrong that happens here on earth: What happens to one happens to all. So people’s minds are full of evil and foolish thoughts while they live. After that, they join the dead. 
ECC.9.4	But anyone still alive has hope; even a live dog is better off than a dead lion!
ECC.9.5	The living know they will die,
ECC.9.5	but the dead know nothing.
ECC.9.5	Dead people have no more reward,
ECC.9.5	and people forget them.
ECC.9.6	After people are dead,
ECC.9.6	they can no longer love or hate or envy.
ECC.9.6	They will never again share
ECC.9.6	in what happens here on earth.
ECC.9.7	So go eat your food and enjoy it;
ECC.9.7	drink your wine and be happy,
ECC.9.7	because that is what God wants you to do.
ECC.9.8	Put on nice clothes
ECC.9.8	and make yourself look good.
ECC.9.9	Enjoy life with the wife you love. Enjoy all the useless days of this useless life God has given you here on earth, because it is all you have. So enjoy the work you do here on earth. 
ECC.9.10	Whatever work you do, do your best, because you are going to the grave, where there is no working, no planning, no knowledge, and no wisdom.
ECC.9.11	I also saw something else here on earth:
ECC.9.11	The fastest runner does not always win the race,
ECC.9.11	the strongest soldier does not always win the battle,
ECC.9.11	the wisest does not always have food,
ECC.9.11	the smartest does not always become wealthy,
ECC.9.11	and the talented one does not always receive praise.
ECC.9.11	Time and chance happen to everyone.
ECC.9.12	No one knows what will happen next.
ECC.9.12	Like a fish caught in a net,
ECC.9.12	or a bird caught in a trap,
ECC.9.12	people are trapped by evil
ECC.9.12	when it suddenly falls on them.
ECC.9.13	I also saw something wise here on earth that impressed me. 
ECC.9.14	There was a small town with only a few people in it. A great king fought against it and put his armies all around it. 
ECC.9.15	Now there was a poor but wise man in the town who used his wisdom to save his town. But later on, everyone forgot about him. 
ECC.9.16	I still think wisdom is better than strength. But those people forgot about the poor man’s wisdom and stopped listening to what he said.
ECC.9.17	The quiet words of a wise person are better
ECC.9.17	than the shouts of a foolish ruler.
ECC.9.18	Wisdom is better than weapons of war,
ECC.9.18	but one sinner can destroy much good.
ECC.10.1	Dead flies can make even perfume stink.
ECC.10.1	In the same way, a little foolishness can spoil wisdom.
ECC.10.2	The heart of the wise leads to right,
ECC.10.2	but the heart of a fool leads to wrong.
ECC.10.3	Even in the way fools walk along the road,
ECC.10.3	they show they are not wise;
ECC.10.3	they show everyone how stupid they are.
ECC.10.4	Don’t leave your job
ECC.10.4	just because your boss is angry with you.
ECC.10.4	Remaining calm solves great problems.
ECC.10.5	There is something else wrong that happens here on earth.
ECC.10.5	It is the kind of mistake rulers make:
ECC.10.6	Fools are given important positions
ECC.10.6	while gifted people are given lower ones;
ECC.10.7	I have seen servants ride horses
ECC.10.7	while princes walk like servants on foot.
ECC.10.8	Anyone who digs a pit might fall into it;
ECC.10.8	anyone who knocks down a wall might be bitten by a snake;
ECC.10.9	anyone who moves boulders might be hurt by them;
ECC.10.9	and anyone who cuts logs might be harmed by them.
ECC.10.10	A dull ax means
ECC.10.10	harder work.
ECC.10.10	Being wise will make it easier.
ECC.10.11	If a snake bites the tamer before it is tamed,
ECC.10.11	what good is the tamer?
ECC.10.12	The words of the wise bring them praise,
ECC.10.12	but the words of a fool will destroy them.
ECC.10.13	A fool begins by saying foolish things
ECC.10.13	and ends by saying crazy and wicked things.
ECC.10.14	A fool talks too much.
ECC.10.14	No one knows the future,
ECC.10.14	and no one can tell what will happen after death.
ECC.10.15	Work wears fools out;
ECC.10.15	they don’t even know how to get home.
ECC.10.16	How terrible it is for a country whose king is a child
ECC.10.16	and whose leaders eat all morning.
ECC.10.17	How lucky a country is whose king comes from a good family,
ECC.10.17	whose leaders eat only at mealtime
ECC.10.17	and for strength, not to get drunk.
ECC.10.18	If someone is lazy, the roof will begin to fall.
ECC.10.18	If he doesn’t fix it, the house will leak.
ECC.10.19	A party makes you feel good,
ECC.10.19	wine makes you feel happy,
ECC.10.19	and money buys anything.
ECC.10.20	Don’t make fun of the king,
ECC.10.20	and don’t make fun of rich people, even in your bedroom.
ECC.10.20	A little bird might carry your words;
ECC.10.20	a bird might fly and tell what you said.
ECC.11.1	Invest what you have,
ECC.11.1	because after a while you will get a return.
ECC.11.2	Invest what you have in several different businesses,
ECC.11.2	because you don’t know what disasters might happen.
ECC.11.3	If clouds are full of rain,
ECC.11.3	they will shower on the earth.
ECC.11.3	A tree can fall to the north or south,
ECC.11.3	but it will stay where it falls.
ECC.11.4	Those who wait for perfect weather
ECC.11.4	will never plant seeds;
ECC.11.4	those who look at every cloud
ECC.11.4	will never harvest crops.
ECC.11.5	You don’t know where the wind will blow,
ECC.11.5	and you don’t know how a baby grows inside the mother.
ECC.11.5	In the same way, you don’t know what God is doing,
ECC.11.5	or how he created everything.
ECC.11.6	Plant early in the morning,
ECC.11.6	and work until evening,
ECC.11.6	because you don’t know if this or that will succeed.
ECC.11.6	They might both do well.
ECC.11.7	Sunshine is sweet;
ECC.11.7	it is good to see the light of day.
ECC.11.8	People ought to enjoy every day of their lives,
ECC.11.8	no matter how long they live.
ECC.11.8	But they should also remember this:
ECC.11.8	You will be dead a long time.
ECC.11.8	Everything that happens then is useless.
ECC.11.9	Young people, enjoy yourselves while you are young;
ECC.11.9	be happy while you are young.
ECC.11.9	Do whatever your heart desires,
ECC.11.9	whatever you want to do.
ECC.11.9	But remember that God will judge you
ECC.11.9	for everything you do.
ECC.11.10	Don’t worry,
ECC.11.10	and forget the troubles of your body,
ECC.11.10	because youth and childhood are useless.
ECC.12.1	Remember your Creator
ECC.12.1	while you are young,
ECC.12.1	before the days of trouble come
ECC.12.1	and the years when you say,
ECC.12.1	“I find no pleasure in them.”
ECC.12.2	When you get old,
ECC.12.2	the light from the sun, moon, and stars will grow dark;
ECC.12.2	the rain clouds will never seem to go away.
ECC.12.3	At that time your arms will shake
ECC.12.3	and your legs will become weak.
ECC.12.3	Your teeth will fall out so you cannot chew,
ECC.12.3	and your eyes will not see clearly.
ECC.12.4	Your ears will be deaf to the noise in the streets,
ECC.12.4	and you will barely hear the millstone grinding grain.
ECC.12.4	You’ll wake up when a bird starts singing,
ECC.12.4	but you will barely hear singing.
ECC.12.5	You will fear high places
ECC.12.5	and will be afraid to go for a walk.
ECC.12.5	Your hair will become white like the flowers on an almond tree.
ECC.12.5	You will limp along like a grasshopper when you walk.
ECC.12.5	Your appetite will be gone.
ECC.12.5	Then you will go to your everlasting home,
ECC.12.5	and people will go to your funeral.
ECC.12.6	Soon your life will snap like a silver chain
ECC.12.6	or break like a golden bowl.
ECC.12.6	You will be like a broken pitcher at a spring,
ECC.12.6	or a broken wheel at a well.
ECC.12.7	You will turn back into the dust of the earth again,
ECC.12.7	but your spirit will return to God who gave it.
ECC.12.8	Everything is useless!
ECC.12.8	The Teacher says that everything is useless.
ECC.12.9	The Teacher was very wise and taught the people what he knew. He very carefully thought about, studied, and set in order many wise teachings. 
ECC.12.10	The Teacher looked for just the right words to write what is dependable and true.
ECC.12.11	Words from wise people are like sharp sticks used to guide animals. They are like nails that have been driven in firmly. Altogether they are wise teachings that come from one Shepherd. 
ECC.12.12	So be careful, my son, about other teachings. People are always writing books, and too much study will make you tired.
ECC.12.13	Now, everything has been heard,
ECC.12.13	so I give my final advice:
ECC.12.13	Honor God and obey his commands,
ECC.12.13	because this is all people must do.
ECC.12.14	God will judge everything,
ECC.12.14	even what is done in secret,
ECC.12.14	the good and the evil. 
SNG.1.1	Solomon’s Song of Songs.
SNG.1.2	Kiss me with the kisses of your mouth,
SNG.1.2	because your love is better than wine.
SNG.1.3	The smell of your perfume is pleasant,
SNG.1.3	and your name is pleasant like expensive perfume.
SNG.1.3	That’s why the young women love you.
SNG.1.4	Take me with you; let’s run together.
SNG.1.4	The king takes me into his rooms.
SNG.1.4	We will rejoice and be happy with you;
SNG.1.4	we praise your love more than wine.
SNG.1.4	With good reason, the young women love you.
SNG.1.5	I’m dark but lovely,
SNG.1.5	women of Jerusalem,
SNG.1.5	dark like the tents of Kedar,
SNG.1.5	like the curtains of Solomon.
SNG.1.6	Don’t look at how dark I am,
SNG.1.6	at how dark the sun has made me.
SNG.1.6	My brothers were angry with me
SNG.1.6	and made me tend the vineyards,
SNG.1.6	so I haven’t tended my own vineyard!
SNG.1.7	Tell me, you whom I love,
SNG.1.7	where do you feed your sheep?
SNG.1.7	Where do you let them rest at noon?
SNG.1.7	Why should I look for you near your friend’s sheep,
SNG.1.7	like a woman who wears a veil?
SNG.1.8	You are the most beautiful of women.
SNG.1.8	Surely you know to follow the sheep
SNG.1.8	and feed your young goats
SNG.1.8	near the shepherds’ tents.
SNG.1.9	My darling, you are like a mare
SNG.1.9	among the king’s stallions.
SNG.1.10	Your cheeks are beautiful with ornaments,
SNG.1.10	and your neck with jewels.
SNG.1.11	We will make for you gold earrings
SNG.1.11	with silver hooks.
SNG.1.12	The smell of my perfume spreads out
SNG.1.12	to the king on his couch.
SNG.1.13	My lover is like a bag of myrrh
SNG.1.13	that lies all night between my breasts.
SNG.1.14	My lover is like a bunch of flowers
SNG.1.14	from the vineyards at En Gedi.
SNG.1.15	My darling, you are beautiful!
SNG.1.15	Oh, you are beautiful,
SNG.1.15	and your eyes are like doves.
SNG.1.16	You are so handsome, my lover,
SNG.1.16	and so pleasant!
SNG.1.16	Our bed is the grass.
SNG.1.17	Cedar trees form our roof;
SNG.1.17	our ceiling is made of juniper wood.
SNG.2.1	I am a rose in the Plain of Sharon,
SNG.2.1	a lily in the valleys.
SNG.2.2	Among the young women, my darling
SNG.2.2	is like a lily among thorns!
SNG.2.3	Among the young men, my lover
SNG.2.3	is like an apple tree in the woods!
SNG.2.3	I enjoy sitting in his shadow;
SNG.2.3	his fruit is sweet to my taste.
SNG.2.4	He brought me to the banquet room,
SNG.2.4	and his banner over me is love.
SNG.2.5	Strengthen me with raisins,
SNG.2.5	and refresh me with apples,
SNG.2.5	because I am weak with love.
SNG.2.6	My lover’s left hand is under my head,
SNG.2.6	and his right arm holds me tight.
SNG.2.7	Women of Jerusalem, promise me
SNG.2.7	by the gazelles and the deer
SNG.2.7	not to awaken
SNG.2.7	or excite my feelings of love
SNG.2.7	until it is ready.
SNG.2.8	I hear my lover’s voice.
SNG.2.8	Here he comes jumping across the mountains,
SNG.2.8	skipping over the hills.
SNG.2.9	My lover is like a gazelle or a young deer.
SNG.2.9	Look, he stands behind our wall
SNG.2.9	peeking through the windows,
SNG.2.9	looking through the blinds.
SNG.2.10	My lover spoke and said to me,
SNG.2.10	“Get up, my darling;
SNG.2.10	let’s go away, my beautiful one.
SNG.2.11	Look, the winter is past;
SNG.2.11	the rains are over and gone.
SNG.2.12	Blossoms appear through all the land.
SNG.2.12	The time has come to sing;
SNG.2.12	the cooing of doves is heard in our land.
SNG.2.13	There are young figs on the fig trees,
SNG.2.13	and the blossoms on the vines smell sweet.
SNG.2.13	Get up, my darling;
SNG.2.13	let’s go away, my beautiful one.”
SNG.2.14	My beloved is like a dove hiding in the cracks of the rock,
SNG.2.14	in the secret places of the cliff.
SNG.2.14	Show me your face,
SNG.2.14	and let me hear your voice.
SNG.2.14	Your voice is sweet,
SNG.2.14	and your face is lovely.
SNG.2.15	Catch the foxes for us—
SNG.2.15	the little foxes that ruin the vineyards
SNG.2.15	while they are in blossom.
SNG.2.16	My lover is mine, and I am his.
SNG.2.16	He feeds among the lilies
SNG.2.17	until the day dawns
SNG.2.17	and the shadows disappear.
SNG.2.17	Turn, my lover.
SNG.2.17	Be like a gazelle or a young deer
SNG.2.17	on the mountain valleys.
SNG.3.1	At night on my bed,
SNG.3.1	I looked for the one I love;
SNG.3.1	I looked for him, but I could not find him.
SNG.3.2	I got up and went around the city,
SNG.3.2	in the streets and squares,
SNG.3.2	looking for the one I love.
SNG.3.2	I looked for him, but I could not find him.
SNG.3.3	The watchmen found me as they patrolled the city,
SNG.3.3	so I asked, “Have you seen the one I love?”
SNG.3.4	As soon as I had left them,
SNG.3.4	I found the one I love.
SNG.3.4	I held him and would not let him go
SNG.3.4	until I brought him to my mother’s house,
SNG.3.4	to the room where I was born.
SNG.3.5	Women of Jerusalem, promise me
SNG.3.5	by the gazelles and the deer
SNG.3.5	not to awaken
SNG.3.5	or excite my feelings of love
SNG.3.5	until it is ready.
SNG.3.6	Who is this coming out of the desert
SNG.3.6	like a cloud of smoke?
SNG.3.6	Who is this that smells like myrrh, incense,
SNG.3.6	and other spices?
SNG.3.7	Look, it’s Solomon’s couch
SNG.3.7	with sixty soldiers around it,
SNG.3.7	the finest soldiers of Israel.
SNG.3.8	These soldiers all carry swords
SNG.3.8	and have been trained in war.
SNG.3.8	Every man wears a sword at his side
SNG.3.8	and is ready for the dangers of the night.
SNG.3.9	King Solomon had a couch made for himself
SNG.3.9	of wood from Lebanon.
SNG.3.10	He made its posts of silver
SNG.3.10	and its braces of gold.
SNG.3.10	The seat was covered with purple cloth
SNG.3.10	that the women of Jerusalem wove with love.
SNG.3.11	Women of Jerusalem, go out and see King Solomon.
SNG.3.11	He is wearing the crown his mother put on his head
SNG.3.11	on his wedding day,
SNG.3.11	when his heart was happy!
SNG.4.1	How beautiful you are, my darling!
SNG.4.1	Oh, you are beautiful!
SNG.4.1	Your eyes behind your veil are like doves.
SNG.4.1	Your hair is like a flock of goats streaming down Mount Gilead.
SNG.4.2	Your teeth are white like newly sheared sheep
SNG.4.2	just coming from their bath.
SNG.4.2	Each one has a twin,
SNG.4.2	and none of them is missing.
SNG.4.3	Your lips are like red silk thread,
SNG.4.3	and your mouth is lovely.
SNG.4.3	Your cheeks behind your veil
SNG.4.3	are like slices of a pomegranate.
SNG.4.4	Your neck is like David’s tower,
SNG.4.4	built with rows of stones.
SNG.4.4	A thousand shields hang on its walls;
SNG.4.4	each shield belongs to a strong soldier.
SNG.4.5	Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.4.5	like twins of a gazelle,
SNG.4.5	feeding among the lilies.
SNG.4.6	Until the day dawns
SNG.4.6	and the shadows disappear,
SNG.4.6	I will go to that mountain of myrrh
SNG.4.6	and to that hill of incense.
SNG.4.7	My darling, everything about you is beautiful,
SNG.4.7	and there is nothing at all wrong with you.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon, my bride.
SNG.4.8	Come with me from Lebanon,
SNG.4.8	from the top of Mount Amana,
SNG.4.8	from the tops of Mount Senir and Mount Hermon.
SNG.4.8	Come from the lions’ dens
SNG.4.8	and from the leopards’ hills.
SNG.4.9	My sister, my bride,
SNG.4.9	you have thrilled my heart;
SNG.4.9	you have thrilled my heart
SNG.4.9	with a glance of your eyes,
SNG.4.9	with one sparkle from your necklace.
SNG.4.10	Your love is so sweet, my sister, my bride.
SNG.4.10	Your love is better than wine,
SNG.4.10	and your perfume smells better than any spice.
SNG.4.11	My bride, your lips drip honey;
SNG.4.11	honey and milk are under your tongue.
SNG.4.11	Your clothes smell like the cedars of Lebanon.
SNG.4.12	My sister, my bride, you are like a garden locked up,
SNG.4.12	like a walled-in spring, a closed-up fountain.
SNG.4.13	Your limbs are like an orchard
SNG.4.13	of pomegranates with all the best fruit,
SNG.4.13	filled with flowers and nard,
SNG.4.14	nard and saffron, calamus, and cinnamon,
SNG.4.14	with trees of incense, myrrh, and aloes—
SNG.4.14	all the best spices.
SNG.4.15	You are like a garden fountain—
SNG.4.15	a well of fresh water
SNG.4.15	flowing down from the mountains of Lebanon.
SNG.4.16	Awake, north wind.
SNG.4.16	Come, south wind.
SNG.4.16	Blow on my garden,
SNG.4.16	and let its sweet smells flow out.
SNG.4.16	Let my lover enter the garden
SNG.4.16	and eat its best fruits.
SNG.5.1	I have entered my garden, my sister, my bride.
SNG.5.1	I have gathered my myrrh with my spice.
SNG.5.1	I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey.
SNG.5.1	I have drunk my wine and my milk.
SNG.5.1	Eat, friends, and drink;
SNG.5.1	yes, drink deeply, lovers.
SNG.5.2	I sleep, but my heart is awake.
SNG.5.2	I hear my lover knocking.
SNG.5.2	“Open to me, my sister, my darling,
SNG.5.2	my dove, my perfect one.
SNG.5.2	My head is wet with dew,
SNG.5.2	and my hair with the dampness of the night.”
SNG.5.3	I have taken off my garment
SNG.5.3	and don’t want to put it on again.
SNG.5.3	I have washed my feet
SNG.5.3	and don’t want to get them dirty again.
SNG.5.4	My lover put his hand through the opening,
SNG.5.4	and I felt excited inside.
SNG.5.5	I got up to open the door for my lover.
SNG.5.5	Myrrh was dripping from my hands
SNG.5.5	and flowing from my fingers,
SNG.5.5	onto the handles of the lock.
SNG.5.6	I opened the door for my lover,
SNG.5.6	but my lover had left and was gone.
SNG.5.6	When he spoke, he took my breath away.
SNG.5.6	I looked for him, but I could not find him;
SNG.5.6	I called for him, but he did not answer.
SNG.5.7	The watchmen found me
SNG.5.7	as they patrolled the city.
SNG.5.7	They hit me and hurt me;
SNG.5.7	the guards on the wall took away my veil.
SNG.5.8	Promise me, women of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.8	if you find my lover,
SNG.5.8	tell him I am weak with love.
SNG.5.9	How is your lover better than other lovers,
SNG.5.9	most beautiful of women?
SNG.5.9	How is your lover better than other lovers?
SNG.5.9	Why do you want us to promise this?
SNG.5.10	My lover is healthy and tan,
SNG.5.10	the best of ten thousand men.
SNG.5.11	His head is like the finest gold;
SNG.5.11	his hair is wavy and black like a raven.
SNG.5.12	His eyes are like doves
SNG.5.12	by springs of water.
SNG.5.12	They seem to be bathed in cream
SNG.5.12	and are set like jewels.
SNG.5.13	His cheeks are like beds of spices;
SNG.5.13	they smell like mounds of perfume.
SNG.5.13	His lips are like lilies
SNG.5.13	flowing with myrrh.
SNG.5.14	His hands are like gold hinges,
SNG.5.14	filled with jewels.
SNG.5.14	His body is like shiny ivory
SNG.5.14	covered with sapphires.
SNG.5.15	His legs are like large marble posts,
SNG.5.15	standing on bases of fine gold.
SNG.5.15	He is like a cedar of Lebanon,
SNG.5.15	like the finest of the trees.
SNG.5.16	His mouth is sweet to kiss,
SNG.5.16	and I desire him very much.
SNG.5.16	Yes, daughters of Jerusalem,
SNG.5.16	this is my lover
SNG.5.16	and my friend.
SNG.6.1	Where has your lover gone,
SNG.6.1	most beautiful of women?
SNG.6.1	Which way did your lover turn?
SNG.6.1	We will look for him with you.
SNG.6.2	My lover has gone down to his garden,
SNG.6.2	to the beds of spices,
SNG.6.2	to feed in the gardens
SNG.6.2	and to gather lilies.
SNG.6.3	I belong to my lover,
SNG.6.3	and my lover belongs to me.
SNG.6.3	He feeds among the lilies.
SNG.6.4	My darling, you are as beautiful as the city of Tirzah,
SNG.6.4	as lovely as the city of Jerusalem,
SNG.6.4	like an army flying flags.
SNG.6.5	Turn your eyes from me,
SNG.6.5	because they excite me too much.
SNG.6.5	Your hair is like a flock of goats
SNG.6.5	streaming down Mount Gilead.
SNG.6.6	Your teeth are white like sheep
SNG.6.6	just coming from their bath;
SNG.6.6	each one has a twin,
SNG.6.6	and none of them is missing.
SNG.6.7	Your cheeks behind your veil
SNG.6.7	are like slices of a pomegranate.
SNG.6.8	There may be sixty queens and eighty slave women
SNG.6.8	and so many girls you cannot count them,
SNG.6.9	but there is only one like my dove, my perfect one.
SNG.6.9	She is her mother’s only daughter,
SNG.6.9	the brightest of the one who gave her birth.
SNG.6.9	The young women saw her and called her happy;
SNG.6.9	the queens and the slave women also praised her.
SNG.6.10	Who is that young woman
SNG.6.10	that shines out like the dawn?
SNG.6.10	She is as pretty as the moon,
SNG.6.10	as bright as the sun,
SNG.6.10	as wonderful as an army flying flags.
SNG.6.11	I went down into the orchard of nut trees
SNG.6.11	to see the blossoms of the valley,
SNG.6.11	to look for buds on the vines,
SNG.6.11	to see if the pomegranate trees had bloomed.
SNG.6.12	Before I realized it, my desire for you made me feel
SNG.6.12	like a prince in a chariot.
SNG.6.13	Come back, come back, woman of Shulam.
SNG.6.13	Come back, come back,
SNG.6.13	so we may look at you!
SNG.6.13	Why do you want to look at the woman of Shulam
SNG.6.13	as you would at the dance of two armies?
SNG.7.1	Your feet are beautiful in sandals,
SNG.7.1	you daughter of a prince.
SNG.7.1	Your round thighs are like jewels
SNG.7.1	shaped by an artist.
SNG.7.2	Your navel is like a round drinking cup
SNG.7.2	always filled with wine.
SNG.7.2	Your stomach is like a pile of wheat
SNG.7.2	surrounded with lilies.
SNG.7.3	Your breasts are like two fawns,
SNG.7.3	like twins of a gazelle.
SNG.7.4	Your neck is like an ivory tower.
SNG.7.4	Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon
SNG.7.4	near the gate of Bath Rabbim.
SNG.7.4	Your nose is like the mountain of Lebanon
SNG.7.4	that looks down on Damascus.
SNG.7.5	Your head is like Mount Carmel,
SNG.7.5	and your hair is like purple cloth;
SNG.7.5	the king is captured in its folds.
SNG.7.6	You are beautiful and pleasant;
SNG.7.6	my love, you are full of delights.
SNG.7.7	You are tall like a palm tree,
SNG.7.7	and your breasts are like its bunches of fruit.
SNG.7.8	I said, “I will climb up the palm tree
SNG.7.8	and take hold of its fruit.”
SNG.7.8	Let your breasts be like bunches of grapes,
SNG.7.8	the smell of your breath like apples,
SNG.7.9	and your mouth like the best wine.
SNG.7.9	Let this wine go down sweetly for my lover;
SNG.7.9	may it flow gently past the lips and teeth.
SNG.7.10	I belong to my lover,
SNG.7.10	and he desires only me.
SNG.7.11	Come, my lover,
SNG.7.11	let’s go out into the country
SNG.7.11	and spend the night in the fields.
SNG.7.12	Let’s go early to the vineyards
SNG.7.12	and see if the buds are on the vines.
SNG.7.12	Let’s see if the blossoms have already opened
SNG.7.12	and if the pomegranates have bloomed.
SNG.7.12	There I will give you my love.
SNG.7.13	The mandrake flowers give their sweet smell,
SNG.7.13	and all the best fruits are at our gates.
SNG.7.13	I have saved them for you, my lover,
SNG.7.13	the old delights and the new.
SNG.8.1	I wish you were like my brother
SNG.8.1	who fed at my mother’s breasts.
SNG.8.1	If I found you outside,
SNG.8.1	I would kiss you,
SNG.8.1	and no one would look down on me.
SNG.8.2	I would lead you and bring you
SNG.8.2	to my mother’s house;
SNG.8.2	she is the one who taught me.
SNG.8.2	I would give you a drink of spiced wine
SNG.8.2	from my pomegranates.
SNG.8.3	My lover’s left hand is under my head,
SNG.8.3	and his right arm holds me tight.
SNG.8.4	Women of Jerusalem,
SNG.8.4	promise not to awaken
SNG.8.4	or excite my feelings of love
SNG.8.4	until it is ready.
SNG.8.5	Who is this coming out of the desert,
SNG.8.5	leaning on her lover?
SNG.8.5	I woke you under the apple tree
SNG.8.5	where you were born;
SNG.8.5	there your mother gave birth to you.
SNG.8.6	Put me like a seal on your heart,
SNG.8.6	like a seal on your arm.
SNG.8.6	Love is as strong as death;
SNG.8.6	jealousy is as strong as the grave.
SNG.8.6	Love bursts into flames
SNG.8.6	and burns like a hot fire.
SNG.8.7	Even much water cannot put out the flame of love;
SNG.8.7	floods cannot drown love.
SNG.8.7	If a man offered everything in his house for love,
SNG.8.7	people would totally reject it.
SNG.8.8	We have a little sister,
SNG.8.8	and her breasts are not yet grown.
SNG.8.8	What should we do for our sister
SNG.8.8	on the day she becomes engaged?
SNG.8.9	If she is a wall,
SNG.8.9	we will put silver towers on her.
SNG.8.9	If she is a door,
SNG.8.9	we will protect her with cedar boards.
SNG.8.10	I am a wall,
SNG.8.10	and my breasts are like towers.
SNG.8.10	So I was to him,
SNG.8.10	as one who brings happiness.
SNG.8.11	Solomon had a vineyard at Baal Hamon.
SNG.8.11	He rented the vineyards for others to tend,
SNG.8.11	and everyone who rented had to pay
SNG.8.11	twenty-five pounds of silver for the fruit.
SNG.8.12	But my own vineyard is mine to give.
SNG.8.12	Solomon, the twenty-five pounds of silver are for you,
SNG.8.12	and five pounds are for those who tend the fruit.
SNG.8.13	You who live in the gardens,
SNG.8.13	my friends are listening for your voice;
SNG.8.13	let me hear it.
SNG.8.14	Hurry, my lover,
SNG.8.14	be like a gazelle
SNG.8.14	or a young deer
SNG.8.14	on the mountains where spices grow. 
ISA.1.1	This is the vision Isaiah son of Amoz saw about what would happen to Judah and Jerusalem. Isaiah saw these things while Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah.
ISA.1.2	Heaven and earth, listen,
ISA.1.2	because the L
ISA.1.2	“I raised my children and helped them grow up,
ISA.1.2	but they have turned against me.
ISA.1.3	An ox knows its master,
ISA.1.3	and a donkey knows where its owner feeds it,
ISA.1.3	but the people of Israel do not know me;
ISA.1.3	my people do not understand.”
ISA.1.4	How terrible! Israel is a nation of sin,
ISA.1.4	a people loaded down with guilt,
ISA.1.4	a group of children doing evil,
ISA.1.4	children who are full of evil.
ISA.1.4	They have left the L
ISA.1.4	they hate God, the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.1.4	and have turned away from him as if he were a stranger.
ISA.1.5	Why should you continue to be punished?
ISA.1.5	Why do you continue to turn against him?
ISA.1.5	Your whole head is hurt,
ISA.1.5	and your whole heart is sick.
ISA.1.6	There is no healthy spot
ISA.1.6	from the bottom of your foot to the top of your head;
ISA.1.6	you are covered with wounds, hurts, and open sores
ISA.1.6	that are not cleaned and covered,
ISA.1.6	and no medicine takes away the pain.
ISA.1.7	Your land is ruined;
ISA.1.7	your cities have been burned with fire.
ISA.1.7	While you watch,
ISA.1.7	your enemies are stealing everything from your land;
ISA.1.7	it is ruined like a country destroyed by enemies.
ISA.1.8	Jerusalem is left alone
ISA.1.8	like an empty shelter in a vineyard,
ISA.1.8	like a hut left in a field of melons,
ISA.1.8	like a city surrounded by enemies.
ISA.1.9	The L
ISA.1.9	allowed a few of our people to live.
ISA.1.9	Otherwise we would have been completely destroyed
ISA.1.9	like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	Jerusalem, your rulers are like those of Sodom,
ISA.1.10	and your people are like those of Gomorrah.
ISA.1.10	Hear the word of the L
ISA.1.10	listen to the teaching of our God!
ISA.1.11	The L
ISA.1.11	“I do not want all these sacrifices.
ISA.1.11	I have had enough of your burnt sacrifices
ISA.1.11	of male sheep and fat from fine animals.
ISA.1.11	I am not pleased
ISA.1.11	by the blood of bulls, lambs, and goats.
ISA.1.12	You come to meet with me,
ISA.1.12	but who asked you to do
ISA.1.12	all this running in and out of my Temple’s rooms?
ISA.1.13	Don’t continue bringing me worthless sacrifices!
ISA.1.13	I hate the incense you burn.
ISA.1.13	I can’t stand your New Moons, Sabbaths, and other feast days;
ISA.1.13	I can’t stand the evil you do in your holy meetings.
ISA.1.14	I hate your New Moon feasts
ISA.1.14	and your other yearly feasts.
ISA.1.14	They have become a heavy weight on me,
ISA.1.14	and I am tired of carrying it.
ISA.1.15	When you raise your arms to me in prayer,
ISA.1.15	I will refuse to look at you.
ISA.1.15	Even if you say many prayers,
ISA.1.15	I will not listen to you,
ISA.1.15	because your hands are full of blood.
ISA.1.16	Wash yourselves and make yourselves clean.
ISA.1.16	Stop doing the evil things I see you do.
ISA.1.16	Stop doing wrong.
ISA.1.17	Learn to do good.
ISA.1.17	Seek justice.
ISA.1.17	Punish those who hurt others.
ISA.1.17	Help the orphans.
ISA.1.17	Stand up for the rights of widows.”
ISA.1.18	The L
ISA.1.18	“Come, let us talk about these things.
ISA.1.18	Though your sins are like scarlet,
ISA.1.18	they can be as white as snow.
ISA.1.18	Though your sins are deep red,
ISA.1.18	they can be white like wool.
ISA.1.19	If you become willing and obey me,
ISA.1.19	you will eat good crops from the land.
ISA.1.20	But if you refuse to obey and if you turn against me,
ISA.1.20	you will be destroyed by your enemies’ swords.”
ISA.1.20	The L
ISA.1.21	The city of Jerusalem once followed the L
ISA.1.21	but she is no longer loyal to him.
ISA.1.21	She used to be filled with fairness;
ISA.1.21	people there lived the way God wanted.
ISA.1.21	But now, murderers live there.
ISA.1.22	Jerusalem, you have become like the scum left when silver is purified;
ISA.1.22	you are like wine mixed with water.
ISA.1.23	Your rulers are rebels
ISA.1.23	and friends of thieves.
ISA.1.23	They all accept money for doing wrong,
ISA.1.23	and they are paid to cheat people.
ISA.1.23	They don’t seek justice for the orphans
ISA.1.23	or listen to the widows’ needs.
ISA.1.24	So the Lord 
ISA.1.24	the Mighty One of Israel, says:
ISA.1.24	“You, my enemies, will not cause me any more trouble.
ISA.1.24	I will pay you back for what you did.
ISA.1.25	I will turn against you
ISA.1.25	and clean away all your wrongs as if with soap;
ISA.1.25	I will take all the worthless things out of you.
ISA.1.26	I will bring back judges as you had long ago;
ISA.1.26	your counselors will be like those you had in the beginning.
ISA.1.26	Then you will be called the City That Is Right with God,
ISA.1.26	the Loyal City.”
ISA.1.27	By doing what is fair,
ISA.1.27	Jerusalem will be free again.
ISA.1.27	By doing what is right,
ISA.1.27	her people who come back to the L
ISA.1.28	But sinners and those who turn against him will be destroyed;
ISA.1.28	those who have left the L
ISA.1.29	“You will be ashamed,
ISA.1.29	because you have worshiped gods under the oak trees.
ISA.1.29	You will be disgraced,
ISA.1.29	because you have worshiped idols in your gardens.
ISA.1.30	You will be like an oak whose leaves are dying
ISA.1.30	or like a garden without water.
ISA.1.31	Powerful people will be like small, dry pieces of wood,
ISA.1.31	and their works will be like sparks.
ISA.1.31	They will burn together,
ISA.1.31	and no one will be able to put out that fire.”
ISA.2.1	Isaiah son of Amoz saw this message about Judah and Jerusalem:
ISA.2.2	In the last days
ISA.2.2	the mountain on which the L
ISA.2.2	will become the most important of all mountains.
ISA.2.2	It will be raised above the hills,
ISA.2.2	and people from all nations will come streaming to it.
ISA.2.3	Many nations will come and say,
ISA.2.3	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the L
ISA.2.3	to the Temple of the God of Jacob.
ISA.2.3	Then God will teach us his ways,
ISA.2.3	and we will obey his teachings.”
ISA.2.3	His teachings will go out from Jerusalem;
ISA.2.3	the message of the L
ISA.2.4	He will settle arguments among the nations
ISA.2.4	and will make decisions for many nations.
ISA.2.4	Then they will make their swords into plows
ISA.2.4	and their spears into hooks for trimming trees.
ISA.2.4	Nations will no longer fight other nations,
ISA.2.4	nor will they train for war anymore.
ISA.2.5	Come, family of Jacob,
ISA.2.5	and let us follow the way of the L
ISA.2.6	L
ISA.2.6	the family of Jacob,
ISA.2.6	because they have become filled with wrong ideas from people in the East.
ISA.2.6	They try to tell the future like the Philistines,
ISA.2.6	and they have completely accepted those foreign ideas.
ISA.2.7	Their land has been filled with silver and gold;
ISA.2.7	there are a great many treasures there.
ISA.2.7	Their land has been filled with horses;
ISA.2.7	there are many chariots there.
ISA.2.8	Their land is full of idols.
ISA.2.8	The people worship these idols they made with their own hands
ISA.2.8	and shaped with their own fingers.
ISA.2.9	People will not be proud any longer
ISA.2.9	but will bow low with shame.
ISA.2.9	God, do not forgive them.
ISA.2.10	Go into the caves of the cliffs;
ISA.2.10	dig holes and hide in the ground
ISA.2.10	from the anger of the L
ISA.2.10	and from his great power!
ISA.2.11	Proud people will be made humble,
ISA.2.11	and they will bow low with shame.
ISA.2.11	At that time only the L
ISA.2.12	The L
ISA.2.12	when he will punish the proud and those who brag,
ISA.2.12	and they will no longer be important.
ISA.2.13	He will bring down the tall cedar trees from Lebanon
ISA.2.13	and the great oak trees of Bashan,
ISA.2.14	all the tall mountains
ISA.2.14	and the high hills,
ISA.2.15	every tall tower
ISA.2.15	and every high, strong wall,
ISA.2.16	all the trading ships
ISA.2.16	and the beautiful ships.
ISA.2.17	At that time proud people will be made humble,
ISA.2.17	and they will bow low with shame.
ISA.2.17	At that time only the L
ISA.2.18	but all the idols will be gone.
ISA.2.19	People will run to caves in the rocky cliffs
ISA.2.19	and will dig holes and hide in the ground
ISA.2.19	from the anger of the L
ISA.2.19	and his great power,
ISA.2.19	when he stands to shake the earth.
ISA.2.20	At that time people will throw away
ISA.2.20	their gold and silver idols,
ISA.2.20	which they made for themselves to worship;
ISA.2.20	they will throw them away to the bats and moles.
ISA.2.21	Then the people will hide in caves
ISA.2.21	and cracks in the rocks
ISA.2.21	from the anger of the L
ISA.2.21	and his great power,
ISA.2.21	when he stands to shake the earth.
ISA.2.22	You should stop trusting in people to save you,
ISA.2.22	because people are only human;
ISA.2.22	they aren’t able to help you.
ISA.3.1	Understand this:
ISA.3.1	The Lord 
ISA.3.1	will take away everything Judah and Jerusalem need—
ISA.3.1	all the food and water,
ISA.3.2	the heroes and great soldiers,
ISA.3.2	the judges and prophets,
ISA.3.2	people who do magic and elders,
ISA.3.3	the military leaders and government leaders,
ISA.3.3	the counselors, the skilled craftsmen, and those who try to tell the future.
ISA.3.4	The L
ISA.3.4	and foolish children will rule over you.
ISA.3.5	People will be against each other; everyone will be against his neighbor.
ISA.3.5	Young people will not respect older people,
ISA.3.5	and common people will not respect important people.”
ISA.3.6	At that time a man will grab one of his brothers
ISA.3.6	from his own family and say,
ISA.3.6	“You have a coat, so you will be our leader.
ISA.3.6	These ruins will be under your control.”
ISA.3.7	But that brother will stand up and say,
ISA.3.7	“I cannot help you,
ISA.3.7	because I do not have food or clothes in my house.
ISA.3.7	You will not make me your leader.”
ISA.3.8	This will happen because Jerusalem has stumbled,
ISA.3.8	and Judah has fallen.
ISA.3.8	The things they say and do are against the L
ISA.3.8	they turn against him.
ISA.3.9	The look on their faces shows they are guilty;
ISA.3.9	like the people of Sodom, they are proud of their sin.
ISA.3.9	They don’t care who sees it.
ISA.3.9	How terrible it will be for them,
ISA.3.9	because they have brought much trouble on themselves.
ISA.3.10	Tell those who do what is right that things will go well for them,
ISA.3.10	because they will receive a reward for what they do.
ISA.3.11	But how terrible it will be for the wicked!
ISA.3.11	They will be punished for all the wrong they have done.
ISA.3.12	Children treat my people cruelly,
ISA.3.12	and women rule over them.
ISA.3.12	My people, your guides lead you in the wrong way
ISA.3.12	and turn you away from what is right.
ISA.3.13	The L
ISA.3.13	and stands to judge the people.
ISA.3.14	The L
ISA.3.14	against the elders and other leaders of his people:
ISA.3.14	“You have burned the vineyard.
ISA.3.14	Your houses are full of what you took from the poor.
ISA.3.15	What gives you the right to crush my people
ISA.3.15	and grind the faces of the poor into the dirt?”
ISA.3.15	The Lord 
ISA.3.16	The L
ISA.3.16	“The women of Jerusalem are proud.
ISA.3.16	They walk around with their heads held high,
ISA.3.16	and they flirt with their eyes.
ISA.3.16	They take quick, short steps,
ISA.3.16	making noise with their ankle bracelets.”
ISA.3.17	So the Lord will put sores on the heads of those women in Jerusalem,
ISA.3.17	and he will make them lose their hair.
ISA.3.18	At that time the Lord will take away everything that makes them proud: their beautiful ankle bracelets, their headbands, their necklaces shaped like the moon, 
ISA.3.19	their earrings, bracelets, and veils, 
ISA.3.20	their scarves, ankle chains, the cloth belts worn around their waists, their bottles of perfume, and charms, 
ISA.3.21	their signet rings, nose rings, 
ISA.3.22	their fine robes, capes, shawls, and purses, 
ISA.3.23	their mirrors, linen dresses, turbans, and long shawls.
ISA.3.24	Instead of wearing sweet-smelling perfume, they will stink.
ISA.3.24	Instead of fine cloth belts, they will wear the ropes of captives.
ISA.3.24	Instead of having their hair fixed in fancy ways, they will be bald.
ISA.3.24	Instead of fine clothes, they will wear clothes of sadness.
ISA.3.24	Instead of being beautiful, they will wear the brand of a captive.
ISA.3.25	At that time your men will be killed with swords,
ISA.3.25	and your heroes will die in war.
ISA.3.26	There will be crying and sadness near the city gates.
ISA.3.26	Jerusalem will be like a woman who has lost everything and sits on the ground.
ISA.4.1	At that time seven women will grab one man
ISA.4.1	and say, “We will eat our own bread
ISA.4.1	and make our own clothes,
ISA.4.1	but please marry us!
ISA.4.1	Please, take away our shame.”
ISA.4.2	At that time the L
ISA.4.3	Those who are still living in Jerusalem will be called holy; their names are recorded among the living in Jerusalem. 
ISA.4.4	The Lord will wash away the filth from the women of Jerusalem. He will wash the bloodstains out of Jerusalem and clean the city with the spirit of fairness and the spirit of fire. 
ISA.4.5	Then the L
ISA.4.6	This covering will protect the people from the heat of the sun and will provide a safe place to hide from the storm and rain.
ISA.5.1	Now I will sing for my friend a song about his vineyard.
ISA.5.1	My friend had a vineyard
ISA.5.1	on a hill with very rich soil.
ISA.5.2	He dug and cleared the field of stones
ISA.5.2	and planted the best grapevines there.
ISA.5.2	He built a tower in the middle of it
ISA.5.2	and cut out a winepress as well.
ISA.5.2	He hoped good grapes would grow there,
ISA.5.2	but only bad ones grew.
ISA.5.3	My friend says, “You people living in Jerusalem,
ISA.5.3	and you people of Judah,
ISA.5.3	judge between me and my vineyard.
ISA.5.4	What more could I have done for my vineyard
ISA.5.4	than I have already done?
ISA.5.4	Although I expected good grapes to grow,
ISA.5.4	why were there only bad ones?
ISA.5.5	Now I will tell you
ISA.5.5	what I will do to my vineyard:
ISA.5.5	I will remove the hedge,
ISA.5.5	and it will be burned.
ISA.5.5	I will break down the stone wall,
ISA.5.5	and it will be walked on.
ISA.5.6	I will ruin my field.
ISA.5.6	It will not be trimmed or hoed,
ISA.5.6	and weeds and thorns will grow there.
ISA.5.6	I will command the clouds
ISA.5.6	not to rain on it.”
ISA.5.7	The vineyard belonging to the L
ISA.5.7	is the nation of Israel;
ISA.5.7	the garden that he loves
ISA.5.7	is the people of Judah.
ISA.5.7	He looked for justice, but there was only killing.
ISA.5.7	He hoped for right living, but there were only cries of pain.
ISA.5.8	How terrible it will be for you who add more houses to your houses
ISA.5.8	and more fields to your fields
ISA.5.8	until there is no room left for other people.
ISA.5.8	Then you are left alone in the land.
ISA.5.9	The L
ISA.5.9	“The fine houses will be destroyed;
ISA.5.9	the large and beautiful houses will be left empty.
ISA.5.10	At that time a ten-acre vineyard will make only six gallons of wine,
ISA.5.10	and ten bushels of seed will grow only half a bushel of grain.”
ISA.5.11	How terrible it will be for people who rise early in the morning
ISA.5.11	to look for strong drink,
ISA.5.11	who stay awake late at night,
ISA.5.11	becoming drunk with wine.
ISA.5.12	At their parties they have lyres, harps,
ISA.5.12	tambourines, flutes, and wine.
ISA.5.12	They don’t see what the L
ISA.5.12	or notice the work of his hands.
ISA.5.13	So my people will be captured and taken away,
ISA.5.13	because they don’t really know me.
ISA.5.13	All the great people will die of hunger,
ISA.5.13	and the common people will die of thirst.
ISA.5.14	So the place of the dead wants more and more people,
ISA.5.14	and it opens wide its mouth.
ISA.5.14	Jerusalem’s important people and common people will go down into it,
ISA.5.14	with their happy and noisy ones.
ISA.5.15	So the common people and the great people will be brought down;
ISA.5.15	those who are proud will be humbled.
ISA.5.16	The L
ISA.5.16	the holy God will show himself holy by doing what is right.
ISA.5.17	Then the sheep will go anywhere they want,
ISA.5.17	and lambs will feed on the land that rich people once owned.
ISA.5.18	How terrible it will be for those people!
ISA.5.18	They pull their guilt and sins behind them
ISA.5.18	as people pull wagons with ropes.
ISA.5.19	They say, “Let God hurry;
ISA.5.19	let him do his work soon
ISA.5.19	so we may see it.
ISA.5.19	Let the plan of the Holy One of Israel happen soon
ISA.5.19	so that we will know what it is.”
ISA.5.20	How terrible it will be for people who call good things bad
ISA.5.20	and bad things good,
ISA.5.20	who think darkness is light
ISA.5.20	and light is darkness,
ISA.5.20	who think sour is sweet
ISA.5.20	and sweet is sour.
ISA.5.21	How terrible it will be for people who think they are wise
ISA.5.21	and believe they are clever.
ISA.5.22	How terrible it will be for people who are famous for drinking wine
ISA.5.22	and are champions at mixing drinks.
ISA.5.23	They take money to set the guilty free
ISA.5.23	and don’t allow good people to be judged fairly.
ISA.5.24	They will be destroyed
ISA.5.24	just as fire burns straw or dry grass.
ISA.5.24	They will be destroyed
ISA.5.24	like a plant whose roots rot
ISA.5.24	and whose flower dies and blows away like dust.
ISA.5.24	They have refused to obey the teachings of the L
ISA.5.24	and have hated the message from the Holy God of Israel.
ISA.5.25	So the L
ISA.5.25	and he has raised his hand to punish them.
ISA.5.25	Even the mountains are frightened.
ISA.5.25	Dead bodies lie in the streets like garbage.
ISA.5.25	But the L
ISA.5.25	his hand is still raised to strike down the people.
ISA.5.26	He raises a banner for the nations far away.
ISA.5.26	He whistles to call those people from the ends of the earth.
ISA.5.26	Look! The enemy comes quickly!
ISA.5.27	Not one of them becomes tired or falls down.
ISA.5.27	Not one of them gets sleepy and falls asleep.
ISA.5.27	Their weapons are close at hand,
ISA.5.27	and their sandal straps are not broken.
ISA.5.28	Their arrows are sharp,
ISA.5.28	and all of their bows are ready to shoot.
ISA.5.28	The horses’ hoofs are hard as rocks,
ISA.5.28	and their chariot wheels move like a whirlwind.
ISA.5.29	Their shout is like the roar of a lion;
ISA.5.29	it is loud like a young lion.
ISA.5.29	They growl as they grab their captives.
ISA.5.29	There is no one to stop them from taking their captives away.
ISA.5.30	On that day they will roar
ISA.5.30	like the waves of the sea.
ISA.5.30	And when people look at the land,
ISA.5.30	they will see only darkness and pain;
ISA.5.30	all light will become dark in this thick cloud.
ISA.6.1	In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a very high throne. His long robe filled the Temple. 
ISA.6.2	Heavenly creatures of fire stood above him. Each creature had six wings: It used two wings to cover its face, two wings to cover its feet, and two wings for flying. 
ISA.6.3	Each creature was calling to the others:
ISA.6.3	“Holy, holy, holy is the L
ISA.6.3	His glory fills the whole earth.”
ISA.6.4	Their calling caused the frame around the door to shake, as the Temple filled with smoke.
ISA.6.5	I said, “Oh, no! I will be destroyed. I am not pure, and I live among people who are not pure, but I have seen the King, the L
ISA.6.6	One of the heavenly creatures used a pair of tongs to take a hot coal from the altar. Then he flew to me with the hot coal in his hand. 
ISA.6.7	The creature touched my mouth with the hot coal and said, “Look, your guilt is taken away, because this hot coal has touched your lips. Your sin is taken away.”
ISA.6.8	Then I heard the Lord’s voice, saying, “Whom can I send? Who will go for us?”
ISA.6.8	So I said, “Here I am. Send me!”
ISA.6.9	Then the Lord said, “Go and tell this to the people:
ISA.6.9	‘You will listen and listen, but you will not understand.
ISA.6.9	You will look and look, but you will not learn.’
ISA.6.10	Make the minds of these people dumb.
ISA.6.10	Shut their ears. Cover their eyes.
ISA.6.10	Otherwise, they might really understand
ISA.6.10	what they see with their eyes
ISA.6.10	and hear with their ears.
ISA.6.10	They might really understand in their minds
ISA.6.10	and come back to me and be healed.”
ISA.6.11	Then I asked, “Lord, how long should I do this?”
ISA.6.11	He answered,
ISA.6.11	“Until the cities are destroyed
ISA.6.11	and the people are gone,
ISA.6.11	until there are no people left in the houses,
ISA.6.11	until the land is destroyed and left empty.
ISA.6.12	The L
ISA.6.12	and the land will be left empty.
ISA.6.13	One-tenth of the people will be left in the land,
ISA.6.13	but it will be destroyed again.
ISA.6.13	These people will be like an oak tree
ISA.6.13	whose stump is left when the tree is chopped down.
ISA.6.13	The people who remain will be like a stump that will sprout again.”
ISA.7.1	Now Ahaz was the son of Jotham, who was the son of Uzziah. When Ahaz was king of Judah, Rezin king of Aram and Pekah son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, went up to Jerusalem to fight against it. But they were not able to defeat the city.
ISA.7.2	Ahaz king of Judah received a message saying, “The armies of Aram and Israel have joined together.”
ISA.7.2	When Ahaz heard this, he and the people were frightened. They shook with fear like trees of the forest blown by the wind.
ISA.7.3	Then the L
ISA.7.4	Tell Ahaz, ‘Be careful. Be calm and don’t worry. Don’t let those two men, Rezin and Pekah son of Remaliah, scare you. Don’t be afraid of their anger or Aram’s anger, because they are like two barely burning sticks that are ready to go out. 
ISA.7.5	They have made plans against you, saying, 
ISA.7.6	“Let’s fight against Judah and tear it apart. We will divide the land for ourselves and make the son of Tabeel the new king of Judah.” 
ISA.7.7	But I, the Lord 
ISA.7.7	“ ‘Their plan will not succeed;
ISA.7.7	it will not happen,
ISA.7.8	because Aram is led by the city of Damascus,
ISA.7.8	and Damascus is led by its weak king, Rezin.
ISA.7.8	Within sixty-five years Israel will no longer be a nation.
ISA.7.9	Israel is led by the city of Samaria,
ISA.7.9	and Samaria is led by its weak king, the son of Remaliah.
ISA.7.9	If your faith is not strong,
ISA.7.9	you will not have strength enough to last.’ ”
ISA.7.10	Then the L
ISA.7.11	“Ask for a sign from the L
ISA.7.12	But Ahaz said, “I will not ask for a sign or test the L
ISA.7.13	Then Isaiah said, “Ahaz, descendant of David, listen carefully! Isn’t it bad enough that you wear out the patience of people? Do you also have to wear out the patience of my God? 
ISA.7.14	The Lord himself will give you a sign: The virgin will be pregnant. She will have a son, and she will name him Immanuel. 
ISA.7.15	He will be eating milk curds and honey when he learns to reject what is evil and to choose what is good. 
ISA.7.16	You are afraid of the kings of Israel and Aram now. But before the child learns to choose good and reject evil, the lands of Israel and Aram will be empty. 
ISA.7.17	The L
ISA.7.18	“At that time the L
ISA.7.19	These enemies will camp in the deep ravines and in the cliffs, by the thornbushes and watering holes. 
ISA.7.20	The Lord will hire Assyria and use it like a razor to punish Judah. It will be as if the Lord is shaving the hair from Judah’s head and legs and removing Judah’s beard.
ISA.7.21	“At that time a person will be able to keep only one young cow and two sheep alive. 
ISA.7.22	There will be only enough milk for that person to eat milk curds. All who remain in the land will go back to eating just milk curds and honey. 
ISA.7.23	In this land there are now vineyards that have a thousand grapevines, which are worth about twenty-five pounds of silver. But these fields will become full of weeds and thorns. 
ISA.7.24	The land will become wild and useful only as a hunting ground. 
ISA.7.25	People once worked and grew food on these hills, but at that time people will not go there, because the land will be filled with weeds and thorns. Only sheep and cattle will go to those places.”
ISA.8.1	The L
ISA.8.2	I will gather some men to be reliable witnesses: Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
ISA.8.3	Then I went to the prophetess, and she became pregnant and had a son. The L
ISA.8.4	because the king of Assyria will take away all the wealth and possessions of Damascus and Samaria before the boy learns to say ‘my father’ or ‘my mother.’ ”
ISA.8.5	Again the L
ISA.8.6	“These people refuse to accept
ISA.8.6	the slow-moving waters of the pool of Shiloah
ISA.8.6	and are terrified of Rezin
ISA.8.6	and Pekah son of Remaliah.
ISA.8.7	So I, the Lord, will bring
ISA.8.7	the king of Assyria and all his power against them,
ISA.8.7	like a powerful flood of water from the Euphrates River.
ISA.8.7	The Assyrians will be like water rising over the banks of the river,
ISA.8.7	flowing over the land.
ISA.8.8	That water will flow into Judah and pass through it,
ISA.8.8	rising to Judah’s throat.
ISA.8.8	Immanuel, this army will spread its wings like a bird
ISA.8.8	until it covers your whole country.”
ISA.8.9	Be broken, all you nations,
ISA.8.9	and be smashed to pieces.
ISA.8.9	Listen, all you faraway countries.
ISA.8.9	Prepare for battle and be smashed to pieces!
ISA.8.9	Prepare for battle and be smashed to pieces!
ISA.8.10	Make your plans for the fight,
ISA.8.10	but they will be defeated.
ISA.8.10	Give orders to your armies,
ISA.8.10	but they will be useless,
ISA.8.10	because God is with us.
ISA.8.11	The L
ISA.8.12	“People are saying that others make plans against them,
ISA.8.12	but you should not believe them.
ISA.8.12	Don’t be afraid of what they fear;
ISA.8.12	do not dread those things.
ISA.8.13	But remember that the L
ISA.8.13	He is the one you should fear;
ISA.8.13	he is the one you should dread.
ISA.8.14	Then he will be a place of safety for you.
ISA.8.14	But for the two families of Israel,
ISA.8.14	he will be like a stone that causes people to stumble,
ISA.8.14	like a rock that makes them fall.
ISA.8.14	He will be like a trap for the people of Jerusalem,
ISA.8.14	and he will catch them in his trap.
ISA.8.15	Many people will fall over this rock.
ISA.8.15	They will fall and be broken;
ISA.8.15	they will be trapped and caught.”
ISA.8.16	Make an agreement.
ISA.8.16	Seal up the teaching while my followers are watching.
ISA.8.17	I will wait for the L
ISA.8.17	the L
ISA.8.17	I will wait for him.
ISA.8.18	I am here, and with me are the children the L
ISA.8.19	Some people say, “Ask the mediums and fortune-tellers, who whisper and mutter, what to do.” But I tell you that people should ask their God for help. Why should people who are still alive ask something from the dead? 
ISA.8.20	You should follow the teachings and the agreement with the L
ISA.8.21	People will wander through the land troubled and hungry. When they become hungry, they will become angry and will look up and curse their king and their God. 
ISA.8.22	They will look around them at their land and see only trouble, darkness, and awful gloom. And they will be forced into the darkness.
ISA.9.1	But suddenly there will be no more gloom for the land that suffered. In the past God made the lands of Zebulun and Naphtali hang their heads in shame, but in the future those lands will be made great. They will stretch from the road along the Mediterranean Sea to the land beyond the Jordan River and north to Galilee, the land of people who are not Israelites.
ISA.9.2	Before those people lived in darkness,
ISA.9.2	but now they have seen a great light.
ISA.9.2	They lived in a dark land,
ISA.9.2	but a light has shined on them.
ISA.9.3	God, you have caused the nation to grow
ISA.9.3	and made the people happy.
ISA.9.3	And they have shown their happiness to you,
ISA.9.3	like the joy during harvest time,
ISA.9.3	like the joy of people
ISA.9.3	taking what they have won in war.
ISA.9.4	Like the time you defeated Midian,
ISA.9.4	you have taken away their heavy load
ISA.9.4	and the heavy pole from their backs
ISA.9.4	and the rod the enemy used to punish them.
ISA.9.5	Every boot that marched in battle
ISA.9.5	and every uniform stained with blood
ISA.9.5	has been thrown into the fire.
ISA.9.6	A child has been born to us;
ISA.9.6	God has given a son to us.
ISA.9.6	He will be responsible for leading the people.
ISA.9.6	His name will be Wonderful Counselor, Powerful God,
ISA.9.6	Father Who Lives Forever, Prince of Peace.
ISA.9.7	Power and peace will be in his kingdom
ISA.9.7	and will continue to grow forever.
ISA.9.7	He will rule as king on David’s throne
ISA.9.7	and over David’s kingdom.
ISA.9.7	He will make it strong
ISA.9.7	by ruling with justice and goodness
ISA.9.7	from now on and forever.
ISA.9.7	The L
ISA.9.7	because of his strong love for his people.
ISA.9.8	The Lord sent a message against the people of Jacob;
ISA.9.8	it says that God will judge Israel.
ISA.9.9	Then everyone in Israel, even the leaders in Samaria,
ISA.9.9	will know that God has sent it.
ISA.9.9	Those people are proud and brag by saying,
ISA.9.10	“These bricks have fallen,
ISA.9.10	but we will build again with cut stones.
ISA.9.10	These small trees have been chopped down,
ISA.9.10	but we will put great cedars there.”
ISA.9.11	But the L
ISA.9.11	he has stirred up their enemies against them.
ISA.9.12	The Arameans came from the east
ISA.9.12	and the Philistines from the west,
ISA.9.12	and they ate up Israel with their armies.
ISA.9.12	But the L
ISA.9.12	his hand was still raised to punish the people.
ISA.9.13	But the people did not return to the one who had struck them;
ISA.9.13	they did not follow the L
ISA.9.14	So the L
ISA.9.14	taking away both the branch and stalk in one day.
ISA.9.15	The elders and important men were the head,
ISA.9.15	and the prophets who speak lies were the tail.
ISA.9.16	Those who led the people led them in the wrong direction,
ISA.9.16	and those who followed them were destroyed.
ISA.9.17	So the Lord is not happy with the young people,
ISA.9.17	nor will he show mercy to the orphans and widows.
ISA.9.17	All the people are separated from God and are very evil;
ISA.9.17	they all speak lies.
ISA.9.17	But the L
ISA.9.17	his hand is still raised to strike down the people.
ISA.9.18	Evil is like a small fire.
ISA.9.18	First, it burns weeds and thorns.
ISA.9.18	Next, it burns the larger bushes in the forest,
ISA.9.18	and they all go up in a column of smoke.
ISA.9.19	The L
ISA.9.19	so the land will be burned.
ISA.9.19	The people are like fuel for the fire;
ISA.9.19	no one will try to save his brother or sister.
ISA.9.20	People will grab something on the right,
ISA.9.20	but they will still be hungry.
ISA.9.20	They will eat something on the left,
ISA.9.20	but they will not be filled.
ISA.9.20	Then they will each turn and eat their own children.
ISA.9.21	The people of Manasseh will fight against the people of Ephraim,
ISA.9.21	and Ephraim will fight against Manasseh.
ISA.9.21	Then both of them will turn against Judah.
ISA.9.21	But the L
ISA.9.21	his hand is still raised to strike down the people.
ISA.10.1	How terrible it will be for those who make unfair laws,
ISA.10.1	and those who write laws that make life hard for people.
ISA.10.2	They are not fair to the poor,
ISA.10.2	and they rob my people of their rights.
ISA.10.2	They allow people to steal from widows
ISA.10.2	and to take from orphans what really belongs to them.
ISA.10.3	How will you explain the things you have done?
ISA.10.3	What will you do when your destruction comes from far away?
ISA.10.3	Where will you run for help?
ISA.10.3	Where will you hide your riches then?
ISA.10.4	You will have to bow down among the captives
ISA.10.4	or fall down among the dead bodies.
ISA.10.4	But the L
ISA.10.4	his hand is still raised to strike down the people.
ISA.10.5	God says, “How terrible it will be for the king of Assyria.
ISA.10.5	I use him like a rod to show my anger;
ISA.10.5	in anger I use Assyria like a club.
ISA.10.6	I send it to fight against a nation that is separated from God.
ISA.10.6	I am angry with those people,
ISA.10.6	so I command Assyria to fight against them,
ISA.10.6	to take their wealth from them,
ISA.10.6	to trample them down like dirt in the streets.
ISA.10.7	But Assyria’s king doesn’t understand that I am using him;
ISA.10.7	he doesn’t know he is a tool for me.
ISA.10.7	He only wants to destroy other people
ISA.10.7	and to defeat many nations.
ISA.10.8	The king of Assyria says to himself,
ISA.10.8	‘All of my commanders are like kings.
ISA.10.9	The city Calno is like the city Carchemish.
ISA.10.9	The city Hamath is like the city Arpad.
ISA.10.9	The city Samaria is like the city Damascus.
ISA.10.10	I defeated those kingdoms that worship idols,
ISA.10.10	and those idols were more than the idols of Jerusalem and Samaria.
ISA.10.11	As I defeated Samaria and her idols,
ISA.10.11	I will also defeat Jerusalem and her idols.’ ”
ISA.10.12	When the Lord finishes doing what he planned to Mount Zion and Jerusalem, he will punish Assyria. The king of Assyria is very proud, and his pride has made him do these evil things, so God will punish him. 
ISA.10.13	The king of Assyria says this:
ISA.10.13	“By my own power I have done these things;
ISA.10.13	by my wisdom I have defeated many nations.
ISA.10.13	I have taken their wealth,
ISA.10.13	and, like a mighty one, I have taken their people.
ISA.10.14	I have taken the riches of all these people,
ISA.10.14	like a person reaching into a bird’s nest.
ISA.10.14	I have taken these nations,
ISA.10.14	like a person taking eggs.
ISA.10.14	Not one raised a hand
ISA.10.14	or opened its mouth to stop me.”
ISA.10.15	An ax is not better than the person who swings it.
ISA.10.15	A saw is not better than the one who uses it.
ISA.10.15	A stick cannot control the person who picks it up.
ISA.10.15	A club cannot pick up the person!
ISA.10.16	So the Lord 
ISA.10.16	will send a terrible disease upon Assyria’s soldiers.
ISA.10.16	The strength of Assyria will be burned up
ISA.10.16	like a fire burning until everything is gone.
ISA.10.17	God, the Light of Israel, will be like a fire;
ISA.10.17	the Holy One will be like a flame.
ISA.10.17	He will be like a fire
ISA.10.17	that suddenly burns the weeds and thorns.
ISA.10.18	The fire burns away the great trees and rich farmlands,
ISA.10.18	destroying everything.
ISA.10.18	It will be like a sick person who wastes away.
ISA.10.19	The trees left standing will be so few
ISA.10.19	that even a child could count them.
ISA.10.20	At that time some people will be left alive in Israel
ISA.10.20	from the family of Jacob.
ISA.10.20	They will not continue to depend
ISA.10.20	on the person who defeated them.
ISA.10.20	They will learn truly to depend on the L
ISA.10.20	the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.10.21	Those who are left alive in Jacob’s family
ISA.10.21	will again follow the powerful God.
ISA.10.22	Israel, your people are many,
ISA.10.22	like the grains of sand by the sea.
ISA.10.22	But only a few of them will be left alive to return to the L
ISA.10.22	God has announced that he will destroy the land
ISA.10.22	completely and fairly.
ISA.10.23	The Lord 
ISA.10.23	as he has announced.
ISA.10.24	This is what the Lord 
ISA.10.24	“My people living in Jerusalem,
ISA.10.24	don’t be afraid of the Assyrians,
ISA.10.24	who beat you with a rod
ISA.10.24	and raise a stick against you, as Egypt did.
ISA.10.25	After a short time my anger against you will stop,
ISA.10.25	and then I will turn my anger to destroying them.”
ISA.10.26	Then the L
ISA.10.26	as he defeated Midian at the rock of Oreb.
ISA.10.26	He will raise his stick over the waters
ISA.10.26	as he did in Egypt.
ISA.10.27	Then the troubles that Assyria puts on you
ISA.10.27	will be removed,
ISA.10.27	and the load they make you carry
ISA.10.27	will be taken away.
ISA.10.28	The army of Assyria will enter near Aiath.
ISA.10.28	Its soldiers will walk through Migron.
ISA.10.28	They will store their food in Micmash.
ISA.10.29	The army will go over the pass.
ISA.10.29	The soldiers will sleep at Geba.
ISA.10.29	The people of Ramah will be afraid,
ISA.10.29	and the people at Gibeah of Saul will run away.
ISA.10.30	Cry out, Bath Gallim!
ISA.10.30	Laishah, listen!
ISA.10.30	Poor Anathoth!
ISA.10.31	The people of Madmenah are running away;
ISA.10.31	the people of Gebim are hiding.
ISA.10.32	This day the army will stop at Nob.
ISA.10.32	They will shake their fist at Mount Zion,
ISA.10.32	at the hill of Jerusalem.
ISA.10.33	Watch! The Lord 
ISA.10.33	with his great power will chop them down like a great tree.
ISA.10.33	Those who are great will be cut down;
ISA.10.33	those who are important will fall to the ground.
ISA.10.34	He will cut them down
ISA.10.34	as a forest is cut down with an ax.
ISA.10.34	And the great trees of Lebanon
ISA.10.34	will fall by the power of the Mighty One.
ISA.11.1	A new branch will grow
ISA.11.1	from a stump of a tree;
ISA.11.1	so a new king will come
ISA.11.1	from the family of Jesse.
ISA.11.2	The Spirit of the L
ISA.11.2	The Spirit will give him wisdom and understanding, guidance and power.
ISA.11.2	The Spirit will teach him to know and respect the L
ISA.11.3	This king will be glad to obey the L
ISA.11.3	He will not judge by the way things look
ISA.11.3	or decide by what he hears.
ISA.11.4	But he will judge the poor honestly;
ISA.11.4	he will be fair in his decisions for the poor people of the land.
ISA.11.4	At his command evil people will be punished,
ISA.11.4	and by his words the wicked will be put to death.
ISA.11.5	Goodness and fairness will give him strength,
ISA.11.5	like a belt around his waist.
ISA.11.6	Then wolves will live in peace with lambs,
ISA.11.6	and leopards will lie down to rest with goats.
ISA.11.6	Calves, lions, and young bulls will eat together,
ISA.11.6	and a little child will lead them.
ISA.11.7	Cows and bears will eat together in peace.
ISA.11.7	Their young will lie down to rest together.
ISA.11.7	Lions will eat hay as oxen do.
ISA.11.8	A baby will be able to play near a cobra’s hole,
ISA.11.8	and a child will be able to put his hand into the nest of a poisonous snake.
ISA.11.9	They will not hurt or destroy each other
ISA.11.9	on all my holy mountain,
ISA.11.9	because the earth will be full of the knowledge of the L
ISA.11.9	as the sea is full of water.
ISA.11.10	At that time the new king from the family of Jesse will stand as a banner for all peoples. The nations will come together around him, and the place where he lives will be filled with glory. 
ISA.11.11	At that time the Lord will again reach out and take his people who are left alive in Assyria, North Egypt, South Egypt, Cush, Elam, Babylonia, Hamath, and all the islands of the sea.
ISA.11.12	God will raise a banner as a sign for all nations,
ISA.11.12	and he will gather the people of Israel who were forced from their country.
ISA.11.12	He will gather the scattered people of Judah
ISA.11.12	from all parts of the earth.
ISA.11.13	At that time Israel will not be jealous anymore,
ISA.11.13	and Judah will have no more enemies.
ISA.11.13	Israel will not be jealous of Judah,
ISA.11.13	and Judah will not hate Israel.
ISA.11.14	But Israel and Judah will attack the Philistines on the west.
ISA.11.14	Together they will take the riches from the people of the east.
ISA.11.14	They will conquer Edom and Moab,
ISA.11.14	and the people of Ammon will be under their control.
ISA.11.15	The L
ISA.11.15	the Red Sea of Egypt.
ISA.11.15	He will wave his arm over the Euphrates River
ISA.11.15	and dry it up with a scorching wind.
ISA.11.15	He will divide it into seven small rivers
ISA.11.15	so that people can walk across them with their sandals on.
ISA.11.16	So God’s people who are left alive
ISA.11.16	will have a way to leave Assyria,
ISA.11.16	just like the time the Israelites
ISA.11.16	came out of Egypt.
ISA.12.1	At that time you will say:
ISA.12.1	“I praise you, L
ISA.12.1	You were angry with me,
ISA.12.1	but you are not angry with me now!
ISA.12.1	You have comforted me.
ISA.12.2	God is the one who saves me;
ISA.12.2	I will trust him and not be afraid.
ISA.12.2	The L
ISA.12.2	He has saved me.”
ISA.12.3	You will receive your salvation with joy
ISA.12.3	as you would draw water from a well.
ISA.12.4	At that time you will say,
ISA.12.4	“Praise the L
ISA.12.4	Tell everyone what he has done
ISA.12.4	and how great he is.
ISA.12.5	Sing praise to the L
ISA.12.5	Let all the world know what he has done.
ISA.12.6	Shout and sing for joy, you people of Jerusalem,
ISA.12.6	because the Holy One of Israel does great things before your eyes.”
ISA.13.1	God showed Isaiah son of Amoz this message about Babylon:
ISA.13.2	Raise a flag on the bare mountain.
ISA.13.2	Call out to the men.
ISA.13.2	Raise your hand to signal them
ISA.13.2	to enter through the gates for important people.
ISA.13.3	I myself have commanded those people
ISA.13.3	whom I have separated as mine.
ISA.13.3	I have called those warriors to carry out my anger.
ISA.13.3	They rejoice and are glad to do my will.
ISA.13.4	Listen to the loud noise in the mountains,
ISA.13.4	the sound of many people.
ISA.13.4	Listen to the noise among the kingdoms,
ISA.13.4	the sound of nations gathering together.
ISA.13.4	The L
ISA.13.4	his army together for battle.
ISA.13.5	This army is coming from a faraway land,
ISA.13.5	from the edge of the horizon.
ISA.13.5	In anger the L
ISA.13.5	to destroy the whole country.
ISA.13.6	Cry, because the L
ISA.13.6	the Almighty is sending destruction.
ISA.13.7	People will be weak with fear,
ISA.13.7	and their courage will melt away.
ISA.13.8	Everyone will be afraid.
ISA.13.8	Pain and hurt will grab them;
ISA.13.8	they will hurt like a woman giving birth to a baby.
ISA.13.8	They will look at each other in fear,
ISA.13.8	with their faces red like fire.
ISA.13.9	Look, the L
ISA.13.9	a terrible day, a day of God’s anger.
ISA.13.9	He will destroy the land
ISA.13.9	and the sinners who live in it.
ISA.13.10	The stars will not show their light;
ISA.13.10	the skies will be dark.
ISA.13.10	The sun will grow dark as it rises,
ISA.13.10	and the moon will not give its light.
ISA.13.11	The L
ISA.13.11	and wicked people for their sins.
ISA.13.11	I will cause proud people to lose their pride,
ISA.13.11	and I will destroy the pride of those who are cruel to others.
ISA.13.12	People will be harder to find than pure gold;
ISA.13.12	there will be fewer people than there is fine gold in Ophir.
ISA.13.13	I will make the sky shake,
ISA.13.13	and the earth will be moved from its place
ISA.13.13	by the anger of the L
ISA.13.13	at the time of his burning anger.
ISA.13.14	“Then the people from Babylon will run away like hunted deer
ISA.13.14	or like sheep who have no shepherd.
ISA.13.14	Everyone will turn back to his own people;
ISA.13.14	each will run back to his own land.
ISA.13.15	Everyone who is captured will be killed;
ISA.13.15	everyone who is caught will be killed with a sword.
ISA.13.16	Their little children will be beaten to death in front of them.
ISA.13.16	Their houses will be robbed
ISA.13.16	and their wives raped.
ISA.13.17	“Look, I will cause the armies of Media to attack Babylon.
ISA.13.17	They do not care about silver
ISA.13.17	or delight in gold.
ISA.13.18	Their soldiers will shoot the young men with arrows;
ISA.13.18	they will show no mercy on children,
ISA.13.18	nor will they feel sorry for little ones.
ISA.13.19	Babylon is the most beautiful of all kingdoms,
ISA.13.19	and the Babylonians are very proud of it.
ISA.13.19	But God will destroy it
ISA.13.19	like Sodom and Gomorrah.
ISA.13.20	No one will ever live there
ISA.13.20	or settle there again.
ISA.13.20	No Arab will put a tent there;
ISA.13.20	no shepherd will bring sheep there.
ISA.13.21	Only desert animals will live there,
ISA.13.21	and their houses will be full of wild dogs.
ISA.13.21	Owls will live there,
ISA.13.21	and wild goats will leap about in the houses.
ISA.13.22	Wolves will howl within the strong walls,
ISA.13.22	and wild dogs will bark in the beautiful buildings.
ISA.13.22	The end of Babylon is near;
ISA.13.22	its time is almost over.”
ISA.14.1	The L
ISA.14.2	Nations will take the Israelites back to their land. Then those men and women from the other nations will become slaves to Israel in the L
ISA.14.3	The L
ISA.14.4	On that day Israel will sing this song about the king of Babylon:
ISA.14.4	The cruel king who ruled us is finished;
ISA.14.4	his angry rule is finished!
ISA.14.5	The L
ISA.14.5	and taken away their power.
ISA.14.6	The king of Babylon struck people in anger
ISA.14.6	again and again.
ISA.14.6	He ruled nations in anger
ISA.14.6	and continued to hurt them.
ISA.14.7	But now, the whole world rests and is quiet.
ISA.14.7	Now the people begin to sing.
ISA.14.8	Even the pine trees are happy,
ISA.14.8	and the cedar trees of Lebanon rejoice.
ISA.14.8	They say, “The king has fallen,
ISA.14.8	so no one will ever cut us down again.”
ISA.14.9	The place of the dead is excited
ISA.14.9	to meet you when you come.
ISA.14.9	It wakes the spirits of the dead,
ISA.14.9	the leaders of the world.
ISA.14.9	It makes kings of all nations
ISA.14.9	stand up from their thrones to greet you.
ISA.14.10	All these leaders will make fun of you
ISA.14.10	and will say,
ISA.14.10	“Now you are weak, as we are.
ISA.14.10	Now you are just like us.”
ISA.14.11	Your pride has been sent down to the place of the dead.
ISA.14.11	The music from your harps goes with it.
ISA.14.11	Flies are spread out like your bed beneath you,
ISA.14.11	and worms cover your body like a blanket.
ISA.14.12	King of Babylon, morning star, you have fallen from heaven,
ISA.14.12	even though you were as bright as the rising sun!
ISA.14.12	In the past all the nations on earth bowed down before you,
ISA.14.12	but now you have been cut down.
ISA.14.13	You told yourself,
ISA.14.13	“I will go up to heaven.
ISA.14.13	I will put my throne
ISA.14.13	above God’s stars.
ISA.14.13	I will sit on the mountain of the gods,
ISA.14.13	on the slopes of the sacred mountain.
ISA.14.14	I will go up above the tops of the clouds.
ISA.14.14	I will be like God Most High.”
ISA.14.15	But you were brought down to the grave,
ISA.14.15	to the deep places where the dead are.
ISA.14.16	Those who see you stare at you.
ISA.14.16	They think about what has happened to you
ISA.14.16	and say, “Is this the same man who caused great fear on earth,
ISA.14.16	who shook the kingdoms,
ISA.14.17	who turned the world into a desert,
ISA.14.17	who destroyed its cities,
ISA.14.17	who captured people in war
ISA.14.17	and would not let them go home?”
ISA.14.18	Every king of the earth has been buried with honor,
ISA.14.18	each in his own grave.
ISA.14.19	But you are thrown out of your grave,
ISA.14.19	like an unwanted branch.
ISA.14.19	You are covered by bodies
ISA.14.19	that died in battle,
ISA.14.19	by bodies to be buried in a rocky pit.
ISA.14.19	You are like a dead body other soldiers walk on.
ISA.14.20	You will not be buried with those bodies,
ISA.14.20	because you ruined your own country
ISA.14.20	and killed your own people.
ISA.14.20	The children of evil people
ISA.14.20	will never be mentioned again.
ISA.14.21	Prepare to kill his children,
ISA.14.21	because their father is guilty.
ISA.14.21	They will never again take control of the earth;
ISA.14.21	they will never again fill the world with their cities.

ISA.14.22	“I will fight against those people;

ISA.14.25	He placed a heavy load on my people,

ISA.14.28	This message was given in the year that King Ahaz died:
ISA.14.29	Country of Philistia, don’t be happy
ISA.14.29	that the king who struck you is now dead.
ISA.14.29	He is like a snake that will give birth to another dangerous snake.
ISA.14.29	The new king will be like a quick, dangerous snake to bite you.
ISA.14.30	Even the poorest of my people will be able to eat safely,
ISA.14.30	and people in need will be able to lie down in safety.
ISA.14.30	But I will kill your family with hunger,
ISA.14.30	and all your people who are left will die.
ISA.14.31	People near the city gates, cry out!
ISA.14.31	Philistines, be frightened,
ISA.14.31	because a cloud of dust comes from the north.
ISA.14.31	It is an army, full of men ready to fight.
ISA.14.32	What shall we tell the messengers from Philistia?
ISA.14.32	Say that the L
ISA.14.32	and that his poor people will go there for safety.
ISA.15.1	This is a message about Moab:
ISA.15.1	In one night armies took the wealth from Ar in Moab,
ISA.15.1	and it was destroyed.
ISA.15.1	In one night armies took the wealth from Kir in Moab,
ISA.15.1	and it was destroyed.
ISA.15.2	The people of Dibon go to the places of worship to cry.
ISA.15.2	The people of Moab cry for the cities of Nebo and Medeba.
ISA.15.2	Every head and beard has been shaved to show how sad Moab is.
ISA.15.3	In the streets they wear rough cloth to show their sadness.
ISA.15.3	On the roofs and in the public squares,
ISA.15.3	they are crying loudly.
ISA.15.4	People in the cities Heshbon and Elealeh cry out loud.
ISA.15.4	You can hear their voices far away in the city Jahaz.
ISA.15.4	Even the soldiers are frightened;
ISA.15.4	they are shaking with fear.
ISA.15.5	My heart cries with sorrow for Moab.
ISA.15.5	Its people run away to Zoar for safety;
ISA.15.5	they run to Eglath Shelishiyah.
ISA.15.5	People are going up the mountain road to Luhith,
ISA.15.5	crying as they go.
ISA.15.5	People are going on the road to Horonaim,
ISA.15.5	crying over their destruction.
ISA.15.6	But the water of Nimrim has dried up.
ISA.15.6	The grass has dried up,
ISA.15.6	and all the plants are dead;
ISA.15.6	nothing green is left.
ISA.15.7	So the people gather up what they have saved
ISA.15.7	and carry it across the Ravine of the Poplars.
ISA.15.8	Crying is heard everywhere in Moab.
ISA.15.8	Their crying is heard as far away as the city Eglaim;
ISA.15.8	it is heard as far away as Beer Elim.
ISA.15.9	The water of the city Dibon is full of blood,
ISA.15.9	and I, the L
ISA.15.9	A few people living in Moab have escaped the enemy,
ISA.15.9	but I will send lions to kill them.
ISA.16.1	Send the king of the land
ISA.16.1	the payment he demands.
ISA.16.1	Send a lamb from Sela through the desert
ISA.16.1	to the mountain of Jerusalem.
ISA.16.2	The women of Moab
ISA.16.2	try to cross the river Arnon
ISA.16.2	like little birds
ISA.16.2	that have fallen from their nest.
ISA.16.3	They say: “Help us.
ISA.16.3	Tell us what to do.
ISA.16.3	Protect us from our enemies
ISA.16.3	as shade protects us from the noon sun.
ISA.16.3	Hide us, because we are running for safety!
ISA.16.3	Don’t give us to our enemies.
ISA.16.4	Let those of us who were forced out of Moab live in your land.
ISA.16.4	Hide us from our enemies.”
ISA.16.4	The robbing of Moab will stop.
ISA.16.4	The enemy will be defeated;
ISA.16.4	those who hurt others will disappear from the land.
ISA.16.5	Then a new loyal king will come;
ISA.16.5	this faithful king will be from the family of David.
ISA.16.5	He will judge fairly
ISA.16.5	and do what is right.
ISA.16.6	We have heard that the people of Moab are proud
ISA.16.6	and very conceited.
ISA.16.6	They are very proud and angry,
ISA.16.6	but their bragging means nothing.
ISA.16.7	So the people of Moab will cry;
ISA.16.7	they will all be sad.
ISA.16.7	They will moan and groan
ISA.16.7	for the raisin cakes they had in Kir Hareseth.
ISA.16.8	But the fields of Heshbon and the vines of Sibmah cannot grow grapes;
ISA.16.8	foreign rulers have destroyed the grapevines.
ISA.16.8	The grapevines once spread as far as the city of Jazer and into the desert;
ISA.16.8	they had spread as far as the sea.
ISA.16.9	I cry with the people of Jazer
ISA.16.9	for the grapevines of Sibmah.
ISA.16.9	I will cry with the people of Heshbon and Elealeh.
ISA.16.9	There will be no shouts of joy,
ISA.16.9	because there will be no harvest or ripe fruit.
ISA.16.10	There will be no joy and happiness in the orchards
ISA.16.10	and no songs or shouts of joy in the vineyards.
ISA.16.10	No one makes wine in the winepresses,
ISA.16.10	because I have put an end to shouts of joy.
ISA.16.11	My heart cries for Moab like a harp playing a funeral song;
ISA.16.11	I am very sad for Kir Hareseth.
ISA.16.12	The people of Moab will go to their places of worship
ISA.16.12	and will try to pray.
ISA.16.12	But when they go to their temple to pray,
ISA.16.12	they will not be able.
ISA.16.13	Earlier the L
ISA.16.14	Now the L
ISA.17.1	This is a message about Damascus:
ISA.17.1	“The city of Damascus will be destroyed;
ISA.17.1	only ruins will remain.
ISA.17.2	People will leave the cities of Aroer.
ISA.17.2	Flocks will wander freely in those empty towns,
ISA.17.2	and there will be no one to bother them.
ISA.17.3	The strong, walled cities of Israel will be destroyed.
ISA.17.3	The government in Damascus will end.
ISA.17.3	Those left alive of Aram will be
ISA.17.3	like the glory of Israel,” says the L
ISA.17.4	“At that time Israel’s wealth will all be gone.
ISA.17.4	Israel will be like someone who has lost much weight from sickness.
ISA.17.5	That time will be like the grain harvest in the Valley of Rephaim.
ISA.17.5	The workers cut the wheat.
ISA.17.5	Then they cut the heads of grain from the plants
ISA.17.5	and collect the grain.
ISA.17.6	That time will also be like the olive harvest,
ISA.17.6	when a few olives are left.
ISA.17.6	Two or three olives are left in the top branches.
ISA.17.6	Four or five olives are left on full branches,” says the L
ISA.17.7	At that time people will look to God, their Maker;
ISA.17.7	their eyes will see the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.17.8	They will not trust the altars they have made,
ISA.17.8	nor will they trust what their hands have made,
ISA.17.8	not even the Asherah idols and altars.
ISA.17.9	In that day all their strong cities will be empty. They will be like the cities the Hivites and the Amorites left when the Israelites came to take the land. Everything will be ruined.
ISA.17.10	You have forgotten the God who saves you;
ISA.17.10	you have not remembered that God is your place of safety.
ISA.17.10	You plant the finest grapevines
ISA.17.10	and grapevines from faraway places.
ISA.17.11	You plant your grapevines one day and try to make them grow,
ISA.17.11	and the next day you make them blossom.
ISA.17.11	But at harvest time everything will be dead;
ISA.17.11	a sickness will kill all the plants.
ISA.17.12	Listen to the many people!
ISA.17.12	Their crying is like the noise from the sea.
ISA.17.12	Listen to the nations!
ISA.17.12	Their crying is like the crashing of great waves.
ISA.17.13	The people roar like the waves,
ISA.17.13	but when God speaks harshly to them, they will run away.
ISA.17.13	They will be like chaff on the hills being blown by the wind,
ISA.17.13	or like tumbleweeds blown away by a storm.
ISA.17.14	At night the people will be very frightened.
ISA.17.14	Before morning, no one will be left.
ISA.17.14	So our enemies will come to our land,
ISA.17.14	but they will become nothing.
ISA.18.1	How terrible it will be for the land beyond the rivers of Cush.
ISA.18.1	It is filled with the sound of wings.
ISA.18.2	That land sends messengers across the sea;
ISA.18.2	they go on the water in boats made of reeds.
ISA.18.2	Go, quick messengers,
ISA.18.2	to a people who are tall and smooth-skinned,
ISA.18.2	who are feared everywhere.
ISA.18.2	They are a powerful nation that defeats other nations.
ISA.18.2	Their land is divided by rivers.
ISA.18.3	All you people of the world, look!
ISA.18.3	Everyone who lives in the world, look!
ISA.18.3	You will see a banner raised on a mountain.
ISA.18.3	You will hear a trumpet sound.
ISA.18.4	The L
ISA.18.4	“I will quietly watch from where I live,
ISA.18.4	like heat in the sunshine,
ISA.18.4	like the dew in the heat of harvest time.”
ISA.18.5	The time will come, after the flowers have bloomed and before the harvest,
ISA.18.5	when new grapes will be budding and growing.
ISA.18.5	The enemy will cut the plants with knives;
ISA.18.5	he will cut down the vines and take them away.
ISA.18.6	They will be left for the birds of the mountains
ISA.18.6	and for the wild animals.
ISA.18.6	Birds will feed on them all summer,
ISA.18.6	and wild animals will eat them that winter.”
ISA.18.7	At that time a gift will be brought to the L
ISA.18.7	from the people who are tall and smooth-skinned,
ISA.18.7	who are feared everywhere.
ISA.18.7	They are a powerful nation that defeats other nations.
ISA.18.7	Their land is divided by rivers.
ISA.18.7	These gifts will be brought to the place of the L
ISA.18.7	to Mount Zion.
ISA.19.1	This is a message about Egypt:
ISA.19.1	Look, the L
ISA.19.1	to enter Egypt.
ISA.19.1	The idols of Egypt will tremble before him,
ISA.19.1	and Egypt’s courage will melt away.
ISA.19.2	The L
ISA.19.2	People will fight with their relatives;
ISA.19.2	neighbors will fight neighbors;
ISA.19.2	cities will fight cities;
ISA.19.2	kingdoms will fight kingdoms.
ISA.19.3	The Egyptians will be afraid,
ISA.19.3	and I will ruin their plans.
ISA.19.3	They will ask advice from their idols and spirits of the dead,
ISA.19.3	from their mediums and fortune-tellers.”
ISA.19.4	The Lord 
ISA.19.4	“I will hand Egypt over to a hard master,
ISA.19.4	and a powerful king will rule over them.”
ISA.19.5	The sea will become dry,
ISA.19.5	and the water will disappear from the Nile River.
ISA.19.6	The canals will stink;
ISA.19.6	the streams of Egypt will decrease and dry up.
ISA.19.6	All the water plants will rot;
ISA.19.7	all the plants along the banks of the Nile will die.
ISA.19.7	Even the planted fields by the Nile
ISA.19.7	will dry up, blow away, and disappear.
ISA.19.8	The fishermen, all those who catch fish from the Nile,
ISA.19.8	will groan and cry;
ISA.19.8	those who fish in the Nile will be sad.
ISA.19.9	All the people who make cloth from flax will be sad,
ISA.19.9	and those who weave linen will lose hope.
ISA.19.10	Those who weave cloth will be broken.
ISA.19.10	All those who work for money will be sad.
ISA.19.11	The officers of the city of Zoan are fools;
ISA.19.11	the wise men who advise the king of Egypt give wrong advice.
ISA.19.11	How can you say to him, ‘I am wise’?
ISA.19.11	How can you say, ‘I am from the old family of the kings’?
ISA.19.12	Egypt, where are your wise men?
ISA.19.12	Let them show you
ISA.19.12	what the L
ISA.19.13	The officers of Zoan have been fooled;
ISA.19.13	the leaders of Memphis have believed false things.
ISA.19.13	So the leaders of Egypt
ISA.19.13	lead that nation the wrong way.
ISA.19.14	The L
ISA.19.14	They have led Egypt to wander in the wrong ways,
ISA.19.14	like drunk people stumbling in their own vomit.
ISA.19.15	There is nothing Egypt can do;
ISA.19.15	no one there can help.
ISA.19.16	In that day the Egyptians will be like women. They will be afraid of the L
ISA.19.17	The land of Judah will bring fear to Egypt. Anyone there who hears the name Judah will be afraid, because the L
ISA.19.18	At that time five cities in Egypt will speak Hebrew, the language of Canaan, and they will promise to be loyal to the L
ISA.19.19	At that time there will be an altar for the L

ISA.19.23	At that time there will be a highway from Egypt to Assyria, and the Assyrians will go to Egypt, and the Egyptians will go to Assyria. The Egyptians and Assyrians will worship God together. 
ISA.19.24	At that time Israel, Assyria, and Egypt will join together, which will be a blessing for the earth. 
ISA.19.25	The L
ISA.20.1	Sargon king of Assyria sent a military commander to Ashdod to attack that city. So the commander attacked and captured it. 
ISA.20.2	Then the L
ISA.20.3	Then the L
ISA.20.4	The king of Assyria will carry away prisoners from Egypt and Cush. Old people and young people will be led away naked and barefoot, with their buttocks bare. So the Egyptians will be shamed. 
ISA.20.5	People who looked to Cush for help will be afraid, and those who were amazed by Egypt’s glory will be shamed. 
ISA.20.6	People who live near the sea will say, ‘Look at those countries. We trusted them to help us. We ran to them so they would save us from the king of Assyria. So how will we be able to escape?’ ”
ISA.21.1	This is a message about the Desert by the Sea:
ISA.21.1	Disaster is coming from the desert
ISA.21.1	like wind blowing in the south.
ISA.21.1	It is coming from a terrible country.
ISA.21.2	I have seen a terrible vision.
ISA.21.2	I see traitors turning against you
ISA.21.2	and people taking your wealth.
ISA.21.2	Elam, attack the people!
ISA.21.2	Media, surround the city and attack it!
ISA.21.2	I will bring an end to the pain the city causes.
ISA.21.3	I saw those terrible things, and now I am in pain;
ISA.21.3	my pains are like the pains of giving birth.
ISA.21.3	What I hear makes me very afraid;
ISA.21.3	what I see causes me to shake with fear.
ISA.21.4	I am worried,
ISA.21.4	and I am shaking with fear.
ISA.21.4	My pleasant evening
ISA.21.4	has become a night of fear.
ISA.21.5	They set the table;
ISA.21.5	they spread the rugs;
ISA.21.5	they eat and drink.
ISA.21.5	Leaders, stand up.
ISA.21.5	Prepare the shields for battle!
ISA.21.6	The Lord said to me,
ISA.21.6	“Go, place a lookout for the city
ISA.21.6	and have him report what he sees.
ISA.21.7	If he sees chariots and teams of horses,
ISA.21.7	donkeys, or camels,
ISA.21.7	he should pay very close attention.”
ISA.21.8	Then the lookout called out,
ISA.21.8	“My master, each day I stand in the watchtower watching;
ISA.21.8	every night I have been on guard.
ISA.21.9	Look, I see a man coming in a chariot
ISA.21.9	with a team of horses.”
ISA.21.9	The man gives back the answer,
ISA.21.9	“Babylon has fallen. It has fallen!
ISA.21.9	All the statues of her gods
ISA.21.9	lie broken on the ground.”
ISA.21.10	My people are crushed like grain on the threshing floor.
ISA.21.10	My people, I tell you what I have heard
ISA.21.10	from the L
ISA.21.10	from the God of Israel.
ISA.21.11	This is a message about Dumah:
ISA.21.11	Someone calls to me from Edom,
ISA.21.11	“Watchman, how much of the night is left?
ISA.21.11	Watchman, how much longer will it be night?”
ISA.21.12	The watchman answers,
ISA.21.12	“Morning is coming, but then night will come again.
ISA.21.12	If you have something to ask,
ISA.21.12	then come back and ask.”
ISA.21.13	This is a message about Arabia:
ISA.21.13	A group of traders from Dedan
ISA.21.13	spent the night near some trees in Arabia.
ISA.21.14	They gave water to thirsty travelers;
ISA.21.14	the people of Tema gave food
ISA.21.14	to those who were escaping.
ISA.21.15	They were running from swords,
ISA.21.15	from swords ready to kill,
ISA.21.15	from bows ready to shoot,
ISA.21.15	from a hard battle.
ISA.21.16	This is what the Lord said to me: “In one year all the glory of the country of Kedar will be gone. (This is a year as a hired helper counts time.) 
ISA.21.17	At that time only a few of the archers, the soldiers of Kedar, will be left alive.” The L
ISA.22.1	This is a message about the Valley of Vision:
ISA.22.1	What is wrong with you people?
ISA.22.1	Why are you on your roofs?
ISA.22.2	This city was a very busy city,
ISA.22.2	full of noise and wild parties.
ISA.22.2	Now your people have been killed,
ISA.22.2	but not with swords,
ISA.22.2	nor did they die in battle.
ISA.22.3	All your leaders ran away together,
ISA.22.3	but they have been captured without using a bow.
ISA.22.3	All you who were captured
ISA.22.3	tried to run away before the enemy came.
ISA.22.4	So I say, “Don’t look at me.
ISA.22.4	Let me cry loudly.
ISA.22.4	Don’t hurry to comfort me
ISA.22.4	about the destruction of Jerusalem.”
ISA.22.5	The Lord 
ISA.22.5	of riots and confusion.
ISA.22.5	People will trample each other in the Valley of Vision.
ISA.22.5	The city walls will be knocked down,
ISA.22.5	and the people will cry out to the mountain.
ISA.22.6	The soldiers from Elam will gather their arrows
ISA.22.6	and their chariots and men on horses.
ISA.22.6	Kir will prepare their shields.
ISA.22.7	Your nicest valleys will be filled with chariots.
ISA.22.7	Horsemen will be ordered to guard the gates of the city.
ISA.22.8	The walls protecting Judah will fall.
ISA.22.8	At that time the people of Jerusalem depended on
ISA.22.8	the weapons kept at the Palace of the Forest.
ISA.22.9	You saw that the walls of Jerusalem
ISA.22.9	had many cracks that needed repairing.
ISA.22.9	You stored up water in the lower pool.
ISA.22.10	You counted the houses of Jerusalem,
ISA.22.10	and you tore down houses to repair the walls with their stones.
ISA.22.11	You made a pool between the two walls
ISA.22.11	to save water from the old pool,
ISA.22.11	but you did not trust the God who made these things;
ISA.22.11	you did not respect the One who planned them long ago.
ISA.22.12	The Lord 
ISA.22.12	to cry and be sad,
ISA.22.12	to shave their heads and wear rough cloth.
ISA.22.13	But look, the people are happy
ISA.22.13	and are having wild parties.
ISA.22.13	They kill the cattle and the sheep;
ISA.22.13	they eat the food and drink the wine.
ISA.22.13	They say, “Let us eat and drink,
ISA.22.13	because tomorrow we will die.”
ISA.22.14	The L
ISA.22.15	This is what the Lord 
ISA.22.15	“Go to this servant Shebna,
ISA.22.15	the manager of the palace.
ISA.22.16	Say to him, ‘What are you doing here?
ISA.22.16	Who said you could cut out a tomb for your self here?
ISA.22.16	Why are you preparing your tomb in a high place?
ISA.22.16	Why are you carving out a tomb from the rock?
ISA.22.17	Look, mighty one! The L
ISA.22.17	He will take firm hold of you
ISA.22.18	and roll you tightly into a ball
ISA.22.18	and throw you into another country.
ISA.22.18	There you will die,
ISA.22.18	and there your fine chariots will remain.
ISA.22.18	You are a disgrace to your master’s house.
ISA.22.19	I will force you out of your important job,
ISA.22.19	and you will be thrown down from your important place.’
ISA.22.20	“At that time I will call for my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah. 
ISA.22.21	I will take your robe and put it on him and give him your belt. I will hand over to him the important job you have, and he will be like a father to the people of Jerusalem and the family of Judah. 
ISA.22.22	I will put the key to the house of David around his neck. If he opens a door, no one will be able to close it; if he closes a door, no one will be able to open it. 
ISA.22.23	He will be like an honored chair in his father’s house. I will make him strong like a peg that is hammered into a strong board. 
ISA.22.24	All the honored and important things of his family will depend on him; all the adults and little children will depend on him. They will be like bowls and jars hanging on him.
ISA.22.25	“At that time,” says the L
ISA.23.1	This is a message about Tyre:
ISA.23.1	You trading ships, cry!
ISA.23.1	The houses and harbor of Tyre are destroyed.
ISA.23.1	This news came to the ships
ISA.23.1	from the land of Cyprus.
ISA.23.2	Be silent, you who live on the island of Tyre;
ISA.23.2	you merchants of Sidon, be silent.
ISA.23.2	Sailors have made you rich.
ISA.23.3	They traveled the sea to bring grain from Egypt;
ISA.23.3	the sailors of Tyre brought grain from the Nile Valley
ISA.23.3	and sold it to other nations.
ISA.23.4	Sidon, be ashamed.
ISA.23.4	Strong city of the sea, be ashamed, because the sea says:
ISA.23.4	“I have not felt the pain of giving birth;
ISA.23.4	I have not reared young men or women.”
ISA.23.5	Egypt will hear the news about Tyre,
ISA.23.5	and it will make Egypt hurt with sorrow.
ISA.23.6	You ships should return to Tarshish.
ISA.23.6	You people living near the sea should be sad.
ISA.23.7	Look at your once happy city!
ISA.23.7	Look at your old, old city!
ISA.23.7	People from that city have traveled
ISA.23.7	far away to live.
ISA.23.8	Who planned Tyre’s destruction?
ISA.23.8	Tyre made others rich.
ISA.23.8	Its merchants were treated like princes,
ISA.23.8	and its traders were greatly respected.
ISA.23.9	It was the L
ISA.23.9	He decided to make these proud people unimportant;
ISA.23.9	he decided to disgrace those who were greatly respected.
ISA.23.10	Go through your land, people of Tarshish,
ISA.23.10	like the Nile goes through Egypt.
ISA.23.10	There is no harbor for you now!
ISA.23.11	The L
ISA.23.11	and made its kingdoms tremble.
ISA.23.11	He commands that Canaan’s
ISA.23.11	strong, walled cities be destroyed.
ISA.23.12	He said, “Sidon, you will not rejoice any longer,
ISA.23.12	because you are destroyed.
ISA.23.12	Even if you cross the sea to Cyprus,
ISA.23.12	you will not find a place to rest.”
ISA.23.13	Look at the land of the Babylonians;
ISA.23.13	it is not a country now.
ISA.23.13	Assyria has made it a place for wild animals.
ISA.23.13	Assyria built towers to attack it;
ISA.23.13	the soldiers took all the treasures from its cities,
ISA.23.13	and they turned it into ruins.
ISA.23.14	So be sad, you trading ships,
ISA.23.14	because your strong city is destroyed.
ISA.23.15	At that time people will forget about Tyre for seventy years, which is the length of a king’s life. After seventy years, Tyre will be like the prostitute in this song:
ISA.23.16	“Oh woman, you are forgotten.
ISA.23.16	Take your harp and walk through the city.
ISA.23.16	Play your harp well. Sing your song often.
ISA.23.16	Then people will remember you.”
ISA.23.17	After seventy years the L
ISA.23.18	The profits will be saved for the L
ISA.24.1	Look! The L
ISA.24.1	he will ruin the surface of the land and scatter its people.
ISA.24.2	At that time the same thing will happen to everyone:
ISA.24.2	to common people and priests,
ISA.24.2	to slaves and masters,
ISA.24.2	to women slaves and their women masters,
ISA.24.2	to buyers and sellers,
ISA.24.2	to those who borrow and those who lend,
ISA.24.2	to bankers and those who owe the bank.
ISA.24.3	The earth will be completely empty.
ISA.24.3	The wealth will all be taken,
ISA.24.3	because the L
ISA.24.4	The earth will dry up and die;
ISA.24.4	the world will grow weak and die;
ISA.24.4	the great leaders in this land will become weak.
ISA.24.5	The people of the earth have ruined it,
ISA.24.5	because they do not follow God’s teachings
ISA.24.5	or obey God’s laws
ISA.24.5	or keep their agreement with God that was to last forever.
ISA.24.6	So a curse will destroy the earth.
ISA.24.6	The people of the world are guilty,
ISA.24.6	so they will be burned up;
ISA.24.6	only a few will be left.
ISA.24.7	The new wine will be bad, and the grapevines will die.
ISA.24.7	People who were happy will be sad.
ISA.24.8	The happy music of the tambourines will end.
ISA.24.8	The happy sounds of wild parties will stop.
ISA.24.8	The joyful music from the harps will end.
ISA.24.9	People will no longer sing while they drink their wine.
ISA.24.9	The beer will taste bitter to those who drink it.
ISA.24.10	The ruined city will be empty,
ISA.24.10	and people will hide behind closed doors.
ISA.24.11	People in the streets will ask for wine,
ISA.24.11	but joy will have turned to sadness;
ISA.24.11	all the happiness will have left.
ISA.24.12	The city will be left in ruins,
ISA.24.12	and its gates will be smashed to pieces.
ISA.24.13	This is what will happen all over the earth
ISA.24.13	and to all the nations.
ISA.24.13	The earth will be like an olive tree after the harvest
ISA.24.13	or like the few grapes left on a vine after harvest.
ISA.24.14	The people shout for joy.
ISA.24.14	From the west they praise the greatness of the L
ISA.24.15	People in the east, praise the L
ISA.24.15	People in the islands of the sea,
ISA.24.15	praise the name of the L
ISA.24.16	We hear songs from every part of the earth
ISA.24.16	praising God, the Righteous One.
ISA.24.16	But I said, “I am dying! I am dying!
ISA.24.16	How terrible it will be for me!
ISA.24.16	Traitors turn against people;
ISA.24.16	with their dishonesty, they turn against people.”
ISA.24.17	There are terrors, holes, and traps
ISA.24.17	for the people of the earth.
ISA.24.18	Anyone who tries to escape from the sound of terror
ISA.24.18	will fall into a hole.
ISA.24.18	Anyone who climbs out of the hole
ISA.24.18	will be caught in a trap.
ISA.24.18	The clouds in the sky will pour out rain,
ISA.24.18	and the foundations of the earth will shake.
ISA.24.19	The earth will be broken up;
ISA.24.19	the earth will split open;
ISA.24.19	the earth will shake violently.
ISA.24.20	The earth will stumble around like someone who is drunk;
ISA.24.20	it will shake like a hut in a storm.
ISA.24.20	Its sin is like a heavy weight on its back;
ISA.24.20	it will fall and never rise again.
ISA.24.21	At that time the L
ISA.24.21	the powers in the sky above
ISA.24.21	and the rulers on earth below.
ISA.24.22	They will be gathered together
ISA.24.22	like prisoners thrown into a dungeon;
ISA.24.22	they will be shut up in prison.
ISA.24.22	After much time they will be punished.
ISA.24.23	The moon will be embarrassed,
ISA.24.23	and the sun will be ashamed,
ISA.24.23	because the L
ISA.24.23	on Mount Zion in Jerusalem.
ISA.24.23	Jerusalem’s leaders will see his greatness.
ISA.25.1	L
ISA.25.1	I honor you and praise you,
ISA.25.1	because you have done amazing things.
ISA.25.1	You have always done what you said you would do;
ISA.25.1	you have done what you planned long ago.
ISA.25.2	You have made the city a pile of rocks
ISA.25.2	and have destroyed her walls.
ISA.25.2	The city our enemies built with strong walls is gone;
ISA.25.2	it will never be built again.
ISA.25.3	People from powerful nations will honor you;
ISA.25.3	cruel people from strong cities will fear you.
ISA.25.4	You protect the poor;
ISA.25.4	you protect the helpless when they are in danger.
ISA.25.4	You are like a shelter from storms,
ISA.25.4	like shade that protects them from the heat.
ISA.25.4	The cruel people attack
ISA.25.4	like a rainstorm beating against the wall,
ISA.25.5	like the heat in the desert.
ISA.25.5	But you, God, stop their violent attack.
ISA.25.5	As a cloud cools a hot day,
ISA.25.5	you silence the songs of those who have no mercy.
ISA.25.6	The L
ISA.25.6	on this mountain for all people.
ISA.25.6	It will be a feast with all the best food and wine,
ISA.25.6	the finest meat and wine.
ISA.25.7	On this mountain God will destroy
ISA.25.7	the veil that covers all nations,
ISA.25.7	the veil that stretches over all peoples;
ISA.25.8	he will destroy death forever.
ISA.25.8	The Lord 
ISA.25.8	He will take away the shame of his people from the earth.
ISA.25.8	The L
ISA.25.9	At that time people will say,
ISA.25.9	“Our God is doing this!
ISA.25.9	We have waited for him, and he has come to save us.
ISA.25.9	This is the L
ISA.25.9	so we will rejoice and be happy when he saves us.”
ISA.25.10	The L
ISA.25.10	but he will crush our enemy Moab
ISA.25.10	like straw that is trampled down in the manure.
ISA.25.11	They will spread their arms in it
ISA.25.11	like a person who is swimming.
ISA.25.11	But God will bring down their pride,
ISA.25.11	and all the clever things they have made will mean nothing.
ISA.25.12	Moab’s high walls protect them,
ISA.25.12	but God will destroy these walls.
ISA.25.12	He will throw them down to the ground,
ISA.25.12	even to the dust.
ISA.26.1	At that time people will sing this song in Judah:
ISA.26.1	We have a strong city.
ISA.26.1	God protects us with its strong walls and defenses.
ISA.26.2	Open the gates,
ISA.26.2	and the good people will enter,
ISA.26.2	those who follow God.
ISA.26.3	You, L
ISA.26.3	to those who depend on you,
ISA.26.3	because they trust you.
ISA.26.4	So, trust the L
ISA.26.4	because he is our Rock forever.
ISA.26.5	He will destroy the proud city,
ISA.26.5	and he will punish the people living there.
ISA.26.5	He will bring that high city down to the ground
ISA.26.5	and throw it down into the dust.
ISA.26.6	Then those who were hurt by the city will walk on its ruins;
ISA.26.6	those who were made poor by the city will trample it under their feet.
ISA.26.7	The path of life is level for those who are right with God;
ISA.26.7	L
ISA.26.8	But, L
ISA.26.8	for your way of justice.
ISA.26.8	Our souls want to remember
ISA.26.8	you and your name.
ISA.26.9	My soul wants to be with you at night,
ISA.26.9	and my spirit wants to be with you at the dawn of every day.
ISA.26.9	When your way of justice comes to the land,
ISA.26.9	people of the world will learn the right way of living.
ISA.26.10	Evil people will not learn to do good
ISA.26.10	even if you show them kindness.
ISA.26.10	They will continue doing evil, even if they live in a good world;
ISA.26.10	they never see the L
ISA.26.11	L
ISA.26.11	but they do not see that.
ISA.26.11	Show them your strong love for your people.
ISA.26.11	Then those who are evil will be ashamed.
ISA.26.11	Burn them in the fire
ISA.26.11	you have prepared for your enemies.
ISA.26.12	L
ISA.26.12	so give us peace.
ISA.26.13	L
ISA.26.13	but we honor only you.
ISA.26.14	Those masters are now dead;
ISA.26.14	their ghosts will not rise from death.
ISA.26.14	You punished and destroyed them
ISA.26.14	and erased any memory of them.
ISA.26.15	L
ISA.26.15	you multiplied them and brought honor to yourself.
ISA.26.15	You made the borders of the land wide.
ISA.26.16	L
ISA.26.16	they say quiet prayers to you when you punish them.
ISA.26.17	L
ISA.26.17	we are like a woman giving birth to a baby;
ISA.26.17	she cries and has pain from the birth.
ISA.26.18	In the same way, we had pain.
ISA.26.18	We gave birth, but only to wind.
ISA.26.18	We don’t bring salvation to the land
ISA.26.18	or make new people for the world.
ISA.26.19	Your people have died, but they will live again;
ISA.26.19	their bodies will rise from death.
ISA.26.19	You who lie in the ground,
ISA.26.19	wake up and be happy!
ISA.26.19	The dew covering you is like the dew of a new day;
ISA.26.19	the ground will give birth to the dead.
ISA.26.20	My people, go into your rooms
ISA.26.20	and shut your doors behind you.
ISA.26.20	Hide in your rooms for a short time
ISA.26.20	until God’s anger is finished.
ISA.26.21	The L
ISA.26.21	to punish the people of the world for their sins.
ISA.26.21	The earth will show the blood of the people who have been killed;
ISA.26.21	it will not cover the dead any longer.
ISA.27.1	At that time the L
ISA.27.1	He will punish Leviathan, the coiled snake,
ISA.27.1	with his great and hard and powerful sword.
ISA.27.1	He will kill the monster in the sea.
ISA.27.2	At that time
ISA.27.2	people will sing about the pleasant vineyard.
ISA.27.3	“I, the L
ISA.27.3	I will water it at the right time.
ISA.27.3	No one will hurt it,
ISA.27.3	because I will guard it day and night.
ISA.27.4	I am not angry.
ISA.27.4	If anyone builds a wall of thornbushes in war,
ISA.27.4	I will march to it and burn it.
ISA.27.5	But if anyone comes to me for safety
ISA.27.5	and wants to make peace with me,
ISA.27.5	he should come and make peace with me.”
ISA.27.6	In the days to come, the people of Jacob will be like a plant with good roots;
ISA.27.6	Israel will grow like a plant beginning to bloom.
ISA.27.6	Then the world will be filled with their children.
ISA.27.7	The L
ISA.27.7	his people have not been killed like those who tried to kill them.
ISA.27.8	He will settle his argument with Israel by sending it far away.
ISA.27.8	Like a hot desert wind, he will drive it away.
ISA.27.9	This is how Israel’s guilt will be forgiven;
ISA.27.9	this is how its sins will be taken away:
ISA.27.9	Israel will crush the rocks of the altar to dust,
ISA.27.9	and no statues or altars will be left standing for the Asherah idols.
ISA.27.10	At that time the strong, walled city will be empty
ISA.27.10	like a desert.
ISA.27.10	Calves will eat grass there.
ISA.27.10	They will lie down there
ISA.27.10	and eat leaves from the branches.
ISA.27.11	The limbs will become dry and break off,
ISA.27.11	so women will use them for firewood.
ISA.27.11	The people refuse to understand,
ISA.27.11	so God will not comfort them;
ISA.27.11	their Maker will not be kind to them.
ISA.27.12	At that time the L
ISA.27.13	Many of my people are now lost in Assyria. Some have run away to Egypt. But at that time a great trumpet will be blown, and all those people will come and worship the L
ISA.28.1	How terrible it will be for Samaria, the pride of Israel’s drunken people!
ISA.28.1	That beautiful crown of flowers is just a dying plant
ISA.28.1	set on a hill above a rich valley where drunkards live.
ISA.28.2	Look, the Lord has someone who is strong and powerful.
ISA.28.2	Like a storm of hail and strong wind,
ISA.28.2	like a sudden flood of water pouring over the country,
ISA.28.2	he will throw Samaria down to the ground.
ISA.28.3	That city, the pride of Israel’s drunken people,
ISA.28.3	will be trampled underfoot.
ISA.28.4	That beautiful crown of flowers is just a dying plant
ISA.28.4	set on a hill above a rich valley.
ISA.28.4	That city will be like the first fig of summer.
ISA.28.4	Anyone who sees it
ISA.28.4	quickly picks it and eats it.
ISA.28.5	At that time the L
ISA.28.5	will be like a beautiful crown,
ISA.28.5	like a wonderful crown of flowers
ISA.28.5	for his people who are left alive.
ISA.28.6	Then he will give wisdom to the judges who must decide cases
ISA.28.6	and strength to those who battle at the city gate.
ISA.28.7	But now those leaders are drunk with wine;
ISA.28.7	they stumble from drinking too much beer.
ISA.28.7	The priests and prophets are drunk with beer
ISA.28.7	and are filled with wine.
ISA.28.7	They stumble from too much beer.
ISA.28.7	The prophets are drunk when they see their visions;
ISA.28.7	the judges stumble when they make their decisions.
ISA.28.8	Every table is covered with vomit,
ISA.28.8	so there is not a clean place anywhere.
ISA.28.9	The L
ISA.28.9	he is trying to make them understand his teachings.
ISA.28.9	But the people are like babies too old for breast milk,
ISA.28.9	like those who no longer nurse at their mother’s breast.
ISA.28.10	So they make fun of the L
ISA.28.10	“A command here, a command there.
ISA.28.10	A rule here, a rule there.
ISA.28.10	A little lesson here, a little lesson there.”
ISA.28.11	So the L
ISA.28.11	to speak to these people.
ISA.28.12	God said to them,
ISA.28.12	“Here is a place of rest;
ISA.28.12	let the tired people come and rest.
ISA.28.12	This is the place of peace.”
ISA.28.12	But the people would not listen.
ISA.28.13	So the words of the L
ISA.28.13	“A command here, a command there.
ISA.28.13	A rule here, a rule there.
ISA.28.13	A little lesson here, a little lesson there.”
ISA.28.13	They will fall back and be defeated;
ISA.28.13	they will be trapped and captured.
ISA.28.14	So listen to the L
ISA.28.14	you leaders in Jerusalem.
ISA.28.15	You say, “We have made an agreement with death;
ISA.28.15	we have a contract with death.
ISA.28.15	When terrible punishment passes by,
ISA.28.15	it won’t hurt us.
ISA.28.15	Our lies will keep us safe,
ISA.28.15	and our tricks will hide us.”
ISA.28.16	Because of these things, this is what the Lord 
ISA.28.16	“I will put a stone in the ground in Jerusalem,
ISA.28.16	a tested stone.
ISA.28.16	Everything will be built on this important and precious rock.
ISA.28.16	Anyone who trusts in it will never be disappointed.
ISA.28.17	I will use justice as a measuring line
ISA.28.17	and goodness as the standard.
ISA.28.17	The lies you hide behind will be destroyed as if by hail.
ISA.28.17	They will be washed away as if in a flood.
ISA.28.18	Your agreement with death will be erased;
ISA.28.18	your contract with death will not help you.
ISA.28.18	When terrible punishment comes,
ISA.28.18	you will be crushed by it.
ISA.28.19	Whenever punishment comes, it will take you away.
ISA.28.19	It will come morning after morning;
ISA.28.19	it will defeat you by day and by night.
ISA.28.19	Those who understand this punishment will be terrified.”
ISA.28.20	You will be like the person who tried to sleep
ISA.28.20	on a bed that was too short
ISA.28.20	and with a blanket that was too narrow
ISA.28.20	to wrap around himself.
ISA.28.21	The L
ISA.28.21	He will be angry as he was in the Valley of Gibeon.
ISA.28.21	He will do his work, his strange work.
ISA.28.21	He will finish his job, his strange job.
ISA.28.22	Now, you must not make fun of these things,
ISA.28.22	or the ropes around you will become tighter.
ISA.28.22	The Lord 
ISA.28.22	how the whole earth will be destroyed.
ISA.28.23	Listen closely to what I tell you;
ISA.28.23	listen carefully to what I say.
ISA.28.24	A farmer does not plow his field all the time;
ISA.28.24	he does not go on working the soil.
ISA.28.25	He makes the ground flat and smooth.
ISA.28.25	Then he plants the dill and scatters the cumin.
ISA.28.25	He plants the wheat in rows,
ISA.28.25	the barley in its special place,
ISA.28.25	and other wheat as a border around the field.
ISA.28.26	His God teaches him
ISA.28.26	and shows him the right way.
ISA.28.27	A farmer doesn’t use heavy boards to crush dill;
ISA.28.27	he doesn’t use a wagon wheel to crush cumin.
ISA.28.27	He uses a small stick to break open the dill,
ISA.28.27	and with a stick he opens the cumin.
ISA.28.28	The grain is ground to make bread.
ISA.28.28	People do not ruin it by crushing it forever.
ISA.28.28	The farmer separates the wheat from the chaff with his cart,
ISA.28.28	but he does not let his horses grind it.
ISA.28.29	This lesson also comes from the L
ISA.28.29	who gives wonderful advice, who is very wise.
ISA.29.1	How terrible it will be for you, Jerusalem,
ISA.29.1	the city where David camped.
ISA.29.1	Your festivals have continued
ISA.29.1	year after year.
ISA.29.2	I will attack Jerusalem,
ISA.29.2	and that city will be filled with sadness and crying.
ISA.29.2	It will be like an altar to me.
ISA.29.3	I will put armies all around you, Jerusalem;
ISA.29.3	I will surround you with towers
ISA.29.3	and with devices to attack you.
ISA.29.4	You will be pulled down and will speak from the ground;
ISA.29.4	I will hear your voice rising from the ground.
ISA.29.4	It will sound like the voice of a ghost;
ISA.29.4	your words will come like a whisper from the dirt.
ISA.29.5	Your many enemies will become like fine dust;
ISA.29.5	the many cruel people will be like chaff that is blown away.
ISA.29.5	Everything will happen very quickly.
ISA.29.6	The L
ISA.29.6	with thunder, earthquakes, and great noises,
ISA.29.6	with storms, strong winds, and a fire that destroys.
ISA.29.7	Then all the nations that fight against Jerusalem
ISA.29.7	will be like a dream;
ISA.29.7	all the nations that attack her
ISA.29.7	will be like a vision in the night.
ISA.29.8	They will be like a hungry man who dreams he is eating,
ISA.29.8	but when he awakens, he is still hungry.
ISA.29.8	They will be like a thirsty man who dreams he is drinking,
ISA.29.8	but when he awakens, he is still weak and thirsty.
ISA.29.8	It will be the same way with all the nations
ISA.29.8	who fight against Mount Zion.
ISA.29.9	Be surprised and amazed.
ISA.29.9	Blind yourselves so that you cannot see.
ISA.29.9	Become drunk, but not from wine.
ISA.29.9	Trip and fall, but not from beer.
ISA.29.10	The L
ISA.29.10	He has closed your eyes. (The prophets are your eyes.)
ISA.29.10	He has covered your heads. (The seers are your heads.)
ISA.29.11	This vision is like the words of a book that is closed and sealed. You may give the book to someone who can read and tell that person to read it. But he will say, “I can’t read the book, because it is sealed.” 
ISA.29.12	Or you may give the book to someone who cannot read and tell him to read it. But he will say, “I don’t know how to read.”
ISA.29.13	The Lord says:
ISA.29.13	“These people worship me with their mouths,
ISA.29.13	and honor me with their lips,
ISA.29.13	but their hearts are far from me.
ISA.29.13	Their worship is based on
ISA.29.13	nothing but human rules.
ISA.29.14	So I will continue to amaze these people
ISA.29.14	by doing more and more miracles.
ISA.29.14	Their wise men will lose their wisdom;
ISA.29.14	their wise men will not be able to understand.”
ISA.29.15	How terrible it will be for those who try
ISA.29.15	to hide things from the L
ISA.29.15	and who do their work in darkness.
ISA.29.15	They think no one will see them or know what they do.
ISA.29.16	You are confused.
ISA.29.16	You think the clay is equal to the potter.
ISA.29.16	You think that an object can tell the one who made it,
ISA.29.16	“You didn’t make me.”
ISA.29.16	This is like a pot telling its maker,
ISA.29.16	“You don’t know anything.”
ISA.29.17	In a very short time, Lebanon will become rich farmland,
ISA.29.17	and the rich farmland will seem like a forest.
ISA.29.18	At that time the deaf will hear the words in a book.
ISA.29.18	Instead of having darkness and gloom, the blind will see.
ISA.29.19	The L
ISA.29.19	they will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.29.20	Then the people without mercy will come to an end;
ISA.29.20	those who do not respect God will disappear.
ISA.29.20	Those who enjoy doing evil will be gone:
ISA.29.21	those who lie about others in court,
ISA.29.21	those who trap people in court,
ISA.29.21	those who lie and take justice from innocent people in court.
ISA.29.22	This is what the L
ISA.29.22	“Now the people of Jacob will not be ashamed
ISA.29.22	or disgraced any longer.
ISA.29.23	When they see all their children,
ISA.29.23	the children I made with my hands,
ISA.29.23	they will say my name is holy.
ISA.29.23	They will agree that the Holy One of Jacob is holy,
ISA.29.23	and they will respect the God of Israel.
ISA.29.24	People who do wrong will now understand.
ISA.29.24	Those who complain will accept being taught.”
ISA.30.1	The L
ISA.30.1	“How terrible it will be for these stubborn children.
ISA.30.1	They make plans, but they don’t ask me to help them.
ISA.30.1	They make agreements with other nations, without asking my Spirit.
ISA.30.1	They are adding more and more sins to themselves.
ISA.30.2	They go down to Egypt for help
ISA.30.2	without asking me about it first.
ISA.30.2	They hope they will be saved by the king of Egypt;
ISA.30.2	they want Egypt to protect them.
ISA.30.3	But hiding in Egypt will bring you only shame;
ISA.30.3	Egypt’s protection will only disappoint you.
ISA.30.4	Your officers have gone to Zoan,
ISA.30.4	and your messengers have gone to Hanes,
ISA.30.5	but they will be put to shame,
ISA.30.5	because Egypt is useless to them.
ISA.30.5	It will give no help and will be of no use;
ISA.30.5	it will cause them only shame and embarrassment.”
ISA.30.6	This is a message about the animals in southern Judah:
ISA.30.6	Southern Judah is a dangerous place
ISA.30.6	full of lions and lionesses,
ISA.30.6	poisonous snakes and darting snakes.
ISA.30.6	The messengers travel through there with their wealth on the backs of donkeys
ISA.30.6	and their treasure on the backs of camels.
ISA.30.6	They carry them to a nation that cannot help them,
ISA.30.7	to Egypt whose help is useless.
ISA.30.7	So I call that country Rahab the Do-Nothing.
ISA.30.8	Now write this on a sign for the people,
ISA.30.8	write this on a scroll,
ISA.30.8	so that for the days to come
ISA.30.8	this will be a witness forever.
ISA.30.9	These people are like children who lie and refuse to obey;
ISA.30.9	they refuse to listen to the L
ISA.30.10	They tell the seers,
ISA.30.10	“Don’t see any more visions!”
ISA.30.10	They say to the prophets,
ISA.30.10	“Don’t tell us the truth!
ISA.30.10	Say things that will make us feel good;
ISA.30.10	see only good things for us.
ISA.30.11	Stop blocking our path.
ISA.30.11	Get out of our way.
ISA.30.11	Stop telling us
ISA.30.11	about God, the Holy One of Israel.”
ISA.30.12	So this is what the Holy One of Israel says:
ISA.30.12	“You people have refused to accept this message
ISA.30.12	and have depended on cruelty and lies to help you.
ISA.30.13	You are guilty of these things.
ISA.30.13	So you will be like a high wall with cracks in it
ISA.30.13	that falls suddenly and breaks into small pieces.
ISA.30.14	You will be like a clay jar that breaks,
ISA.30.14	smashed into many pieces.
ISA.30.14	Those pieces will be too small
ISA.30.14	to take coals from the fire
ISA.30.14	or to get water from a well.”
ISA.30.15	This is what the Lord 
ISA.30.15	“If you come back to me and trust me, you will be saved.
ISA.30.15	If you will be calm and trust me, you will be strong.”
ISA.30.15	But you don’t want to do that.
ISA.30.16	You say, “No, we need horses to run away on.”
ISA.30.16	So you will run away on horses.
ISA.30.16	You say, “We will ride away on fast horses.”
ISA.30.16	So those who chase you will be fast.
ISA.30.17	One enemy will make threats,
ISA.30.17	and a thousand of your men will run away.
ISA.30.17	Five enemies will make threats,
ISA.30.17	and all of you will run from them.
ISA.30.17	You will be left alone like a flagpole on a hilltop,
ISA.30.17	like a banner on a hill.
ISA.30.18	The L
ISA.30.18	He wants to rise and comfort you.
ISA.30.18	The L
ISA.30.18	and everyone who waits for his help will be happy.
ISA.30.19	You people who live on Mount Zion in Jerusalem will not cry anymore. The L
ISA.30.20	The Lord has given you sorrow and hurt like the bread and water you ate every day. He is your teacher; he will not continue to hide from you, but you will see your teacher with your own eyes. 
ISA.30.21	If you go the wrong way—to the right or to the left—you will hear a voice behind you saying, “This is the right way. You should go this way.” 
ISA.30.22	You have statues covered with silver and gold, but you will ruin them for further use. You will throw them away like filthy rags and say, “Go away!”
ISA.30.23	At that time the L
ISA.30.24	Your oxen and donkeys that work the soil will have all the food they need. You will have to use shovels and pitchforks to spread all their food. 
ISA.30.25	Every mountain and hill will have streams filled with water. These things will happen after many people are killed and the towers are pulled down. 
ISA.30.26	At that time the light from the moon will be bright like the sun, and the light from the sun will be seven times brighter than now, like the light of seven days. These things will happen when the L
ISA.30.27	Look! The L
ISA.30.27	His anger is like a fire with thick clouds of smoke.
ISA.30.27	His mouth is filled with anger,
ISA.30.27	and his tongue is like a burning fire.
ISA.30.28	His breath is like a rushing river,
ISA.30.28	which rises to the throat.
ISA.30.28	He will judge the nations as if he is sifting them through the strainer of destruction.
ISA.30.28	He will place in their mouths a bit that will lead them the wrong way.
ISA.30.29	You will sing happy songs
ISA.30.29	as on the nights you begin a festival.
ISA.30.29	You will be happy like people listening to flutes
ISA.30.29	as they come to the mountain of the L
ISA.30.29	to the Rock of Israel.
ISA.30.30	The L
ISA.30.30	and to see his powerful arm come down with anger,
ISA.30.30	like a great fire that burns everything,
ISA.30.30	like a great storm with much rain and hail.
ISA.30.31	Assyria will be afraid when it hears the voice of the L
ISA.30.31	because he will strike Assyria with a rod.
ISA.30.32	When the L
ISA.30.32	he will beat them to the music of tambourines and harps;
ISA.30.32	he will fight against them with his mighty weapons.
ISA.30.33	Topheth has been made ready for a long time;
ISA.30.33	it is ready for the king.
ISA.30.33	It was made deep and wide
ISA.30.33	with much wood and fire.
ISA.30.33	And the L
ISA.30.33	like a stream of burning sulfur and set it on fire.
ISA.31.1	How terrible it will be for those people who go down to Egypt for help.
ISA.31.1	They think horses will save them.
ISA.31.1	They think their many chariots
ISA.31.1	and strong horsemen will save them.
ISA.31.1	But they don’t trust God, the Holy One of Israel,
ISA.31.1	or ask the L
ISA.31.2	But he is wise and can bring them disaster.
ISA.31.2	He does not change his warnings.
ISA.31.2	He will rise up and fight against the evil people
ISA.31.2	and against those who try to help evil people.
ISA.31.3	The Egyptians are only people and are not God.
ISA.31.3	Their horses are only animals and are not spirit.
ISA.31.3	The L
ISA.31.3	and the one who helps will stumble,
ISA.31.3	and the people who wanted help will fall.
ISA.31.3	All of them will be destroyed together.
ISA.31.4	The L
ISA.31.4	“When a lion or a lion’s cub kills an animal to eat,
ISA.31.4	it stands over the dead animal and roars.
ISA.31.4	A band of shepherds
ISA.31.4	may be assembled against it,
ISA.31.4	but the lion will not be afraid of their yelling
ISA.31.4	or upset by their noise.
ISA.31.4	So the L
ISA.31.4	to fight on Mount Zion and on its hill.
ISA.31.5	The L
ISA.31.5	like birds flying over their nests.
ISA.31.5	He will defend and save it;
ISA.31.5	he will ‘pass over’ and save Jerusalem.”
ISA.31.6	You children of Israel, come back to the God you fought against. 
ISA.31.7	The time is coming when each of you will stop worshiping idols of gold and silver, which you sinned by making.
ISA.31.8	“Assyria will be defeated by a sword, but not the sword of a person;
ISA.31.8	Assyria will be destroyed, but not by a person’s sword.
ISA.31.8	Assyria will run away from the sword of God,
ISA.31.8	but its young men will be caught and made slaves.
ISA.31.9	They will panic, and their protection will be destroyed.
ISA.31.9	Their commanders will be terrified when they see God’s battle flag,”
ISA.31.9	says the L
ISA.31.9	whose fire is in Jerusalem
ISA.31.9	and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
ISA.32.1	A king will rule in a way that brings justice,
ISA.32.1	and leaders will make fair decisions.
ISA.32.2	Then each ruler will be like a shelter from the wind,
ISA.32.2	like a safe place in a storm,
ISA.32.2	like streams of water in a dry land,
ISA.32.2	like a cool shadow from a large rock in a hot land.
ISA.32.3	People will look to the king for help,
ISA.32.3	and they will truly listen to what he says.
ISA.32.4	People who are now worried will be able to understand.
ISA.32.4	Those who cannot speak clearly now will then be able to speak clearly and quickly.
ISA.32.5	Fools will not be called great,
ISA.32.5	and people will not respect the wicked.
ISA.32.6	A fool says foolish things,
ISA.32.6	and in his mind he plans evil.
ISA.32.6	A fool does things that are wicked,
ISA.32.6	and he says wrong things about the L
ISA.32.6	A fool does not feed the hungry
ISA.32.6	or let thirsty people drink water.
ISA.32.7	The wicked person uses evil like a tool.
ISA.32.7	He plans ways to take everything from the poor.
ISA.32.7	He destroys the poor with lies,
ISA.32.7	even when the poor person is in the right.
ISA.32.8	But a good leader plans to do good,
ISA.32.8	and those good things make him a good leader.
ISA.32.9	You women who are calm now,
ISA.32.9	stand up and listen to me.
ISA.32.9	You women who feel safe now,
ISA.32.9	hear what I say.
ISA.32.10	You women feel safe now,
ISA.32.10	but after one year you will be afraid.
ISA.32.10	There will be no grape harvest
ISA.32.10	and no summer fruit to gather.
ISA.32.11	Women, you are calm now, but you should shake with fear.
ISA.32.11	Women, you feel safe now, but you should tremble.
ISA.32.11	Take off your nice clothes
ISA.32.11	and put rough cloth around your waist to show your sadness.
ISA.32.12	Beat your breasts in grief, because the fields that were pleasant are now empty.
ISA.32.12	Cry, because the vines that once had fruit now have no more grapes.
ISA.32.13	Cry for the land of my people,
ISA.32.13	in which only thorns and weeds now grow.
ISA.32.13	Cry for the city that once was happy
ISA.32.13	and for all the houses that once were filled with joy.
ISA.32.14	The palace will be empty;
ISA.32.14	people will leave the noisy city.
ISA.32.14	Strong cities and towers will be empty.
ISA.32.14	Wild donkeys will love to live there, and sheep will go there to eat.
ISA.32.15	This will continue until God pours his Spirit from above upon us.
ISA.32.15	Then the desert will be like a fertile field
ISA.32.15	and the fertile field like a forest.
ISA.32.16	Justice will be found even in the desert,
ISA.32.16	and fairness will be found in the fertile fields.
ISA.32.17	That fairness will bring peace,
ISA.32.17	and it will bring calm and safety forever.
ISA.32.18	My people will live in peaceful places
ISA.32.18	and in safe homes
ISA.32.18	and in calm places of rest.
ISA.32.19	Hail will destroy the forest,
ISA.32.19	and the city will be completely destroyed.
ISA.32.20	But you will be happy as you plant seeds near every stream
ISA.32.20	and as you let your cattle and donkeys wander freely.
ISA.33.1	How terrible it will be for you who destroy others
ISA.33.1	but have not been destroyed yet.
ISA.33.1	How terrible it will be for you, traitor,
ISA.33.1	whom no one has turned against yet.
ISA.33.1	When you stop destroying,
ISA.33.1	others will destroy you.
ISA.33.1	When you stop turning against others,
ISA.33.1	they will turn against you.
ISA.33.2	L
ISA.33.2	We have waited for your help.
ISA.33.2	Give us strength every morning.
ISA.33.2	Save us when we are in trouble.
ISA.33.3	Your powerful voice makes people run away in fear;
ISA.33.3	your greatness causes the nations to run away.
ISA.33.4	Like locusts, your enemies will take away the things you stole in war.
ISA.33.4	Like locusts rushing about, they will take your wealth.
ISA.33.5	The L
ISA.33.5	He fills Jerusalem with fairness and justice.
ISA.33.6	He will be your safety.
ISA.33.6	He is full of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge.
ISA.33.6	Respect for the L
ISA.33.7	See, brave people are crying out in the streets;
ISA.33.7	those who tried to bring peace are weeping loudly.
ISA.33.8	There is no one on the roads,
ISA.33.8	no one walking in the paths.
ISA.33.8	People have broken the agreements they made.
ISA.33.8	They refuse to believe the proof from witnesses.
ISA.33.8	No one respects other people.
ISA.33.9	The land is sick and dying;
ISA.33.9	Lebanon is ashamed and dying.

ISA.33.9	and the trees of Bashan and Carmel are dying.
ISA.33.10	The L
ISA.33.10	and show my greatness.
ISA.33.10	Now, I will become important to the people.
ISA.33.11	You people do useless things
ISA.33.11	that are like hay and straw.
ISA.33.11	A destructive wind will burn you like fire.
ISA.33.12	People will be burned until their bones become like lime;
ISA.33.12	they will burn quickly like dry thornbushes.”
ISA.33.13	You people in faraway lands, hear what I have done.
ISA.33.13	You people who are near me, learn about my power.
ISA.33.14	The sinners in Jerusalem are afraid;
ISA.33.14	those who are separated from God shake with fear.
ISA.33.14	They say, “Can any of us live through this fire that destroys?
ISA.33.14	Who can live near this fire that burns on and on?”
ISA.33.15	A person who does what is right
ISA.33.15	and speaks what is right,
ISA.33.15	who refuses to take money unfairly,
ISA.33.15	who refuses to take money to hurt others,
ISA.33.15	who does not listen to plans of murder,
ISA.33.15	who refuses to think about evil—
ISA.33.16	this is the kind of person who will be safe.
ISA.33.16	He will be protected as he would be in a high, walled city.
ISA.33.16	He will always have bread,
ISA.33.16	and he will not run out of water.
ISA.33.17	Your eyes will see the king in his beauty.
ISA.33.17	You will see the land that stretches far away.
ISA.33.18	You will think about the terror of the past:
ISA.33.18	“Where is that officer?
ISA.33.18	Where is the one who collected the taxes?
ISA.33.18	Where is the officer in charge of our defense towers?”
ISA.33.19	No longer will you see those proud people from other countries,
ISA.33.19	whose strange language you couldn’t understand.
ISA.33.20	Look at Jerusalem, the city of our festivals.
ISA.33.20	Look at Jerusalem, that beautiful place of rest.
ISA.33.20	It is like a tent that will never be moved;
ISA.33.20	the pegs that hold her in place will never be pulled up,
ISA.33.20	and her ropes will never be broken.
ISA.33.21	There the L
ISA.33.21	That land is a place with streams and wide rivers,
ISA.33.21	but there will be no enemy boats on those rivers;
ISA.33.21	no powerful ship will sail on them.
ISA.33.22	This is because the L
ISA.33.22	The L
ISA.33.22	The L
ISA.33.22	He will save us.
ISA.33.23	You sailors from other lands, hear:
ISA.33.23	The ropes on your boats hang loose.
ISA.33.23	The mast is not held firm.
ISA.33.23	The sails are not spread open.
ISA.33.23	Then your great wealth will be divided.
ISA.33.23	There will be so much wealth that even the crippled people will carry off a share.
ISA.33.24	No one living in Jerusalem will say, “I am sick.”
ISA.33.24	The people who live there will have their sins forgiven.
ISA.34.1	All you nations, come near and listen.
ISA.34.1	Pay attention, you peoples!
ISA.34.1	The earth and all the people in it should listen,
ISA.34.1	the world and everything in it.
ISA.34.2	The L
ISA.34.2	he is angry with their armies.
ISA.34.2	He will destroy them and kill them all.
ISA.34.3	Their bodies will be thrown outside.
ISA.34.3	The stink will rise from the bodies,
ISA.34.3	and the blood will flow down the mountains.
ISA.34.4	The sun, moon, and stars will dissolve,
ISA.34.4	and the sky will be rolled up like a scroll.
ISA.34.4	The stars will fall
ISA.34.4	like dead leaves from a vine
ISA.34.4	or dried-up figs from a fig tree.
ISA.34.5	The L
ISA.34.5	It will cut through Edom
ISA.34.5	and destroy those people as an offering to the L
ISA.34.6	The L
ISA.34.6	it will be covered with fat,
ISA.34.6	with the blood from lambs and goats,
ISA.34.6	with the fat from the kidneys of sheep.
ISA.34.6	This is because the L
ISA.34.6	and much killing in Edom.
ISA.34.7	The oxen will be killed,
ISA.34.7	and the cattle and the strong bulls.
ISA.34.7	The land will be filled with their blood,
ISA.34.7	and the dirt will be covered with their fat.
ISA.34.8	The L
ISA.34.8	He has chosen a year when people must pay for the wrongs they did to Jerusalem.
ISA.34.9	Edom’s rivers will be like hot tar.
ISA.34.9	Its dirt will be like burning sulfur.
ISA.34.9	Its land will be like burning tar.
ISA.34.10	The fires will burn night and day;
ISA.34.10	the smoke will rise from Edom forever.
ISA.34.10	Year after year that land will be empty;
ISA.34.10	no one will ever travel through that land again.
ISA.34.11	Birds and small animals will own that land,
ISA.34.11	and owls and ravens will live there.
ISA.34.11	God will make it an empty wasteland;
ISA.34.11	it will have nothing left in it.
ISA.34.12	The important people will have no one left to rule them;
ISA.34.12	the leaders will all be gone.
ISA.34.13	Thorns will take over the strong towers,
ISA.34.13	and wild bushes will grow in the walled cities.
ISA.34.13	It will be a home for wild dogs
ISA.34.13	and a place for owls to live.
ISA.34.14	Desert animals will live with the hyenas,
ISA.34.14	and wild goats will call to their friends.
ISA.34.14	Night animals will live there
ISA.34.14	and find a place of rest.
ISA.34.15	Owls will nest there and lay eggs.
ISA.34.15	When they hatch open, the owls will gather their young under their wings.
ISA.34.15	Hawks will gather
ISA.34.15	with their own kind.
ISA.34.16	Look at the L
ISA.34.16	None of these will be missing;
ISA.34.16	none will be without its mate.
ISA.34.16	God has given the command,
ISA.34.16	so his Spirit will gather them together.
ISA.34.17	God has divided the land among them,
ISA.34.17	and he has given them each their portion.
ISA.34.17	So they will own that land forever
ISA.34.17	and will live there year after year.
ISA.35.1	The desert and dry land will become happy;
ISA.35.1	the desert will be glad and will produce flowers.
ISA.35.1	Like a flower, 
ISA.35.2	it will have many blooms.
ISA.35.2	It will show its happiness, as if it were shouting with joy.
ISA.35.2	It will be beautiful like the forest of Lebanon,
ISA.35.2	as beautiful as the hill of Carmel and the Plain of Sharon.
ISA.35.2	Everyone will see the glory of the L
ISA.35.2	and the splendor of our God.
ISA.35.3	Make the weak hands strong
ISA.35.3	and the weak knees steady.
ISA.35.4	Say to people who are frightened,
ISA.35.4	“Be strong. Don’t be afraid.
ISA.35.4	Look, your God will come,
ISA.35.4	and he will punish your enemies.
ISA.35.4	He will make them pay for the wrongs they did,
ISA.35.4	but he will save you.”
ISA.35.5	Then the blind people will see again,
ISA.35.5	and the deaf will hear.
ISA.35.6	Crippled people will jump like deer,
ISA.35.6	and those who can’t talk now will shout with joy.
ISA.35.6	Water will flow in the desert,
ISA.35.6	and streams will flow in the dry land.
ISA.35.7	The burning desert will have pools of water,
ISA.35.7	and the dry ground will have springs.
ISA.35.7	Where wild dogs once lived,
ISA.35.7	grass and water plants will grow.
ISA.35.8	A road will be there;
ISA.35.8	this highway will be called “The Road to Being Holy.”
ISA.35.8	Evil people will not be allowed to walk on that road;
ISA.35.8	only good people will walk on it.
ISA.35.8	No fools will go on it.
ISA.35.9	No lions will be there,
ISA.35.9	nor will dangerous animals be on that road.
ISA.35.9	They will not be found there.
ISA.35.9	That road will be for the people God saves;
ISA.35.10	the people the L
ISA.35.10	They will enter Jerusalem with joy,
ISA.35.10	and their happiness will last forever.
ISA.35.10	Their gladness and joy will fill them completely,
ISA.35.10	and sorrow and sadness will go far away.
ISA.36.1	During Hezekiah’s fourteenth year as king, Sennacherib king of Assyria attacked all the strong, walled cities of Judah and captured them. 
ISA.36.2	The king of Assyria sent out his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. When the commander came near the waterway from the upper pool on the road where people do their laundry, he stopped. 
ISA.36.3	Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah went out to meet him. Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager, Shebna was the royal secretary, and Joah son of Asaph was the recorder.
ISA.36.4	The field commander said to them, “Tell Hezekiah this:
ISA.36.4	“ ‘The great king, the king of Assyria, says: What can you trust in now? 
ISA.36.5	You say you have battle plans and power for war, but your words mean nothing. Whom are you trusting for help so that you turn against me? 
ISA.36.6	Look, you are depending on Egypt to help you, but Egypt is like a splintered walking stick. If you lean on it for help, it will stab your hand and hurt you. The king of Egypt will hurt all those who depend on him.

ISA.36.10	I have not come to attack and destroy this country without an order from the L
ISA.36.11	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the field commander, “Please speak to us in the Aramaic language. We understand it. Don’t speak to us in Hebrew, because the people on the city wall can hear you.”
ISA.36.12	But the commander said, “My master did not send me to tell these things only to you and your king. He sent me to speak also to those people sitting on the wall who will have to eat their own dung and drink their own urine like you.”
ISA.36.13	Then the commander stood and shouted loudly in the Hebrew language, “Listen to what the great king, the king of Assyria says,

ISA.36.15	Don’t let Hezekiah talk you into trusting the L

ISA.36.17	After that I will come and take you to a land like your own—a land with grain and new wine, bread and vineyards.’
ISA.36.18	“Don’t let Hezekiah fool you, saying, ‘The L
ISA.36.19	Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? They did not save Samaria from my power. 
ISA.36.20	Not one of all the gods of these countries has saved his people from me. Neither can the L
ISA.36.21	The people were silent. They didn’t answer the commander at all, because King Hezekiah had ordered, “Don’t answer him.”
ISA.36.22	Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah tore their clothes to show how upset they were. (Eliakim son of Hilkiah was the palace manager, Shebna was the royal secretary, and Joah son of Asaph was the recorder.) The three men went to Hezekiah and told him what the field commander had said.
ISA.37.1	When King Hezekiah heard the message, he tore his clothes and put on rough cloth to show how sad he was. Then he went into the Temple of the L
ISA.37.2	Hezekiah sent Eliakim, the palace manager, and Shebna, the royal secretary, and the older priests to Isaiah. They were all wearing rough cloth when they came to Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz. 
ISA.37.3	They told Isaiah, “This is what Hezekiah says: Today is a day of sorrow and punishment and disgrace, as when a child should be born, but the mother is not strong enough to give birth to it. 
ISA.37.4	The king of Assyria sent his field commander to make fun of the living God. Maybe the L
ISA.37.5	When Hezekiah’s officers came to Isaiah, 
ISA.37.6	he said to them, “Tell your master this: The L
ISA.37.7	Listen! I am going to put a spirit in the king of Assyria. He will hear a report that will make him return to his own country, and I will cause him to die by the sword there.’ ”
ISA.37.8	The field commander heard that the king of Assyria had left Lachish. When he went back, he found the king fighting against the city of Libnah.
ISA.37.9	The king received a report that Tirhakah, the Cushite king of Egypt, was coming to attack him. When the king of Assyria heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying, 
ISA.37.10	“Tell Hezekiah king of Judah: Don’t be fooled by the god you trust. Don’t believe him when he says Jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of Assyria. 
ISA.37.11	You have heard what the kings of Assyria have done. They have completely defeated every country, so do not think you will be saved. 
ISA.37.12	Did the gods of those people save them? My ancestors destroyed them, defeating the cities of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and the people of Eden living in Tel Assar. 
ISA.37.13	Where are the kings of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the kings of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?”
ISA.37.14	When Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the Temple of the L
ISA.37.15	and prayed to the L
ISA.37.16	“L
ISA.37.17	Hear, L
ISA.37.18	“It is true, L
ISA.37.19	They have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire, but they were only wood and rock statues that people made. So the kings have destroyed them.

ISA.37.22	So this is what the L

ISA.37.23	You have insulted me and spoken against me;
ISA.37.23	you have raised your voice against me.
ISA.37.23	You have a proud look on your face,
ISA.37.23	which is against me, the Holy One of Israel!
ISA.37.24	You have sent your messengers to insult the Lord.
ISA.37.24	You have said, “With my many chariots
ISA.37.24	I have gone to the tops of the mountains,
ISA.37.24	to the highest mountains of Lebanon.
ISA.37.24	I have cut down its tallest cedars
ISA.37.24	and its best pine trees.
ISA.37.24	I have gone to its greatest heights
ISA.37.24	and its best forests.
ISA.37.25	I have dug wells in foreign countries
ISA.37.25	and drunk water there.
ISA.37.25	By the soles of my feet,
ISA.37.25	I have dried up all the rivers of Egypt.”
ISA.37.26	“ ‘King of Assyria, surely you have heard.
ISA.37.26	Long ago I, the L
ISA.37.26	Long ago I designed them,
ISA.37.26	and now I have made them happen.
ISA.37.26	I allowed you to turn those strong, walled cities
ISA.37.26	into piles of rocks.
ISA.37.27	The people in those cities were weak;
ISA.37.27	they were frightened and put to shame.
ISA.37.27	They were like grass in the field,
ISA.37.27	like tender, young grass,
ISA.37.27	like grass on the housetop
ISA.37.27	that is burned by the wind before it can grow.
ISA.37.28	“ ‘I know when you rest,
ISA.37.28	when you come and go,
ISA.37.28	and how you rage against me.
ISA.37.29	Because you rage against me,
ISA.37.29	and because I have heard your proud words,
ISA.37.29	I will put my hook in your nose
ISA.37.29	and my bit in your mouth.
ISA.37.29	Then I will force you to leave my country
ISA.37.29	the same way you came.’
ISA.37.30	“Then the L
ISA.37.30	This year you will eat the grain that grows wild,
ISA.37.30	and the second year you will eat what grows wild from that.
ISA.37.30	But in the third year, plant grain and harvest it.
ISA.37.30	Plant vineyards and eat their fruit.
ISA.37.31	Some of the people in the family of Judah
ISA.37.31	will escape.
ISA.37.31	Like plants that take root,
ISA.37.31	they will grow strong and have many children.
ISA.37.32	A few people will come out of Jerusalem alive;
ISA.37.32	a few from Mount Zion will live.
ISA.37.32	The strong love of the L
ISA.37.32	will make this happen.’
ISA.37.33	“So this is what the L
ISA.37.33	‘He will not enter this city
ISA.37.33	or even shoot an arrow here.
ISA.37.33	He will not fight against it with shields
ISA.37.33	or build a ramp to attack the city walls.
ISA.37.34	He will return to his country the same way he came,
ISA.37.34	and he will not enter this city,’
ISA.37.34	says the L
ISA.37.35	‘I will defend and save this city
ISA.37.35	for my sake and for David, my servant.’ ”
ISA.37.36	Then the angel of the L
ISA.37.37	So Sennacherib king of Assyria left and went back to Nineveh and stayed there.
ISA.37.38	One day as Sennacherib was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword. Then they escaped to the land of Ararat. So Sennacherib’s son Esarhaddon became king of Assyria.
ISA.38.1	At that time Hezekiah became very sick; he was almost dead. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and told him, “This is what the L
ISA.38.2	Hezekiah turned toward the wall and prayed to the L
ISA.38.3	“L
ISA.38.4	Then the L
ISA.38.5	“Go to Hezekiah and tell him: ‘This is what the L

ISA.38.7	“ ‘The L
ISA.38.8	The sun has made a shadow go down the stairway of Ahaz, but I will make it go back ten steps.’ ” So the shadow made by the sun went back up the ten steps it had gone down.
ISA.38.9	After Hezekiah king of Judah got well, he wrote this song:
ISA.38.10	I said, “I am in the middle of my life.
ISA.38.10	Do I have to go through the gates of death?
ISA.38.10	Will I have the rest of my life taken away from me?”
ISA.38.11	I said, “I will not see the L
ISA.38.11	in the land of the living again.
ISA.38.11	I will not again see the people
ISA.38.11	who live on the earth.
ISA.38.12	Like a shepherd’s tent,
ISA.38.12	my home has been pulled down and taken from me.
ISA.38.12	I am finished
ISA.38.12	like the cloth a weaver rolls up and cuts from the loom.
ISA.38.12	In one day you brought me to this end.
ISA.38.13	All night I cried loudly.
ISA.38.13	Like a lion, he crushed all my bones.
ISA.38.13	In one day you brought me to this end.
ISA.38.14	I cried like a bird
ISA.38.14	and moaned like a dove.
ISA.38.14	My eyes became tired as I looked to the heavens.
ISA.38.14	Lord, I have troubles. Please help me.”
ISA.38.15	What can I say?
ISA.38.15	The Lord told me what would happen and then made it happen.
ISA.38.15	I have had these troubles in my soul,
ISA.38.15	so now I will be humble all my life.
ISA.38.16	Lord, because of you, people live.
ISA.38.16	Because of you, my spirit also lives;
ISA.38.16	you made me well and let me live.
ISA.38.17	It was for my own good
ISA.38.17	that I had such troubles.
ISA.38.17	Because you love me very much,
ISA.38.17	you did not let me die
ISA.38.17	but threw my sins
ISA.38.17	far away.
ISA.38.18	People in the place of the dead cannot praise you;
ISA.38.18	those who have died cannot sing praises to you;
ISA.38.18	those who die don’t trust you
ISA.38.18	to help them.
ISA.38.19	The people who are alive are the ones who praise you.
ISA.38.19	They praise you as I praise you today.
ISA.38.19	A father should tell his children
ISA.38.19	that you provide help.

ISA.38.20	so we will play songs on stringed instruments
ISA.38.20	in the Temple of the L
ISA.38.20	all the days of our lives.
ISA.38.21	Then Isaiah said, “Make a paste from figs and put it on Hezekiah’s boil. Then he will get well.” 
ISA.38.22	Hezekiah then asked Isaiah, “What will be the sign? What will show that I will go up to the Temple of the L
ISA.39.1	At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan was king of Babylon. He sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, because he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick and was now well. 
ISA.39.2	Hezekiah was pleased and showed the messengers what was in his storehouses: the silver, gold, spices, expensive perfumes, his swords and shields, and all his wealth. He showed them everything in his palace and in his kingdom.
ISA.39.3	Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say? Where did they come from?”
ISA.39.3	Hezekiah said, “They came from a faraway country—from Babylon.”
ISA.39.4	So Isaiah asked him, “What did they see in your palace?”
ISA.39.4	Hezekiah said, “They saw everything in my palace. I showed them all my wealth.”
ISA.39.5	Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah: “Listen to the words of the L
ISA.39.6	‘In the future everything in your palace and everything your ancestors have stored up until this day will be taken away to Babylon. Nothing will be left,’ says the L
ISA.39.7	Some of your own children, those who will be born to you, will be taken away, and they will become servants in the palace of the king of Babylon.”
ISA.39.8	Hezekiah told Isaiah, “These words from the L
ISA.40.1	Your God says,
ISA.40.1	“Comfort, comfort my people.
ISA.40.2	Speak kindly to the people of Jerusalem
ISA.40.2	and tell them

ISA.40.2	that they have paid for their sins,
ISA.40.2	that the L
ISA.40.2	twice for every sin they did.”
ISA.40.3	This is the voice of one who calls out:

ISA.40.3	Make a straight road in the dry lands
ISA.40.3	for our God.
ISA.40.4	Every valley should be raised up,
ISA.40.4	and every mountain and hill should be made flat.
ISA.40.4	The rough ground should be made level,
ISA.40.4	and the rugged ground should be made smooth.
ISA.40.5	Then the glory of the L
ISA.40.5	and all people together will see it.

ISA.40.9	Jerusalem, you have good news to tell.
ISA.40.9	Shout out loud the good news.
ISA.40.9	Shout it out and don’t be afraid.
ISA.40.9	Say to the towns of Judah,
ISA.40.9	“Here is your God.”
ISA.40.10	Look, the Lord 
ISA.40.10	to rule all the people.
ISA.40.10	Look, he will bring reward for his people;
ISA.40.10	he will have their payment with him.
ISA.40.11	He takes care of his people like a shepherd.
ISA.40.11	He gathers them like lambs in his arms
ISA.40.11	and carries them close to him.
ISA.40.11	He gently leads the mothers of the lambs.
ISA.40.12	Who has measured the oceans in the palm of his hand?
ISA.40.12	Who has used his hand to measure the sky?
ISA.40.12	Who has used a bowl to measure all the dust of the earth
ISA.40.12	and scales to weigh the mountains and hills?
ISA.40.13	Who has known the mind of the L

ISA.40.16	All the trees in Lebanon are not enough for the altar fires,
ISA.40.16	and all the animals in Lebanon are not enough for burnt offerings.
ISA.40.17	Compared to the L

ISA.40.18	Can you compare God to anything?
ISA.40.18	Can you compare him to an image of anything?
ISA.40.19	An idol is formed by a craftsman,
ISA.40.19	and a goldsmith covers it with gold
ISA.40.19	and makes silver chains for it.
ISA.40.20	A poor person cannot buy those expensive statues,
ISA.40.20	so he finds a tree that will not rot.
ISA.40.20	Then he finds a skilled craftsman
ISA.40.20	to make it into an idol that will not fall over.
ISA.40.21	Surely you know. Surely you have heard.
ISA.40.21	Surely from the beginning someone told you.
ISA.40.21	Surely you understand how the earth was created.
ISA.40.22	God sits on his throne above the circle of the earth,
ISA.40.22	and compared to him, people are like grasshoppers.
ISA.40.22	He stretches out the skies like a piece of cloth
ISA.40.22	and spreads them out like a tent to sit under.
ISA.40.23	He makes rulers unimportant
ISA.40.23	and the judges of this world worth nothing.
ISA.40.24	They are like plants that are placed in the ground,
ISA.40.24	like seeds that are planted.
ISA.40.24	As soon as they begin to grow strong,

ISA.40.26	Look up to the skies.
ISA.40.26	Who created all these stars?
ISA.40.26	He leads out the army of heaven one by one

ISA.40.29	and more power to those who are weak.

ISA.42.2	or speak loudly in the streets.
ISA.42.3	He will not break a crushed blade of grass
ISA.42.3	or put out even a weak flame.
ISA.42.3	He will truly bring justice;
ISA.42.4	he will not lose hope or give up
ISA.42.4	until he brings justice to the world.
ISA.42.4	And people far away will trust his teachings.”
ISA.42.5	God, the L
ISA.42.5	He created the skies and stretched them out.
ISA.42.5	He spread out the earth and everything on it.

ISA.42.6	and protect you.
ISA.42.6	You will be the sign of my agreement with the people,
ISA.42.6	a light to shine for all people.
ISA.42.7	You will help the blind to see.
ISA.42.7	You will free those who are in prison,
ISA.42.7	and you will lead those who live in darkness out of their prison.
ISA.42.8	“I am the L
ISA.42.8	I will not give my glory to another;
ISA.42.8	I will not let idols take the praise that should be mine.
ISA.42.9	The things I said would happen have happened,

ISA.42.9	Before those things happen,
ISA.42.9	I tell you about them.”
ISA.42.10	Sing a new song to the L
ISA.42.10	sing his praise everywhere on the earth.
ISA.42.10	Praise him, you people who sail on the seas and you animals who live in them.
ISA.42.10	Praise him, you people living in faraway places.
ISA.42.11	The deserts and their cities should praise him.
ISA.42.11	The settlements of Kedar should praise him.
ISA.42.11	The people living in Sela should sing for joy;
ISA.42.11	they should shout from the mountaintops.
ISA.42.12	They should give glory to the L
ISA.42.12	People in faraway lands should praise him.
ISA.42.13	The L
ISA.42.13	he will be excited like a man ready to fight a war.
ISA.42.13	He will shout out the battle cry
ISA.42.13	and defeat his enemies.
ISA.42.14	The L
ISA.42.14	I have been quiet and held myself back.
ISA.42.14	But now I will cry out
ISA.42.14	and strain like a woman giving birth to a child.
ISA.42.15	I will destroy the hills and mountains
ISA.42.15	and dry up all their plants.
ISA.42.15	I will make the rivers become dry land
ISA.42.15	and dry up the pools of water.
ISA.42.16	Then I will lead the blind along a way they never knew;
ISA.42.16	I will guide them along paths they have not known.
ISA.42.16	I will make the darkness become light for them,
ISA.42.16	and the rough ground smooth.
ISA.42.16	These are the things I will do;
ISA.42.16	I will not leave my people.
ISA.42.17	But those who trust in idols,
ISA.42.17	who say to their statues,
ISA.42.17	‘You are our gods’
ISA.42.17	will be rejected in disgrace.
ISA.42.18	“You who are deaf, hear me.
ISA.42.18	You who are blind, look and see.
ISA.42.19	No one is more blind than my servant Israel

ISA.42.20	You hear, but you refuse to listen.”
ISA.42.21	The L
ISA.42.21	because he is good.
ISA.42.22	These people have been defeated and robbed.
ISA.42.22	They are trapped in pits
ISA.42.22	or locked up in prison.
ISA.42.22	Like robbers, enemies have taken them away,
ISA.42.22	and there is no one to save them.
ISA.42.22	Enemies carried them off,
ISA.42.22	and no one said, “Bring them back.”
ISA.42.23	Will any of you listen to this?
ISA.42.23	Will you listen carefully in the future?
ISA.42.24	Who let the people of Jacob be carried off?
ISA.42.24	Who let robbers take Israel away?
ISA.42.24	The L
ISA.42.24	because we sinned against him.
ISA.42.24	We did not live the way he wanted us to live
ISA.42.24	and did not obey his teaching.
ISA.42.25	So he became very angry with us
ISA.42.25	and brought terrible wars against us.
ISA.42.25	It was as if the people of Israel had fire all around them,
ISA.42.25	but they didn’t know what was happening.
ISA.42.25	It was as if they were burning,
ISA.42.25	but they didn’t pay any attention.
ISA.43.1	Now this is what the L
ISA.43.1	He created you, people of Jacob;
ISA.43.1	he formed you, people of Israel.
ISA.43.1	He says, “Don’t be afraid, because I have saved you.
ISA.43.1	I have called you by name, and you are mine.
ISA.43.2	When you pass through the waters, I will be with you.
ISA.43.2	When you cross rivers, you will not drown.
ISA.43.2	When you walk through fire, you will not be burned,
ISA.43.2	nor will the flames hurt you.
ISA.43.3	This is because I, the L
ISA.43.3	the Holy One of Israel, your Savior.
ISA.43.3	I gave Egypt to pay for you,
ISA.43.3	and I gave Cush and Seba to make you mine.
ISA.43.4	Because you are precious to me,
ISA.43.4	because I give you honor and love you,
ISA.43.4	I will give other people in your place;
ISA.43.4	I will give other nations to save your life.
ISA.43.5	Don’t be afraid, because I am with you.
ISA.43.5	I will bring your children from the east
ISA.43.5	and gather you from the west.
ISA.43.6	I will tell the north: Give my people to me.
ISA.43.6	I will tell the south: Don’t keep my people in prison.
ISA.43.6	Bring my sons from far away
ISA.43.6	and my daughters from faraway places.
ISA.43.7	Bring to me all the people who are mine,
ISA.43.7	whom I made for my glory,
ISA.43.7	whom I formed and made.”
ISA.43.8	Bring out the people who have eyes but don’t see
ISA.43.8	and those who have ears but don’t hear.
ISA.43.9	All the nations gather together,
ISA.43.9	and all the people come together.
ISA.43.9	Which of their gods said this would happen?
ISA.43.9	Which of their gods can tell what happened in the beginning?
ISA.43.9	Let them bring their witnesses to prove they were right.
ISA.43.9	Then others will say, “It is true.”
ISA.43.10	The L
ISA.43.10	and the servant I chose.
ISA.43.10	I chose you so you would know and believe me,
ISA.43.10	so you would understand that I am the true God.
ISA.43.10	There was no God before me,
ISA.43.10	and there will be no God after me.
ISA.43.11	I myself am the L
ISA.43.11	I am the only Savior.
ISA.43.12	I myself have spoken to you, saved you, and told you these things.
ISA.43.12	It was not some foreign god among you.
ISA.43.12	You are my witnesses, and I am God,”
ISA.43.12	says the L
ISA.43.13	“I have always been God.
ISA.43.13	No one can save people from my power;
ISA.43.13	when I do something, no one can change it.”
ISA.43.14	This is what the L
ISA.43.14	the Holy One of Israel, says:
ISA.43.14	“I will send armies to Babylon for you,
ISA.43.14	and I will knock down all its locked gates.
ISA.43.14	The Babylonians will shout their cries of sorrow.
ISA.43.15	I am the L
ISA.43.15	the Creator of Israel, your King.”
ISA.43.16	This is what the L
ISA.43.16	He is the one who made a road through the sea
ISA.43.16	and a path through rough waters.
ISA.43.17	He is the one who defeated the chariots and horses
ISA.43.17	and the mighty armies.
ISA.43.17	They fell together and will never rise again.
ISA.43.17	They were destroyed as a flame is put out.
ISA.43.18	The L
ISA.43.18	and do not think about the past.
ISA.43.19	Look at the new thing I am going to do.
ISA.43.19	It is already happening. Don’t you see it?
ISA.43.19	I will make a road in the desert
ISA.43.19	and rivers in the dry land.
ISA.43.20	Even the wild animals will be thankful to me—
ISA.43.20	the wild dogs and owls.
ISA.43.20	They will honor me when I put water in the desert
ISA.43.20	and rivers in the dry land
ISA.43.20	to give water to my people, the ones I chose.
ISA.43.21	The people I made
ISA.43.21	will sing songs to praise me.
ISA.43.22	“People of Jacob, you have not called to me;
ISA.43.22	people of Israel, you have become tired of me.
ISA.43.23	You have not brought me your sacrifices of sheep
ISA.43.23	nor honored me with your sacrifices.
ISA.43.23	I did not weigh you down with sacrifices to offer
ISA.43.23	or make you tired with incense to burn.
ISA.43.24	So you did not buy incense for me;
ISA.43.24	you did not freely bring me fat from your sacrifices.
ISA.43.24	Instead you have weighed me down with your many sins;
ISA.43.24	you have made me tired of your many wrongs.
ISA.43.25	“I, I am the One who erases all your sins, for my sake;
ISA.43.25	I will not remember your sins.
ISA.43.26	But you should remind me.
ISA.43.26	Let’s meet and decide what is right.
ISA.43.26	Tell what you have done and show you are right.
ISA.43.27	Your first father sinned,
ISA.43.27	and your leaders have turned against me.
ISA.43.28	So I will make your holy rulers unholy.
ISA.43.28	I will bring destruction on the people of Jacob,
ISA.43.28	and I will let Israel be insulted.”
ISA.44.1	The L
ISA.44.1	People of Israel, I chose you.”
ISA.44.2	This is what the L
ISA.44.2	who formed you in your mother’s body,
ISA.44.2	who will help you:
ISA.44.2	“People of Jacob, my servants, don’t be afraid.
ISA.44.2	Israel, I chose you.
ISA.44.3	I will pour out water for the thirsty land
ISA.44.3	and make streams flow on dry land.
ISA.44.3	I will pour out my Spirit into your children
ISA.44.3	and my blessing on your descendants.
ISA.44.4	Your children will grow like a tree in the grass,
ISA.44.4	like poplar trees growing beside streams of water.
ISA.44.5	One person will say, ‘I belong to the L
ISA.44.5	and another will use the name Jacob.
ISA.44.5	Another will sign his name ‘I am the L
ISA.44.5	and another will use the name Israel.”
ISA.44.6	The L
ISA.44.6	is the L
ISA.44.6	This is what he says: “I am the beginning and the end.
ISA.44.6	I am the only God.
ISA.44.7	Who is a god like me?
ISA.44.7	That god should come and prove it.
ISA.44.7	Let him tell and explain all that has happened since I set up my ancient people.
ISA.44.7	He should also tell what will happen in the future.
ISA.44.8	Don’t be afraid! Don’t worry!
ISA.44.8	I have always told you what will happen.
ISA.44.8	You are my witnesses.
ISA.44.8	There is no other God but me.
ISA.44.8	I know of no other Rock; I am the only One.”
ISA.44.9	Some people make idols, but they are worth nothing.
ISA.44.9	People treasure them, but they are useless.
ISA.44.9	Those people are witnesses for the statues, but those people cannot see.
ISA.44.9	They know nothing, so they will be ashamed.
ISA.44.10	Who made these gods?
ISA.44.10	Who made these useless idols?
ISA.44.11	The workmen who made them will be ashamed,
ISA.44.11	because they are only human.
ISA.44.11	If they all would come together,
ISA.44.11	they would all be ashamed and afraid.
ISA.44.12	One workman uses tools to heat iron,
ISA.44.12	and he works over hot coals.
ISA.44.12	With his hammer he beats the metal and makes a statue,
ISA.44.12	using his powerful arms.
ISA.44.12	But when he becomes hungry, he loses his power.
ISA.44.12	If he does not drink water, he becomes tired.
ISA.44.13	Another workman uses a line and a compass
ISA.44.13	to draw on the wood.
ISA.44.13	Then he uses his chisels to cut a statue
ISA.44.13	and his calipers to measure the statue.
ISA.44.13	In this way, the workman makes the wood look exactly like a person,
ISA.44.13	and this statue of a person sits in the house.
ISA.44.14	He cuts down cedars
ISA.44.14	or cypress or oak trees.
ISA.44.14	Those trees grew by their own power in the forest.
ISA.44.14	Or he plants a pine tree, and the rain makes it grow.
ISA.44.15	Then he burns the tree.
ISA.44.15	He uses some of the wood for a fire to keep himself warm.
ISA.44.15	He also starts a fire to bake his bread.
ISA.44.15	But he uses part of the wood to make a god, and then he worships it!
ISA.44.15	He makes the idol and bows down to it!
ISA.44.16	The man burns half of the wood in the fire.
ISA.44.16	He uses the fire to cook his meat,
ISA.44.16	and he eats the meat until he is full.
ISA.44.16	He also burns the wood to keep himself warm. He says,
ISA.44.16	“Good! Now I am warm. I can see because of the fire’s light.”
ISA.44.17	But he makes a statue from the wood that is left and calls it his god.
ISA.44.17	He bows down to it and worships it.
ISA.44.17	He prays to it and says,
ISA.44.17	“You are my god. Save me!”
ISA.44.18	Those people don’t know what they are doing. They don’t understand!
ISA.44.18	It is as if their eyes are covered so they can’t see.
ISA.44.18	Their minds don’t understand.
ISA.44.19	They have not thought about these things;
ISA.44.19	they don’t understand.
ISA.44.19	They have never thought to themselves,
ISA.44.19	“I burned half of the wood in the fire
ISA.44.19	and used the hot coals to bake my bread.
ISA.44.19	I cooked and ate my meat.
ISA.44.19	And I used the wood that was left to make this hateful thing.
ISA.44.19	I am worshiping a block of wood!”
ISA.44.20	He doesn’t know what he is doing;
ISA.44.20	his confused mind leads him the wrong way.
ISA.44.20	He cannot save himself
ISA.44.20	or say, “This statue I am holding is a false god.”
ISA.44.21	“People of Jacob, remember these things!
ISA.44.21	People of Israel, remember you are my servants.
ISA.44.21	I made you, and you are my servants.
ISA.44.21	So Israel, I will not forget you.
ISA.44.22	I have swept away your sins like a big cloud;
ISA.44.22	I have removed your sins like a cloud that disappears into the air.
ISA.44.22	Come back to me because I saved you.”
ISA.44.23	Skies, sing for joy because the L
ISA.44.23	Earth, shout for joy, even in your deepest parts!
ISA.44.23	Sing, you mountains, with thanks to God.
ISA.44.23	Sing, too, you trees in the forest!
ISA.44.23	The L
ISA.44.23	He showed his glory when he saved Israel.
ISA.44.24	This is what the L
ISA.44.24	who formed you in your mother’s body:
ISA.44.24	“I, the L

ISA.44.25	I confuse even the wise;
ISA.44.25	they think they know much, but I make them look foolish.
ISA.44.26	I make the messages of my servants come true;
ISA.44.26	I make the advice of my messengers come true.
ISA.44.26	I say to Jerusalem,
ISA.44.26	‘People will live in you again!’
ISA.44.26	I say to the towns of Judah,
ISA.44.26	‘You will be built again!’
ISA.44.26	I say to Jerusalem’s ruins,
ISA.44.26	‘I will repair you.’
ISA.44.27	I tell the deep waters, ‘Become dry!
ISA.44.27	I will make your streams become dry!’
ISA.44.28	I say of Cyrus, ‘He is my shepherd
ISA.44.28	and will do all that I want him to do.

ISA.44.28	He will tell the Temple, “Your foundations will be rebuilt.” ’ ”

ISA.46.7	They set it in its place, and there it stands;
ISA.46.7	it cannot move from its place.
ISA.46.7	People may yell at it, but it cannot answer.
ISA.46.7	It cannot save them from their troubles.
ISA.46.8	“Remember this, and do not forget it!
ISA.46.8	Think about these things, you who turn against God.
ISA.46.9	Remember what happened long ago.
ISA.46.9	Remember that I am God, and there is no other God.
ISA.46.9	I am God, and there is no one like me.
ISA.46.10	From the beginning I told you what would happen in the end.
ISA.46.10	A long time ago I told you things that have not yet happened.
ISA.46.10	When I plan something, it happens.
ISA.46.10	What I want to do, I will do.
ISA.46.11	I am calling a man from the east to carry out my plan;
ISA.46.11	he will come like a hawk from a country far away.
ISA.46.11	I will make what I have said come true;
ISA.46.11	I will do what I have planned.
ISA.46.12	Listen to me, you stubborn people,
ISA.46.12	who are far from what is right.
ISA.46.13	I will soon do the things that are right.
ISA.46.13	I will bring salvation soon.
ISA.46.13	I will save Jerusalem
ISA.46.13	and bring glory to Israel.”
ISA.47.1	The L
ISA.47.1	People of Babylon, sit on the ground.
ISA.47.1	You are no longer the ruler.
ISA.47.1	You will no longer be called
ISA.47.1	tender or beautiful.
ISA.47.2	You must use large stones to grind grain into flour.
ISA.47.2	Remove your veil and your nice skirts.
ISA.47.2	Uncover your legs and cross the rivers.
ISA.47.3	People will see your nakedness;
ISA.47.3	they will see your shame.
ISA.47.3	I will punish you;
ISA.47.3	I will punish every one of you.”
ISA.47.4	Our Savior is named the L
ISA.47.4	he is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.47.5	“Babylon, sit in darkness and say nothing.
ISA.47.5	You will no longer be called the queen of kingdoms.
ISA.47.6	I was angry with my people,
ISA.47.6	so I rejected those who belonged to me.
ISA.47.6	I gave them to you,
ISA.47.6	but you showed them no mercy.
ISA.47.6	You even made the old people
ISA.47.6	work very hard.
ISA.47.7	You said, ‘I will live forever
ISA.47.7	as the queen.’
ISA.47.7	But you did not think about these things
ISA.47.7	or consider what would happen.
ISA.47.8	“Now, listen, you lover of pleasure.
ISA.47.8	You think you are safe.
ISA.47.8	You tell yourself,
ISA.47.8	‘I am the only important person.
ISA.47.8	I will never be a widow
ISA.47.8	or lose my children.’
ISA.47.9	Two things will happen to you suddenly, in a single day.
ISA.47.9	You will lose your children and your husband.
ISA.47.9	These things will truly happen to you,
ISA.47.9	in spite of all your magic,
ISA.47.9	in spite of your powerful tricks.
ISA.47.10	You do evil things, but you feel safe
ISA.47.10	and say, ‘No one sees what I do.’
ISA.47.10	Your wisdom and knowledge
ISA.47.10	have fooled you.
ISA.47.10	You say to yourself,
ISA.47.10	‘I am God, and no one is equal to me.’
ISA.47.11	But troubles will come to you,
ISA.47.11	and you will not know how to stop them.
ISA.47.11	Disaster will fall on you,
ISA.47.11	and you will not be able to keep it away.
ISA.47.11	You will be destroyed quickly;
ISA.47.11	you will not even see it coming.
ISA.47.12	“Keep on using your tricks
ISA.47.12	and doing all your magic
ISA.47.12	that you have used since you were young.
ISA.47.12	Maybe they will help you;
ISA.47.12	maybe you will be able to scare someone.
ISA.47.13	You are tired of the advice you have received.
ISA.47.13	So let those who study the sky—
ISA.47.13	those who tell the future by looking at the stars and the new moons—
ISA.47.13	let them save you from what is about to happen to you.
ISA.47.14	But they are like straw;
ISA.47.14	fire will quickly burn them up.
ISA.47.14	They cannot save themselves
ISA.47.14	from the power of the fire.
ISA.47.14	They are not like coals that give warmth
ISA.47.14	nor like a fire that you may sit beside.
ISA.47.15	You have worked with these people,
ISA.47.15	and they have been with you since you were young,
ISA.47.15	but they will not be able to help you.
ISA.47.15	Everyone will go his own way,
ISA.47.15	and there will be no one left to save you.”
ISA.48.1	The L
ISA.48.1	You are called Israel,
ISA.48.1	and you come from the family of Judah.
ISA.48.1	You swear by the L
ISA.48.1	and praise the God of Israel,
ISA.48.1	but you are not honest or sincere.
ISA.48.2	You call yourselves people of the holy city,
ISA.48.2	and you depend on the God of Israel,
ISA.48.2	who is named the L
ISA.48.3	Long ago I told you what would happen.
ISA.48.3	I said these things and made them known;
ISA.48.3	suddenly I acted, and these things happened.
ISA.48.4	I knew you were stubborn;
ISA.48.4	your neck was like an iron muscle,
ISA.48.4	and your head was like bronze.
ISA.48.5	So a long time ago I told you about these things;
ISA.48.5	I told you about them before they happened
ISA.48.5	so you couldn’t say, ‘My idols did this,
ISA.48.5	and my wooden and metal statues made these things happen.’
ISA.48.6	“You heard and saw everything that happened,
ISA.48.6	so you should tell this news to others.
ISA.48.6	Now I will tell you about new things,
ISA.48.6	hidden things that you don’t know yet.
ISA.48.7	These things are happening now, not long ago;
ISA.48.7	you have not heard about them before today.
ISA.48.7	So you cannot say, ‘We already knew about that.’
ISA.48.8	But you have not heard me; you have not understood.
ISA.48.8	Even long ago you did not listen to me.
ISA.48.8	I knew you would surely turn against me;
ISA.48.8	you have fought against me since you were born.
ISA.48.9	But for my own sake I will be patient.
ISA.48.9	People will praise me for not becoming angry
ISA.48.9	and destroying you.
ISA.48.10	I have made you pure, but not by fire, as silver is made pure.
ISA.48.10	I have purified you by giving you troubles.
ISA.48.11	I do this for myself, for my own sake.
ISA.48.11	I will not let people speak evil against me,
ISA.48.11	and I will not let some god take my glory.
ISA.48.12	“People of Jacob, listen to me.
ISA.48.12	People of Israel, I have called you to be my people.
ISA.48.12	I am God;
ISA.48.12	I am the beginning and the end.
ISA.48.13	I made the earth with my own hands.
ISA.48.13	With my right hand I spread out the skies.
ISA.48.13	When I call them,
ISA.48.13	they come together before me.”
ISA.48.14	All of you, come together and listen.
ISA.48.14	None of the gods said these things would happen.
ISA.48.14	The L
ISA.48.14	to attack the Babylonians;
ISA.48.14	he will carry out his wishes against Babylon.
ISA.48.15	“I have spoken; I have called him.
ISA.48.15	I have brought him, and I will make him successful.
ISA.48.16	Come to me and listen to this.
ISA.48.16	From the beginning I have spoken openly.
ISA.48.16	From the time it began, I was there.”
ISA.48.16	Now, the Lord 
ISA.48.16	has sent me with his Spirit.
ISA.48.17	This is what the L
ISA.48.17	the Holy One of Israel, says:
ISA.48.17	“I am the L
ISA.48.17	who teaches you to do what is good,
ISA.48.17	who leads you in the way you should go.
ISA.48.18	If you had obeyed me,
ISA.48.18	you would have had peace like a full-flowing river.
ISA.48.18	Good things would have flowed to you like the waves of the sea.
ISA.48.19	You would have had many children,
ISA.48.19	as many as the grains of sand.
ISA.48.19	They would never have died out
ISA.48.19	nor been destroyed.”
ISA.48.20	My people, leave Babylon!
ISA.48.20	Run from the Babylonians!
ISA.48.20	Tell this news with shouts of joy to the people;
ISA.48.20	spread it everywhere on earth.
ISA.48.20	Say, “The L
ISA.48.21	They did not become thirsty when he led them through the deserts.
ISA.48.21	He made water flow from a rock for them.
ISA.48.21	He split the rock,
ISA.48.21	and water flowed out.
ISA.48.22	“There is no peace for evil people,” says the L
ISA.49.1	All of you people in faraway places, listen to me.
ISA.49.1	Listen, all you nations far away.
ISA.49.1	Before I was born, the L
ISA.49.1	The L
ISA.49.2	He made my tongue like a sharp sword.
ISA.49.2	He hid me in the shadow of his hand.
ISA.49.2	He made me like a sharp arrow.
ISA.49.2	He hid me in the holder for his arrows.
ISA.49.3	He told me, “Israel, you are my servant.
ISA.49.3	I will show my glory through you.”
ISA.49.4	But I said, “I have worked hard for nothing;
ISA.49.4	I have used all my power, but I did nothing useful.
ISA.49.4	But the L
ISA.49.4	God will decide my reward.”
ISA.49.5	The L
ISA.49.5	to be his servant,
ISA.49.5	to lead the people of Jacob back to him
ISA.49.5	so that Israel might be gathered to him.
ISA.49.5	The L
ISA.49.5	and I will get my strength from my God.
ISA.49.6	Now he told me,
ISA.49.6	“You are an important servant to me
ISA.49.6	to bring back the tribes of Jacob,
ISA.49.6	to bring back the people of Israel who are left alive.
ISA.49.6	But, more importantly, I will make you a light for all nations
ISA.49.6	to show people all over the world the way to be saved.”
ISA.49.7	The L
ISA.49.7	is the Holy One of Israel.
ISA.49.7	He speaks to the one who is hated by the people,
ISA.49.7	to the servant of rulers.
ISA.49.7	This is what he says: “Kings will see you and stand to honor you;
ISA.49.7	great leaders will bow down before you,
ISA.49.7	because the L
ISA.49.7	He is the Holy One of Israel, who has chosen you.”
ISA.49.8	This is what the L
ISA.49.8	“At the right time I will hear your prayers.
ISA.49.8	On the day of salvation I will help you.
ISA.49.8	I will protect you,
ISA.49.8	and you will be the sign of my agreement with the people.
ISA.49.8	You will bring back the people to the land
ISA.49.8	and give the land that is now ruined back to its owners.
ISA.49.9	You will tell the prisoners, ‘Come out of your prison.’
ISA.49.9	You will tell those in darkness, ‘Come into the light.’
ISA.49.9	The people will eat beside the roads,
ISA.49.9	and they will find food even on bare hills.
ISA.49.10	They will not be hungry or thirsty.
ISA.49.10	Neither the hot sun nor the desert wind will hurt them.
ISA.49.10	The God who comforts them will lead them
ISA.49.10	and guide them by springs of water.
ISA.49.11	I will make my mountains into roads,
ISA.49.11	and the roads will be raised up.
ISA.49.12	Look, people are coming to me from far away,
ISA.49.12	from the north and from the west,
ISA.49.12	from Aswan in southern Egypt.”
ISA.49.13	Heavens and earth, be happy.
ISA.49.13	Mountains, shout with joy,
ISA.49.13	because the L
ISA.49.13	and will have pity on those who suffer.
ISA.49.14	But Jerusalem said, “The L
ISA.49.14	the Lord has forgotten me.”
ISA.49.15	The L
ISA.49.15	Can she feel no kindness for the child to which she gave birth?
ISA.49.15	Even if she could forget her children,
ISA.49.15	I will not forget you.
ISA.49.16	See, I have written your name on my hand.
ISA.49.16	Jerusalem, I always think about your walls.
ISA.49.17	Your children will soon return to you,
ISA.49.17	and the people who defeated you and destroyed you will leave.
ISA.49.18	Look up and look around you.
ISA.49.18	All your children are gathering to return to you.”
ISA.49.18	The L
ISA.49.18	your children will be like jewels
ISA.49.18	that a bride wears proudly.
ISA.49.19	“You were destroyed and defeated,
ISA.49.19	and your land was made useless.
ISA.49.19	But now you will have more people than the land can hold,
ISA.49.19	and those people who destroyed you will be far away.
ISA.49.20	Children were born to you while you were sad,
ISA.49.20	but they will say to you,
ISA.49.20	‘This place is too small for us.
ISA.49.20	Give us a bigger place to live.’
ISA.49.21	Then you will say to yourself,
ISA.49.21	‘Who gave me all these children?
ISA.49.21	I was sad and lonely,
ISA.49.21	defeated and separated from my people.
ISA.49.21	So who reared these children?
ISA.49.21	I was left all alone.
ISA.49.21	Where did all these children come from?’ ”
ISA.49.22	This is what the Lord 
ISA.49.22	“See, I will lift my hand to signal the nations;
ISA.49.22	I will raise my banner for all the people to see.
ISA.49.22	Then they will bring your sons back to you in their arms,
ISA.49.22	and they will carry your daughters on their shoulders.
ISA.49.23	Kings will teach your children,
ISA.49.23	and daughters of kings will take care of them.
ISA.49.23	They will bow down before you
ISA.49.23	and kiss the dirt at your feet.
ISA.49.23	Then you will know I am the L
ISA.49.23	Anyone who trusts in me will not be disappointed.”
ISA.49.24	Can the wealth a soldier wins in war be taken away from him?
ISA.49.24	Can a prisoner be freed from a powerful soldier?
ISA.49.25	This is what the L
ISA.49.25	“The prisoners will be taken from the strong soldiers.
ISA.49.25	What the soldiers have taken will be saved.
ISA.49.25	I will fight your enemies,
ISA.49.25	and I will save your children.
ISA.49.26	I will force those who trouble you to eat their own flesh.
ISA.49.26	Their own blood will be the wine that makes them drunk.
ISA.49.26	Then everyone will know
ISA.49.26	I, the L
ISA.49.26	I am the Powerful One of Jacob who saves you.”
ISA.50.1	This is what the L
ISA.50.1	“People of Israel, you say I divorced your mother.
ISA.50.1	Then where is the paper that proves it?
ISA.50.1	Or do you think I sold you
ISA.50.1	to pay a debt?
ISA.50.1	Because of the evil things you did, I sold you.
ISA.50.1	Because of the times she turned against me, your mother was sent away.
ISA.50.2	I came home and found no one there;
ISA.50.2	I called, but no one answered.
ISA.50.2	Do you think I am not able to save you?
ISA.50.2	Do I not have the power to save you?
ISA.50.2	Look, I need only to shout and the sea becomes dry.
ISA.50.2	I change rivers into a desert,
ISA.50.2	and their fish rot because there is no water;
ISA.50.2	they die of thirst.
ISA.50.3	I can make the skies dark;
ISA.50.3	I can make them black like clothes of sadness.”
ISA.50.4	The Lord 
ISA.50.4	so that I know what to say to make the weak strong.
ISA.50.4	Every morning he wakes me.
ISA.50.4	He teaches me to listen like a student.
ISA.50.5	The Lord 
ISA.50.5	and I have not turned against him
ISA.50.5	nor stopped following him.
ISA.50.6	I offered my back to those who beat me.
ISA.50.6	I offered my cheeks to those who pulled my beard.
ISA.50.6	I won’t hide my face from them
ISA.50.6	when they make fun of me and spit at me.
ISA.50.7	The Lord 
ISA.50.7	so I will not be ashamed.
ISA.50.7	I will be determined,
ISA.50.7	and I know I will not be disgraced.
ISA.50.8	He shows that I am innocent, and he is close to me.
ISA.50.8	So who can accuse me?
ISA.50.8	If there is someone, let us go to court together.
ISA.50.8	If someone wants to prove I have done wrong,
ISA.50.8	he should come and tell me.
ISA.50.9	Look! It is the Lord 
ISA.50.9	So who can prove me guilty?
ISA.50.9	Look! All those who try will become useless like old clothes;
ISA.50.9	moths will eat them.
ISA.50.10	Who among you fears the L
ISA.50.10	and obeys his servant?
ISA.50.10	That person may walk in the dark
ISA.50.10	and have no light.
ISA.50.10	Then let him trust in the L
ISA.50.10	and yet depend on his God.
ISA.50.11	But instead, some of you want to light your own fires
ISA.50.11	and make your own light.
ISA.50.11	So, go, walk in the light of your fires,
ISA.50.11	and trust your own light to guide you.
ISA.50.11	But this is what you will receive from me:
ISA.50.11	You will lie down in a place of pain.
ISA.51.1	The L
ISA.51.1	those of you who try to live right and follow the L
ISA.51.1	Look at the rock from which you were cut;
ISA.51.1	look at the stone quarry from which you were dug.
ISA.51.2	Look at Abraham, your ancestor,
ISA.51.2	and Sarah, who gave birth to your ancestors.
ISA.51.2	Abraham had no children when I called him,
ISA.51.2	but I blessed him and gave him many descendants.
ISA.51.3	So the L
ISA.51.3	he will show mercy to those who live in her ruins.
ISA.51.3	He will change her deserts into a garden like Eden;
ISA.51.3	he will make her empty lands like the garden of the L
ISA.51.3	People there will be very happy;
ISA.51.3	they will give thanks and sing songs.
ISA.51.4	“My people, listen to me;
ISA.51.4	my nation, pay attention to me.
ISA.51.4	I will give the people my teachings,
ISA.51.4	and my decisions will be like a light to all people.
ISA.51.5	I will soon show that I do what is right.
ISA.51.5	I will soon save you.
ISA.51.5	I will use my power and judge all nations.
ISA.51.5	All the faraway places are waiting for me;
ISA.51.5	they wait for my power to help them.
ISA.51.6	Look up to the heavens.
ISA.51.6	Look around you at the earth below.
ISA.51.6	The skies will disappear like clouds of smoke.
ISA.51.6	The earth will become useless like old clothes,
ISA.51.6	and its people will die like flies.
ISA.51.6	But my salvation will continue forever,
ISA.51.6	and my goodness will never end.
ISA.51.7	“You people who know what is right should listen to me;
ISA.51.7	you people who follow my teachings should hear what I say.
ISA.51.7	Don’t be afraid of the evil things people say,
ISA.51.7	and don’t be upset by their insults.
ISA.51.8	Moths will eat those people as if they were clothes,
ISA.51.8	and worms will eat them as if they were wool.
ISA.51.8	But my goodness will continue forever,
ISA.51.8	and my salvation will continue from now on.”
ISA.51.9	Wake up, wake up, and use your strength,
ISA.51.9	powerful L
ISA.51.9	Wake up as you did in the old times,
ISA.51.9	as you did a long time ago.
ISA.51.9	With your own power, you cut Rahab into pieces
ISA.51.9	and killed that sea monster.
ISA.51.10	You dried up the sea
ISA.51.10	and the waters of the deep ocean.
ISA.51.10	You made the deepest parts of the sea into a road
ISA.51.10	for your people to cross over and be saved.
ISA.51.11	The people the L
ISA.51.11	and enter Jerusalem with joy.
ISA.51.11	Their happiness will last forever.
ISA.51.11	They will have joy and gladness,
ISA.51.11	and all sadness and sorrow will be gone far away.
ISA.51.12	The L
ISA.51.12	So why should you be afraid of people, who die?
ISA.51.12	Why should you fear people who die like the grass?
ISA.51.13	Have you forgotten the L
ISA.51.13	who stretched out the skies
ISA.51.13	and made the earth?
ISA.51.13	Why are you always afraid
ISA.51.13	of those angry people who trouble you
ISA.51.13	and who want to destroy?
ISA.51.13	But where are those angry people now?
ISA.51.14	People in prison will soon be set free;
ISA.51.14	they will not die in prison,
ISA.51.14	and they will have enough food.
ISA.51.15	I am the L
ISA.51.15	who stirs the sea and makes the waves roar.
ISA.51.15	My name is the L
ISA.51.16	I will give you the words I want you to say.
ISA.51.16	I will cover you with my hands and protect you.
ISA.51.16	I made the heavens and the earth,
ISA.51.16	and I say to Jerusalem, ‘You are my people.’ ”
ISA.51.17	Awake! Awake!
ISA.51.17	Get up, Jerusalem.
ISA.51.17	The L
ISA.51.17	your punishment was like wine in a cup.
ISA.51.17	The L
ISA.51.17	you drank the whole cup until you stumbled.
ISA.51.18	Jerusalem had many people,
ISA.51.18	but there was not one to lead her.
ISA.51.18	Of all the people who grew up there,
ISA.51.18	no one was there to guide her.
ISA.51.19	Troubles came to you two by two,
ISA.51.19	but no one will feel sorry for you.
ISA.51.19	There was ruin and disaster, great hunger and fighting.
ISA.51.19	No one can comfort you.
ISA.51.20	Your people have become weak.
ISA.51.20	They fall down and lie on every street corner,
ISA.51.20	like animals caught in a net.
ISA.51.20	They have felt the full anger of the L
ISA.51.20	and have heard God’s angry shout.
ISA.51.21	So listen to me, poor Jerusalem,
ISA.51.21	you who are drunk but not from wine.
ISA.51.22	Your God will defend his people.
ISA.51.22	This is what the L
ISA.51.22	“The punishment I gave you is like a cup of wine.
ISA.51.22	You drank it and could not walk straight.
ISA.51.22	But I am taking that cup of my anger away from you,
ISA.51.22	and you will never be punished by my anger again.
ISA.51.23	I will now give that cup of punishment to those who gave you pain,
ISA.51.23	who told you,
ISA.51.23	‘Bow down so we can walk over you.’
ISA.51.23	They made your back like dirt for them to walk on;
ISA.51.23	you were like a street for them to travel on.”
ISA.52.1	Wake up, wake up, Jerusalem! Become strong!
ISA.52.1	Be beautiful again,
ISA.52.1	holy city of Jerusalem.
ISA.52.1	The people who do not worship God and who are not pure
ISA.52.1	will not enter you again.
ISA.52.2	Jerusalem, you once were a prisoner.
ISA.52.2	Now shake off the dust and stand up.
ISA.52.2	Jerusalem, you once were a prisoner.
ISA.52.2	Now free yourself from the chains around your neck.
ISA.52.3	This is what the L
ISA.52.3	“You were not sold for a price,
ISA.52.3	so you will be saved without cost.”
ISA.52.4	This is what the Lord

ISA.52.5	This nation who rules them makes fun of me,” says the L

ISA.52.6	This has happened so my people will know who I am,
ISA.52.6	and so, on that future day, they will know
ISA.52.6	that I am the one speaking to them.
ISA.52.6	It will really be me.”
ISA.52.7	How beautiful is the person
ISA.52.7	who comes over the mountains to bring good news,
ISA.52.7	who announces peace
ISA.52.7	and brings good news,
ISA.52.7	who announces salvation
ISA.52.7	and says to Jerusalem,
ISA.52.7	“Your God is King.”
ISA.52.8	Listen! Your guards are shouting.
ISA.52.8	They are all shouting for joy!
ISA.52.8	They all will see with their own eyes
ISA.52.8	when the L
ISA.52.9	Jerusalem, your buildings are destroyed now,
ISA.52.9	but shout and rejoice together,
ISA.52.9	because the L

ISA.52.10	The L
ISA.52.10	to all the nations.
ISA.52.10	Then everyone on earth
ISA.52.10	will see the salvation of our God.
ISA.52.11	You people, leave, leave; get out of Babylon!
ISA.52.11	Touch nothing that is unclean.
ISA.52.11	You men who carry the L
ISA.52.11	leave there and make yourselves pure.
ISA.52.12	You will not be forced to leave Babylon quickly;
ISA.52.12	you will not be forced to run away,
ISA.52.12	because the L
ISA.52.12	and the God of Israel will guard you from behind.
ISA.52.13	The L

ISA.52.14	Many people were shocked when they saw him.
ISA.52.14	His appearance was so damaged he did not look like a man;
ISA.52.14	his form was so changed they could barely tell he was human.
ISA.52.15	But now he will surprise many nations.
ISA.52.15	Kings will be amazed and shut their mouths.
ISA.52.15	They will see things they had not been told about him,
ISA.52.15	and they will understand things they had not heard.”
ISA.53.1	Who would have believed what we heard?
ISA.53.1	Who saw the L
ISA.53.2	He grew up like a small plant before the L
ISA.53.2	like a root growing in a dry land.
ISA.53.2	He had no special beauty or form to make us notice him;
ISA.53.2	there was nothing in his appearance to make us desire him.
ISA.53.3	He was hated and rejected by people.
ISA.53.3	He had much pain and suffering.
ISA.53.3	People would not even look at him.
ISA.53.3	He was hated, and we didn’t even notice him.
ISA.53.4	But he took our suffering on him
ISA.53.4	and felt our pain for us.
ISA.53.4	We saw his suffering
ISA.53.4	and thought God was punishing him.
ISA.53.5	But he was wounded for the wrong we did;
ISA.53.5	he was crushed for the evil we did.
ISA.53.5	The punishment, which made us well, was given to him,
ISA.53.5	and we are healed because of his wounds.
ISA.53.6	We all have wandered away like sheep;
ISA.53.6	each of us has gone his own way.
ISA.53.6	But the L
ISA.53.6	for all the evil we have done.
ISA.53.7	He was beaten down and punished,
ISA.53.7	but he didn’t say a word.
ISA.53.7	He was like a lamb being led to be killed.
ISA.53.7	He was quiet, as a sheep is quiet while its wool is being cut;
ISA.53.7	he never opened his mouth.
ISA.53.8	Men took him away roughly and unfairly.
ISA.53.8	He died without children to continue his family.
ISA.53.8	He was put to death;
ISA.53.8	he was punished for the sins of my people.
ISA.53.9	He was buried with wicked men,
ISA.53.9	and he died with the rich.
ISA.53.9	He had done nothing wrong,
ISA.53.9	and he had never lied.
ISA.53.10	But it was the L
ISA.53.10	to crush him and make him suffer.
ISA.53.10	The L

ISA.53.11	My good servant will make many people right with God;
ISA.53.11	he will carry away their sins.
ISA.53.12	For this reason I will make him a great man among people,
ISA.53.12	and he will share in all things with those who are strong.
ISA.53.12	He willingly gave his life
ISA.53.12	and was treated like a criminal.
ISA.53.12	But he carried away the sins of many people
ISA.53.12	and asked forgiveness for those who sinned.”
ISA.54.1	The L
ISA.54.1	You are like a woman who never gave birth to children.
ISA.54.1	Start singing and shout for joy.
ISA.54.1	You never felt the pain of giving birth,
ISA.54.1	but you will have more children
ISA.54.1	than the woman who has a husband.
ISA.54.2	Make your tent bigger;
ISA.54.2	stretch it out and make it wider.
ISA.54.2	Do not hold back.
ISA.54.2	Make the ropes longer
ISA.54.2	and its stakes stronger,
ISA.54.3	because you will spread out to the right and to the left.
ISA.54.3	Your children will take over other nations,
ISA.54.3	and they will again live in cities that once were destroyed.
ISA.54.4	“Don’t be afraid, because you will not be ashamed.
ISA.54.4	Don’t be embarrassed, because you will not be disgraced.
ISA.54.4	You will forget the shame you felt earlier;
ISA.54.4	you will not remember the shame you felt when you lost your husband.
ISA.54.5	The God who made you is like your husband.
ISA.54.5	His name is the L
ISA.54.5	The Holy One of Israel is the one who saves you.
ISA.54.5	He is called the God of all the earth.
ISA.54.6	You were like a woman whose husband left her,
ISA.54.6	and you were very sad.
ISA.54.6	You were like a wife who married young
ISA.54.6	and then her husband left her.
ISA.54.6	But the L
ISA.54.6	says your God.
ISA.54.7	God says, “I left you for a short time,
ISA.54.7	but with great kindness I will bring you back again.
ISA.54.8	I became very angry
ISA.54.8	and hid from you for a time,
ISA.54.8	but I will show you mercy with kindness forever,”
ISA.54.8	says the L
ISA.54.9	The L
ISA.54.9	I promised then that I would never flood the world again.
ISA.54.9	In the same way, I promise I will not be angry with you
ISA.54.9	or punish you again.
ISA.54.10	The mountains may disappear,
ISA.54.10	and the hills may come to an end,
ISA.54.10	but my love will never disappear;
ISA.54.10	my promise of peace will not come to an end,”
ISA.54.10	says the L
ISA.54.11	“You poor city. Storms have hurt you,
ISA.54.11	and you have not been comforted.
ISA.54.11	But I will rebuild you with turquoise stones,
ISA.54.11	and I will build your foundations with sapphires.
ISA.54.12	I will use rubies to build your walls
ISA.54.12	and shining jewels for the gates
ISA.54.12	and precious jewels for all your outer walls.
ISA.54.13	All your children will be taught by the L
ISA.54.13	and they will have much peace.
ISA.54.14	I will build you using fairness.
ISA.54.14	You will be safe from those who would hurt you,
ISA.54.14	so you will have nothing to fear.
ISA.54.14	Nothing will come to make you afraid.
ISA.54.15	I will not send anyone to attack you,
ISA.54.15	and you will defeat those who do attack you.
ISA.54.16	“See, I made the blacksmith.
ISA.54.16	He fans the fire to make it hotter,
ISA.54.16	and he makes the kind of tool he wants.
ISA.54.16	In the same way I have made the destroyer to destroy.
ISA.54.17	So no weapon that is used against you will defeat you.
ISA.54.17	You will show that those who speak against you are wrong.
ISA.54.17	These are the good things my servants receive.
ISA.54.17	Their victory comes from me,” says the L
ISA.55.1	The L
ISA.55.1	come and drink.
ISA.55.1	Those of you who do not have money,
ISA.55.1	come, buy and eat!
ISA.55.1	Come buy wine and milk
ISA.55.1	without money and without cost.
ISA.55.2	Why spend your money on something that is not real food?
ISA.55.2	Why work for something that doesn’t really satisfy you?
ISA.55.2	Listen closely to me, and you will eat what is good;
ISA.55.2	your soul will enjoy the rich food that satisfies.
ISA.55.3	Come to me and listen;
ISA.55.3	listen to me so you may live.
ISA.55.3	I will make an agreement with you that will last forever.
ISA.55.3	I will give you the blessings I promised to David.
ISA.55.4	I made David a witness of my power for all nations,
ISA.55.4	a ruler and commander of many nations.
ISA.55.5	You will call for nations that you don’t yet know.
ISA.55.5	And these nations that do not know you will run to you
ISA.55.5	because of the L
ISA.55.5	because of the Holy One of Israel who honors you.”
ISA.55.6	So you should look for the L
ISA.55.6	you should call to him while he is near.
ISA.55.7	The wicked should stop doing wrong,
ISA.55.7	and they should stop their evil thoughts.
ISA.55.7	They should return to the L
ISA.55.7	They should come to our God, because he will freely forgive them.
ISA.55.8	The L
ISA.55.8	Your ways are not like my ways.
ISA.55.9	Just as the heavens are higher than the earth,
ISA.55.9	so are my ways higher than your ways
ISA.55.9	and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.
ISA.55.10	Rain and snow fall from the sky
ISA.55.10	and don’t return without watering the ground.
ISA.55.10	They cause the plants to sprout and grow,
ISA.55.10	making seeds for the farmer
ISA.55.10	and bread for the people.
ISA.55.11	The same thing is true of the words I speak.
ISA.55.11	They will not return to me empty.
ISA.55.11	They make the things happen that I want to happen,
ISA.55.11	and they succeed in doing what I send them to do.
ISA.55.12	“So you will go out with joy
ISA.55.12	and be led out in peace.
ISA.55.12	The mountains and hills will burst into song before you,
ISA.55.12	and all the trees in the fields will clap their hands.
ISA.55.13	Large cypress trees will grow where thornbushes were.
ISA.55.13	Myrtle trees will grow where weeds were.
ISA.55.13	These things will be a reminder of the L
ISA.55.13	and this reminder will never be destroyed.”
ISA.56.1	This is what the L
ISA.56.1	“Give justice to all people,
ISA.56.1	and do what is right,
ISA.56.1	because my salvation will come to you soon.
ISA.56.1	Soon everyone will know that I do what is right.
ISA.56.2	The person who obeys the law about the Sabbath
ISA.56.2	will be blessed,
ISA.56.2	and the person who does no evil
ISA.56.2	will be blessed.”
ISA.56.3	Foreigners who have joined the L
ISA.56.3	“The L
ISA.56.3	The eunuch should not say,
ISA.56.3	“Because I cannot have children, the L
ISA.56.4	This is what the L
ISA.56.4	“The eunuchs should obey the law about the Sabbath
ISA.56.4	and do what I want
ISA.56.4	and keep my agreement.
ISA.56.5	If they do, I will make their names remembered
ISA.56.5	within my Temple and its walls.
ISA.56.5	It will be better for them than children.
ISA.56.5	I will give them a name that will last forever,
ISA.56.5	that will never be forgotten.
ISA.56.6	Foreigners will join the L
ISA.56.6	to worship him and love him,
ISA.56.6	to serve him,
ISA.56.6	to obey the law about the Sabbath,
ISA.56.6	and to keep my agreement.
ISA.56.7	I will bring these people to my holy mountain
ISA.56.7	and give them joy in my house of prayer.
ISA.56.7	The offerings and sacrifices
ISA.56.7	they place on my altar will please me,
ISA.56.7	because my Temple will be called
ISA.56.7	a house for prayer for people from all nations.”
ISA.56.8	The Lord 
ISA.56.8	he who gathers the Israelites that were forced to leave their country:
ISA.56.8	“I will bring together other people
ISA.56.8	to join those who are already gathered.”
ISA.56.9	All you animals of the field,
ISA.56.9	all you animals of the forest, come to eat.
ISA.56.10	The leaders who are to guard the people are blind;
ISA.56.10	they don’t know what they are doing.
ISA.56.10	All of them are like quiet dogs
ISA.56.10	that don’t know how to bark.
ISA.56.10	They lie down and dream
ISA.56.10	and love to sleep.
ISA.56.11	They are like hungry dogs
ISA.56.11	that are never satisfied.
ISA.56.11	They are like shepherds
ISA.56.11	who don’t know what they are doing.
ISA.56.11	They all have gone their own way;
ISA.56.11	all they want to do is satisfy themselves.
ISA.56.12	They say, “Come, let’s drink some wine;
ISA.56.12	let’s drink all the beer we want.
ISA.56.12	And tomorrow we will do this again,
ISA.56.12	or, maybe we will have an even better time.”
ISA.57.1	Those who are right with God may die,
ISA.57.1	but no one pays attention.
ISA.57.1	Good people are taken away,
ISA.57.1	but no one understands.
ISA.57.1	Those who do right are being taken away from evil
ISA.57.2	and are given peace.
ISA.57.2	Those who live as God wants
ISA.57.2	find rest in death.
ISA.57.3	“Come here, you magicians!
ISA.57.3	Come here, you children of prostitutes and those who take part in adultery!
ISA.57.4	Of whom are you making fun?
ISA.57.4	Whom are you insulting?
ISA.57.4	At whom do you stick out your tongue?
ISA.57.4	You turn against God,
ISA.57.4	and you are liars.
ISA.57.5	You have sexual relations under every green tree
ISA.57.5	to worship your gods.
ISA.57.5	You kill children in the ravines
ISA.57.5	and sacrifice them in the rocky places.
ISA.57.6	You take the smooth rocks from the ravines
ISA.57.6	as your portion.
ISA.57.6	You pour drink offerings on them to worship them,
ISA.57.6	and you give grain offerings to them.
ISA.57.6	Do you think this makes me want to show you mercy?
ISA.57.7	You make your bed on every hill and mountain,
ISA.57.7	and there you offer sacrifices.
ISA.57.8	You have hidden your idols
ISA.57.8	behind your doors and doorposts.
ISA.57.8	You have left me, and you have uncovered yourself.
ISA.57.8	You have pulled back the covers and climbed into bed.
ISA.57.8	You have made an agreement with those whose beds you love,
ISA.57.8	and you have looked at their nakedness.
ISA.57.9	You use your oils and perfumes
ISA.57.9	to look nice for Molech.
ISA.57.9	You have sent your messengers to faraway lands;
ISA.57.9	you even tried to send them to the place of the dead.
ISA.57.10	You were tired from doing these things,
ISA.57.10	but you never gave up.
ISA.57.10	You found new strength,
ISA.57.10	so you did not quit.
ISA.57.11	“Whom were you so afraid of
ISA.57.11	that you lied to me?
ISA.57.11	You have not remembered me
ISA.57.11	or even thought about me.
ISA.57.11	I have been quiet for a long time.
ISA.57.11	Is that why you are not afraid of me?
ISA.57.12	I will tell about your ‘goodness’ and what you do,
ISA.57.12	and those things will do you no good.
ISA.57.13	When you cry out for help,
ISA.57.13	let the gods you have gathered help you.
ISA.57.13	The wind will blow them all away;
ISA.57.13	just a puff of wind will take them away.
ISA.57.13	But the person who depends on me will receive the land
ISA.57.13	and own my holy mountain.”
ISA.57.14	Someone will say, “Build a road! Build a road! Prepare the way!
ISA.57.14	Make the way clear for my people.”
ISA.57.15	And this is the reason: God lives forever and is holy.
ISA.57.15	He is high and lifted up.
ISA.57.15	He says, “I live in a high and holy place,
ISA.57.15	but I also live with people who are sad and humble.
ISA.57.15	I give new life to those who are humble
ISA.57.15	and to those whose hearts are broken.
ISA.57.16	I will not accuse forever,
ISA.57.16	nor will I always be angry,
ISA.57.16	because then human life would grow weak.
ISA.57.16	Human beings, whom I created, would die.
ISA.57.17	I was angry because they were dishonest in order to make money.
ISA.57.17	I punished them and turned away from them in anger,
ISA.57.17	but they continued to do evil.
ISA.57.18	I have seen what they have done, but I will heal them.
ISA.57.18	I will guide them and comfort them and those who felt sad for them.
ISA.57.18	They will all praise me.
ISA.57.19	I will give peace, real peace, to those far and near,
ISA.57.19	and I will heal them,” says the L
ISA.57.20	But evil people are like the angry sea,
ISA.57.20	which cannot rest,
ISA.57.20	whose waves toss up waste and mud.
ISA.57.21	“There is no peace for evil people,” says my God.
ISA.58.1	The L
ISA.58.1	Shout out loud like a trumpet.
ISA.58.1	Tell my people what they have done against their God;
ISA.58.1	tell the family of Jacob about their sins.
ISA.58.2	They still come every day looking for me
ISA.58.2	and want to learn my ways.
ISA.58.2	They act just like a nation that does what is right,
ISA.58.2	that obeys the commands of its God.
ISA.58.2	They ask me to judge them fairly.
ISA.58.2	They want God to be near them.
ISA.58.3	They say, ‘To honor you we had special days when we fasted,
ISA.58.3	but you didn’t see.
ISA.58.3	We humbled ourselves to honor you,
ISA.58.3	but you didn’t notice.’ ”
ISA.58.3	But the L
ISA.58.3	and you are unfair to your workers.
ISA.58.4	On these special days when you fast, you argue and fight
ISA.58.4	and hit each other with your fists.
ISA.58.4	You cannot do these things as you do now
ISA.58.4	and believe your prayers are heard in heaven.
ISA.58.5	This kind of special day is not what I want.
ISA.58.5	This is not the way I want people to be sorry for what they have done.
ISA.58.5	I don’t want people just to bow their heads like a plant
ISA.58.5	and wear rough cloth and lie in ashes to show their sadness.
ISA.58.5	This is what you do on your special days when you fast,
ISA.58.5	but do you think this is what the L
ISA.58.6	“I will tell you the kind of fast I want:
ISA.58.6	Free the people you have put in prison unfairly
ISA.58.6	and undo their chains.
ISA.58.6	Free those to whom you are unfair
ISA.58.6	and stop their hard labor.
ISA.58.7	Share your food with the hungry
ISA.58.7	and bring poor, homeless people into your own homes.
ISA.58.7	When you see someone who has no clothes, give him yours,
ISA.58.7	and don’t refuse to help your own relatives.
ISA.58.8	Then your light will shine like the dawn,
ISA.58.8	and your wounds will quickly heal.
ISA.58.8	Your God will walk before you,
ISA.58.8	and the glory of the L
ISA.58.9	Then you will call out, and the L
ISA.58.9	You will cry out, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’
ISA.58.9	“If you stop making trouble for others,
ISA.58.9	if you stop using cruel words and pointing your finger at others,
ISA.58.10	if you feed those who are hungry
ISA.58.10	and take care of the needs of those who are troubled,
ISA.58.10	then your light will shine in the darkness,
ISA.58.10	and you will be bright like sunshine at noon.
ISA.58.11	The L
ISA.58.11	He will satisfy your needs in dry lands
ISA.58.11	and give strength to your bones.
ISA.58.11	You will be like a garden that has much water,
ISA.58.11	like a spring that never runs dry.
ISA.58.12	Your people will rebuild the old cities that are now in ruins;
ISA.58.12	you will rebuild their foundations.
ISA.58.12	You will be known for repairing the broken places
ISA.58.12	and for rebuilding the roads and houses.
ISA.58.13	“You must obey God’s law about the Sabbath
ISA.58.13	and not do what pleases yourselves on that holy day.
ISA.58.13	You should call the Sabbath a joyful day
ISA.58.13	and honor it as the L
ISA.58.13	You should honor it by not doing whatever you please
ISA.58.13	nor saying whatever you please on that day.
ISA.58.14	Then you will find joy in the L

ISA.58.14	I will let you eat the crops of the land your ancestor Jacob had.”
ISA.58.14	The L
ISA.59.1	Surely the L
ISA.59.1	He can hear you when you ask him for help.
ISA.59.2	It is your evil that has separated
ISA.59.2	you from your God.
ISA.59.2	Your sins cause him to turn away from you,
ISA.59.2	so he does not hear you.
ISA.59.3	With your hands you have killed others,
ISA.59.3	and with your fingers you have done wrong.
ISA.59.3	With your lips you have lied,
ISA.59.3	and with your tongue you say evil things.
ISA.59.4	People take each other to court unfairly,
ISA.59.4	and no one tells the truth in arguing his case.
ISA.59.4	They accuse each other falsely and tell lies.
ISA.59.4	They cause trouble and create more evil.
ISA.59.5	They hatch evil like eggs from poisonous snakes.
ISA.59.5	If you eat one of those eggs, you will die,
ISA.59.5	and if you break one open, a poisonous snake comes out.
ISA.59.5	People tell lies as they would spin a spider’s web.
ISA.59.6	The webs they make cannot be used for clothes;
ISA.59.6	you can’t cover yourself with those webs.
ISA.59.6	The things they do are evil,
ISA.59.6	and they use their hands to hurt others.
ISA.59.7	They eagerly run to do evil,
ISA.59.7	and they are always ready to kill innocent people.
ISA.59.7	They think evil thoughts.
ISA.59.7	Everywhere they go they cause ruin and destruction.
ISA.59.8	They don’t know how to live in peace,
ISA.59.8	and there is no fairness in their lives.
ISA.59.8	They are dishonest.
ISA.59.8	Anyone who lives as they live will never have peace.
ISA.59.9	Fairness has gone far away;
ISA.59.9	goodness is nowhere to be found.
ISA.59.9	We wait for the light, but there is only darkness now.
ISA.59.9	We hope for a bright light, but all we have is darkness.
ISA.59.10	We are like the blind feeling our way along a wall.
ISA.59.10	We feel our way as if we had no eyes.
ISA.59.10	In the brightness of day we trip as if it were night.
ISA.59.10	We are like dead men among the strong.
ISA.59.11	All of us growl like the bears.
ISA.59.11	We call out sadly like the doves.
ISA.59.11	We look for justice, but there isn’t any.
ISA.59.11	We want to be saved, but salvation is far away.
ISA.59.12	We have done many wrong things against our God;
ISA.59.12	our sins show we are wrong.
ISA.59.12	We know we have turned against God;
ISA.59.12	we know the evil things we have done:
ISA.59.13	sinning and rejecting the L
ISA.59.13	turning away from our God,
ISA.59.13	planning to hurt others and to disobey God,
ISA.59.13	planning and speaking lies.
ISA.59.14	So we have driven away justice,
ISA.59.14	and we have kept away from what is right.
ISA.59.14	Truth is not spoken in the streets;
ISA.59.14	what is honest is not allowed to enter the city.
ISA.59.15	Truth cannot be found anywhere,
ISA.59.15	and people who refuse to do evil are attacked.
ISA.59.15	The L
ISA.59.15	and he was displeased.
ISA.59.16	He could not find anyone to help the people,
ISA.59.16	and he was surprised that there was no one to help.
ISA.59.16	So he used his own power to save the people;
ISA.59.16	his own goodness gave him strength.
ISA.59.17	He covered himself with goodness like armor.
ISA.59.17	He put the helmet of salvation on his head.
ISA.59.17	He put on his clothes for punishing
ISA.59.17	and wrapped himself in the coat of his strong love.
ISA.59.18	The L
ISA.59.18	He will show his anger to those who were against him;
ISA.59.18	he will punish the people in faraway places as they deserve.
ISA.59.19	Then people from the west will fear the L
ISA.59.19	and people from the east will fear his glory.
ISA.59.19	The L
ISA.59.19	driven by the breath of the L

ISA.60.5	you will be excited and full of joy,
ISA.60.5	because the wealth of the nations across the seas will be given to you;

ISA.62.8	I will not let your enemies drink the new wine
ISA.62.8	that you have worked to make.
ISA.62.9	Those who gather food will eat it,

ISA.62.10	Go through, go through the gates!
ISA.62.10	Make the way ready for the people.
ISA.62.10	Build up, build up the road!
ISA.62.10	Move all the stones off the road.
ISA.62.10	Raise the banner as a sign for the people.
ISA.62.11	The L

ISA.62.12	His people will be called the Holy People,
ISA.62.12	the Saved People of the L

ISA.62.12	the City God Has Not Rejected.
ISA.63.1	Who is this coming from Edom,
ISA.63.1	from the city of Bozrah, dressed in red?
ISA.63.1	Who is this dressed in fine clothes
ISA.63.1	and marching forward with his great power?
ISA.63.1	He says, “I, the L
ISA.63.1	I have the power to save you.”
ISA.63.2	Someone asks, “Why are your clothes bright red
ISA.63.2	as if you had walked on the grapes to make wine?”
ISA.63.3	The L
ISA.63.3	and no one among the nations helped me.
ISA.63.3	I was angry and walked on the nations
ISA.63.3	and crushed them because of my anger.
ISA.63.3	Blood splashed on my clothes,
ISA.63.3	and I stained all my clothing.
ISA.63.4	I chose a time to punish people,
ISA.63.4	and the time has come for me to save.
ISA.63.5	I looked around, but I saw no one to help me.
ISA.63.5	I was surprised that no one supported me.
ISA.63.5	So I used my own power to save my people;
ISA.63.5	my own anger supported me.
ISA.63.6	While I was angry, I walked on the nations.
ISA.63.6	In my anger I punished them
ISA.63.6	and poured their blood on the ground.”
ISA.63.7	I will tell about the L
ISA.63.7	and praise him for everything he has done.
ISA.63.7	I will praise the L
ISA.63.7	and for his goodness to the people of Israel.
ISA.63.7	He has shown great mercy to us
ISA.63.7	and has been very kind to us.
ISA.63.8	He said, “These are my people;
ISA.63.8	my children will not lie to me.”
ISA.63.8	So he saved them.
ISA.63.9	When they suffered, he suffered also.
ISA.63.9	He sent his own angel to save them.
ISA.63.9	Because of his love and kindness, he saved them.
ISA.63.9	Since long ago he has picked them up and carried them.
ISA.63.10	But they turned against him
ISA.63.10	and made his Holy Spirit very sad.
ISA.63.10	So he became their enemy,
ISA.63.10	and he fought against them.
ISA.63.11	But then his people remembered what happened long ago,
ISA.63.11	in the days of Moses and the Israelites with him.
ISA.63.11	Where is the L
ISA.63.11	with the leaders of his people?
ISA.63.11	Where is the one
ISA.63.11	who put his Holy Spirit among them,
ISA.63.12	who led Moses by the right hand
ISA.63.12	with his wonderful power,
ISA.63.12	who divided the water before them
ISA.63.12	to make his name famous forever,
ISA.63.13	who led the people through the deep waters?
ISA.63.13	Like a horse walking through a desert,
ISA.63.13	the people did not stumble.
ISA.63.14	Like cattle that go down to the valley,
ISA.63.14	the Spirit of the L
ISA.63.14	L
ISA.63.14	and by this you won for yourself wonderful fame.
ISA.63.15	L
ISA.63.15	look at us from your wonderful and holy home in heaven.
ISA.63.15	Where is your strong love and power?
ISA.63.15	Why are you keeping your love and mercy from us?
ISA.63.16	You are our father.
ISA.63.16	Abraham doesn’t know we are his children,
ISA.63.16	and Israel doesn’t recognize us.
ISA.63.16	L
ISA.63.16	You are called “the one who has always saved us.”
ISA.63.17	L
ISA.63.17	Why do you make us stubborn so that we don’t honor you?
ISA.63.17	For our sake come back to us,
ISA.63.17	your servants, who belong to you.
ISA.63.18	Your people had your Temple for a while,
ISA.63.18	but now our enemies have walked on your holy place and crushed it.
ISA.63.19	We have become like people you never ruled over,
ISA.63.19	like those who have never worn your name.
ISA.64.1	Tear open the skies and come down to earth
ISA.64.1	so that the mountains will tremble before you.
ISA.64.2	Like a fire that burns twigs,
ISA.64.2	like a fire that makes water boil,
ISA.64.2	let your enemies know who you are.
ISA.64.2	Then all nations will shake with fear when they see you.
ISA.64.3	You have done amazing things we did not expect.
ISA.64.3	You came down, and the mountains trembled before you.
ISA.64.4	From long ago no one has ever heard of a God like you.
ISA.64.4	No one has ever seen a God besides you,
ISA.64.4	who helps the people who trust you.
ISA.64.5	You help those who enjoy doing good,
ISA.64.5	who remember how you want them to live.
ISA.64.5	But you were angry because we sinned.
ISA.64.5	For a long time we disobeyed,
ISA.64.5	so how can we be saved?
ISA.64.6	All of us are dirty with sin.
ISA.64.6	All the right things we have done are like filthy pieces of cloth.
ISA.64.6	All of us are like dead leaves,
ISA.64.6	and our sins, like the wind, have carried us away.
ISA.64.7	No one worships you
ISA.64.7	or even asks you to help us.
ISA.64.7	That is because you have turned away from us
ISA.64.7	and have let our sins destroy us.
ISA.64.8	But L
ISA.64.8	We are like clay, and you are the potter;
ISA.64.8	your hands made us all.
ISA.64.9	L
ISA.64.9	don’t remember our sins forever.
ISA.64.9	Please, look at us,
ISA.64.9	because we are your people.
ISA.64.10	Your holy cities are empty like the desert.
ISA.64.10	Jerusalem is like a desert;
ISA.64.10	it is destroyed.
ISA.64.11	Our ancestors worshiped you
ISA.64.11	in our holy and wonderful Temple,
ISA.64.11	but now it has been burned with fire,
ISA.64.11	and all our precious things have been destroyed.
ISA.64.12	When you see these things, will you hold yourself back from helping us, L
ISA.64.12	Will you be silent and punish us beyond what we can stand?
ISA.65.1	The L
ISA.65.1	I was found by those who were not asking me for help.
ISA.65.1	I said, ‘Here I am. Here I am,’
ISA.65.1	to a nation that was not praying to me.
ISA.65.2	All day long I stood ready to accept
ISA.65.2	people who turned against me,
ISA.65.2	but the way they continue to live is not good;
ISA.65.2	they do anything they want to do.
ISA.65.3	Right in front of me
ISA.65.3	they continue to do things that make me angry.
ISA.65.3	They offer sacrifices to their gods in their gardens,
ISA.65.3	and they burn incense on altars of brick.
ISA.65.4	They sit among the graves
ISA.65.4	and spend their nights waiting to get messages from the dead.
ISA.65.4	They eat the meat of pigs,
ISA.65.4	and their pots are full of soup made from meat that is wrong to eat.
ISA.65.5	But they tell others, ‘Stay away, and don’t come near me.
ISA.65.5	I am too holy for you.’
ISA.65.5	These people are like smoke in my nose.
ISA.65.5	Like a fire that burns all the time, they continue to make me angry.
ISA.65.6	“Look, it is written here before me.
ISA.65.6	I will not be quiet; instead, I will repay you in full.
ISA.65.6	I will punish you for what you have done.
ISA.65.7	I will punish you for your sins and your ancestors’ sins,”
ISA.65.7	says the L
ISA.65.7	“They burned incense to gods on the mountains
ISA.65.7	and shamed me on those hills.
ISA.65.7	So I will punish them as they should be punished
ISA.65.7	for what they did.”
ISA.65.8	This is what the L
ISA.65.8	“When there is juice left in the grapes,
ISA.65.8	people do not destroy them,
ISA.65.8	because they know there is good left in them.
ISA.65.8	So I will do the same thing to my servants—
ISA.65.8	I will not completely destroy them.
ISA.65.9	I will leave some of the children of Jacob,
ISA.65.9	and some of the people of Judah will receive my mountain.
ISA.65.9	I will choose the people who will live there;
ISA.65.9	my servants will live there.
ISA.65.10	Then the Plain of Sharon will be a field for flocks,
ISA.65.10	and the Valley of Achor will be a place for herds to rest.
ISA.65.10	They will be for the people who want to follow me.
ISA.65.11	“But as for you who left the L
ISA.65.11	who forgot about my holy mountain,
ISA.65.11	who worship the god Luck,
ISA.65.11	who hold religious feasts for the god Fate,
ISA.65.12	I decide your fate, and I will punish you with my sword.
ISA.65.12	You will all be killed,
ISA.65.12	because I called you, but you refused to answer.
ISA.65.12	I spoke to you, but you wouldn’t listen.
ISA.65.12	You did the things I said were evil
ISA.65.12	and chose to do things that displease me.”
ISA.65.13	So this is what the Lord 
ISA.65.13	“My servants will eat,
ISA.65.13	but you evil people will be hungry.
ISA.65.13	My servants will drink,
ISA.65.13	but you evil people will be thirsty.
ISA.65.13	My servants will be happy,
ISA.65.13	but you evil people will be shamed.
ISA.65.14	My servants will shout for joy
ISA.65.14	because of the goodness of their hearts,
ISA.65.14	but you evil people will cry,
ISA.65.14	because you will be sad.
ISA.65.14	You will cry loudly, because your spirits will be broken.
ISA.65.15	Your names will be like curses to my servants,
ISA.65.15	and the Lord 
ISA.65.15	But he will call his servants by another name.
ISA.65.16	People in the land who ask for blessings
ISA.65.16	will ask for them from the faithful God.
ISA.65.16	And people in the land who make a promise
ISA.65.16	will promise in the name of the faithful God,
ISA.65.16	because the troubles of the past will be forgotten.
ISA.65.16	I will make those troubles go away.
ISA.65.17	“Look, I will make new heavens and a new earth,
ISA.65.17	and people will not remember the past
ISA.65.17	or think about those things.
ISA.65.18	My people will be happy forever
ISA.65.18	because of the things I will make.
ISA.65.18	I will make a Jerusalem that is full of joy,
ISA.65.18	and I will make her people a delight.
ISA.65.19	Then I will rejoice over Jerusalem
ISA.65.19	and be delighted with my people.
ISA.65.19	There will never again be heard in that city
ISA.65.19	the sounds of crying and sadness.
ISA.65.20	There will never be a baby from that city
ISA.65.20	who lives only a few days.
ISA.65.20	And there will never be an older person
ISA.65.20	who doesn’t have a long life.
ISA.65.20	A person who lives a hundred years will be called young,
ISA.65.20	and a person who dies before he is a hundred will be thought of as a sinner.
ISA.65.21	In that city those who build houses will live there.
ISA.65.21	Those who plant vineyards will get to eat their grapes.
ISA.65.22	No more will one person build a house and someone else live there.
ISA.65.22	One person will not plant a garden and someone else eat its fruit.
ISA.65.22	My people will live a long time,
ISA.65.22	as trees live long.
ISA.65.22	My chosen people will live there
ISA.65.22	and enjoy the things they make.
ISA.65.23	They will never again work for nothing.
ISA.65.23	They will never again give birth to children who die young.
ISA.65.23	All my people will be blessed by the L
ISA.65.23	they and their children will be blessed.
ISA.65.24	I will provide for their needs before they ask,
ISA.65.24	and I will help them while they are still asking for help.
ISA.65.25	Wolves and lambs will eat together in peace.
ISA.65.25	Lions will eat hay like oxen,
ISA.65.25	and a snake on the ground will not hurt anyone.
ISA.65.25	They will not hurt or destroy each other
ISA.65.25	on all my holy mountain,”
ISA.65.25	says the L
ISA.66.1	This is what the L
ISA.66.1	“Heaven is my throne,
ISA.66.1	and the earth is my footstool.
ISA.66.1	So do you think you can build a house for me?
ISA.66.1	Do I need a place to rest?
ISA.66.2	My hand made all things.
ISA.66.2	All things are here because I made them,”
ISA.66.2	says the L
ISA.66.2	“These are the people I am pleased with:
ISA.66.2	those who are not proud or stubborn
ISA.66.2	and who fear my word.
ISA.66.3	But those people who kill bulls as a sacrifice to me

ISA.66.3	Those who kill sheep as a sacrifice
ISA.66.3	are like those who break the necks of dogs.
ISA.66.3	Those who give me grain offerings
ISA.66.3	are like those who offer me the blood of pigs.
ISA.66.3	Those who burn incense
ISA.66.3	are like those who worship idols.
ISA.66.3	These people choose their own ways, not mine,
ISA.66.3	and they love the terrible things they do.
ISA.66.4	So I will choose their punishments,
ISA.66.4	and I will punish them with what they fear most.
ISA.66.4	This is because I called to them, but they did not listen.
ISA.66.4	I spoke to them, but they did not hear me.
ISA.66.4	They did things I said were evil;
ISA.66.4	they chose to do things I did not like.”
ISA.66.5	You people who obey the words of the L
ISA.66.5	listen to what he says:
ISA.66.5	“Your brothers hated you
ISA.66.5	and turned against you because you followed me.
ISA.66.5	Your brothers said, ‘Let the L
ISA.66.5	so we may see you rejoice,’
ISA.66.5	but they will be punished.
ISA.66.6	Listen to the loud noise coming from the city;
ISA.66.6	hear the noise from the Temple.
ISA.66.6	It is the L
ISA.66.6	giving them the punishment they should have.
ISA.66.7	“A woman does not give birth before she feels the pain;
ISA.66.7	she does not give birth to a son before the pain starts.
ISA.66.8	No one has ever heard of that happening;
ISA.66.8	no one has ever seen that happen.
ISA.66.8	In the same way no one ever saw a country begin in one day;
ISA.66.8	no one has ever heard of a new nation beginning in one moment.
ISA.66.8	But Jerusalem will give birth to her children
ISA.66.8	just as soon as she feels the birth pains.
ISA.66.9	In the same way I will not cause pain
ISA.66.9	without allowing something new to be born,” says the L
ISA.66.9	“If I cause you the pain,
ISA.66.9	I will not stop you from giving birth to your new nation,” says your God.
ISA.66.10	“Jerusalem, rejoice.
ISA.66.10	All you people who love Jerusalem, be happy.
ISA.66.10	Those of you who felt sad for Jerusalem
ISA.66.10	should now feel happy with her.
ISA.66.11	You will take comfort from her and be satisfied,
ISA.66.11	as a child is nursed by its mother.
ISA.66.11	You will receive her good things
ISA.66.11	and enjoy her wealth.”
ISA.66.12	This is what the L
ISA.66.12	“I will give her peace that will flow to her like a river.
ISA.66.12	The wealth of the nations will come to her like a river overflowing its banks.
ISA.66.12	Like babies you will be nursed and held in my arms
ISA.66.12	and bounced on my knees.
ISA.66.13	I will comfort you
ISA.66.13	as a mother comforts her child.
ISA.66.13	You will be comforted in Jerusalem.”

ISA.66.14	but his enemies will see his anger.
ISA.66.15	Look, the L

ISA.66.15	He will punish those people with his anger;
ISA.66.15	he will punish them with flames of fire.
ISA.66.16	The L
ISA.66.16	and he will destroy many people with his sword;
ISA.66.16	he will kill many people. 
ISA.66.17	“These people make themselves holy and pure to go to worship their gods in their gardens. Following each other into their special gardens, they eat the meat of pigs and rats and other hateful things. But they will all be destroyed together,” says the L
ISA.66.18	“I know they have evil thoughts and do evil things, so I am coming to punish them. I will gather all nations and all people, and they will come together and see my glory.
ISA.66.19	“I will put a mark on some of the people, and I will send some of these saved people to the nations: to Tarshish, Libya, Lud (the land of archers), Tubal, Greece, and all the faraway lands. These people have never heard about what I have done nor seen my glory. So the saved people will tell the nations about my glory. 
ISA.66.20	And they will bring all your fellow Israelites from all nations to my holy mountain in Jerusalem. Your fellow Israelites will come on horses, donkeys, and camels and in chariots and wagons. They will be like the grain offerings that the people bring in clean containers to the Temple,” says the L

JER.2.20	you lay down as a prostitute.
JER.2.21	But I planted you as a special vine,
JER.2.21	as a very good seed.

JER.2.23	You are like a she-camel in mating season
JER.2.23	that runs from place to place.
JER.2.24	You are like a wild donkey that lives in the desert
JER.2.24	and sniffs the wind at mating time.
JER.2.24	At that time who can hold her back?
JER.2.24	Any male who chases her will easily catch her;
JER.2.24	at mating time, it is easy to find her.
JER.2.25	Don’t run until your feet are bare
JER.2.25	or until your throat is dry.

JER.2.25	I love those other gods,

JER.2.26	“A thief is ashamed when someone catches him stealing.
JER.2.26	In the same way, the family of Israel is ashamed—
JER.2.26	they, their kings, their officers,
JER.2.26	their priests, and their prophets.
JER.2.27	They say to things of wood, ‘You are my father,’
JER.2.27	and to idols of stone, ‘You gave birth to me.’
JER.2.27	Those people won’t look at me;
JER.2.27	they have turned their backs to me.

JER.2.31	or like a dark and dangerous land?

JER.2.32	A young woman does not forget her jewelry,
JER.2.32	and a bride does not forget the decorations for her dress.
JER.2.32	But my people have forgotten me
JER.2.32	for more days than can be counted.
JER.2.33	You really know how to chase after love.
JER.2.33	Even the worst women can learn evil ways from you.
JER.2.34	Even on your clothes you have the blood
JER.2.34	of poor and innocent people,

JER.2.34	You do all these things,

JER.2.35	God is not angry with me.’
JER.2.35	But I will judge you guilty of lying,
JER.2.35	because you say, ‘I have not sinned.’
JER.2.36	It is so easy for you to change your mind.
JER.2.36	Even Egypt will let you down,
JER.2.36	as Assyria let you down.
JER.2.37	You will eventually leave that place
JER.2.37	with your hands on your head, like captives.

JER.3.2	You made the land unclean,
JER.3.2	because you did evil and were like a prostitute.
JER.3.3	So the rain has not come,
JER.3.3	and there have not been any spring rains.
JER.3.3	But your face still looks like the face of a prostitute.
JER.3.3	You refuse even to be ashamed of what you did.
JER.3.4	Now you are calling to me,
JER.3.4	‘My father, you have been my friend since I was young.
JER.3.5	Will you always be angry at me?
JER.3.5	Will your anger last forever?’
JER.3.5	Judah, you said this,

JER.3.8	Judah saw that I divorced unfaithful Israel because of her adultery, but that didn’t make Israel’s wicked sister Judah afraid. She also went out and acted like a prostitute! 
JER.3.9	And she didn’t care that she was acting like a prostitute. So she made her country unclean and was guilty of adultery, because she worshiped idols made of stone and wood. 
JER.3.10	Israel’s wicked sister didn’t even come back to me with her whole heart, but only pretended,” says the Lord.

JER.4.23	I looked at the earth,
JER.4.23	and it was empty and had no shape.
JER.4.23	I looked at the sky,
JER.4.23	and its light was gone.
JER.4.24	I looked at the mountains,
JER.4.24	and they were shaking.
JER.4.24	All the hills were trembling.
JER.4.25	I looked, and there were no people.
JER.4.25	Every bird in the sky had flown away.
JER.4.26	I looked, and the good, rich land had become a desert.

JER.4.28	I have made a decision, and I will not change it.”
JER.4.29	At the sound of the horsemen and the archers,
JER.4.29	all the people in the towns run away.
JER.4.29	They hide in the thick bushes
JER.4.29	and climb up into the rocks.
JER.4.29	All of the cities of Judah are empty;
JER.4.29	no one lives in them.
JER.4.30	Judah, you destroyed nation, what are you doing?
JER.4.30	Why do you put on your finest dress
JER.4.30	and decorate yourself with gold jewelry?
JER.4.30	Why do you put color around your eyes?
JER.4.30	You make yourself beautiful, but it is all useless.
JER.4.30	Your lovers hate you;
JER.4.30	they want to kill you.
JER.4.31	I hear a cry like a woman having a baby,
JER.4.31	distress like a woman having her first child.
JER.4.31	It is the sound of Jerusalem gasping for breath.
JER.4.31	She lifts her hands in prayer and says,
JER.4.31	“Oh! I am about to faint
JER.4.31	before my murderers!”
JER.5.1	The L
JER.5.1	Look around and discover these things.
JER.5.1	Search the public squares of the city.
JER.5.1	If you can find one person who does honest things,
JER.5.1	who searches for the truth,
JER.5.1	I will forgive this city.
JER.5.2	Although the people say, ‘As surely as the L
JER.5.2	they don’t really mean it.”
JER.5.3	L
JER.5.3	You struck the people of Judah,
JER.5.3	but they didn’t feel any pain.
JER.5.3	You crushed them,
JER.5.3	but they refused to learn what is right.
JER.5.3	They became more stubborn than a rock;
JER.5.3	they refused to turn back to God.
JER.5.4	But I thought,
JER.5.4	“These are only the poor, foolish people.
JER.5.4	They have not learned the way of the L
JER.5.4	and what their God wants them to do.
JER.5.5	So I will go to the leaders of Judah
JER.5.5	and talk to them.
JER.5.5	Surely they understand the way of the L
JER.5.5	and know what God wants them to do.”
JER.5.5	But even the leaders had all joined together to break away from the L
JER.5.5	they had broken their ties with him.
JER.5.6	So a lion from the forest will attack them.
JER.5.6	A wolf from the desert will kill them.
JER.5.6	A leopard is waiting for them near their towns.
JER.5.6	It will tear to pieces anyone who comes out of the city,
JER.5.6	because the people of Judah have sinned greatly.
JER.5.6	They have wandered away from the L
JER.5.7	The L
JER.5.7	Your children have left me
JER.5.7	and have made promises to idols that are not gods at all.
JER.5.7	I gave your children everything they needed,
JER.5.7	but they still were like an unfaithful wife to me.
JER.5.7	They spent much time in houses of prostitutes.
JER.5.8	They are like well-fed horses filled with sexual desire;
JER.5.8	each one wants another man’s wife.
JER.5.9	Shouldn’t I punish the people of Judah for doing these things?” says the L
JER.5.9	“Shouldn’t I give a nation such as this the punishment it deserves?
JER.5.10	“Go along and cut down Judah’s vineyards,
JER.5.10	but do not completely destroy them.
JER.5.10	Cut off all her people as if they were branches,
JER.5.10	because they do not belong to the L
JER.5.11	The families of Israel and Judah
JER.5.11	have been completely unfaithful to me,” says the L
JER.5.12	Those people have lied about the L
JER.5.12	and said, “He will not do anything to us!
JER.5.12	Nothing bad will happen to us!
JER.5.12	We will never see war or hunger!
JER.5.13	The prophets are like an empty wind;
JER.5.13	the word of God is not in them.
JER.5.13	Let the bad things they say happen to them.”
JER.5.14	So this is what the L
JER.5.14	“The people said I would not punish them.
JER.5.14	So, the words I give you will be like fire,
JER.5.14	and these people will be like wood that it burns up.
JER.5.15	Listen, family of Israel,” says the L
JER.5.15	“I will soon bring a nation from far away to attack you.
JER.5.15	It is an old nation that has lasted a long time.
JER.5.15	The people there speak a language you do not know;
JER.5.15	you cannot understand what they say.
JER.5.16	Their arrows bring death.
JER.5.16	All their people are strong warriors.
JER.5.17	They will eat your crops and your food.
JER.5.17	They will eat your sons and daughters.
JER.5.17	They will eat your flocks and herds.
JER.5.17	They will eat your grapes and figs.
JER.5.17	They will destroy with their swords
JER.5.17	the strong, walled cities you trust.
JER.5.18	“Yet even then,” says the L
JER.5.19	When the people of Judah ask, ‘Why has the L
JER.5.20	“Announce this message to the family of Jacob,
JER.5.20	and tell it to the nation of Judah:
JER.5.21	Hear this message, you foolish people who have no sense.
JER.5.21	They have eyes, but they don’t really see.
JER.5.21	They have ears, but they don’t really listen.
JER.5.22	Surely you are afraid of me,” says the L
JER.5.22	“You should shake with fear in my presence.
JER.5.22	I am the one who made the beaches to be a border for the sea,
JER.5.22	a border the water can never go past.
JER.5.22	The waves may pound the beach, but they can’t win over it.
JER.5.22	They may roar, but they cannot go beyond it.
JER.5.23	But the people of Judah are stubborn and have turned against me.
JER.5.23	They have turned aside and gone away from me.
JER.5.24	They do not say to themselves,
JER.5.24	‘We should fear the L
JER.5.24	who gives us autumn and spring rains in their seasons,
JER.5.24	who makes sure we have the harvest at the right time.’
JER.5.25	But your evil has kept away both rain and harvest.
JER.5.25	Your sins have kept you from enjoying good things.
JER.5.26	There are wicked men among my people.
JER.5.26	Like those who make nets for catching birds,
JER.5.26	they set their traps to catch people.
JER.5.27	Like cages full of birds,
JER.5.27	their houses are full of lies.
JER.5.27	They have become rich and powerful.
JER.5.28	They have grown big and fat.
JER.5.28	There is no end to the evil things they do.
JER.5.28	They won’t plead the case of the orphan
JER.5.28	or help the poor be judged fairly.
JER.5.29	Shouldn’t I punish the people of Judah for doing these things?” says the L
JER.5.29	“Shouldn’t I give a nation such as this the punishment it deserves?
JER.5.30	“A terrible and shocking thing
JER.5.30	has happened in the land of Judah:
JER.5.31	The prophets speak lies,
JER.5.31	and the priests take power into their own hands,
JER.5.31	and my people love it this way.
JER.5.31	But what will you do when the end comes?
JER.6.1	“Run for your lives, people of Benjamin!
JER.6.1	Run away from Jerusalem!
JER.6.1	Blow the war trumpet in the town of Tekoa!
JER.6.1	Raise the warning flag over the town of Beth Hakkerem!
JER.6.1	Disaster is coming from the north;
JER.6.1	terrible destruction is coming to you.
JER.6.2	Jerusalem, I will destroy you,
JER.6.2	you who are fragile and gentle.
JER.6.3	Shepherds with their flocks will come against Jerusalem.
JER.6.3	They will set up their tents all around her,
JER.6.3	each shepherd taking care of his own section.”
JER.6.4	They say, “Get ready to fight against Jerusalem!
JER.6.4	Get up! We will attack at noon!
JER.6.4	But it is already getting late;
JER.6.4	the evening shadows are growing long.
JER.6.5	So get up! We will attack at night.
JER.6.5	We will destroy the strong towers of Jerusalem!”
JER.6.6	This is what the L
JER.6.6	“Cut down the trees around Jerusalem,
JER.6.6	and build an attack ramp to the top of its walls.
JER.6.6	This city must be punished.
JER.6.6	Inside it is nothing but slavery.
JER.6.7	Jerusalem pours out her evil
JER.6.7	as a well pours out its water.
JER.6.7	The sounds of violence and destruction are heard within her.
JER.6.7	I can see the sickness and hurts of Jerusalem.
JER.6.8	Listen to this warning, Jerusalem,
JER.6.8	or I will turn my back on you
JER.6.8	and make your land an empty desert
JER.6.8	where no one can live.”
JER.6.9	This is what the L
JER.6.9	“Gather the few people of Israel who are left alive,
JER.6.9	as you would gather the last grapes on a grapevine.
JER.6.9	Check each vine again,
JER.6.9	like someone who gathers grapes.”
JER.6.10	To whom can I speak? Whom can I warn?
JER.6.10	Who will listen to me?
JER.6.10	The people of Israel have closed ears,
JER.6.10	so they cannot hear my warnings.
JER.6.10	They don’t like the word of the L
JER.6.10	they don’t want to listen to it!
JER.6.11	But I am full of the anger of the L
JER.6.11	and I am tired of holding it in.
JER.6.11	“Pour out my anger on the children who play in the street
JER.6.11	and on the young men gathered together.
JER.6.11	A husband and his wife will both be caught in his anger,
JER.6.11	as will the very old.
JER.6.12	Their houses will be turned over to others,
JER.6.12	along with their fields and wives,
JER.6.12	because I will raise my hand
JER.6.12	and punish the people of Judah,” says the L
JER.6.13	“Everyone, from the least important to the greatest,
JER.6.13	is greedy for money.
JER.6.13	Even the prophets and priests
JER.6.13	all tell lies.
JER.6.14	They tried to heal my people’s serious injuries
JER.6.14	as if they were small wounds.
JER.6.14	They said, ‘It’s all right, it’s all right.’
JER.6.14	But really, it is not all right.
JER.6.15	They should be ashamed of the terrible way they act,
JER.6.15	but they are not ashamed at all.
JER.6.15	They don’t even know how to blush about their sins.
JER.6.15	So they will fall, along with everyone else.
JER.6.15	They will be thrown to the ground when I punish them,” says the L
JER.6.16	This is what the L
JER.6.16	“Stand where the roads cross and look.
JER.6.16	Ask where the old way is,
JER.6.16	where the good way is, and walk on it.
JER.6.16	If you do, you will find rest for yourselves.
JER.6.16	But they have said, ‘We will not walk on the good way.’
JER.6.17	I set watchmen over you
JER.6.17	and told you, ‘Listen for the sound of the war trumpet!’
JER.6.17	But they said, ‘We will not listen.’
JER.6.18	So listen, all you nations,
JER.6.18	and pay attention, you witnesses.
JER.6.18	Watch what I will do to the people of Judah.
JER.6.19	Hear this, people of the earth:
JER.6.19	I am going to bring disaster to the people of Judah
JER.6.19	because of the evil they plan.
JER.6.19	They have not listened to my messages
JER.6.19	and have rejected my teachings.
JER.6.20	Why do you bring me offerings of incense from the land of Sheba?
JER.6.20	Why do you bring me sweet-smelling cane from a faraway land?
JER.6.20	Your burnt offerings will not be accepted;
JER.6.20	your sacrifices do not please me.”
JER.6.21	So this is what the L
JER.6.21	“I will put problems in front of Judah.
JER.6.21	Fathers and sons will stumble over them together.
JER.6.21	Neighbors and friends will die.”
JER.6.22	This is what the L
JER.6.22	“Look, an army is coming
JER.6.22	from the land of the north;
JER.6.22	a great nation is coming
JER.6.22	from the far sides of the earth.
JER.6.23	The soldiers carry bows and spears.
JER.6.23	They are cruel and show no mercy.
JER.6.23	They sound like the roaring ocean
JER.6.23	when they ride their horses.
JER.6.23	That army is coming lined up for battle,
JER.6.23	ready to attack you, Jerusalem.”
JER.6.24	We have heard the news about that army
JER.6.24	and are helpless from fear.
JER.6.24	We are gripped by our pain,
JER.6.24	like a woman having a baby.
JER.6.25	Don’t go out into the fields
JER.6.25	or walk down the roads,
JER.6.25	because the enemy has swords.
JER.6.25	There is terror on every side.
JER.6.26	My people, put on rough cloth
JER.6.26	and roll in the ashes to show how sad you are.
JER.6.26	Cry loudly for those who are dead,
JER.6.26	as if your only son were dead,
JER.6.26	because the destroyer
JER.6.26	will soon come against us.
JER.6.27	“Jeremiah, I have made you like a worker who tests metal,
JER.6.27	and my people are like the ore.
JER.6.27	You must observe their ways
JER.6.27	and test them.
JER.6.28	All my people have turned against me and are stubborn.
JER.6.28	They go around telling lies about others.
JER.6.28	They are like bronze and iron
JER.6.28	that became covered with rust.
JER.6.28	They all act dishonestly.
JER.6.29	The fire is fanned to make it hotter,
JER.6.29	but the lead does not melt.
JER.6.29	The pure metal does not come out;
JER.6.29	the evil is not removed from my people.
JER.6.30	My people will be called rejected silver,
JER.6.30	because the L
JER.7.1	This is the word that the L
JER.7.2	“Stand at the gate of the Temple and preach this message there:
JER.7.2	“ ‘Hear the word of the L
JER.7.3	This is what the L
JER.7.4	Don’t trust the lies of people who say, “This is the Temple of the L
JER.7.5	You must change your lives and do what is right. Be fair to each other. 
JER.7.6	You must not be hard on strangers, orphans, and widows. Don’t kill innocent people in this place! Don’t follow other gods, or they will ruin your lives. 
JER.7.7	If you do these things, I will let you live in this land that I gave to your ancestors to keep forever.
JER.7.8	“ ‘But look, you are trusting lies, which is useless. 
JER.7.9	Will you steal and murder and be guilty of adultery? Will you falsely accuse other people? Will you burn incense to the god Baal and follow other gods you have not known? 
JER.7.10	If you do that, do you think you can come before me and stand in this place where I have chosen to be worshiped? Do you think you can say, “We are safe!” when you do all these hateful things? 
JER.7.11	This place where I have chosen to be worshiped is nothing more to you than a hideout for robbers. I have been watching you, says the L
JER.7.12	“ ‘You people of Judah, go now to the town of Shiloh, where I first made a place to be worshiped. See what I did to it because of the evil things the people of Israel had done. 
JER.7.13	You people of Judah have done all these evil things too, says the L
JER.7.14	So I will destroy the place where I have chosen to be worshiped in Jerusalem. You trust in that place, which I gave to you and your ancestors, but I will destroy it just as I destroyed Shiloh. 
JER.7.15	I will push you away from me just as I pushed away your relatives, the people of Israel!’
JER.7.16	“As for you, Jeremiah, don’t pray for these people. Don’t cry out for them or ask anything for them or beg me to help them, because I will not listen to you. 
JER.7.17	Don’t you see what they are doing in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
JER.7.18	The children gather wood, and the fathers use the wood to make a fire. The women make the dough for cakes of bread, and they offer them to the Queen Goddess. They pour out drink offerings to other gods to make me angry. 
JER.7.19	But I am not the one the people of Judah are really hurting, says the L
JER.7.20	“ ‘So this is what the Lord 
JER.7.21	“ ‘This is what the L
JER.7.22	When I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, I did not speak to them and give them commands only about burnt offerings and sacrifices. 
JER.7.23	I also gave them this command: Obey me, and I will be your God and you will be my people. Do all that I command so that good things will happen to you. 
JER.7.24	But your ancestors did not listen or pay attention to me. They were stubborn and did whatever their evil hearts wanted. They went backward, not forward. 
JER.7.25	Since the day your ancestors left Egypt, I have sent my servants, the prophets, again and again to you. 
JER.7.26	But your ancestors did not listen or pay attention to me. They were very stubborn and did more evil than their ancestors.’
JER.7.27	“Jeremiah, you will tell all these things to the people of Judah, but they will not listen to you. You will call to them, but they will not answer you. 
JER.7.28	So say to them, ‘This is the nation that has not obeyed the L
JER.7.29	“ ‘Cut off your hair and throw it away. Go up to the bare hilltop and cry out, because the L
JER.7.30	The people of Judah have done what I said was evil, says the L
JER.7.31	The people of Judah have built places of worship at Topheth in the Valley of Ben Hinnom. There they burned their own sons and daughters as sacrifices, something I never commanded. It never even entered my mind. 
JER.7.32	So, I warn you. The days are coming, says the L
JER.7.33	Then the bodies of the dead will become food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals. There will be no one left alive to chase them away. 
JER.7.34	I will end the happy sounds of the bride and bridegroom. There will be no happy sounds in the cities of Judah or in the streets of Jerusalem, because the land will become an empty desert!
JER.8.1	“ ‘The L
JER.8.2	The bones will be spread on the ground under the sun, moon, and stars that the people loved and served and went after and searched for and worshiped. No one will gather up the bones and bury them. So they will be like dung thrown on the ground. 
JER.8.3	I will force the people of Judah to leave their homes and their land. Those of this evil family who are not dead will wish they were, says the L
JER.8.4	“Say to the people of Judah: ‘This is what the L
JER.8.4	When people fall down, don’t they get up again?
JER.8.4	And when someone goes the wrong way, doesn’t he turn back?
JER.8.5	Why, then, have the people of Jerusalem gone the wrong way
JER.8.5	and not turned back?
JER.8.5	They believe their own lies
JER.8.5	and refuse to turn around and come back.
JER.8.6	I have listened to them very carefully,
JER.8.6	but they do not say what is right.
JER.8.6	They do not feel sorry about their wicked ways,
JER.8.6	saying, “What have I done?”
JER.8.6	Each person goes his own way,
JER.8.6	like a horse charging into a battle.
JER.8.7	Even the birds in the sky
JER.8.7	know the right times to do things.
JER.8.7	The storks, doves, swifts, and thrushes
JER.8.7	know when it is time to migrate.

JER.8.7	what the L

JER.8.8	because we have the teachings of the L
JER.8.8	But actually, those who explain the Scriptures
JER.8.8	have written lies with their pens.
JER.8.9	These wise teachers refused to listen to the word of the L
JER.8.9	so they are not really wise at all.
JER.8.9	They will be ashamed.
JER.8.9	They will be shocked and trapped.
JER.8.10	So I will give their wives to other men
JER.8.10	and their fields to new owners.
JER.8.10	Everyone, from the least important to the greatest,
JER.8.10	is greedy for money.
JER.8.10	Even the prophets and priests
JER.8.10	all tell lies.
JER.8.11	They tried to heal my people’s serious injuries
JER.8.11	as if they were small wounds.
JER.8.11	They said, “It’s all right, it’s all right.”
JER.8.11	But really, it is not all right.
JER.8.12	They should be ashamed of the terrible way they act,
JER.8.12	but they are not ashamed at all.
JER.8.12	They don’t even know how to blush about their sins.
JER.8.12	So they will fall, along with everyone else.
JER.8.12	They will be thrown to the ground when I punish them, says the L
JER.8.13	“ ‘I will take away their crops, says the L
JER.8.13	There will be no grapes on the vine
JER.8.13	and no figs on the fig tree.
JER.8.13	Even the leaves will dry up and die.
JER.8.13	I will take away what I gave them.’ ”
JER.8.14	“Why are we just sitting here?
JER.8.14	Let’s get together!
JER.8.14	We have sinned against the L
JER.8.14	so he has given us poisoned water to drink.
JER.8.14	Come, let’s run to the strong, walled cities.
JER.8.14	The L
JER.8.14	so let’s die there.
JER.8.15	We hoped to have peace,
JER.8.15	but nothing good has come.
JER.8.15	We hoped for a time when he would heal us,
JER.8.15	but only terror has come.
JER.8.16	From the land of Dan,
JER.8.16	the snorting of the enemy’s horses is heard.
JER.8.16	The ground shakes from the neighing of their large horses.
JER.8.16	They have come and destroyed
JER.8.16	the land and everything in it,
JER.8.16	the city and all who live there.”
JER.8.17	“Look! I am sending poisonous snakes to attack you.
JER.8.17	These snakes cannot be charmed,
JER.8.17	and they will bite you,” says the L
JER.8.18	God, you are my comfort when I am very sad
JER.8.18	and when I am afraid.
JER.8.19	Listen to the sound of my people.
JER.8.19	They cry from a faraway land:
JER.8.19	“Isn’t the L
JER.8.19	Isn’t Jerusalem’s king still there?”
JER.8.19	But God says, “Why did the people make me angry by worshiping idols,
JER.8.19	useless foreign idols?”
JER.8.20	And the people say, “Harvest time is over;
JER.8.20	summer has ended,
JER.8.20	and we have not been saved.”
JER.8.21	Because my people are crushed, I am crushed.
JER.8.21	I cry loudly and am afraid for them.
JER.8.22	Isn’t there balm in the land of Gilead?
JER.8.22	Isn’t there a doctor there?
JER.8.22	So why aren’t the hurts of my people healed?
JER.9.1	I wish my head were like a spring of water
JER.9.1	and my eyes like a fountain of tears!
JER.9.1	Then I could cry day and night
JER.9.1	for my people who have been killed.
JER.9.2	I wish I had a place in the desert—
JER.9.2	a house where travelers spend the night—
JER.9.2	so I could leave my people.
JER.9.2	I could go away from them,
JER.9.2	because they are all unfaithful to God;
JER.9.2	they are all turning against him.
JER.9.3	“They use their tongues like a bow,
JER.9.3	shooting lies from their mouths like arrows.
JER.9.3	Lies, not truth,
JER.9.3	have grown strong in the land.
JER.9.3	They go from one evil thing to another.
JER.9.3	They do not know who I am,” says the L
JER.9.4	“Watch out for your friends,
JER.9.4	and don’t trust your own relatives,
JER.9.4	because every relative is a cheater,
JER.9.4	and every friend tells lies about you.
JER.9.5	Everyone lies to his friend,
JER.9.5	and no one speaks the truth.
JER.9.5	The people of Judah have taught their tongues to lie.
JER.9.5	They have become tired from sinning.
JER.9.6	Jeremiah, you live in the middle of lies.
JER.9.6	With their lies the people refuse to know me,” says the L
JER.9.7	So this is what the L
JER.9.7	“I will test the people of Judah as a person tests metal in a fire.
JER.9.7	I have no other choice,
JER.9.7	because my people have sinned.
JER.9.8	Their tongues are like sharp arrows.
JER.9.8	Their mouths speak lies.
JER.9.8	Everyone speaks nicely to his neighbor,
JER.9.8	but he is secretly planning to attack him.
JER.9.9	Shouldn’t I punish the people for doing this?” says the L
JER.9.9	“Shouldn’t I give a nation like this the punishment it deserves?”
JER.9.10	I, Jeremiah, will cry loudly for the mountains
JER.9.10	and sing a funeral song for the empty fields.
JER.9.10	They are empty, and no one passes through.
JER.9.10	The mooing of cattle cannot be heard.
JER.9.10	The birds have flown away,
JER.9.10	and the animals are gone.
JER.9.11	“I, the L
JER.9.11	a home for wild dogs.
JER.9.11	I will destroy the cities of Judah
JER.9.11	so no one can live there.”
JER.9.12	What person is wise enough to understand these things? Is there someone who has been taught by the L
JER.9.13	The L
JER.9.14	Instead, they were stubborn and followed the Baals, as their ancestors taught them to do. 
JER.9.15	So this is what the L
JER.9.16	I will scatter them through other nations that they and their ancestors never knew about. I will chase the people of Judah with the sword until they are all killed.”
JER.9.17	This is what the L
JER.9.17	“Now, think about these things!
JER.9.17	Call for the women who cry at funerals to come.
JER.9.17	Send for those women who are good at that job.
JER.9.18	Let them come quickly
JER.9.18	and cry loudly for us.
JER.9.18	Then our eyes will fill with tears,
JER.9.18	and streams of water will flow from our eyelids.
JER.9.19	The sound of loud crying is heard from Jerusalem:
JER.9.19	‘We are truly ruined!
JER.9.19	We are truly ashamed!
JER.9.19	We must leave our land,
JER.9.19	because our houses are in ruins.’ ”
JER.9.20	Now, women of Judah, listen to the word of the 
JER.9.20	open your ears to hear the words of his mouth.
JER.9.20	Teach your daughters how to cry loudly.
JER.9.20	Teach one another a funeral song.
JER.9.21	Death has climbed in through our windows
JER.9.21	and has entered our strong cities.
JER.9.21	Death has taken away our children who play in the streets
JER.9.21	and the young men who meet in the city squares.
JER.9.22	Say, “This is what the L
JER.9.22	‘The dead bodies of people will lie
JER.9.22	in the open field like dung.
JER.9.22	They will lie like grain a farmer has cut,
JER.9.22	but there will be no one to gather them.’ ”
JER.9.23	This is what the L
JER.9.23	“The wise must not brag about their wisdom.
JER.9.23	The strong must not brag about their strength.
JER.9.23	The rich must not brag about their money.
JER.9.24	But if people want to brag, let them brag
JER.9.24	that they understand and know me.
JER.9.24	Let them brag that I am the L
JER.9.24	and that I am kind and fair,
JER.9.24	and that I do things that are right on earth.
JER.9.24	This kind of bragging pleases me,” says the L
JER.9.25	The L
JER.9.26	the people of Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and the desert people who cut their hair short. The men in all those countries are not circumcised. And the whole family of Israel does not give itself to serving me.”
JER.10.1	Family of Israel, listen to what the L
JER.10.2	This is what he says:
JER.10.2	“Don’t live like the people from other nations,
JER.10.2	and don’t be afraid of special signs in the sky,
JER.10.2	even though the other nations are afraid of them.
JER.10.3	The customs of other people are worth nothing.
JER.10.3	Their idols are just wood cut from the forest,
JER.10.3	shaped by a worker with his chisel.
JER.10.4	They decorate their idols with silver and gold.
JER.10.4	With hammers and nails they fasten them down
JER.10.4	so they won’t fall over.
JER.10.5	Their idols are like scarecrows in melon fields;
JER.10.5	they cannot talk.
JER.10.5	Since they cannot walk,
JER.10.5	they must be carried.
JER.10.5	Do not be afraid of those idols,
JER.10.5	because they can’t hurt you,
JER.10.5	and they can’t help you either.”
JER.10.6	L
JER.10.6	You are great,
JER.10.6	and your name is great and powerful.
JER.10.7	Everyone should respect you, King of the nations;
JER.10.7	you deserve respect.
JER.10.7	Of all the wise people among the nations
JER.10.7	and in all the kingdoms,
JER.10.7	none of them is as wise as you.
JER.10.8	Those wise people are stupid and foolish.
JER.10.8	Their teachings come from worthless wooden idols.
JER.10.9	Hammered silver is brought from Tarshish
JER.10.9	and gold from Uphaz,
JER.10.9	so the idols are made by craftsmen and goldsmiths.
JER.10.9	They put blue and purple clothes on the idols.
JER.10.9	All these things are made by skilled workers.
JER.10.10	But the L
JER.10.10	He is the only living God, the King forever.
JER.10.10	The earth shakes when he is angry,
JER.10.10	and the nations cannot stand up to his anger.
JER.10.11	“Tell them this message: ‘These gods did not make heaven and earth; they will be destroyed and disappear from heaven and earth.’ ”
JER.10.12	God made the earth by his power.
JER.10.12	He used his wisdom to build the world
JER.10.12	and his understanding to stretch out the skies.
JER.10.13	When he thunders, the waters in the skies roar.
JER.10.13	He makes clouds rise in the sky all over the earth.
JER.10.13	He sends lightning with the rain
JER.10.13	and brings out the wind from his storehouses.
JER.10.14	People are so stupid and know so little.
JER.10.14	Goldsmiths are made ashamed by their idols,
JER.10.14	because those statues are only false gods.
JER.10.14	They have no breath in them.
JER.10.15	They are worth nothing; people make fun of them.
JER.10.15	When they are judged, they will be destroyed.
JER.10.16	But God, who is Jacob’s Portion, is not like the idols.
JER.10.16	He made everything,
JER.10.16	and he chose Israel to be his special people.
JER.10.16	The L
JER.10.17	Get everything you own and prepare to leave,
JER.10.17	you people who are trapped by your enemies.
JER.10.18	This is what the L
JER.10.18	“At this time I will throw out the people who live in this land.
JER.10.18	I will bring trouble to them
JER.10.18	so that they may be captured.”
JER.10.19	How terrible it will be for me because of my injury.
JER.10.19	My wound cannot be healed.
JER.10.19	Yet I told myself,
JER.10.19	“This is my sickness; I must suffer through it.”
JER.10.20	My tent is ruined,
JER.10.20	and all its ropes are broken.
JER.10.20	My children have gone away and left me.
JER.10.20	No one is left to put up my tent again
JER.10.20	or to set up a shelter for me.
JER.10.21	The shepherds are stupid
JER.10.21	and don’t ask the L
JER.10.21	So they do not have success,
JER.10.21	and all their flocks are scattered and lost.
JER.10.22	Listen! The news is coming.
JER.10.22	A loud noise comes from the north
JER.10.22	to make the towns of Judah an empty desert
JER.10.22	and a home for wild dogs!
JER.10.23	L
JER.10.23	We can’t control our own lives.
JER.10.24	L
JER.10.24	Don’t punish me in your anger,
JER.10.24	or you will destroy me.
JER.10.25	Pour out your anger on other nations
JER.10.25	that do not know you
JER.10.25	and do not pray to you.
JER.10.25	Those nations have destroyed the people of Jacob.
JER.10.25	They have eaten them up completely
JER.10.25	and destroyed their homeland.
JER.11.1	These are the words that the L
JER.11.2	“Listen to the words of this agreement and tell them to the people of Judah and those living in Jerusalem. 
JER.11.3	Tell them this is what the L
JER.11.4	that I made with your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt. Egypt was like a furnace for melting iron!’ I told them, ‘Obey me and do everything I command you. Then you will be my people, and I will be your God. 
JER.11.5	Then I will keep the promise I made to your ancestors to give them a fertile land.’ And you are living in that country today.”
JER.11.5	I answered, “Amen, L
JER.11.6	The L
JER.11.7	I warned your ancestors to obey me when I brought them out of Egypt. I have warned them again and again to this very day: “Obey me!” 
JER.11.8	But your ancestors did not listen to me. They were stubborn and did what their own evil hearts wanted. So I made all the curses of this agreement come upon them. I commanded them to obey the agreement, but they did not.’ ”
JER.11.9	Then the L
JER.11.10	They have gone back to the same sins their ancestors did. Their ancestors refused to listen to my message and followed and worshiped other gods instead. The families of Israel and Judah have broken the agreement I made with their ancestors. 
JER.11.11	So this is what the L
JER.11.12	The people living in the towns of Judah and the city of Jerusalem will pray to their idols to whom they burn incense. But those idols will not be able to help when disaster comes. 
JER.11.13	Look, people of Judah, you have as many idols as there are towns in Judah. You have built as many altars to burn incense to that shameful god Baal as there are streets in Jerusalem.’
JER.11.14	“As for you, Jeremiah, don’t pray for these people or cry out for them or ask anything for them. I will not listen when they call to me in the time of their trouble.
JER.11.15	“What is my beloved Judah doing in my Temple
JER.11.15	when she makes many evil plans?
JER.11.15	Do you think animal sacrifices will stop your punishment?
JER.11.15	When you do your evil, then you are happy.”
JER.11.16	The L
JER.11.16	with beautiful fruit and shape.”
JER.11.16	But with the roar of a strong storm
JER.11.16	he will set that tree on fire,
JER.11.16	and its branches will be burned up.
JER.11.17	The L
JER.11.18	The L
JER.11.19	Before this, I was like a gentle lamb waiting to be butchered. I did not know they had made plans against me, saying:
JER.11.19	“Let us destroy the tree and its fruit.
JER.11.19	Let’s kill him so people will forget him.”
JER.11.20	But, L
JER.11.20	You know how to test peoples’ hearts and minds.
JER.11.20	I have told you what I have against them.
JER.11.20	So let me see you give them the punishment they deserve.
JER.11.21	So the L
JER.11.22	So this is what the L
JER.11.23	No one from the city of Anathoth will be left alive, because I will cause a disaster to happen to them that year.”
JER.12.1	L
JER.12.1	you are always right.
JER.12.1	But I want to ask you about the justice you give.
JER.12.1	Why are evil people successful?
JER.12.1	Why do dishonest people have such easy lives?
JER.12.2	You have put the evil people here
JER.12.2	like plants with strong roots.
JER.12.2	They grow and produce fruit.
JER.12.2	With their mouths they speak well of you,
JER.12.2	but their hearts are really far away from you.
JER.12.3	But you know my heart, L
JER.12.3	You see me and test my thoughts about you.
JER.12.3	Drag the evil people away like sheep to be butchered.
JER.12.3	Set them aside for the day of killing.
JER.12.4	How much longer will the land stay dried up
JER.12.4	and the grass in every field be dead?
JER.12.4	The animals and birds in the land have died,
JER.12.4	because the people are evil.
JER.12.4	Yes, they are even saying,
JER.12.4	“God does not see what happens to us.”
JER.12.5	“If you get tired while racing against people,
JER.12.5	how can you race against horses?
JER.12.5	If you stumble in a country that is safe,
JER.12.5	what will you do in the thick thornbushes along the Jordan River?
JER.12.6	Even your own brothers and members of your own family
JER.12.6	are making plans against you.
JER.12.6	They are crying out against you.
JER.12.6	Don’t trust them,
JER.12.6	even when they say nice things to you!
JER.12.7	“I have left Israel;
JER.12.7	I have left my people.
JER.12.7	I have given the people I love
JER.12.7	over to their enemies.
JER.12.8	My people have become to me
JER.12.8	like a lion in the forest.
JER.12.8	They roar at me,
JER.12.8	so I hate them.
JER.12.9	My people have become to me
JER.12.9	like a speckled bird attacked on all sides by hawks.
JER.12.9	Go, gather the wild animals.
JER.12.9	Bring them to get something to eat.
JER.12.10	Many shepherds have ruined my vineyards
JER.12.10	and trampled the plants in my field.
JER.12.10	They have turned my beautiful field
JER.12.10	into an empty desert.
JER.12.11	They have turned my field into a desert
JER.12.11	that is wilted and dead.
JER.12.11	The whole country is an empty desert,
JER.12.11	because no one who lives there cares.
JER.12.12	Many soldiers have marched over those barren hills.
JER.12.12	The L
JER.12.12	from one end to the other.
JER.12.12	No one is safe.
JER.12.13	The people have planted wheat,
JER.12.13	but they have harvested only thorns.
JER.12.13	They have worked hard until they were very tired,
JER.12.13	but they have nothing for all their work.
JER.12.13	They are ashamed of their poor harvest,
JER.12.13	because the 
JER.12.14	This is what the L
JER.12.15	But after I pull them up, I will feel sorry for them again. I will bring each person back to his own property and to his own land. 
JER.12.16	I want them to learn their lessons well. In the past they taught my people to swear by Baal’s name. But if they will now learn to swear by my name, saying, ‘As surely as the L
JER.12.17	But if a nation will not listen to my message, I will pull it up completely and destroy it,” says the L
JER.13.1	This is what the L
JER.13.2	So I bought a linen belt, just as the L
JER.13.3	Then the L
JER.13.4	“Take the belt you bought and are wearing, and go to Perath. Hide the belt there in a crack in the rocks.” 
JER.13.5	So I went to Perath and hid the belt there, just as the L
JER.13.6	Many days later the L
JER.13.7	So I went to Perath and dug up the belt and took it from where I had hidden it. But now it was ruined; it was good for nothing.
JER.13.8	Then the L
JER.13.9	This is what the L
JER.13.10	These evil people refuse to listen to my warnings. They stubbornly do only what they want to do, and they follow other gods to serve and worship them. So they will become like this linen belt—good for nothing. 
JER.13.11	As a belt is wrapped tightly around a person’s waist, I wrapped the families of Israel and Judah around me,” says the L
JER.13.12	“Say to them: ‘This is what the L

JER.13.16	and before you slip and fall
JER.13.16	on the dark hills.
JER.13.16	You hope for light,

JER.13.16	he will change it into deep gloom.
JER.13.17	If you don’t listen to him,
JER.13.17	I will cry secretly
JER.13.17	because of your pride.
JER.13.17	I will cry painfully,
JER.13.17	and my eyes will overflow with tears,
JER.13.17	because the

JER.13.18	“Come down from your thrones,
JER.13.18	because your beautiful crowns
JER.13.18	have fallen from your heads.”
JER.13.19	The cities of southern Judah are locked up,
JER.13.19	and no one can open them.
JER.13.19	All Judah will be taken as captives to a foreign land;
JER.13.19	they will be carried away completely.
JER.13.20	Jerusalem, look up and see
JER.13.20	the people coming from the north.
JER.13.20	Where is the flock God gave you to care for,
JER.13.20	the flock you bragged about?
JER.13.21	What will you say when they appoint as your heads
JER.13.21	those you had thought were your friends?
JER.13.21	Won’t you have much pain and trouble,
JER.13.21	like a woman giving birth to a baby?
JER.13.22	You might ask yourself,
JER.13.22	“Why has this happened to me?”
JER.13.22	It happened because of your many sins.
JER.13.22	Because of your sins, your skirt was torn off
JER.13.22	and your body has been treated badly.
JER.13.23	Can a person from Cush change the color of his skin?
JER.13.23	Can a leopard change his spots?
JER.13.23	In the same way, Jerusalem, you cannot change and do good,
JER.13.23	because you are accustomed to doing evil.
JER.13.24	“I will scatter you like chaff that is blown away by the desert wind.
JER.13.25	This is what will happen to you;
JER.13.25	this is your part in my plans,” says the L
JER.13.25	“Because you forgot me
JER.13.25	and trusted in false gods,
JER.13.26	I will pull your skirts up over your face
JER.13.26	so everyone will see your shame.
JER.13.27	I have seen the terrible things you have done:
JER.13.27	your acts of adultery and your snorting,
JER.13.27	your prostitution,
JER.13.27	your hateful acts
JER.13.27	on the hills and in the fields.
JER.13.27	How terrible it will be for you, Jerusalem.
JER.13.27	How long will you continue being unclean?”
JER.14.1	These are the words that the L
JER.14.2	“The nation of Judah cries as if someone has died,
JER.14.2	and her cities are very sad.
JER.14.2	They are distressed over the land.
JER.14.2	A cry goes up to God from Jerusalem.
JER.14.3	The important men send their servants to get water.
JER.14.3	They go to the wells,
JER.14.3	but they find no water.
JER.14.3	So they return with empty jars.
JER.14.3	They are ashamed and embarrassed
JER.14.3	and cover their heads in shame.
JER.14.4	The ground is dry and cracked open,
JER.14.4	because no rain falls on the land.
JER.14.4	The farmers are upset and sad,
JER.14.4	so they cover their heads in shame.
JER.14.5	Even the mother deer in the field
JER.14.5	leaves her newborn fawn to die,
JER.14.5	because there is no grass.
JER.14.6	Wild donkeys stand on the bare hills
JER.14.6	and sniff the wind like wild dogs.
JER.14.6	But their eyes go blind,
JER.14.6	because there is no food.”
JER.14.7	We know that we suffer because of our sins.
JER.14.7	L
JER.14.7	We have left you many times;
JER.14.7	we have sinned against you.
JER.14.8	God, the Hope of Israel,
JER.14.8	you have saved Israel in times of trouble.
JER.14.8	Why are you like a stranger in the land,
JER.14.8	or like a traveler who only stays one night?
JER.14.9	Why are you like someone who has been attacked by surprise,
JER.14.9	like a warrior who is not able to save anyone?
JER.14.9	But you are among us, L
JER.14.9	and we are called by your name
JER.14.9	so don’t leave us without help!
JER.14.10	This is what the L
JER.14.10	“They really love to wander from me;
JER.14.10	they don’t stop themselves from leaving me.
JER.14.10	So now the L
JER.14.10	He will now remember the evil they do
JER.14.10	and will punish them for their sins.”
JER.14.11	Then the L
JER.14.12	Even if they fast, I will not listen to their prayers. Even if they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings to me, I will not accept them. Instead, I will destroy the people of Judah with war, hunger, and terrible diseases.”
JER.14.13	But I said, “Oh, Lord 
JER.14.14	Then the L
JER.14.15	So this is what I say about the prophets who are prophesying in my name. I did not send them. They say, ‘No enemy will attack this country with swords. There will never be hunger in this land.’ So those prophets will die from hunger and from an enemy’s sword. 
JER.14.16	And the people to whom the prophets speak will be thrown into the streets of Jerusalem. There they will die from hunger and from an enemy’s sword. And no one will be there to bury them, or their wives, or their sons, or their daughters. I will punish them.
JER.14.17	“Jeremiah, speak this message to the people of Judah:
JER.14.17	‘Let my eyes be filled with tears
JER.14.17	night and day, without stopping.
JER.14.17	My people have received a terrible blow;
JER.14.17	they have been hurt badly.

JER.14.18	I see people killed by swords.
JER.14.18	If I go into the city,
JER.14.18	I see much sickness, because the people have no food.
JER.14.18	Both the priests and the prophets
JER.14.18	have been taken to a foreign land.’ ”
JER.14.19	L
JER.14.19	Do you hate Jerusalem?
JER.14.19	Why have you hurt us so badly
JER.14.19	that we cannot be made well again?
JER.14.19	We hoped for peace,
JER.14.19	but nothing good has come.
JER.14.19	We looked for a time of healing,
JER.14.19	but only terror came.
JER.14.20	L
JER.14.20	and that our ancestors did evil things.
JER.14.20	We have sinned against you.
JER.14.21	For your sake, do not hate us.
JER.14.21	Do not take away the honor from your glorious throne.
JER.14.21	Remember your agreement with us,
JER.14.21	and do not break it.
JER.14.22	Do foreign idols have the power to bring rain?
JER.14.22	Does the sky itself have the power to send down showers?
JER.14.22	No, it is you, L
JER.14.22	You are our only hope,
JER.14.22	because you are the one who made all these things.
JER.15.1	Then the L
JER.15.2	When they ask you, ‘Where will we go?’ tell them: ‘This is what the L
JER.15.2	Those who are meant to die
JER.15.2	will die.
JER.15.2	Those who are meant to die in war
JER.15.2	will die in war.
JER.15.2	Those who are meant to die from hunger
JER.15.2	will die from hunger.
JER.15.2	Those who are meant to be taken captive
JER.15.2	will be taken captive.’
JER.15.3	“I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,” says the L
JER.15.4	I will make the people of Judah hated by everyone on earth because of what Manasseh did in Jerusalem. (Manasseh son of Hezekiah was king of the nation of Judah.)
JER.15.5	“Who will feel sorry for you, Jerusalem?
JER.15.5	Who will be sad and cry for you?
JER.15.5	Who will go out of his way to ask how you are?
JER.15.6	Jerusalem, you have left me,” says the L
JER.15.6	“You keep going farther and farther away,
JER.15.6	so I have taken hold of you and destroyed you.
JER.15.6	I was tired of holding back my anger.
JER.15.7	I have separated the people of Judah with my pitchfork
JER.15.7	and scattered them at the city gates of the land.
JER.15.7	My people haven’t changed their ways.
JER.15.7	So I have destroyed them
JER.15.7	and taken away their children.
JER.15.8	There are more widows than grains of sand in the sea.
JER.15.8	I brought a destroyer at noontime
JER.15.8	against the mothers of the young men of Judah.
JER.15.8	I suddenly brought pain and fear
JER.15.8	on the people of Judah.
JER.15.9	When the enemy attacked, a woman with seven sons felt faint because they would all die.
JER.15.9	She became weak and unable to breathe.
JER.15.9	Her bright day became dark from sadness.
JER.15.9	She felt shame and disgrace.
JER.15.9	And everyone else left alive in Judah
JER.15.9	I will hand over to the enemies, too!” says the L
JER.15.10	Mother, I am sorry that you gave birth to me
JER.15.10	since I must accuse and criticize the whole land.
JER.15.10	I have not loaned or borrowed anything,

JER.15.12	that comes from the north.
JER.15.13	Your wealth and treasures
JER.15.13	I will give to others free of charge,

JER.15.13	throughout the country.
JER.15.14	I will make you slaves to your enemies

JER.15.15	Punish for me those who are hurting me.
JER.15.15	Don’t destroy me while you remain patient with them.
JER.15.15	Think about the shame I suffer for you.
JER.15.16	Your words came to me, and I listened carefully to them.
JER.15.16	Your words made me very happy,
JER.15.16	because I am called by your name,

JER.15.17	I never sat with the crowd

JER.15.19	Then you may serve me.
JER.15.19	And if you speak things that have worth,
JER.15.19	not useless words,
JER.15.19	then you may speak for me.
JER.15.19	Let the people of Judah turn to you,
JER.15.19	but you must not change and be like them.
JER.15.20	I will make you as strong as a wall to this people,
JER.15.20	as strong as a wall of bronze.
JER.15.20	They will fight against you,
JER.15.20	but they will not defeat you,
JER.15.20	because I am with you.
JER.15.20	I will rescue you and save you,” says the L
JER.15.21	“I will save you from these wicked people
JER.15.21	and rescue you from these cruel people.”
JER.16.1	Then the L
JER.16.2	“You must not get married or have sons or daughters in this place.”
JER.16.3	The L
JER.16.4	“They will die of terrible diseases, and no one will cry for them or bury them. Their bodies will lie on the ground like dung. They will die in war, or they will starve to death. Their bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and for the wild animals.”
JER.16.5	So this is what the L
JER.16.6	“Important people and common people will die in the land of Judah. No one will bury them or cry for them or cut himself or shave his head to show sorrow for them. 
JER.16.7	No one will bring food to comfort those who are crying for the dead. No one will offer a drink to comfort someone whose mother or father has died.
JER.16.8	“Do not go into a house where the people are having a feast to sit down to eat and drink, 
JER.16.9	because this is what the L
JER.16.10	“When you tell the people of Judah these things, they will ask you, ‘Why has the L
JER.16.11	“Then say to them: ‘This is because your ancestors quit following me,’ says the L
JER.16.12	But you have done even more evil than your ancestors. You are very stubborn and do only what you want to do; you have not obeyed me. 
JER.16.13	So I will throw you out of this country and send you into a land that you and your ancestors never knew. There you can serve other gods day and night, because I will not help you or show you any favors.’
JER.16.14	“People say, ‘As surely as the L
JER.16.15	They will say instead, ‘As surely as the L
JER.16.16	“I will soon send for many fishermen to come to this land,” says the L
JER.16.17	I see everything they do. They cannot hide from me the things they do; their sin is not hidden from my eyes. 
JER.16.18	I will pay back the people of Judah twice for every one of their sins, because they have made my land unclean. They have filled my country with their hateful idols.”
JER.16.19	L
JER.16.19	my safe place in times of trouble.
JER.16.19	The nations will come to you from all over the world
JER.16.19	and say, “Our ancestors had only false gods,
JER.16.19	useless idols that didn’t help them.
JER.16.20	Can people make gods for themselves?
JER.16.20	They will not really be gods!”
JER.16.21	The L
JER.16.21	This time I will teach them
JER.16.21	about my power and my strength.
JER.16.21	Then they will know
JER.16.21	that my name is the L
JER.17.1	“The sin of the people of Judah is written with an iron tool.
JER.17.1	Their sins were cut with a hard point into the stone that is their hearts.
JER.17.1	Their sins were cut into the corners of their altars.
JER.17.2	Even their children remember
JER.17.2	their altars to idols and their Asherah idols
JER.17.2	beside the green trees
JER.17.2	and on the high hills.
JER.17.3	My mountain in the open country
JER.17.3	and your wealth and treasures
JER.17.3	I will give away to other people.
JER.17.3	I will give away the places of worship in your country,
JER.17.3	because you sinned by worshiping there.
JER.17.4	You will lose the land I gave you,
JER.17.4	and it is your own fault.
JER.17.4	I will let your enemies take you as their slaves
JER.17.4	to a land you have never known.
JER.17.4	This is because you have made my anger burn like a hot fire,
JER.17.4	and it will burn forever.”
JER.17.5	This is what the L
JER.17.5	“A curse is placed on those who trust other people,
JER.17.5	who depend on humans for strength,
JER.17.5	who have stopped trusting the L
JER.17.6	They are like a bush in a desert
JER.17.6	that grows in a land where no one lives,
JER.17.6	a hot and dry land with bad soil.
JER.17.6	They don’t know about the good things God can give.
JER.17.7	“But the person who trusts in the L
JER.17.7	The L
JER.17.8	He will be strong, like a tree planted near water
JER.17.8	that sends its roots by a stream.
JER.17.8	It is not afraid when the days are hot;
JER.17.8	its leaves are always green.
JER.17.8	It does not worry in a year when no rain comes;
JER.17.8	it always produces fruit.
JER.17.9	“More than anything else, a person’s mind is evil
JER.17.9	and cannot be healed.
JER.17.9	Who can understand it?
JER.17.10	But I, the L
JER.17.10	and test the mind.
JER.17.10	So I can decide what each one deserves;
JER.17.10	I can give each one the right payment for what he does.”
JER.17.11	Like a bird hatching an egg it did not lay,
JER.17.11	so are the people who get rich by cheating.
JER.17.11	When their lives are half finished, they will lose their riches.
JER.17.11	At the end of their lives, it will be clear they were fools.
JER.17.12	From the beginning, our Temple has been honored
JER.17.12	as a glorious throne for God.
JER.17.13	L
JER.17.13	those who leave you will be shamed.
JER.17.13	People who quit following the L
JER.17.13	because they have left the L
JER.17.14	L
JER.17.14	Save me, and I will truly be saved.
JER.17.14	You are the one I praise.
JER.17.15	The people of Judah keep asking me,
JER.17.15	“Where is the word from the L
JER.17.15	Let’s see that message come true!”
JER.17.16	L
JER.17.16	I didn’t want the terrible day to come.
JER.17.16	You know everything I have said;
JER.17.16	you see all that is happening.
JER.17.17	Don’t be a terror to me.
JER.17.17	I run to you for safety in times of trouble.
JER.17.18	Make those who are hurting me be ashamed,
JER.17.18	but don’t bring shame to me.
JER.17.18	Let them be terrified,
JER.17.18	but keep me from terror.
JER.17.18	Bring the day of disaster on my enemies.
JER.17.18	Destroy them, and destroy them again.
JER.17.19	This is what the L
JER.17.20	Say to them there: ‘Hear the word of the L
JER.17.21	This is what the L
JER.17.22	Don’t take a load out of your houses on the Sabbath or do any work on that day. But keep the Sabbath as a holy day, as I commanded your ancestors. 
JER.17.23	But your ancestors did not listen or pay attention to me. They were very stubborn and did not listen. I punished them, but it didn’t do any good. 
JER.17.24	But you must be careful to obey me, says the L
JER.17.25	“ ‘If you obey this command, kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of Jerusalem with their officers. They will come riding in chariots and on horses, along with the people of Judah and Jerusalem. And the city of Jerusalem will have people living in it forever. 
JER.17.26	People will come to Jerusalem from the villages around it, from the towns of Judah, from the land of Benjamin, from the western hills, from the mountains, and from southern Judah. They will all bring to the Temple of the L
JER.17.27	But you must obey me and keep the Sabbath day as a holy day. You must not carry any loads into Jerusalem on the Sabbath. If you don’t obey me, I will start a fire at the gates of Jerusalem, and it will burn until it burns even the strong towers. And it will not be put out.’ ”
JER.18.1	This is the word the L
JER.18.2	“Go down to the potter’s house, and I will give you my message there.” 
JER.18.3	So I went down to the potter’s house and saw him working at the potter’s wheel. 
JER.18.4	He was using his hands to make a pot from clay, but something went wrong with it. So he used that clay to make another pot the way he wanted it to be.
JER.18.5	Then the L
JER.18.6	“Family of Israel, can’t I do the same thing with you?” says the L
JER.18.7	There may come a time when I will speak about a nation or a kingdom that I will pull up by its roots or that I will pull down to destroy it. 
JER.18.8	But if the people of that nation stop doing the evil they have done, I will change my mind and not carry out my plans to bring disaster to them. 
JER.18.9	There may come another time when I will speak about a nation that I will build up and plant. 
JER.18.10	But if I see it doing evil by not obeying me, I will change my mind and not carry out my plans to do good for them.
JER.18.11	“So, say this to the people of Judah and those who live in Jerusalem: ‘This is what the L
JER.18.12	But the people of Judah will answer, ‘It won’t do any good to try! We will continue to do what we want. Each of us will do what his stubborn, evil heart wants!’ ”
JER.18.13	So this is what the L
JER.18.13	“Ask the people in other nations this question:
JER.18.13	‘Have you ever heard anything like this?’
JER.18.13	The people of Israel have done a horrible thing.
JER.18.14	The snow on the mountains of Lebanon
JER.18.14	never melts from the rocks.
JER.18.14	Its cool, flowing streams
JER.18.14	do not dry up.
JER.18.15	But my people have forgotten me.
JER.18.15	They burn incense to worthless idols
JER.18.15	and have stumbled in what they do
JER.18.15	and in the old ways of their ancestors.
JER.18.15	They walk along back roads
JER.18.15	and on poor highways.
JER.18.16	So Judah’s country will become an empty desert.
JER.18.16	People will not stop making fun of it.
JER.18.16	They will shake their heads as they pass by;
JER.18.16	they will be shocked at how the country was destroyed.
JER.18.17	Like a strong east wind,
JER.18.17	I will scatter them before their enemies.
JER.18.17	At that awful time they will not see me coming to help them;
JER.18.17	they will see me leaving.”
JER.18.18	Then the people said, “Come, let’s make plans against Jeremiah. Surely the teaching of the law by the priest will not be lost. We will still have the advice from the wise teachers and the words of the prophets. So let’s ruin him by telling lies about him. We won’t pay attention to anything he says.”
JER.18.19	L
JER.18.19	Listen to what my accusers are saying!
JER.18.20	Good should not be paid back with evil,
JER.18.20	but they have dug a pit in order to kill me.
JER.18.20	Remember that I stood before you
JER.18.20	and asked you to do good things for these people
JER.18.20	and to turn your anger away from them.
JER.18.21	So now, let their children starve,
JER.18.21	and let their enemies kill them with swords.
JER.18.21	Let their wives lose their children and husbands.
JER.18.21	Let the men from Judah be put to death
JER.18.21	and the young men be killed with swords in battle.
JER.18.22	Let them cry out in their houses
JER.18.22	when you bring an enemy against them suddenly.
JER.18.22	Let all this happen, because my enemies have dug
JER.18.22	a pit to capture me and have hidden traps for my feet.
JER.18.23	L
JER.18.23	about all their plans to kill me.
JER.18.23	Don’t forgive their crimes
JER.18.23	or erase their sins from your mind.
JER.18.23	Make them fall from their places;
JER.18.23	punish them while you are angry.
JER.19.1	This is what the L
JER.19.2	Take some of the elders of the people and the priests, and go out to the Valley of Ben Hinnom, near the front of the Potsherd Gate. There speak the words I tell you. 
JER.19.3	Say, ‘Kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem, listen to this message from the L
JER.19.4	The people of Judah have quit following me. They have made this a place for foreign gods. They have burned sacrifices to other gods that neither they, nor their ancestors, nor the kings of Judah had ever known before. They filled this place with the blood of innocent people. 
JER.19.5	They have built places on hilltops to worship Baal, where they burn their children in the fire to Baal. That is something I did not command or speak about; it never even entered my mind. 
JER.19.6	Now people call this place the Valley of Ben Hinnom or Topheth, but the days are coming, says the L
JER.19.7	“ ‘At this place I will ruin the plans of the people of Judah and Jerusalem. The enemy will chase them, and I will have them killed with swords. I will make their dead bodies food for the birds and wild animals. 
JER.19.8	I will completely destroy this city. People will make fun of it and shake their heads when they pass by. They will be shocked when they see how the city was destroyed. 
JER.19.9	An enemy army will surround the city and will not let anyone go out to get food. I will make the people so hungry that they will eat the bodies of their own sons and daughters, and then they will begin to eat each other.’
JER.19.10	“While the people with you are watching, break that jar. 
JER.19.11	Then say this: ‘The L
JER.19.12	This is what I will do to these people and to this place, says the L
JER.19.13	The houses in Jerusalem and the king’s palaces will become as unclean as this place, Topheth, because the people worshiped gods on the roofs of their houses. They worshiped the stars and burned incense to honor them and gave drink offerings to gods.’ ”
JER.19.14	When Jeremiah left Topheth where the L
JER.19.15	“This is what the L
JER.20.1	Pashhur son of Immer was a priest and the highest officer in the Temple of the L
JER.20.2	he had Jeremiah the prophet beaten. And he locked Jeremiah’s hands and feet between large blocks of wood at the Upper Gate of Benjamin of the 
JER.20.3	The next day when Pashhur took Jeremiah out of the blocks of wood, Jeremiah said to him, “The 
JER.20.4	This is what the L
JER.20.5	I will give all the wealth of this city to its enemies—its goods, its valuables, and the treasures of the kings of Judah. The enemies will carry all those valuables off to Babylon. 
JER.20.6	And Pashhur, you and everyone in your house will be taken captive. You will be forced to go to Babylon, where you will die and be buried, you and your friends to whom you have prophesied lies.’ ”
JER.20.7	L
JER.20.7	You are stronger than I am, so you won.
JER.20.7	I have become a joke;
JER.20.7	everyone makes fun of me all day long.
JER.20.8	Every time I speak, I shout.
JER.20.8	I am always shouting about violence and destruction.
JER.20.8	I tell the people about the message I received from the L
JER.20.8	but this only brings me insults.
JER.20.8	The people make fun of me all day long.
JER.20.9	Sometimes I say to myself,
JER.20.9	“I will forget about the L
JER.20.9	I will not speak anymore in his name.”
JER.20.9	But then his message becomes like a burning fire inside me,
JER.20.9	deep within my bones.
JER.20.9	I get tired of trying to hold it inside of me,
JER.20.9	and finally, I cannot hold it in.
JER.20.10	I hear many people whispering about me:
JER.20.10	“Terror on every side!
JER.20.10	Tell on him! Let’s tell the rulers about him.”
JER.20.10	My friends are all just waiting for me to make some mistake.
JER.20.10	They are saying,
JER.20.10	“Maybe we can trick him
JER.20.10	so we can defeat him
JER.20.10	and pay him back.”
JER.20.11	But the L
JER.20.11	so those who are chasing me will trip and fall;
JER.20.11	they will not defeat me.
JER.20.11	They will be ashamed because they have failed,
JER.20.11	and their shame will never be forgotten.
JER.20.12	L
JER.20.12	you look deeply into the heart and mind of a person.
JER.20.12	I have told you my arguments against these people,
JER.20.12	so let me see you give them the punishment they deserve.
JER.20.13	Sing to the L
JER.20.13	Praise the L
JER.20.13	He saves the life of the poor
JER.20.13	from the power of the wicked.
JER.20.14	Let there be a curse on the day I was born;
JER.20.14	let there be no blessing on the day when my mother gave birth to me.
JER.20.15	Let there be a curse on the man
JER.20.15	who brought my father the news:
JER.20.15	“You have a son!”
JER.20.15	This made my father very glad.
JER.20.16	Let that man be like the towns
JER.20.16	the L
JER.20.16	Let him hear loud crying in the morning
JER.20.16	and battle cries at noon,
JER.20.17	because he did not kill me before I was born.
JER.20.17	Then my mother would have been my grave;
JER.20.17	she would have stayed pregnant forever.
JER.20.18	Why did I have to come out of my mother’s body?
JER.20.18	All I have known is trouble and sorrow,
JER.20.18	and my life will end in shame.
JER.21.1	This is the word that the L
JER.21.2	They said, “Ask the L
JER.21.3	But Jeremiah answered them, “Tell King Zedekiah this: 
JER.21.4	‘Here is what the L
JER.21.5	In my anger, my very great anger, I myself will fight against you with my great power and strength. 
JER.21.6	I will kill everything living in Jerusalem—both people and animals. They will die from terrible diseases. 
JER.21.7	Then, says the L
JER.21.8	“Also tell this to the people of Jerusalem: ‘This is what the L
JER.21.9	Anyone who stays in Jerusalem will die in war or from hunger or from a terrible disease. But anyone who goes out of Jerusalem and surrenders to the Babylonians who are attacking you will live. Anyone who leaves the city will save his life as if it were a prize won in war. 
JER.21.10	I have decided to make trouble for this city and not to help it, says the L
JER.21.11	“Say to Judah’s royal family: ‘Hear the word of the L
JER.21.12	Family of David, this is what the L
JER.21.12	You must judge people fairly every morning.
JER.21.12	Save the person who has been robbed
JER.21.12	from the power of his attacker.
JER.21.12	If you don’t, I will become very angry.
JER.21.12	My anger will be like a fire that no one can put out,
JER.21.12	because you have done evil things.
JER.21.13	“ ‘Jerusalem, I am against you,
JER.21.13	you who live on top of the mountain
JER.21.13	over this valley, says the L
JER.21.13	You say, “No one can attack us
JER.21.13	or come into our strong city.”
JER.21.14	But I will give you the punishment you deserve, says the L
JER.21.14	I will start a fire in your forests
JER.21.14	that will burn up everything around you!’ ”
JER.22.1	This is what the L
JER.22.2	‘Hear the word of the L
JER.22.3	This is what the L
JER.22.4	If you carefully obey these commands, kings who sit on David’s throne will come through the gates of this palace with their officers and people, riding in chariots and on horses. 
JER.22.5	But if you don’t obey these commands, says the L
JER.22.6	This is what the L
JER.22.6	“You are tall like the forests of Gilead,
JER.22.6	like the mountaintops of Lebanon.
JER.22.6	But I will truly make you into a desert,
JER.22.6	into towns where no one lives.
JER.22.7	I will send men to destroy the palace,
JER.22.7	each with his weapons.
JER.22.7	They will cut up your strong, beautiful cedar beams
JER.22.7	and throw them into the fire.
JER.22.8	“People from many nations will pass by this city and ask each other, ‘Why has the L

JER.22.10	Don’t cry for the dead king or be sad about him.
JER.22.10	But cry painfully for the king who is being taken away,
JER.22.10	because he will never return
JER.22.10	or see his homeland again.
JER.22.11	This is what the L
JER.22.12	He will die where he has been taken captive, and he will not see this land again.”
JER.22.13	“How terrible it will be for one who builds his palace by doing evil,
JER.22.13	who cheats people so he can build its upper rooms.
JER.22.13	He makes his own people work for nothing
JER.22.13	and does not pay them.
JER.22.14	He says, ‘I will build a great palace for myself
JER.22.14	with large upper rooms.’
JER.22.14	So he builds it with large windows
JER.22.14	and uses cedar wood for the walls,
JER.22.14	which he paints red.
JER.22.15	“Does having a lot of cedar in your house
JER.22.15	make you a great king?
JER.22.15	Your father was satisfied to have food and drink.
JER.22.15	He did what was right and fair,
JER.22.15	so everything went well for him.
JER.22.16	He helped those who were poor and needy,
JER.22.16	so everything went well for him.
JER.22.16	That is what it means to know God,”
JER.22.16	says the L
JER.22.17	“But you only look for and think about
JER.22.17	what you can get dishonestly.
JER.22.17	You are even willing to kill innocent people to get it.
JER.22.17	You feel free to hurt people and to steal from them.”
JER.22.18	So this is what the L
JER.22.18	“The people of Judah will not cry when Jehoiakim dies,
JER.22.18	saying: ‘Oh, my brother,’ or ‘Oh, my sister.’
JER.22.18	They will not cry for him, saying:
JER.22.18	‘Oh, master,’ or ‘Oh, my king.’
JER.22.19	They will bury him like a donkey,
JER.22.19	dragging his body away
JER.22.19	and throwing it outside the gates of Jerusalem.
JER.22.20	“Judah, go up to Lebanon and cry out.
JER.22.20	Let your voice be heard in Bashan.
JER.22.20	Cry out from Abarim,
JER.22.20	because all your friends are destroyed!
JER.22.21	Judah, when you were successful, I warned you,
JER.22.21	but you said, ‘I won’t listen.’
JER.22.21	You have acted like this since you were young;
JER.22.21	you have not obeyed me.
JER.22.22	Like a storm, my punishment will blow all your shepherds away
JER.22.22	and send your friends into captivity.
JER.22.22	Then you will really be ashamed and disgraced
JER.22.22	because of all the wicked things you did.
JER.22.23	King, you live in your palace,
JER.22.23	cozy in your rooms of cedar.
JER.22.23	But when your punishment comes, how you will groan
JER.22.23	like a woman giving birth to a baby!
JER.22.24	“As surely as I live,” says the L
JER.22.25	I will hand you over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and to the Babylonians—those people you fear because they want to kill you. 
JER.22.26	I will throw you and your mother into another country. Neither of you was born there, but both of you will die there. 
JER.22.27	They will want to come back, but they will never be able to return.”
JER.22.28	Jehoiachin is like a broken pot someone threw away;
JER.22.28	he is like something no one wants.
JER.22.28	Why will Jehoiachin and his children be thrown out
JER.22.28	and sent into a foreign land?
JER.22.29	Land, land, land of Judah,
JER.22.29	hear the word of the L
JER.22.30	This is what the L
JER.22.30	“Write this down in the record about Jehoiachin:
JER.22.30	He is a man without children,
JER.22.30	a man who will not be successful in his lifetime.
JER.22.30	And none of his descendants will be successful;
JER.22.30	none will sit on the throne of David
JER.22.30	or rule in Judah.”
JER.23.1	“How terrible it will be for the leaders of Judah, who are scattering and destroying my people,” says the L
JER.23.2	They are responsible for the people, so the L
JER.23.3	“I sent my people to other countries, but I will gather those who are left alive and bring them back to their own country. Then they will have many children and grow in number. 
JER.23.4	I will place new leaders over my people, who will take care of them. And my people will not be afraid or terrified again, and none of them will be lost,” says the L
JER.23.5	“The days are coming,” says the L

JER.23.8	But people will say something new: ‘As surely as the L
JER.23.9	A message to the prophets:
JER.23.9	My heart is broken.
JER.23.9	All my bones shake.
JER.23.9	I’m like someone who is drunk,
JER.23.9	like someone who has been overcome with wine.
JER.23.9	This is because of the L
JER.23.9	and his holy words.
JER.23.10	The land of Judah is full of people who are guilty of adultery.
JER.23.10	Because of this, the L
JER.23.10	It has become a very sad place,
JER.23.10	and the pastures have dried up.
JER.23.10	The people are evil
JER.23.10	and use their power in the wrong way.
JER.23.11	“Both the prophets and the priests live as if there were no God.
JER.23.11	I have found them doing evil things even in my own Temple,” says the L
JER.23.12	“So they will be in danger.
JER.23.12	They will be forced into darkness
JER.23.12	where they will be defeated.
JER.23.12	I will bring disaster on them
JER.23.12	in the year I punish them,” says the L
JER.23.13	“I saw the prophets of Samaria
JER.23.13	do something wrong.
JER.23.13	Those prophets prophesied by Baal
JER.23.13	and led my people Israel away.
JER.23.14	And I have seen the prophets of Jerusalem
JER.23.14	do terrible things.
JER.23.14	They are guilty of adultery
JER.23.14	and live by lies.
JER.23.14	They encourage evil people to keep on doing evil,
JER.23.14	so the people don’t stop sinning.
JER.23.14	All of those people are like the city of Sodom.
JER.23.14	The people of Jerusalem are like the city of Gomorrah to me!”
JER.23.15	So this is what the L
JER.23.15	“I will make those prophets eat bitter food
JER.23.15	and drink poisoned water,
JER.23.15	because the prophets of Jerusalem spread wickedness
JER.23.15	through the whole country.”
JER.23.16	This is what the L
JER.23.16	“Don’t pay attention to what those prophets are saying to you.
JER.23.16	They are trying to fool you.
JER.23.16	They talk about visions their own minds made up,
JER.23.16	not about visions from me.
JER.23.17	They say to those who hate me:
JER.23.17	‘The L
JER.23.17	They say to all those who are stubborn and do as they please:
JER.23.17	‘Nothing bad will happen to you.’
JER.23.18	But none of these prophets has stood in the meeting of angels
JER.23.18	to see or hear the message of the L
JER.23.18	None of them has paid close attention to his message.
JER.23.19	Look, the punishment from the L
JER.23.19	will come like a storm.
JER.23.19	His anger will be like a hurricane.
JER.23.19	It will come swirling down on the heads of those wicked people.
JER.23.20	The 
JER.23.20	until he finishes what he plans to do.
JER.23.20	When that day is over,
JER.23.20	you will understand this clearly.
JER.23.21	I did not send those prophets,
JER.23.21	but they ran to tell their message.
JER.23.21	I did not speak to them,
JER.23.21	but they prophesied anyway.
JER.23.22	But if they had stood in the meeting of angels,
JER.23.22	they would have told my message to my people.
JER.23.22	They would have turned the people from their evil ways
JER.23.22	and from doing evil.
JER.23.23	“I am a God who is near,” says the L
JER.23.23	“I am also a God who is far away.”
JER.23.24	“No one can hide
JER.23.24	where I cannot see him,” says the L
JER.23.24	“I fill all of heaven and earth,” says the L
JER.23.25	“I have heard the prophets who prophesy lies in my name. They say, ‘I have had a dream! I have had a dream!’ 
JER.23.26	How long will this continue in the minds of these lying prophets? They prophesy from their own wishful thinking. 
JER.23.27	They are trying to make the people of Judah forget me by telling each other these dreams. In the same way, their ancestors forgot me and worshiped Baal. 
JER.23.28	Is straw the same thing as wheat?” says the L
JER.23.29	Isn’t my message like a fire?” says the L
JER.23.30	“So I am against the false prophets,” says the L
JER.23.31	I am against the false prophets,” says the L
JER.23.32	I am against the prophets who prophesy false dreams,” says the L
JER.23.33	“Suppose the people of Judah, a prophet, or a priest asks you: ‘Jeremiah, what is the message from the L
JER.23.34	A prophet or a priest or one of the people might say, ‘This is a message from the L
JER.23.35	This is what you will say to each other: ‘What did the L
JER.23.36	But you will never again say, ‘The message of the L
JER.23.37	This is how you should speak to the prophets: ‘What answer did the L
JER.23.38	But don’t say, ‘The message from the L
JER.23.39	I will pick you up and throw you away from me, along with Jerusalem, which I gave to your ancestors and to you. 
JER.23.40	And I will make a disgrace of you forever; your shame will never be forgotten.”
JER.24.1	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon captured Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim and king of Judah, his officers, and all the craftsmen and metalworkers of Judah. He took them away from Jerusalem and brought them to Babylon. It was then that the L
JER.24.2	One of the baskets had very good figs in it, like figs that ripen early in the season. But the other basket had figs too rotten to eat.
JER.24.3	The L
JER.24.3	I answered, “I see figs. The good figs are very good, but the rotten figs are too rotten to eat.”
JER.24.4	Then the L
JER.24.5	“This is what the L
JER.24.6	I will look after them and bring them back to the land of Judah. I will not tear them down, but I will build them up. I will not pull them up, but I will plant them so they can grow. 
JER.24.7	I will make them want to know me, that I am the L
JER.24.8	“ ‘But the bad figs are too rotten to eat.’ So this is what the L
JER.24.9	I will make those people hated as an evil people by all the kingdoms of the earth. People will make fun of them and tell jokes about them and point fingers at them and curse them everywhere I scatter them. 
JER.24.10	I will send war, hunger, and disease against them. I will attack them until they have all been killed. Then they will no longer be in the land I gave to them and their ancestors.’ ”
JER.25.1	This is the message that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah. It came in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah and the first year Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylon. 
JER.25.2	This is the message Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah and Jerusalem:
JER.25.3	The L
JER.25.4	The L
JER.25.5	Those prophets have said, “Stop your evil ways. Stop doing what is wrong so you can stay in the land that the L
JER.25.6	Don’t follow other gods to serve them or to worship them. Don’t make me, the L
JER.25.7	“But you people of Judah did not listen to me,” says the L
JER.25.8	So this is what the L
JER.25.9	I will send for all the peoples of the north,” says the L
JER.25.10	I will bring an end to the sounds of joy and happiness, the sounds of brides and bridegrooms, and the sound of people grinding meal. And I will take away the light of the lamp. 
JER.25.11	That whole area will be an empty desert, and these nations will be slaves of the king of Babylon for seventy years.
JER.25.12	“But when the seventy years have passed, I will punish the king of Babylon and his entire nation for their evil,” says the L
JER.25.13	I will make happen all the terrible things I said about Babylonia—everything Jeremiah prophesied about all those foreign nations, the warnings written in this book. 
JER.25.14	Even the Babylonians will have to serve many nations and many great kings. I will give them the punishment they deserve for all their own hands have done.”
JER.25.15	The L
JER.25.16	They will drink my anger and stumble about and act like madmen because of the war I am going to send among them.”
JER.25.17	So I took the cup from the 
JER.25.18	I served this wine to the people of Jerusalem and the towns of Judah, and the kings and officers of Judah, so they would become a ruin. Then people would be shocked and would insult them and speak evil of them. And so it has been to this day. 
JER.25.19	I also made these people drink of the 
JER.25.20	and all the foreigners there; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the Philistines (the kings of the cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and the people left at Ashdod); 
JER.25.21	the people of Edom, Moab, and Ammon; 
JER.25.22	all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; all the kings of the coastal countries to the west; 
JER.25.23	the people of Dedan and Tema and Buz; all who cut their hair short; 
JER.25.24	all the kings of Arabia; and the kings of the people who live in the desert; 
JER.25.25	all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media; 
JER.25.26	and all the kings of the north, near and far, one after the other. I made all the kingdoms on earth drink from the cup of the 
JER.25.27	“Then say to them, ‘This is what the L
JER.25.28	“If they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink, say to them, ‘The L
JER.25.29	Look! I am already bringing disaster on Jerusalem, the city that is called by my name. Do you think you will not be punished? You will be punished! I am sending war on all the people of the earth, says the L
JER.25.30	“You, Jeremiah, will prophesy against them with all these words. Say to them:
JER.25.30	‘The L
JER.25.30	and will shout from his Holy Temple.
JER.25.30	He will roar loudly against his land.
JER.25.30	He will shout like people who walk on grapes to make wine;
JER.25.30	he will shout against all who live on the earth.
JER.25.31	The noise will spread all over the earth,
JER.25.31	because the L
JER.25.31	He will judge and tell what is wrong with all people,
JER.25.31	and he will kill the evil people with a sword,’ ” says the L
JER.25.32	This is what the L
JER.25.32	“Disasters will soon spread
JER.25.32	from nation to nation.
JER.25.32	They will come like a powerful storm
JER.25.32	from the faraway places on earth.”
JER.25.33	At that time those killed by the L
JER.25.34	Cry, you leaders! Cry out loud!
JER.25.34	Roll around in the dust, leaders of the people!
JER.25.34	It is now time for you to be killed.
JER.25.34	You will fall and be scattered,
JER.25.34	like pieces of a broken jar.
JER.25.35	There will be no place for the leaders to hide;
JER.25.35	they will not escape.
JER.25.36	I hear the sound of the leaders shouting.
JER.25.36	I hear the leaders of the people crying loudly,
JER.25.36	because the L
JER.25.37	Those peaceful pastures will be like an empty desert,
JER.25.37	because the L
JER.25.38	Like a lion, he has left his den.
JER.25.38	Their land has been destroyed
JER.25.38	because of the terrible war he brought,
JER.25.38	because of his fierce anger.
JER.26.1	This message came from the L
JER.26.2	This is what the L
JER.26.3	Maybe they will listen and stop their evil ways. If they will, I will change my mind about bringing on them the disaster that I am planning because of the evil they have done. 
JER.26.4	Say to them: ‘This is what the L
JER.26.5	You must listen to what my servants the prophets say to you. I have sent them to you again and again, but you did not listen. 
JER.26.6	If you don’t obey me, I will destroy my Temple in Jerusalem as I destroyed my Holy Tent at Shiloh. When I do, people all over the world will curse Jerusalem.’ ”
JER.26.7	The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the Temple of the L
JER.26.8	When Jeremiah finished speaking everything the L
JER.26.9	How dare you prophesy in the name of the L
JER.26.10	Now when the officers of Judah heard about what was happening, they came out of the king’s palace and went up to the Temple of the L
JER.26.11	Then the priests and prophets said to the officers and all the other people, “Jeremiah should be killed. He prophesied against Jerusalem, and you heard him yourselves.”
JER.26.12	Then Jeremiah spoke these words to all the officers of Judah and all the other people: “The L
JER.26.13	Now change your lives and start doing good and obey the L
JER.26.14	As for me, I am in your power. Do to me what you think is good and right. 
JER.26.15	But be sure of one thing. If you kill me, you will be guilty of killing an innocent person. You will make this city and everyone who lives in it guilty, too! The L
JER.26.16	Then the officers and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, “Jeremiah must not be killed. What he told us comes from the L
JER.26.17	Then some of the elders of Judah stood up and said to all the people, 
JER.26.18	“Micah, from the city of Moresheth, was a prophet during the time Hezekiah was king of Judah. Micah said to all the people of Judah, ‘This is what the L
JER.26.18	Jerusalem will be plowed like a field.
JER.26.18	It will become a pile of rocks,
JER.26.18	and the hill where the Temple stands will be covered with bushes.’
JER.26.19	“Hezekiah king of Judah and the people of Judah did not kill Micah. You know that Hezekiah feared the L
JER.26.20	(Now there was another man who prophesied in the name of the L
JER.26.21	When King Jehoiakim, all his army officers, and all the leaders of Judah heard Uriah preach, King Jehoiakim wanted to kill Uriah. But Uriah heard about it and was afraid. So he escaped to Egypt. 
JER.26.22	Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Acbor and some other men to Egypt, 
JER.26.23	and they brought Uriah back from Egypt. Then they took him to King Jehoiakim, who had Uriah killed with a sword. His body was thrown into the burial place where poor people are buried.)
JER.26.24	Ahikam son of Shaphan supported Jeremiah. So Ahikam did not hand Jeremiah over to be killed by the people.
JER.27.1	The L
JER.27.2	This is what the L
JER.27.3	Then send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon by their messengers who have come to Jerusalem to see Zedekiah king of Judah. 
JER.27.4	Tell them to give this message to their masters: ‘The L
JER.27.5	I made the earth, its people, and all its animals with my great power and strength. I can give the earth to anyone I want. 
JER.27.6	Now I have given all these lands to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my servant. I will make even the wild animals obey him. 
JER.27.7	All nations will serve Nebuchadnezzar and his son and grandson. Then the time will come for Babylon to be defeated, and many nations and great kings will make Babylon their servant.
JER.27.8	“ ‘ “But if some nations or kingdoms refuse to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and refuse to be under his control, I will punish them with war, hunger, and terrible diseases, says the L
JER.27.9	So don’t listen to your false prophets, those who use magic to tell the future, those who explain dreams, the mediums, or magicians. They all tell you, ‘You will not be slaves to the king of Babylon.’ 
JER.27.10	They are telling you lies that will cause you to be taken far from your homeland. I will force you to leave your homes, and you will die in another land. 
JER.27.11	But the nations who put themselves under the control of the king of Babylon and serve him I will let stay in their own country, says the L
JER.27.12	I gave the same message to Zedekiah king of Judah. I said, “Put yourself under the control of the king of Babylon and serve him, and you will live. 
JER.27.13	Why should you and your people die from war, hunger, or disease, as the L
JER.27.14	But the false prophets are saying, ‘You will never be slaves to the king of Babylon.’ Don’t listen to them because they are prophesying lies to you! 
JER.27.15	‘I did not send them,’ says the L
JER.27.16	Then I, Jeremiah, said to the priests and all the people, “This is what the L
JER.27.17	Don’t listen to those prophets. But serve the king of Babylon, and you will live. There is no reason for you to cause Jerusalem to become a ruin. 
JER.27.18	If they are prophets and have the message from the L
JER.27.19	“This is what the L
JER.27.20	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon did not take these away when he took as captives Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other important people from Judah and Jerusalem to Babylon. 
JER.27.21	This is what the L
JER.27.22	‘All of them will also be taken to Babylon. And they will stay there until the day I go to get them,’ says the L
JER.28.1	It was in that same year, in the fifth month of Zedekiah’s fourth year as king of Judah, soon after he began to rule. The prophet Hananiah son of Azzur, from the town of Gibeon, spoke to me in the Temple of the L
JER.28.2	“The L
JER.28.3	Before two years are over, I will bring back everything that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took to Babylon from the 
JER.28.4	I will also bring back Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim king of Judah and all the other captives from Judah who went to Babylon,’ says the L
JER.28.5	Then the prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in front of the priests and all the people who were standing in the Temple of the L
JER.28.6	He said, “Amen! Let the L
JER.28.7	“But listen to what I am going to say to you and all the people. 
JER.28.8	There were prophets long before we became prophets, Hananiah. They prophesied that war, hunger, and terrible diseases would come to many countries and great kingdoms. 
JER.28.9	But if a prophet prophesies that we will have peace and that message comes true, he can be recognized as one truly sent by the L
JER.28.10	Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke off Jeremiah’s neck and broke it. 
JER.28.11	Hananiah said in front of all the people, “This is what the L
JER.28.12	The L
JER.28.13	The L
JER.28.14	The L
JER.28.15	Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, “Listen, Hananiah! The L
JER.28.16	So this is what the L
JER.28.17	Hananiah died in the seventh month of that same year.
JER.29.1	This is the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the elders who were among the captives, the priests, and the prophets. He sent it to all the other people Nebuchadnezzar had taken as captives from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
JER.29.2	(This letter was sent after all these people were taken away: Jehoiachin the king and the queen mother; the officers and leaders of Judah and Jerusalem; and the craftsmen and metalworkers from Jerusalem.) 
JER.29.3	Zedekiah king of Judah sent Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. So Jeremiah gave them this letter to carry to Babylon:
JER.29.4	This is what the L
JER.29.5	“Build houses and settle in the land. Plant gardens and eat the food they grow. 
JER.29.6	Get married and have sons and daughters. Find wives for your sons, and let your daughters be married so they also may have sons and daughters. Have many children in Babylon; don’t become fewer in number. 
JER.29.7	Also do good things for the city where I sent you as captives. Pray to the L
JER.29.8	The L
JER.29.9	They are prophesying lies to you, saying that their message is from me. But I did not send them,” says the L
JER.29.10	This is what the L
JER.29.11	I say this because I know what I am planning for you,” says the L
JER.29.12	Then you will call my name. You will come to me and pray to me, and I will listen to you. 
JER.29.13	You will search for me. And when you search for me with all your heart, you will find me! 
JER.29.14	I will let you find me,” says the L
JER.29.15	You might say, “The L
JER.29.16	But the L
JER.29.17	The L
JER.29.18	I will chase them with war, hunger, and terrible diseases. I will make them hated by all the kingdoms of the earth. People will curse them and be shocked and will use them as a shameful example wherever I make them go. 
JER.29.19	This is because they have not listened to my message,” says the L
JER.29.20	You captives, whom I forced to leave Jerusalem and go to Babylon, listen to the message from the L
JER.29.21	The L
JER.29.22	Because of them, all the captives from Judah in Babylon will use this curse: ‘May the L
JER.29.23	They have done evil things among the people of Israel. They are guilty of adultery with their neighbors’ wives. They have also spoken lies and said those lies were a message from me. I did not tell them to do that. I know what they have done; I am a witness to it,” says the L
JER.29.24	Also give a message to Shemaiah from the Nehelamite family. 
JER.29.25	The L
JER.29.26	You said to Zephaniah, ‘The L
JER.29.27	Now Jeremiah from Anathoth is acting like a prophet. So why haven’t you arrested him? 
JER.29.28	Jeremiah has sent this message to us in Babylon: You will be there for a long time, so build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what they grow.’ ”
JER.29.29	Zephaniah the priest read the letter to Jeremiah the prophet. 
JER.29.30	Then the L
JER.29.31	“Send this message to all the captives in Babylon: ‘This is what the L
JER.29.32	So the L
JER.30.1	These are the words that the L
JER.30.2	The L
JER.30.3	The days will come when I will bring Israel and Judah back from captivity,” says the L
JER.30.4	The L
JER.30.5	This is what the L
JER.30.5	“We hear people crying from fear.
JER.30.5	They are afraid; there is no peace.
JER.30.6	Ask this question, and consider it:
JER.30.6	A man cannot have a baby.
JER.30.6	So why do I see every strong man
JER.30.6	holding his stomach in pain like a woman having a baby?
JER.30.6	Why is everyone’s face turning white like a dead man’s face?
JER.30.7	This will be a terrible day!
JER.30.7	There will never be another time like this.
JER.30.7	This is a time of great trouble for the people of Jacob,
JER.30.7	but they will be saved from it.”
JER.30.8	The L
JER.30.8	I will break the yoke from their necks
JER.30.8	and tear off the ropes that hold them.
JER.30.8	Foreign people will never again make my people slaves.
JER.30.9	They will serve the L
JER.30.9	and David their king,
JER.30.9	whom I will send to them.
JER.30.10	“So people of Jacob, my servants, don’t be afraid.
JER.30.10	Israel, don’t be frightened,” says the L
JER.30.10	“I will soon save you from that faraway place where you are captives.
JER.30.10	I will save your family from that land.
JER.30.10	The people of Jacob will be safe and have peace again;
JER.30.10	there will be no enemy to frighten them.
JER.30.11	I am with you and will save you,”
JER.30.11	says the L
JER.30.11	“I will completely destroy all those nations
JER.30.11	where I scattered you,
JER.30.11	but I will not completely destroy you.
JER.30.11	I will punish you fairly,
JER.30.11	but I will still punish you.”
JER.30.12	This is what the L
JER.30.12	“You people have a wound that cannot be cured;
JER.30.12	your injury will not heal.
JER.30.13	There is no one to argue your case
JER.30.13	and no cure for your sores.

JER.30.14	All those nations who were your friends have forgotten you.
JER.30.14	They don’t care about you.
JER.30.14	I have hurt you as an enemy would.
JER.30.14	I punished you very hard,
JER.30.14	because your guilt was so great
JER.30.14	and your sins were so many.
JER.30.15	Why are you crying out about your injury?
JER.30.15	There is no cure for your pain.
JER.30.15	I did these things to you because of your great guilt,
JER.30.15	because of your many sins.
JER.30.16	But all those nations that destroyed you will now be destroyed.
JER.30.16	All your enemies will become captives in other lands.
JER.30.16	Those who stole from you will have their own things stolen.

JER.30.18	This is what the L
JER.30.18	“I will soon make the tents of Jacob’s people as they used to be,

JER.30.23	Look! It is a storm from the L

JER.31.8	Some of the women are pregnant, and some are ready to give birth.
JER.31.8	A great many people will come back.

JER.31.12	They will be like a garden that has plenty of water,

JER.31.13	Then young women of Israel will be happy and dance,
JER.31.13	the young men and old men also.
JER.31.13	I will change their sadness into happiness;
JER.31.13	I will give them comfort and joy instead of sadness.

JER.31.15	of painful crying and deep sadness:

JER.31.19	I changed my heart and life.
JER.31.19	After I understood,

JER.31.20	“You know that Israel is my dear son,
JER.31.20	The child I love.
JER.31.20	Yes, I often speak against Israel,
JER.31.20	but I still remember him.

JER.31.26	After hearing that, I, Jeremiah, woke up and looked around. My sleep had been very pleasant.
JER.31.27	The L
JER.31.28	In the past I watched over Israel and Judah, to pull them up and tear them down, to destroy them and bring them disaster. But now I will watch over them to build them up and make them strong,” says the L

JER.31.29	‘The parents have eaten sour grapes,

JER.32.10	I signed the record and sealed it and had some people witness it. I also weighed out the silver on the scales. 
JER.32.11	Then I took both copies of the record of ownership—the one that was sealed that had the demands and limits of ownership, and the one that was not sealed. 
JER.32.12	And I gave them to Baruch son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah. My cousin Hanamel, the other witnesses who signed the record of ownership, and many Jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard saw me give the record of ownership to Baruch.

JER.32.19	You plan and do great things. You see everything that people do, and you reward people for the way they live and for what they do. 
JER.32.20	You did miracles and wonderful things in the land of Egypt. You have continued doing them in Israel and among the other nations even until today. So you have become well known. 
JER.32.21	You brought your people, the Israelites, out of Egypt using signs and miracles and your great power and strength. You brought great terror on everyone. 
JER.32.22	You gave them this land that you promised to their ancestors long ago, a fertile land. 
JER.32.23	They came into this land and took it for their own, but they did not obey you or follow your teachings. They did not do everything you commanded. So you made all these terrible things happen to them.
JER.32.24	“Look! The enemy has surrounded the city and has built roads to the top of the walls to capture it. Because of war, hunger, and terrible diseases, the city will be handed over to the Babylonians who are attacking it. You said this would happen, and now you see it is happening.

JER.32.29	The Babylonian army is already attacking the city of Jerusalem. They will soon enter it and start a fire to burn down the city and its houses. The people of Jerusalem offered sacrifices to Baal on the roofs of those same houses and poured out drink offerings to other idols to make me angry. 
JER.32.30	From their youth, the people of Israel and Judah have done only the things I said were wrong. They have made me angry by worshiping idols made with their own hands,” says the L
JER.32.31	“From the day Jerusalem was built until now, this city has made me angry, so angry that I must remove it from my sight. 
JER.32.32	I will destroy it, because of all the evil the people of Israel and Judah have done. The people, their kings and officers, their priests and prophets, all the people of Judah, and the people of Jerusalem have made me angry. 
JER.32.33	They turned their backs to me, not their faces. I tried to teach them again and again, but they wouldn’t listen or learn. 
JER.32.34	They put their hateful idols in the place where I have chosen to be worshiped, so they made it unclean. 
JER.32.35	In the Valley of Ben Hinnom they built places to worship Baal so they could burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices to Molech. But I never commanded them to do such a hateful thing. It never entered my mind that they would do such a thing and cause Judah to sin.
JER.32.36	“You are saying, ‘Because of war, hunger, and terrible diseases, the city will be handed over to the king of Babylon.’ But the L
JER.32.37	I forced the people of Israel and Judah to leave their land, because I was furious and very angry with them. But soon I will gather them from all the lands where I forced them to go, and I will bring them back to this place, where they may live in safety. 
JER.32.38	The people of Israel and Judah will be my people, and I will be their God. 
JER.32.39	I will make them truly want to be one people with one goal. They will truly want to worship me all their lives, for their own good and for the good of their children after them.

JER.32.42	This is what the L
JER.32.43	You are saying, ‘This land is an empty desert, without people or animals. It has been handed over to the Babylonians.’ But in the future, people will again buy fields in this land. 
JER.32.44	They will use their money to buy fields. They will sign and seal their agreements and call in witnesses. They will again buy fields in the land of Benjamin, in the area around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the mountains, in the western hills, and in southern Judah. I will make everything as good for them as it once was,” says the L
JER.33.1	While Jeremiah was still locked up in the courtyard of the guards, the L
JER.33.2	“These are the words of the L
JER.33.3	‘Judah, pray to me, and I will answer you. I will tell you important secrets you have never heard before.’

JER.33.9	Then “Jerusalem” will be to me a name that brings joy! And people from all nations of the earth will praise it when they hear about the good things I am doing there. They will be surprised and shocked at all the good things and the peace I will bring to Jerusalem.’
JER.33.10	“You are saying, ‘Our country is an empty desert, without people or animals.’ But this is what the L
JER.33.11	There will be sounds of joy and gladness and the happy sounds of brides and bridegrooms. There will be the sounds of people bringing to the Temple of the L

JER.33.11	They will say this because I will again do good things for Judah, as I did in the beginning,” says the L
JER.33.12	This is what the L
JER.33.13	Shepherds will again count their sheep as the sheep walk in front of them. They will count them in the mountains and in the western hills, in southern Judah and the land of Benjamin, and around Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah!” says the L
JER.33.14	The L
JER.33.15	In those days and at that time,
JER.33.15	I will make a good branch sprout from David’s family.
JER.33.15	He will do what is fair and right in the land.
JER.33.16	At that time Judah will be saved,
JER.33.16	and the people of Jerusalem will live in safety.
JER.33.16	The branch will be named:
JER.33.16	The L
JER.33.17	This is what the L
JER.33.18	And there will always be priests from the family of Levi. They will always stand before me to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings and sacrifices to me.”
JER.33.19	The L
JER.33.20	“This is what the L
JER.33.21	only then could you change my agreement with David and Levi. Only then would my servant David not have a descendant ruling as king on David’s throne. And only then would the family of Levi not be priests serving me in the Temple. 
JER.33.22	But I will give many descendants to my servant David and to the family group of Levi who serve me in the Temple. They will be as many as the stars in the sky that no one can count. They will be as many as the grains of sand on the seashore that no one can measure.”
JER.33.23	The L
JER.33.24	“Jeremiah, have you heard what the people are saying? They say: ‘The L
JER.33.25	This is what the L
JER.33.26	only then would I turn away from Jacob’s descendants. And only then would I not let the descendants of David my servant rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. But I will be kind to them and cause good things to happen to them again.”
JER.34.1	The L
JER.34.2	This is what the L
JER.34.3	You will not escape from the king of Babylon; you will surely be captured and handed over to him. You will see the king of Babylon with your own eyes, and he will talk to you face to face. And you will go to Babylon. 
JER.34.4	But, Zedekiah king of Judah, listen to the promise of the L
JER.34.5	You will die in a peaceful way. As people made funeral fires to honor your ancestors, the kings who ruled before you, so people will make a funeral fire to honor you. They will cry for you and sadly say, “Ah, master!” I myself make this promise to you, says the L
JER.34.6	So Jeremiah the prophet gave this message to Zedekiah in Jerusalem. 
JER.34.7	This was while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and the cities of Judah that had not yet been taken—Lachish and Azekah. These were the only strong, walled cities left in the land of Judah.
JER.34.8	The L
JER.34.9	Everyone was supposed to free his Hebrew slaves, both male and female. No one was to keep a fellow Jew as a slave. 
JER.34.10	All the officers and all the people accepted this agreement; they agreed to free their male and female slaves and no longer keep them as slaves. So all the slaves were set free. 
JER.34.11	But after that, the people who had slaves changed their minds. So they took back the people they had set free and made them slaves again.
JER.34.12	Then the L
JER.34.13	“This is what the L
JER.34.14	I said to your ancestors: ‘At the end of every seven years, each one of you must set his Hebrew slaves free. If a fellow Hebrew has sold himself to you, you must let him go free after he has served you for six years.’ But your ancestors did not listen or pay attention to me. 
JER.34.15	A short time ago you changed your hearts and did what I say is right. Each of you gave freedom to his fellow Hebrews who were slaves. And you even made an agreement before me in the place where I have chosen to be worshiped. 
JER.34.16	But now you have changed your minds. You have shown you do not honor me. Each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free, and you have forced them to become your slaves again.
JER.34.17	“So this is what the L
JER.34.18	I will hand over the men who broke my agreement, who have not kept the promises they made before me. They cut a calf into two pieces before me and walked between the pieces. 
JER.34.19	These people made the agreement before me by walking between the pieces of the calf: the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the officers of the court, the priests, and all the people of the land. 
JER.34.20	So I will hand them over to their enemies and to everyone who wants to kill them. Their bodies will become food for the birds of the air and for the wild animals of the earth. 
JER.34.21	I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah and his officers over to their enemies, and to everyone who wants to kill them, and to the army of the king of Babylon, even though they have left Jerusalem. 
JER.34.22	I will give the order, says the L
JER.35.1	When Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the L
JER.35.2	 “Go to the family of Recab. Invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the Temple of the L
JER.35.3	So I went to get Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah, the son of Habazziniah. And I gathered all of Jaazaniah’s brothers and sons and the whole family of the Recabites together. 
JER.35.4	Then I brought them into the Temple of the L
JER.35.5	Then I put some bowls full of wine and some cups before the men of the Recabite family. And I said to them, “Drink some wine.”
JER.35.6	But the Recabite men answered, “We never drink wine. Our ancestor Jonadab son of Recab gave us this command: ‘You and your descendants must never drink wine. 
JER.35.7	Also you must never build houses, plant seeds, or plant vineyards, or do any of those things. You must live only in tents. Then you will live a long time in the land where you are wanderers.’ 
JER.35.8	So we Recabites have obeyed everything Jonadab our ancestor commanded us. Neither we nor our wives, sons, or daughters ever drink wine. 
JER.35.9	We never build houses in which to live, or own fields or vineyards, or plant crops. 
JER.35.10	We have lived in tents and have obeyed everything our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. 
JER.35.11	But when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Judah, we said to each other, ‘Come, we must enter Jerusalem so we can escape the Babylonian army and the Aramean army.’ So we have stayed in Jerusalem.”
JER.35.12	Then the L
JER.35.13	“This is what the L
JER.35.14	‘Jonadab son of Recab ordered his descendants not to drink wine, and that command has been obeyed. Until today they have obeyed their ancestor’s command; they do not drink wine. But I, the L
JER.35.15	I sent all my servants the prophets to you again and again, saying, “Each of you must stop doing evil. You must change and be good. Do not follow other gods to serve them. If you obey me, you will live in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.” But you have not listened to me or paid attention to my message. 
JER.35.16	The descendants of Jonadab son of Recab obeyed the commands their ancestor gave them, but the people of Judah have not obeyed me.’
JER.35.17	“So the L
JER.35.18	Then Jeremiah said to the Recabites, “This is what the L
JER.35.19	So this is what the L

JER.36.2	“Get a scroll. Write on it all the words I have spoken to you about Israel and Judah and all the nations. Write everything from when I first spoke to you, when Josiah was king, until now. 
JER.36.3	Maybe the family of Judah will hear what disasters I am planning to bring on them and will stop doing wicked things. Then I would forgive them for the sins and the evil things they have done.”
JER.36.4	So Jeremiah called for Baruch son of Neriah. Jeremiah spoke the messages the L
JER.36.5	Then Jeremiah commanded Baruch, “I cannot go to the Temple of the L
JER.36.6	So I want you to go to the Temple of the L
JER.36.7	Perhaps they will ask the L
JER.36.8	So Baruch son of Neriah did everything Jeremiah the prophet told him to do. In the 
JER.36.9	In the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king, a fast was announced. All the people of Jerusalem and everyone who had come into Jerusalem from the towns of Judah were supposed to give up eating to honor the L
JER.36.10	At that time Baruch read to all the people there the scroll containing Jeremiah’s words. He read the scroll in the Temple of the L
JER.36.11	Micaiah son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, heard all the messages from the L
JER.36.12	Micaiah went down to the royal secretary’s room in the king’s palace where all of the officers were sitting: Elishama the royal secretary; Delaiah son of Shemaiah; Elnathan son of Acbor; Gemariah son of Shaphan; Zedekiah son of Hananiah; and all the other officers. 
JER.36.13	Micaiah told those officers everything he had heard Baruch read to the people from the scroll.
JER.36.14	Then the officers sent a man named Jehudi son of Nethaniah to Baruch. (Nethaniah was the son of Shelemiah, who was the son of Cushi.) Jehudi said to Baruch, “Bring the scroll that you read to the people and come with me.”
JER.36.14	So Baruch son of Neriah took the scroll and went with Jehudi to the officers. 
JER.36.15	Then the officers said to Baruch, “Please sit down and read the scroll to us.”
JER.36.15	So Baruch read the scroll to them. 
JER.36.16	When the officers heard all the words, they became afraid and looked at each other. They said to Baruch, “We must certainly tell the king about these words.” 
JER.36.17	Then the officers asked Baruch, “Tell us, please, where did you get all these words you wrote on the scroll? Did you write down what Jeremiah said to you?”
JER.36.18	“Yes,” Baruch answered. “Jeremiah spoke them all to me, and I wrote them down with ink on this scroll.”
JER.36.19	Then the officers said to Baruch, “You and Jeremiah must go and hide, and don’t tell anyone where you are.”
JER.36.20	The officers put the scroll in the room of Elishama the royal secretary. Then they went to the king in the courtyard and told him all about the scroll. 
JER.36.21	So King Jehoiakim sent Jehudi to get the scroll. Jehudi brought the scroll from the room of Elishama the royal secretary and read it to the king and to all the officers who stood around the king. 
JER.36.22	It was the ninth month of the year, so King Jehoiakim was sitting in the winter apartment. There was a fire burning in a small firepot in front of him. 
JER.36.23	After Jehudi had read three or four columns, the king cut those columns off of the scroll with a penknife and threw them into the firepot. Finally, the whole scroll was burned in the fire. 
JER.36.24	King Jehoiakim and his servants heard everything that was said, but they were not frightened! They did not tear their clothes to show their sorrow. 
JER.36.25	Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah even tried to talk King Jehoiakim out of burning the scroll, but he would not listen to them. 
JER.36.26	Instead, the king ordered Jerahmeel son of the king, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet. But the L
JER.36.27	So King Jehoiakim burned the scroll where Baruch had written all the words Jeremiah had spoken to him. Then the L
JER.36.28	“Get another scroll. Write all the words on it that were on the first scroll that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned up. 
JER.36.29	Also say this to Jehoiakim king of Judah: ‘This is what the L
JER.36.30	So this is what the L
JER.36.31	I will punish Jehoiakim and his children and his servants, because they have done evil things. I will bring disasters upon them and upon all the people in Jerusalem and Judah—everything I promised but which they refused to hear.’ ”
JER.36.32	So Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch son of Neriah, his secretary. As Jeremiah spoke, Baruch wrote on the scroll the same words that were on the scroll Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire. And many similar words were added to the second scroll.
JER.37.1	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had appointed Zedekiah son of Josiah to be king of Judah. Zedekiah took the place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim. 
JER.37.2	But Zedekiah, his servants, and the people of Judah did not listen to the words the L
JER.37.3	Now King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah with a message to Jeremiah the prophet. This was the message: “Jeremiah, please pray to the L
JER.37.4	At that time Jeremiah had not yet been put into prison. So he was free to go anywhere he wanted. 
JER.37.5	The army of the king of Egypt had marched from Egypt toward Judah. Now the Babylonian army had surrounded the city of Jerusalem. When they heard about the Egyptian army marching toward them, the Babylonian army left Jerusalem.
JER.37.6	The L
JER.37.7	“This is what the L
JER.37.8	After that, the Babylonian army will return and attack Jerusalem and capture it and burn it down.’
JER.37.9	“This is what the L
JER.37.10	Even if you defeated all of the Babylonian army that is attacking you and there were only a few injured men left in their tents, they would come from their tents and burn down Jerusalem!”
JER.37.11	So the Babylonian army left Jerusalem to fight the army of the king of Egypt. 
JER.37.12	Now Jeremiah tried to travel from Jerusalem to the land of Benjamin to get his share of the property that belonged to his family. 
JER.37.13	When Jeremiah got to the Benjamin Gate of Jerusalem, the captain in charge of the guards arrested him. The captain’s name was Irijah son of Shelemiah son of Hananiah. Irijah said, “You are leaving us to join the Babylonians!”
JER.37.14	But Jeremiah said to Irijah, “That’s not true! I am not leaving to join the Babylonians.” Irijah refused to listen to Jeremiah, so he arrested Jeremiah and took him to the officers of Jerusalem. 
JER.37.15	Those rulers were very angry with Jeremiah and beat him. Then they put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the royal secretary, which had been made into a prison. 
JER.37.16	So those people put Jeremiah into a cell in a dungeon, and Jeremiah was there for a long time.
JER.37.17	Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the palace. Zedekiah asked him in private, “Is there any message from the L
JER.37.17	Jeremiah answered, “Yes, there is. Zedekiah, you will be handed over to the king of Babylon.” 
JER.37.18	Then Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, “What crime have I done against you or your officers or the people of Jerusalem? Why have you thrown me into prison? 
JER.37.19	Where are your prophets that prophesied this message to you: ‘The king of Babylon will not attack you or this land of Judah?’ 
JER.37.20	But now, my master, king of Judah, please listen to me, and please do what I ask of you. Do not send me back to the house of Jonathan the royal secretary, or I will die there!”
JER.37.21	So King Zedekiah gave orders for Jeremiah to be put under guard in the courtyard of the guard and to be given bread each day from the street of the bakers until there was no more bread in the city. So he stayed under guard in the courtyard of the guard.
JER.38.1	Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah was telling all the people. He said: 
JER.38.2	“This is what the L
JER.38.3	And this is what the L
JER.38.4	Then the officers said to the king, “Jeremiah must be put to death! He is discouraging the soldiers who are still in the city, and all the people, by what he is saying to them. He does not want good to happen to us; he wants to ruin us.”
JER.38.5	King Zedekiah said to them, “Jeremiah is in your control. I cannot do anything to stop you.”
JER.38.6	So the officers took Jeremiah and put him into the well of Malkijah, the king’s son, which was in the courtyard of the guards. The officers used ropes to lower Jeremiah into the well, which did not have any water in it, only mud. And Jeremiah sank down into the mud.
JER.38.7	But Ebed-Melech, a Cushite and a servant in the palace, heard that the officers had put Jeremiah into the well. As King Zedekiah was sitting at the Benjamin Gate, 
JER.38.8	Ebed-Melech left the palace and went to the king. Ebed-Melech said to him, 
JER.38.9	“My master and king, these rulers have acted in an evil way. They have treated Jeremiah the prophet badly. They have thrown him into a well and left him there to die! When there is no more bread in the city, he will starve to death.”
JER.38.10	Then King Zedekiah commanded Ebed-Melech the Cushite, “Take thirty men from the palace and lift Jeremiah the prophet out of the well before he dies.”
JER.38.11	So Ebed-Melech took the men with him and went to a room under the storeroom in the palace. He took some old rags and worn-out clothes from that room. Then he let those rags down with some ropes to Jeremiah in the well. 
JER.38.12	Ebed-Melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, “Put these old rags and worn-out clothes under your arms to be pads for the ropes.” So Jeremiah did as Ebed-Melech said. 
JER.38.13	The men pulled Jeremiah up with the ropes and lifted him out of the well. And Jeremiah stayed under guard in the courtyard of the guard.
JER.38.14	Then King Zedekiah sent someone to get Jeremiah the prophet and bring him to the third entrance to the Temple of the L
JER.38.15	Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “If I give you an answer, you will surely kill me. And even if I give you advice, you will not listen to me.”
JER.38.16	But King Zedekiah made a secret promise to Jeremiah, “As surely as the L
JER.38.17	Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, “This is what the L
JER.38.18	But if you refuse to surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, Jerusalem will be handed over to the Babylonian army, and they will burn it down. And you yourself will not escape from them.’ ”
JER.38.19	Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “I’m afraid of some Jews who have already gone over to the side of the Babylonian army. If the Babylonians hand me over to them, they will treat me badly.”
JER.38.20	But Jeremiah answered, “The Babylonians will not hand you over to the Jews. Obey the L
JER.38.21	But if you refuse to surrender to the Babylonians, the L
JER.38.22	All the women left in the palace of the king of Judah will be brought out and taken to the important officers of the king of Babylon. Your women will make fun of you with this song:
JER.38.22	‘Your good friends misled you
JER.38.22	and were stronger than you.
JER.38.22	While your feet were stuck in the mud,
JER.38.22	they left you.’
JER.38.23	“All your wives and children will be brought out and given to the Babylonian army. You yourself will not even escape from them. You will be taken prisoner by the king of Babylon, and Jerusalem will be burned down.”
JER.38.24	Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, “Do not tell anyone that I have been talking to you, or you will die. 
JER.38.25	If the officers find out I talked to you, they will come to you and say, ‘Tell us what you said to King Zedekiah and what he said to you. Don’t keep any secrets from us. If you don’t tell us everything, we will kill you.’ 
JER.38.26	If they ask you, tell them, ‘I was begging the king not to send me back to Jonathan’s house to die.’ ”
JER.38.27	All the officers did come to question Jeremiah. So he told them everything the king had ordered him to say. Then the officers said no more to Jeremiah, because no one had heard what Jeremiah and the king had discussed.
JER.38.28	So Jeremiah stayed under guard in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
JER.39.1	This is how Jerusalem was captured: Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army and surrounded the city to attack it. This was during the tenth month of the ninth year Zedekiah was king of Judah. 
JER.39.2	This lasted until the ninth day of the fourth month in Zedekiah’s eleventh year. Then the city wall was broken through. 
JER.39.3	And all these officers of the king of Babylon came into Jerusalem and sat down at the Middle Gate: Nergal-Sharezer of the district of Samgar; Nebo-Sarsekim, a chief officer; Nergal-Sharezer, an important leader; and all the other important officers.
JER.39.4	When Zedekiah king of Judah and all his soldiers saw them, they ran away. They left Jerusalem at night and went out from the king’s garden. They went through the gate that was between the two walls and then headed toward the Jordan Valley. 
JER.39.5	But the Babylonian army chased them and caught up with Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. They captured him and took him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, who was at the town of Riblah in the land of Hamath. There Nebuchadnezzar passed his sentence on Zedekiah. 
JER.39.6	At Riblah the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons and all the important officers of Judah as Zedekiah watched. 
JER.39.7	Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes. He put bronze chains on Zedekiah and took him to Babylon.
JER.39.8	The Babylonians set fire to the palace and to the houses of the people, and they broke down the walls around Jerusalem. 
JER.39.9	Nebuzaradan, commander of the king’s special guards, took the people left in Jerusalem, those captives who had surrendered to him earlier, and the rest of the people of Jerusalem, and he took them all away to Babylon. 
JER.39.10	But Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard, left some of the poorest people of Judah behind. They owned nothing, but that day he gave them vineyards and fields.
JER.39.11	Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had given these orders about Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, commander of the guard: 
JER.39.12	“Find Jeremiah and take care of him. Do not hurt him, but do for him whatever he asks you.” 
JER.39.13	So Nebuchadnezzar sent these men for Jeremiah: Nebuzaradan, commander of the guards; Nebushazban, a chief officer; Nergal-Sharezer, an important leader; and all the other officers of the king of Babylon. 
JER.39.14	They had Jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard. Then they turned him over to Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan, who had orders to take Jeremiah back home. So they took him home, and he stayed among the people left in Judah.
JER.39.15	While Jeremiah was guarded in the courtyard, the L
JER.39.16	“Jeremiah, go and tell Ebed-Melech the Cushite this message: ‘This is what the L
JER.39.17	But I will save you on that day, Ebed-Melech, says the L
JER.39.18	I will surely save you, Ebed-Melech. You will not die from a sword, but you will escape and live. This will happen because you have trusted in me, says the L
JER.40.1	The L
JER.40.2	When commander Nebuzaradan found Jeremiah, Nebuzaradan said to him, “The L
JER.40.3	And now the L
JER.40.4	But today I am freeing you from the chains on your wrists. If you want to, come with me to Babylon, and I will take good care of you. But if you don’t want to come, then don’t. Look, the whole country is open to you. Go wherever you wish.” 
JER.40.5	Before Jeremiah turned to leave, Nebuzaradan said, “Or go back to Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan. The king of Babylon has chosen him to be governor over the towns of Judah. Go and live with Gedaliah among the people, or go anywhere you want.”
JER.40.5	Then Nebuzaradan gave Jeremiah some food and a present and let him go. 
JER.40.6	So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah and stayed with him there. He lived among the people who were left behind in Judah.
JER.40.7	Some officers and their men from the army of Judah were still out in the open country. They heard that the king of Babylon had put Gedaliah son of Ahikam in charge of the people who were left in the land: the men, women, and children who were the poorest. They were the ones who were not taken to Babylon as captives. 
JER.40.8	So these soldiers came to Gedaliah at Mizpah: Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jaazaniah son of the Maacathite, and their men.
JER.40.9	Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, made a promise to them, saying, “Do not be afraid to serve the Babylonians. Stay in the land and serve the king of Babylon. Then everything will go well for you. 
JER.40.10	I myself will live in Mizpah and will speak for you before the Babylonians who come to us here. Harvest the wine, the summer fruit, and the oil, and put what you harvest in your storage jars. Live in the towns you control.”
JER.40.11	The Jews in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries also heard that the king of Babylon had left a few Jews alive in the land. And they heard the king of Babylon had chosen Gedaliah as governor over them. (Gedaliah was the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan.) 
JER.40.12	When the people of Judah heard this news, they came back to Judah from all the countries where they had been scattered. They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah and gathered a large harvest of wine and summer fruit.
JER.40.13	Johanan son of Kareah and all the army officers of Judah still in the open country came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
JER.40.14	They said to him, “Don’t you know that Baalis king of the Ammonite people wants you dead? He has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to kill you.” But Gedaliah son of Ahikam did not believe them.
JER.40.15	Then Johanan son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in private at Mizpah. He said, “Let me go and kill Ishmael son of Nethaniah. No one will know anything about it. We should not let Ishmael kill you. Then all the Jews gathered around you would be scattered to different countries again, and the few people of Judah who are left alive would be lost.”
JER.40.16	But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Johanan son of Kareah, “Do not kill Ishmael! The things you are saying about Ishmael are not true.”
JER.41.1	In the seventh month Ishmael son of Nethaniah and ten of his men came to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah. (Nethaniah was the son of Elishama.) Now Ishmael was a member of the king’s family and had been one of the officers of the king of Judah. While they were eating a meal with Gedaliah at Mizpah, 
JER.41.2	Ishmael and his ten men got up and killed Gedaliah son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with a sword. (Gedaliah was the man the king of Babylon had chosen as governor over Judah.) 
JER.41.3	Ishmael also killed all the Jews and the Babylonian soldiers who were there with Gedaliah at Mizpah.
JER.41.4	The day after Gedaliah was murdered, before anyone knew about it, 
JER.41.5	eighty men came to Mizpah bringing grain offerings and incense to the Temple of the L
JER.41.6	Ishmael son of Nethaniah went out from Mizpah to meet them, crying as he walked. When he met them, he said, “Come with me to meet Gedaliah son of Ahikam.” 
JER.41.7	So they went into Mizpah. Then Ishmael son of Nethaniah and his men killed seventy of them and threw the bodies into a deep well. 
JER.41.8	But the ten men who were left alive said to Ishmael, “Don’t kill us! We have wheat and barley and oil and honey that we have hidden in a field.” So Ishmael let them live and did not kill them with the others. 
JER.41.9	Now the well where he had thrown all the bodies had been made by King Asa as a part of his defenses against Baasha king of Israel. But Ishmael son of Nethaniah put dead bodies in it until it was full.
JER.41.10	Ishmael captured all the other people in Mizpah: the king’s daughters and all the other people who were left there. They were the ones whom Nebuzaradan commander of the guard had chosen Gedaliah son of Ahikam to take care of. So Ishmael son of Nethaniah captured those people, and he started to cross over to the country of the Ammonites.
JER.41.11	Johanan son of Kareah and all his army officers with him heard about all the evil things Ishmael son of Nethaniah had done. 
JER.41.12	So they took their men and went to fight Ishmael son of Nethaniah and caught him near the big pool of water at Gibeon. 
JER.41.13	When the captives Ishmael had taken saw Johanan and the army officers, they were glad. 
JER.41.14	So all the people Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and ran to Johanan son of Kareah. 
JER.41.15	But Ishmael son of Nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from Johanan and ran away to the Ammonites.
JER.41.16	So Johanan son of Kareah and all his army officers saved the captives that Ishmael son of Nethaniah had taken from Mizpah after he murdered Gedaliah son of Ahikam. Among those left alive were soldiers, women, children, and palace officers. And Johanan brought them back from the town of Gibeon.
JER.41.17+JER.41.18	Johanan and the other army officers were afraid of the Babylonians. Since the king of Babylon had chosen Gedaliah son of Ahikam to be governor of Judah but Ishmael son of Nethaniah had murdered him, Johanan was afraid that the Babylonians would be angry. So they decided to run away to Egypt. On the way they stayed at Geruth Kimham, near the town of Bethlehem.
JER.42.1	While there, Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah son of Hoshaiah went to Jeremiah the prophet. All the army officers and all the people, from the least important to the greatest, went along, too. 
JER.42.2	They said to him, “Jeremiah, please listen to what we ask. Pray to the L
JER.42.3	So pray that the L
JER.42.4	Then Jeremiah the prophet answered, “I understand what you want me to do. I will pray to the L
JER.42.5	Then the people said to Jeremiah, “May the L
JER.42.6	It does not matter if we like the message or not. We will obey the L
JER.42.7	Ten days later the L
JER.42.8	Then Jeremiah called for Johanan son of Kareah, the army officers with him, and all the other people, from the least important to the greatest. 
JER.42.9	Jeremiah said to them, “You sent me to ask the L
JER.42.10	‘If you will stay in Judah, I will build you up and not tear you down. I will plant you and not pull you up, because I am sad about the disaster I brought on you. 
JER.42.11	Now you fear the king of Babylon, but don’t be afraid of him. Don’t be afraid of him,’ says the L
JER.42.12	I will be kind to you, and he will also treat you with mercy and let you stay in your land.’
JER.42.13	“But if you say, ‘We will not stay in Judah,’ you will disobey the L
JER.42.14	Or you might say, ‘No, we will go and live in Egypt. There we will not see war, or hear the trumpets of war, or be hungry.’ 
JER.42.15	If you say that, listen to the message of the L
JER.42.16	You are afraid of war, but it will find you in the land of Egypt. And you are worried about hunger, but it will follow you into Egypt, and you will die there. 
JER.42.17	Everyone who goes to live in Egypt will die in war or from hunger or terrible disease. No one who goes to Egypt will live; no one will escape the terrible things I will bring to them.’
JER.42.18	“This is what the L
JER.42.19	“You who are left alive in Judah, the L
JER.42.20	that you are making a mistake that will cause your deaths. You sent me to the L
JER.42.21	So today I have told you, but you have not obeyed the L
JER.42.22	So now be sure you understand this: You want to go to live in Egypt, but you will die there by war, hunger, or terrible diseases.”
JER.43.1	So Jeremiah finished telling the people the message from the L
JER.43.2	Azariah son of Hoshaiah, Johanan son of Kareah, and some other men were too proud. They said to Jeremiah, “You are lying! The L
JER.43.3	Baruch son of Neriah is causing you to be against us. He wants you to hand us over to the Babylonians so they can kill us or capture us and take us to Babylon.”
JER.43.4	So Johanan, the army officers, and all the people disobeyed the 
JER.43.5	But Johanan son of Kareah and the army officers led away those who were left alive from Judah. They were the people who had run away from the Babylonians to other countries but then had come back to live in Judah. 
JER.43.6	They led away the men, women, and children, and the king’s daughters. Nebuzaradan commander of the guard had put Gedaliah son of Ahikam son of Shaphan in charge of those people. Johanan also took Jeremiah the prophet and Baruch son of Neriah. 
JER.43.7	These people did not listen to the L
JER.43.8	In Tahpanhes the L
JER.43.9	“Take some large stones. Bury them in the clay in the brick pavement in front of the king of Egypt’s palace in Tahpanhes. Do this while the Jews are watching you. 
JER.43.10	Then say to them, ‘This is what the L
JER.43.11	He will come here and attack Egypt. He will bring death to those who are supposed to die. He will make prisoners of those who are to be taken captive, and he will bring war to those who are to be killed with a sword. 
JER.43.12	Nebuchadnezzar will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt and burn them. And he will take the idols away as captives. As a shepherd wraps himself in his clothes, so Nebuchadnezzar will wrap Egypt around him. Then he will safely leave Egypt. 
JER.43.13	He will destroy the stone pillars in the temple of the sun god in Egypt, and he will burn down the temples of the gods of Egypt.’ ”
JER.44.1	Jeremiah received a message from the L
JER.44.2	“The L
JER.44.3	It is because the people who lived there did evil. They made me angry by burning incense and worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever knew. 
JER.44.4	I sent all my servants, the prophets, to you again and again. By them I said to you, ‘Don’t do this terrible thing that I hate.’ 
JER.44.5	But they did not listen or pay attention. They did not stop doing evil things and burning incense to other gods. 
JER.44.6	So I showed my great anger against them. I poured out my anger in the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem so they are only ruins and piles of stones today.
JER.44.7	“Now the L
JER.44.8	Why do you want to make me angry by making idols? Why do you burn incense to the gods of Egypt, where you have come to live? You will destroy yourselves. Other nations will speak evil of you and make fun of you. 
JER.44.9	Have you forgotten about the evil things your ancestors did? And have you forgotten the evil the kings and queens of Judah did? Have you forgotten about the evil you and your wives did? These things were done in the country of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. 
JER.44.10	Even to this day the people of Judah are still too proud. They have not learned to respect me or to follow my teachings. They have not obeyed the laws I gave you and your ancestors.
JER.44.11	“So this is what the L
JER.44.12	The few who were left alive from Judah were determined to go to Egypt and settle there, but they will all die in Egypt. They will be killed in war or die from hunger. From the least important to the greatest, they will be killed in war or die from hunger. Other nations will speak evil about them. People will be shocked by what has happened to them. They will become a curse word, and people will insult them. 
JER.44.13	I will punish those people who have gone to live in Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem, using swords, hunger, and terrible diseases. 
JER.44.14	Of the people of Judah who were left alive and have gone to live in Egypt, none will escape my punishment. They want to return to Judah and live there, but none of them will live to return to Judah, except a few people who will escape.”
JER.44.15	A large group of the people of Judah who lived in southern Egypt were meeting together. Among them were many women of Judah who were burning incense to other gods, and their husbands knew it. All these people said to Jeremiah, 
JER.44.16	“We will not listen to the message from the L
JER.44.17	We promised to make sacrifices to the Queen Goddess, and we will certainly do everything we promised. We will burn incense and pour out drink offerings to worship her, just as we, our ancestors, kings, and officers did in the past. All of us did these things in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. At that time we had plenty of food and were successful, and nothing bad happened to us. 
JER.44.18	But since we stopped making sacrifices to the Queen Goddess and stopped pouring out drink offerings to her, we have had great problems. Our people have also been killed in war and by hunger.”
JER.44.19	The women said, “Our husbands knew what we were doing. We had their permission to burn incense to the Queen Goddess and to pour out drink offerings to her. Our husbands knew we were making cakes that looked like her and were pouring out drink offerings to her.”
JER.44.20	Then Jeremiah spoke to all the people—men and women—who answered him. 
JER.44.21	He said to them, “The L
JER.44.22	Then he could not be patient with you any longer. He hated the terrible things you did. So he made your country an empty desert, where no one lives. Other people curse that country. And so it is today. 
JER.44.23	All this happened because you burned incense to other gods. You sinned against the L
JER.44.24	Then Jeremiah said to all those men and women, “People of Judah who are now in Egypt, hear the word of the L
JER.44.25	The L
JER.44.26	But hear the word of the L
JER.44.27	I am watching over them, not to take care of them, but to hurt them. The Jews who live in Egypt will die from swords or hunger until they are all destroyed. 
JER.44.28	A few will escape being killed by the sword and will come back to Judah from Egypt. Then, of the people of Judah who came to live in Egypt, those who are left alive will know if my word or their word came true. 
JER.44.29	I will give you a sign that I will punish you here in Egypt,’ says the L
JER.44.30	This is what the L
JER.45.1	It was the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah. Jeremiah the prophet told these things to Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote them on a scroll: 
JER.45.2	“This is what the L
JER.45.3	You have said, ‘How terrible it is for me! The L

JER.46.2	This message is to Egypt. It is about the army of Neco king of Egypt, which was defeated at the city of Carchemish on the Euphrates River by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. This was in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah. This is the

JER.46.8	Egypt rises up like the Nile River,

JER.49.16	You live in the hollow places of the cliff
JER.49.16	and control the high places of the hills.

JER.49.28	This message is to the tribe of Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon defeated. This is what the L
JER.49.28	“Go and attack the people of Kedar,

JER.49.37	until I have killed them all.
JER.49.38	I will set up my throne in Elam to show that I am king,

JER.49.39	“But I will make good things happen to Elam again
JER.49.39	in the future,” says the L
JER.50.1	This is the message the L
JER.50.2	“Announce this to the nations.
JER.50.2	Lift up a banner and tell them.
JER.50.2	Speak the whole message and say:
JER.50.2	‘Babylon will be captured.
JER.50.2	The god Bel will be put to shame,
JER.50.2	and the god Marduk will be afraid.
JER.50.2	Babylon’s gods will be put to shame,
JER.50.2	and her idols will be afraid!’
JER.50.3	A nation from the north will attack Babylon
JER.50.3	and make it like an empty desert.
JER.50.3	No one will live there;
JER.50.3	both people and animals will run away.”
JER.50.4	The L
JER.50.4	the people of Israel and Judah will come together.
JER.50.4	They will cry and look for the L
JER.50.5	Those people will ask how to go to Jerusalem
JER.50.5	and will start in that direction.
JER.50.5	They will come and join themselves to the L
JER.50.5	They will make an agreement with him that will last forever,
JER.50.5	an agreement that will never be forgotten.
JER.50.6	“My people have been like lost sheep.
JER.50.6	Their leaders have led them in the wrong way
JER.50.6	and made them wander around in the mountains and hills.
JER.50.6	They forgot where their resting place was.
JER.50.7	Whoever saw my people hurt them.
JER.50.7	And those enemies said, ‘We did nothing wrong.
JER.50.7	Those people sinned against the L
JER.50.7	the God their fathers trusted.’
JER.50.8	“Run away from Babylon,
JER.50.8	and leave the land of the Babylonians.
JER.50.8	Be like the goats that lead the flock.
JER.50.9	I will soon bring against Babylon
JER.50.9	many great nations from the north.
JER.50.9	They will take their places for war against it,
JER.50.9	and it will be captured by people from the north.
JER.50.9	Their arrows are like trained soldiers
JER.50.9	who do not return from war with empty hands.
JER.50.10	The enemy will take all the wealth from the Babylonians.
JER.50.10	Those enemy soldiers will get all they want,” says the L
JER.50.11	“Babylon, you are excited and happy,
JER.50.11	because you took my land.
JER.50.11	You dance around like a young cow in the grain.
JER.50.11	Your laughter is like the neighing of male horses.
JER.50.12	Your mother will be very ashamed;
JER.50.12	the woman who gave birth to you will be disgraced.
JER.50.12	Soon Babylonia will be the least important of all the nations.
JER.50.12	She will be an empty, dry desert.
JER.50.13	Because of the

JER.50.13	She will be completely empty.
JER.50.13	Everyone who passes by Babylon will be shocked.
JER.50.13	They will shake their heads when they see all her injuries.
JER.50.14	“Take your positions for war against Babylon,
JER.50.14	all you soldiers with bows.
JER.50.14	Shoot your arrows at Babylon! Do not save any of them,
JER.50.14	because Babylon has sinned against the L
JER.50.15	Soldiers around Babylon, shout the war cry!
JER.50.15	Babylon has surrendered, her towers have fallen,
JER.50.15	and her walls have been torn down.
JER.50.15	The L
JER.50.15	You nations should give her what she deserves;
JER.50.15	do to her what she has done to others.
JER.50.16	Don’t let the people from Babylon plant their crops
JER.50.16	or gather the harvest.
JER.50.16	The soldiers treated their captives cruelly.
JER.50.16	Now, let everyone go back home.
JER.50.16	Let everyone run to his own country.
JER.50.17	“The people of Israel are like a flock of sheep that are scattered
JER.50.17	from being chased by lions.
JER.50.17	The first lion to eat them up
JER.50.17	was the king of Assyria.
JER.50.17	The last lion to crush their bones
JER.50.17	was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.”
JER.50.18	So this is what the L
JER.50.18	“I will punish the king of Babylon and his country
JER.50.18	as I punished the king of Assyria.
JER.50.19	But I will bring the people of Israel back to their own pasture.
JER.50.19	They will eat on Mount Carmel and in Bashan.
JER.50.19	They will eat and be full

JER.50.20	The L
JER.50.20	“At that time people will try to find Israel’s guilt,
JER.50.20	but there will be no guilt.
JER.50.20	People will try to find Judah’s sins,
JER.50.20	but no sins will be found,
JER.50.20	because I will leave a few people alive from Israel and Judah,
JER.50.20	and I will forgive their sins.
JER.50.21	“Attack the land of Merathaim.
JER.50.21	Attack the people who live in Pekod.

JER.50.22	“The noise of battle can be heard all over the country;
JER.50.22	it is the noise of much destruction.
JER.50.23	Babylon was the hammer of the whole earth,
JER.50.23	but how broken and shattered that hammer is now.
JER.50.23	It is truly the most ruined
JER.50.23	of all the nations.
JER.50.24	Babylon, I set a trap for you,

JER.50.26	Come against Babylon from far away.
JER.50.26	Break open her storehouses of grain.
JER.50.26	Pile up her dead bodies like heaps of grain.
JER.50.26	Completely destroy Babylon
JER.50.26	and do not leave anyone alive.
JER.50.27	Kill all the young men in Babylon;
JER.50.27	let them be killed like animals.
JER.50.27	How terrible it will be for them, because the time has come for their defeat;
JER.50.27	it is time for them to be punished.
JER.50.28	Listen to the people running to escape the country of Babylon!
JER.50.28	They are telling Jerusalem
JER.50.28	how the L
JER.50.28	for destroying his Temple.
JER.50.29	“Call for the archers
JER.50.29	to come against Babylon.
JER.50.29	Tell them to surround the city,
JER.50.29	and let no one escape.
JER.50.29	Pay her back for what she has done;
JER.50.29	do to her what she has done to other nations.
JER.50.29	Babylon acted with pride against the L
JER.50.29	the Holy One of Israel.
JER.50.30	So her young men will be killed in her streets.
JER.50.30	All her soldiers will die on that day,” says the L
JER.50.31	“Babylon, you are too proud, and I am against you,”
JER.50.31	says the Lord 
JER.50.31	“The time has come
JER.50.31	for you to be punished.
JER.50.32	Proud Babylon will stumble and fall,
JER.50.32	and no one will help her get up.
JER.50.32	I will start a fire in her towns,
JER.50.32	and it will burn up everything around her.”
JER.50.33	This is what the L
JER.50.33	“The people of Israel
JER.50.33	and Judah are slaves.
JER.50.33	The enemy took them as prisoners
JER.50.33	and won’t let them go.

JER.50.34	His name is the L
JER.50.34	He will surely defend them with power
JER.50.34	so he can give rest to their land.
JER.50.34	But he will not give rest to those living in Babylon.”
JER.50.35	The L
JER.50.35	“Let a sword kill the people living in Babylon
JER.50.35	and her officers and wise men!
JER.50.36	Let a sword kill her false prophets,
JER.50.36	and they will become fools.
JER.50.36	Let a sword kill her warriors,
JER.50.36	and they will be full of terror.
JER.50.37	Let a sword kill her horses and chariots
JER.50.37	and all the soldiers hired from other countries!
JER.50.37	Then they will be like frightened women.
JER.50.37	Let a sword attack her treasures,
JER.50.37	so they will be taken away.
JER.50.38	Let a sword attack her waters
JER.50.38	so they will be dried up.
JER.50.38	She is a land of idols,

JER.50.39	She will never be filled with people again.
JER.50.40	God completely destroyed the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah
JER.50.40	and the towns around them,” says the L
JER.50.40	“In the same way no people will live in Babylon,
JER.50.40	and no human being will stay there.
JER.50.41	“Look! An army is coming from the north.
JER.50.41	A powerful nation and many kings
JER.50.41	are coming together from all around the world.
JER.50.42	Their armies have bows and spears.
JER.50.42	The soldiers are cruel and have no mercy.
JER.50.42	As the soldiers come riding on their horses,
JER.50.42	the sound is loud like the roaring sea.
JER.50.42	They stand in their places, ready for battle.
JER.50.42	They are ready to attack you, city of Babylon.
JER.50.43	The king of Babylon heard about those armies,
JER.50.43	and he became helpless with fear.
JER.50.43	Distress has gripped him.
JER.50.43	His pain is like that of a woman giving birth to a baby.
JER.50.44	“Like a lion coming up from the thick bushes near the Jordan River
JER.50.44	to attack a strong pen for sheep,
JER.50.44	I will suddenly chase the people of Babylon from their land.
JER.50.44	Who is the one I have chosen to do this?
JER.50.44	There is no one like me,
JER.50.44	no one who can take me to court.
JER.50.44	None of their leaders can stand up against me.”
JER.50.45	So listen to what the L
JER.50.45	Listen to what he has decided to do to the people in the city of Babylon.
JER.50.45	He will surely drag away the young ones of Babylon.
JER.50.45	Their hometowns will surely be shocked at what happens to them.
JER.50.46	At the sound of Babylon’s capture, the earth will shake.
JER.50.46	People in all nations will hear Babylon’s cry of distress.
JER.51.1	This is what the L
JER.51.1	“I will soon cause a destroying wind to blow
JER.51.1	against Babylon and the Babylonian people.
JER.51.2	I will send foreign people to destroy Babylon
JER.51.2	like a wind that blows chaff away.

JER.51.59	This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet gave to the officer Seraiah son of Neriah, who was the son of Mahseiah. Seraiah went to Babylon with Zedekiah king of Judah in the fourth year Zedekiah was king of Judah. His duty was to arrange the king’s food and housing on the trip. 
JER.51.60	Jeremiah had written on a scroll all the terrible things that would happen to Babylon, all these words about Babylon. 
JER.51.61	Jeremiah said to Seraiah, “As soon as you come to Babylon, be sure to read this message so all the people can hear you. 
JER.51.62	Then say, ‘L
JER.51.63	After you finish reading this scroll, tie a stone to it and throw it into the Euphrates River. 
JER.51.64	Then say, ‘In the same way Babylon will sink and will not rise again because of the terrible things I will make happen here. Her people will fall.’ ”
JER.51.64	The words of Jeremiah end here.
JER.52.1	Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he was king in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother’s name was Hamutal daughter of Jeremiah, and she was from Libnah. 
JER.52.2	Zedekiah did what the 
JER.52.3	All this happened in Jerusalem and Judah because the L
JER.52.3	Zedekiah turned against the king of Babylon. 
JER.52.4	Then Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon marched against Jerusalem with his whole army. They made a camp around the city and built devices all around the city walls to attack it. This happened on Zedekiah’s ninth year, tenth month, and tenth day as king. 
JER.52.5	And the city was under attack until Zedekiah’s eleventh year as king.
JER.52.6	By the ninth day of the fourth month, the hunger was terrible in the city; there was no food for the people to eat. 
JER.52.7	Then the city wall was broken through, and the whole army of Judah ran away at night. They left the city through the gate between the two walls by the king’s garden. Even though the Babylonians were surrounding the city, Zedekiah and his men headed toward the Jordan Valley.
JER.52.8	But the Babylonian army chased King Zedekiah and caught him in the plains of Jericho. All of his army was scattered from him. 
JER.52.9	So the Babylonians captured Zedekiah and took him to the king of Babylon at the town of Riblah in the land of Hamath. There he passed sentence on Zedekiah. 
JER.52.10	At Riblah the king of Babylon killed Zedekiah’s sons as he watched. The king also killed all the officers of Judah. 
JER.52.11	Then he put out Zedekiah’s eyes, and put bronze chains on him, and took him to Babylon. And the king kept Zedekiah in prison there until the day he died.
JER.52.12	Nebuzaradan, commander of the king’s special guards and servant of the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem on the tenth day of the fifth month. This was in Nebuchadnezzar’s nineteenth year as king of Babylon. 
JER.52.13	Nebuzaradan set fire to the Temple of the L
JER.52.14	The whole Babylonian army, led by the commander of the king’s special guards, broke down all the walls around Jerusalem. 
JER.52.15	Nebuzaradan, the commander of the king’s special guards, took captive some of the poorest people, those who were left in Jerusalem, those who had surrendered to the king of Babylon, and the skilled craftsmen who were left in Jerusalem. 
JER.52.16	But Nebuzaradan left behind some of the poorest people of the land to take care of the vineyards and fields.
JER.52.17	The Babylonians broke into pieces the bronze pillars, the bronze stands, and the large bronze bowl, called the Sea, which were in the Temple of the L
JER.52.18	They also took the pots, shovels, wick trimmers, bowls, dishes, and all the bronze objects used to serve in the Temple. 
JER.52.19	The commander of the king’s special guards took away bowls, pans for carrying hot coals, large bowls, pots, lampstands, pans, and bowls used for drink offerings. He took everything that was made of pure gold or silver.
JER.52.20	There was so much bronze that it could not be weighed: two pillars, the large bronze bowl called the Sea with the twelve bronze bulls under it, and the movable stands, which King Solomon had made for the Temple of the L
JER.52.21	Each of the pillars was about twenty-seven feet high, eighteen feet around, and hollow inside. The wall of each pillar was three inches thick. 
JER.52.22	The bronze capital on top of the one pillar was about seven and one-half feet high. It was decorated with a net design and bronze pomegranates all around it. The other pillar also had pomegranates and was like the first pillar. 
JER.52.23	There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides of the pillars. There was a total of a hundred pomegranates above the net design.
JER.52.24	The commander of the king’s special guards took as prisoners Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three doorkeepers. 
JER.52.25	He also took from the city the officer in charge of the soldiers, seven people who advised the king, the royal secretary who selected people for the army, and sixty other men from Judah who were in the city when it fell. 
JER.52.26	Nebuzaradan, the commander, took these people and brought them to the king of Babylon at the town of Riblah. 
JER.52.27	There at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king had them killed.
JER.52.27	So the people of Judah were led away from their country as captives. 
JER.52.28	This is the number of the people Nebuchadnezzar took away as captives: in the seventh year, 3,023 Jews; 
JER.52.29	in Nebuchadnezzar’s eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem; 
JER.52.30	in Nebuchadnezzar’s twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan, commander of the king’s special guards, took 745 Jews as captives.
JER.52.30	In all 4,600 people were taken captive.
JER.52.31	Jehoiachin king of Judah was in prison in Babylon for thirty-seven years. The year Evil-Merodach became king of Babylon he let Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison. He set Jehoiachin free on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month. 
JER.52.32	Evil-Merodach spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a seat of honor above the seats of the other kings who were with him in Babylon. 
JER.52.33	So Jehoiachin put away his prison clothes, and for the rest of his life, he ate at the king’s table. 
JER.52.34	Every day the king of Babylon gave Jehoiachin an allowance. This lasted as long as he lived, until the day Jehoiachin died.
LAM.1.1	Jerusalem once was full of people,

LAM.1.1	Jerusalem once was a great city among the nations,

LAM.1.1	She was like a queen of all the other cities,

LAM.1.2	She cries loudly at night,

LAM.1.2	There is no one to comfort her;
LAM.1.2	all who loved her are gone.
LAM.1.2	All her friends have turned against her
LAM.1.2	and are now her enemies.
LAM.1.3	Judah has gone into captivity
LAM.1.3	where she suffers and works hard.
LAM.1.3	She lives among other nations,

LAM.1.3	Those who chased her caught her
LAM.1.3	when she was in trouble.
LAM.1.4	The roads to Jerusalem are sad,
LAM.1.4	because no one comes for the feasts.
LAM.1.4	No one passes through her gates.
LAM.1.4	Her priests groan,
LAM.1.4	her young women are suffering,

LAM.1.6	Her rulers are like deer
LAM.1.6	that cannot find food.
LAM.1.6	They are weak
LAM.1.6	and run from the hunters.
LAM.1.7	Jerusalem is suffering and homeless.
LAM.1.7	She remembers all the good things
LAM.1.7	from the past.
LAM.1.7	But her people were defeated by the enemy,

LAM.1.7	When her enemies saw her,
LAM.1.7	they laughed to see her ruined.
LAM.1.8	Jerusalem sinned terribly,
LAM.1.8	so she has become unclean.
LAM.1.8	Those who honored her now hate her,
LAM.1.8	because they have seen her nakedness.
LAM.1.8	She groans
LAM.1.8	and turns away.
LAM.1.9	She made herself dirty by her sins
LAM.1.9	and did not think about what would happen to her.
LAM.1.9	Her defeat was surprising,
LAM.1.9	and no one could comfort her.
LAM.1.9	She says, “L

LAM.1.11	so they can stay alive.

LAM.1.15	all my mighty men inside my walls.

LAM.2.1	Look how the Lord in his anger
LAM.2.1	has brought Jerusalem to shame.
LAM.2.1	He has thrown down the greatness of Israel
LAM.2.1	from the sky to the earth;
LAM.2.1	he did not remember the Temple, his footstool,
LAM.2.1	on the day of his anger.
LAM.2.2	The Lord swallowed up without mercy
LAM.2.2	all the houses of the people of Jacob;

LAM.2.2	the strong places of Judah.
LAM.2.2	He threw her kingdom and its rulers
LAM.2.2	down to the ground in dishonor.
LAM.2.3	In his anger he has removed
LAM.2.3	all the strength of Israel;
LAM.2.3	he took away his power from Israel
LAM.2.3	when the enemy came.
LAM.2.3	He burned against the people of Jacob like a flaming fire
LAM.2.3	that burns up everything around it.
LAM.2.4	Like an enemy, he prepared to shoot his bow,
LAM.2.4	and his hand was against us.
LAM.2.4	Like an enemy, he killed
LAM.2.4	all the good-looking people;
LAM.2.4	he poured out his anger like fire
LAM.2.4	on the tents of Jerusalem.
LAM.2.5	The Lord was like an enemy;
LAM.2.5	he swallowed up Israel.
LAM.2.5	He swallowed up all her palaces
LAM.2.5	and destroyed all her strongholds.
LAM.2.5	He has caused more moaning and groaning

LAM.2.6	He cut down his Temple like a garden;

LAM.3.10	like a lion in hiding.
LAM.3.11	He led me the wrong way and let me stray
LAM.3.11	and left me without help.
LAM.3.12	He prepared to shoot his bow
LAM.3.12	and made me the target for his arrows.
LAM.3.13	He shot me in the kidneys

LAM.3.30	he should be filled with shame.
LAM.3.31	The Lord will not reject
LAM.3.31	his people forever.
LAM.3.32	Although he brings sorrow,
LAM.3.32	he also has mercy and great love.
LAM.3.33	He does not like to punish people
LAM.3.33	or make them sad.
LAM.3.34	He sees if any prisoner of the earth
LAM.3.34	is crushed under his feet;
LAM.3.35	he sees if someone is treated unfairly
LAM.3.35	before the Most High God;
LAM.3.36	the Lord sees
LAM.3.36	if someone is cheated in his case in court.
LAM.3.37	Nobody can speak and have it happen
LAM.3.37	unless the Lord commands it.
LAM.3.38	Both bad and good things
LAM.3.38	come by the command of the Most High God.
LAM.3.39	No one should complain

LAM.3.47	We have been frightened and fearful,

LAM.3.48	Streams of tears flow from my eyes,

LAM.3.49	My tears flow continually,
LAM.3.49	without stopping,

LAM.3.51	what has happened to all the women of my city.
LAM.3.52	Those who are my enemies for no reason
LAM.3.52	hunted me like a bird.
LAM.3.53	They tried to kill me in a pit;
LAM.3.53	they threw stones at me.
LAM.3.54	Water came up over my head,
LAM.3.54	and I said, “I am going to die.”
LAM.3.55	I called out to you, L
LAM.3.55	from the bottom of the pit.
LAM.3.56	You heard me calling, “Do not close your ears
LAM.3.56	and ignore my gasps and shouts.”
LAM.3.57	You came near when I called to you;
LAM.3.57	you said, “Don’t be afraid.”
LAM.3.58	Lord, you have taken my case
LAM.3.58	and given me back my life.
LAM.3.59	L
LAM.3.59	Now judge my case for me.
LAM.3.60	You have seen how my enemies took revenge on me
LAM.3.60	and made evil plans against me.
LAM.3.61	L
LAM.3.61	and all their evil plans against me.
LAM.3.62	The words and thoughts of my enemies
LAM.3.62	are against me all the time.
LAM.3.63	Look! In everything they do
LAM.3.63	they make fun of me with songs.
LAM.3.64	Pay them back, L
LAM.3.64	for what they have done.
LAM.3.65	Make them stubborn,

LAM.4.1	See how the gold has lost its shine,
LAM.4.1	how the pure gold has dulled!
LAM.4.1	The stones of the Temple are scattered
LAM.4.1	at every street corner.
LAM.4.2	The precious people of Jerusalem
LAM.4.2	were more valuable than gold,
LAM.4.2	but now they are thought of as clay jars
LAM.4.2	made by the hands of a potter.
LAM.4.3	Even wild dogs give their milk
LAM.4.3	to feed their young,
LAM.4.3	but my people are cruel
LAM.4.3	like ostriches in the desert.
LAM.4.4	The babies are so thirsty
LAM.4.4	their tongues stick to the roofs of their mouths.
LAM.4.4	Children beg for bread,
LAM.4.4	but no one gives them any.
LAM.4.5	Those who once ate fine foods
LAM.4.5	are now starving in the streets.
LAM.4.5	People who grew up wearing nice clothes
LAM.4.5	now pick through trash piles.
LAM.4.6	My people have been punished
LAM.4.6	more than Sodom was.
LAM.4.6	Sodom was destroyed suddenly,
LAM.4.6	and no hands reached out to help her.
LAM.4.7	Our princes were purer than snow,
LAM.4.7	and whiter than milk.
LAM.4.7	Their bodies were redder than rubies;
LAM.4.7	they looked like sapphires.
LAM.4.8	But now they are blacker than coal,
LAM.4.8	and no one recognizes them in the streets.
LAM.4.8	Their skin hangs on their bones;
LAM.4.8	it is as dry as wood.
LAM.4.9	Those who were killed in the war were better off
LAM.4.9	than those killed by hunger.
LAM.4.9	They starve in pain and die,

LAM.4.11	He set fire to Jerusalem,
LAM.4.11	burning it down to the foundations.
LAM.4.12	Kings of the earth and people of the world
LAM.4.12	could not believe
LAM.4.12	that enemies and foes
LAM.4.12	could enter the gates of Jerusalem.
LAM.4.13	It happened because her prophets sinned
LAM.4.13	and her priests did evil.
LAM.4.13	They killed in the city
LAM.4.13	those who did what was right.
LAM.4.14	They wandered in the streets
LAM.4.14	as if they were blind.
LAM.4.14	They were dirty with blood,
LAM.4.14	so no one would touch their clothes.
LAM.4.15	“Go away! You are unclean,” people shouted at them.
LAM.4.15	“Get away! Get away! Don’t touch us!”
LAM.4.15	So they ran away and wandered.
LAM.4.15	Even the other nations said, “Don’t stay here.”

LAM.4.16	and did not look after them anymore.
LAM.4.16	No one respects the priests
LAM.4.16	or honors the elders.
LAM.4.17	Also, our eyes grew tired,
LAM.4.17	looking for help that never came.
LAM.4.17	We kept watch from our towers
LAM.4.17	for a nation to save us.
LAM.4.18	Our enemies hunted us,
LAM.4.18	so we could not even walk in the streets.
LAM.4.18	Our end is near. Our time is up.
LAM.4.18	Our end has come.
LAM.4.19	Those who chased us
LAM.4.19	were faster than eagles in the sky.
LAM.4.19	They ran us into the mountains
LAM.4.19	and ambushed us in the desert.
LAM.4.20	The L

LAM.4.21	you who live in the land of Uz.

LAM.4.22	Your punishment is complete, Jerusalem.

LAM.4.22	But the L
LAM.4.22	he will uncover your evil.
LAM.5.1	Remember, L
LAM.5.1	Look and see our disgrace.
LAM.5.2	Our land has been turned over to strangers;
LAM.5.2	our houses have been given to foreigners.
LAM.5.3	We are like orphans with no father;
LAM.5.3	our mothers are like widows.
LAM.5.4	We have to buy the water we drink;
LAM.5.4	we must pay for the firewood.
LAM.5.5	Those who chase after us want to catch us by the neck.
LAM.5.5	We are tired and find no rest.
LAM.5.6	We made an agreement with Egypt
LAM.5.6	and with Assyria to get enough food.
LAM.5.7	Our ancestors sinned against you, but they are gone;
LAM.5.7	now we suffer because of their sins.
LAM.5.8	Slaves have become our rulers,
LAM.5.8	and no one can save us from them.
LAM.5.9	We risk our lives to get our food;
LAM.5.9	we face death in the desert.
LAM.5.10	Our skin is hot like an oven;
LAM.5.10	we burn with starvation.
LAM.5.11	The enemy abused the women of Jerusalem
LAM.5.11	and the girls in the cities of Judah.
LAM.5.12	Princes were hung by the hands;
LAM.5.12	they did not respect our elders.
LAM.5.13	The young men ground grain at the mill,
LAM.5.13	and boys stumbled under loads of wood.
LAM.5.14	The elders no longer sit at the city gates;
LAM.5.14	the young men no longer sing.
LAM.5.15	We have no more joy in our hearts;
LAM.5.15	our dancing has turned to sadness.
LAM.5.16	The crown has fallen from our head.
LAM.5.16	How terrible it is because we sinned.
LAM.5.17	Because of this we are afraid,
LAM.5.17	and now our eyes are dim.
LAM.5.18	Mount Zion is empty,
LAM.5.18	and wild dogs wander around it.
LAM.5.19	But you rule forever, L
LAM.5.19	You will be King from now on.

LAM.5.20	Have you left us forever?

LAM.5.21	Make our days as they were before,
LAM.5.22	or have you completely rejected us?
LAM.5.22	Are you so angry with us?
EZK.1.1	It was the thirtieth year, on the fifth day of the fourth month of our captivity. I was by the Kebar River among the people who had been carried away as captives. The sky opened, and I saw visions of God.
EZK.1.2	It was the fifth day of the month of the fifth year that King Jehoiachin had been a prisoner. 
EZK.1.3	The L
EZK.1.4	When I looked, I saw a stormy wind coming from the north. There was a great cloud with a bright light around it and fire flashing out of it. Something that looked like glowing metal was in the center of the fire. 
EZK.1.5	Inside the cloud was what looked like four living creatures, who were shaped like humans, 
EZK.1.6	but each of them had four faces and four wings. 
EZK.1.7	Their legs were straight. Their feet were like a calf’s hoofs and sparkled like polished bronze. 
EZK.1.8	The living creatures had human hands under their wings on their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings, 
EZK.1.9	and their wings touched each other. The living creatures did not turn when they moved, but each went straight ahead.
EZK.1.10	Their faces looked like this: Each living creature had a human face and the face of a lion on the right side and the face of an ox on the left side. And each one also had the face of an eagle. 
EZK.1.11	That was what their faces looked like. Their wings were spread out above. Each had two wings that touched one of the other living creatures and two wings that covered its body. 
EZK.1.12	Each went straight ahead. Wherever the spirit would go, the living creatures would also go, without turning. 
EZK.1.13	The living creatures looked like burning coals of fire or like torches. Fire went back and forth among the living creatures. It was bright, and lightning flashed from it. 
EZK.1.14	The living creatures ran back and forth like bolts of lightning.
EZK.1.15	Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground by each of the living creatures with its four faces. 
EZK.1.16	The wheels and the way they were made were like this: They looked like sparkling chrysolite. All four of them looked the same, like one wheel crossways inside another wheel. 
EZK.1.17	When they moved, they went in any one of the four directions, without turning as they went. 
EZK.1.18	The rims of the wheels were high and frightening and were full of eyes all around.
EZK.1.19	When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them. When the living creatures were lifted up from the ground, the wheels also were lifted up. 
EZK.1.20	Wherever the spirit would go, the living creatures would go. And the wheels were lifted up beside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels. 
EZK.1.21	When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved. When the living creatures stopped, the wheels stopped. And when the living creatures were lifted from the ground, the wheels were lifted beside them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
EZK.1.22	Now, over the heads of the living creatures was something like a dome that sparkled like ice and was frightening. 
EZK.1.23	And under the dome the wings of the living creatures were stretched out straight toward one another. Each living creature also had two wings covering its body. 
EZK.1.24	I heard the sound of their wings, like the roaring sound of the sea, as they moved. It was like the voice of God Almighty, a roaring sound like a noisy army. When the living creatures stopped, they lowered their wings.
EZK.1.25	A voice came from above the dome over the heads of the living creatures. When the living creatures stopped, they lowered their wings. 
EZK.1.26	Now above the dome there was something that looked like a throne. It looked like a sapphire gem. And on the throne was a shape like a human. 
EZK.1.27	Then I noticed that from the waist up the shape looked like glowing metal with fire inside. From the waist down it looked like fire, and a bright light was all around. 
EZK.1.28	The surrounding glow looked like the rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day. It seemed to look like the glory of the L
EZK.2.1	He said to me, “Human, stand up on your feet so I may speak with you.” 
EZK.2.2	While he spoke to me, the Spirit entered me and put me on my feet. Then I heard the L
EZK.2.3	He said, “Human, I am sending you to the people of Israel. That nation has turned against me and broken away from me. They and their ancestors have sinned against me until this very day. 
EZK.2.4	I am sending you to people who are stubborn and who do not obey. You will say to them, ‘This is what the Lord G
EZK.2.5	They may listen, or they may not, since they are a people who have turned against me. But they will know that a prophet has been among them. 
EZK.2.6	You, human, don’t be afraid of the people or their words. Even though they may be like thorny branches and stickers all around you, and though you may feel like you live with poisonous insects, don’t be afraid. Don’t be afraid of their words or their looks, because they are a people who turn against me. 
EZK.2.7	But speak my words to them. They may listen, or they may not, because they turn against me. 
EZK.2.8	But you, human, listen to what I say to you. Don’t turn against me as those people do. Open your mouth and eat what I am giving you.”
EZK.2.9	Then I looked and saw a hand stretched out to me, and a scroll was in it. 
EZK.2.10	He opened the scroll in front of me. Funeral songs, sad writings, and words about troubles were written on the front and back.
EZK.3.1	Then the L
EZK.3.2	So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.
EZK.3.3	He said to me, “Human, eat this scroll which I am giving you, and fill your stomach with it.” Then I ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth.
EZK.3.4	Then he said to me, “Human, go to the people of Israel, and speak my words to them. 
EZK.3.5	You are not being sent to people whose speech you can’t understand, whose language is difficult. You are being sent to Israel. 
EZK.3.6	You are not being sent to many nations whose speech you can’t understand, whose language is difficult, whose words you cannot understand. If I had sent you to them, they would have listened to you. 
EZK.3.7	But the people of Israel will not be willing to listen to you, because they are not willing to listen to me. Yes, all the people of Israel are stubborn and will not obey. 
EZK.3.8	See, I now make you as stubborn and as hard as they are. 
EZK.3.9	I am making you as hard as a diamond, harder than stone. Don’t be afraid of them or be frightened by them, though they are a people who turn against me.”
EZK.3.10	Also, he said to me, “Human, believe all the words I will speak to you, and listen carefully to them. 
EZK.3.11	Then go to the captives, your own people, and say to them, ‘The Lord G
EZK.3.12	Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me, saying, “Praise the glory of the L
EZK.3.13	I heard the wings of the living creatures touching each other and the sound of the wheels by them. It was a loud rumbling sound. 
EZK.3.14	So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I was unhappy and angry, and I felt the great power of the L
EZK.3.15	I came to the captives from Judah, who lived by the Kebar River at Tel Abib. I sat there seven days where these people lived, feeling shocked.
EZK.3.16	After seven days the L
EZK.3.17	“Human, I now make you a watchman for Israel. Any time you hear a word from my mouth, warn them for me. 
EZK.3.18	When I say to the wicked, ‘You will surely die,’ you must warn them so they may live. If you don’t speak out to warn the wicked to stop their evil ways, they will die in their sin. But I will hold you responsible for their death. 
EZK.3.19	If you warn the wicked and they do not turn from their wickedness or their evil ways, they will die because of their sin. But you will have saved your life.
EZK.3.20	“Again, those who do right may turn away from doing good and do evil. If I make something bad happen to them, they will die. Because you have not warned them, they will die because of their sin, and the good they did will not be remembered. But I will hold you responsible for their deaths. 
EZK.3.21	But if you have warned those good people not to sin, and they do not sin, they will surely live, because they believed the warning. And you will have saved your life.”
EZK.3.22	Then I felt the power of the L
EZK.3.23	So I got up and went out to the plain. I saw the glory of the L
EZK.3.24	Then the Spirit entered me and made me stand on my feet. He spoke to me and said, “Go, shut yourself up in your house. 
EZK.3.25	As for you, human, the people will tie you up with ropes so that you will not be able to go out among them. 
EZK.3.26	Also, I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so you will be silent. You will not be able to argue with the people, even though they turn against me. 
EZK.3.27	But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth, and you will say to them, ‘The Lord G
EZK.4.1	“Now, human, get yourself a brick, put it in front of you, and draw a map of Jerusalem on it. 
EZK.4.2	Then surround it with an army. Build battle works against the city and a dirt road to the top of the city walls. Set up camps around it, and put heavy logs in place to break down the walls. 
EZK.4.3	Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up like an iron wall between you and the city. Turn your face toward the city as if to attack it and then attack. This is a sign to Israel.
EZK.4.4	“Then lie down on your left side, and take the guilt of Israel on yourself. Their guilt will be on you for the number of days you lie on your left side. 
EZK.4.5	I have given you the same number of days as the years of the people’s sin. So you will have the guilt of Israel’s sin on you for three hundred ninety days.
EZK.4.6	“After you have finished these three hundred ninety days, lie down a second time, on your right side. You will then have the guilt of Judah on you. I will give it to you for forty days, a day for each year of their sin. 
EZK.4.7	Then you will look toward Jerusalem, which is being attacked. With your arm bare, you will prophesy against Jerusalem. 
EZK.4.8	I will put ropes on you so you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your attack on Jerusalem.
EZK.4.9	“Take wheat, barley, beans, small peas, and millet seeds, and put them in one bowl, and make them into bread for yourself. You will eat it the three hundred ninety days you lie on your side. 
EZK.4.10	You will eat eight ounces of food every day at set times. 
EZK.4.11	You will drink about two-thirds of a quart of water every day at set times. 
EZK.4.12	Eat your food as you would eat a barley cake, baking it over human dung where the people can see.” 
EZK.4.13	Then the L
EZK.4.14	But I said, “No, Lord G
EZK.4.15	“Very well,” he said. “Then I will give you cow’s dung instead of human dung to use for your fire to bake your bread.”
EZK.4.16	He also said to me, “Human, I am going to cut off the supply of bread to Jerusalem. They will eat the bread that is measured out to them, and they will worry as they eat. They will drink water that is measured out to them, and they will be in shock as they drink it. 
EZK.4.17	This is because bread and water will be hard to find. The people will be shocked at the sight of each other, and they will become weak because of their sin.
EZK.5.1	“Now, human, take a sharp sword, and use it like a barber’s razor to shave your head and beard. Then take scales and weigh and divide the hair. 
EZK.5.2	Burn one-third with fire in the middle of the city when the days of the attack on Jerusalem are over. Then take one-third and cut it up with the knife all around the city. And scatter one-third to the wind. This is how I will chase them with a sword. 
EZK.5.3	Also take a few of these hairs and tie them in the folds of your clothes. 
EZK.5.4	Take a few more and throw them into the fire and burn them up. From there a fire will spread to all the people of Israel.
EZK.5.5	“This is what the Lord G
EZK.5.6	But she has refused to obey my laws and has been more evil than the nations. She has refused to obey my rules, even more than nations around her. The people of Jerusalem have rejected my laws and have not lived by my rules.
EZK.5.7	“So this is what the Lord G
EZK.5.8	“So this is what the Lord G
EZK.5.9	I will do things among you that I have not done before and that I will never do anything like again, because you do the things I hate. 
EZK.5.10	So parents among you will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will punish you and will scatter to the winds all who are left alive. 
EZK.5.11	So the Lord G
EZK.5.12	A third of you will die by disease or be destroyed by hunger inside your walls. A third will fall dead by the sword outside your walls. And a third I will scatter in every direction as I chase them with a sword. 
EZK.5.13	Then my anger will come to an end. I will use it up against them, and then I will be satisfied. Then they will know that I, the L
EZK.5.14	“I will make you a ruin and a shame among the nations around you, to be seen by all who pass by. 
EZK.5.15	Then the nations around you will shame you and make fun of you. You will be a warning and a terror to them. This will happen when I punish you in my great anger. I, the L
EZK.5.16	I will send a time of hunger to destroy you, and then I will make your hunger get even worse, and I will cut off your supply of food. 
EZK.5.17	I will send a time of hunger and wild animals against you, and they will kill your children. Disease and death will sweep through your people, and I will bring the sword against you to kill you. I, the L

EZK.6.3	Say, ‘Mountains of Israel, listen to the word of the Lord G
EZK.6.4	Your altars will be destroyed and your incense altars broken down. Your people will be killed in front of your idols. 
EZK.6.5	I will lay the dead bodies of the Israelites in front of their idols, and I will scatter your bones around your altars. 
EZK.6.6	In all the places you live, cities will become empty. The places of idol worship will be ruined; your altars will become lonely ruins. Your idols will be broken and brought to an end. Your incense altars will be cut down, and the things you made will be wiped out. 
EZK.6.7	Your people will be killed and fall among you. Then you will know that I am the L

EZK.6.9	Then those who have escaped will remember me, as they live among the nations where they have been taken as captives. They will remember how I was hurt because they were unfaithful to me and turned away from me and desired to worship their idols. They will hate themselves because of the evil things they did that I hate. 
EZK.6.10	Then they will know that I am the L

EZK.6.12	The person who is far away will die by disease. The one who is nearby will die in war. The person who is still alive and has escaped these will die from hunger. So I will carry out my anger on them. 
EZK.6.13	Their people will lie dead among their idols around the altars, on every high hill, on all the mountain tops, and under every green tree and leafy oak—all the places where they offered sweet-smelling incense to their idols. Then you will know that I am the L
EZK.6.14	I will use my power against them to make the land empty and wasted from the desert to Diblah, wherever they live. Then they will know that I am the L

EZK.7.2	“Human, the Lord G
EZK.7.3	Now the end has come for you, and I will send my anger against you. I will judge you for the way you have lived, and I will make you pay for all your actions that I hate. 
EZK.7.4	I will have no pity on you; I will not hold back punishment from you. Instead, I will make you pay for the way you have lived and for your actions that I hate. Then you will know that I am the L
EZK.7.5	“This is what the Lord G
EZK.7.6	The end has come! The end has come! It has stirred itself up against you! Look! It has come! 
EZK.7.7	Disaster has come for you who live in the land! The time has come; the day of confusion is near. There will be no happy shouting on the mountains. 
EZK.7.8	Soon I will pour out my anger against you; I will carry out my anger against you. I will judge you for the way you have lived and will make you pay for everything you have done that I hate. 
EZK.7.9	I will show no pity, and I will not hold back punishment. I will pay you back for the way you have lived and the things you have done that I hate. Then you will know that I am the L
EZK.7.10	“Look, the day is here. It has come. Disaster has come, violence has grown, and there is more pride than ever. 
EZK.7.11	Violence has grown into a weapon for punishing wickedness. None of the people will be left—none of that crowd, none of their wealth, and nothing of value. 
EZK.7.12	The time has come; the day has arrived. Don’t let the buyer be happy or the seller be sad, because my burning anger is against the whole crowd. 
EZK.7.13	Sellers will not return to the land they have sold as long as they live, because the vision against all that crowd will not be changed. Because of their sins, they will not save their lives. 
EZK.7.14	They have blown the trumpet, and everything is ready. But no one is going to the battle, because my anger is against all that crowd.
EZK.7.15	“The sword is outside, and disease and hunger are inside. Whoever is in the field will die by the sword. Hunger and disease will destroy those in the city. 
EZK.7.16	Those who are left alive and who escape will be on the mountains, moaning like doves of the valleys about their own sin. 
EZK.7.17	All hands will hang weakly with fear, and all knees will become weak as water. 
EZK.7.18	They will put on rough cloth to show how sad they are. They will tremble all over with fear. Their faces will show their shame, and all their heads will be shaved. 
EZK.7.19	The people will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be like trash. Their silver and gold will not save them from the L
EZK.7.20	They were proud of their beautiful jewelry and used it to make their idols and their evil statues, which I hate. So I will turn their wealth into trash. 
EZK.7.21	I will give it to foreigners as loot from war and to the most evil people in the world as treasure, and they will dishonor it. 
EZK.7.22	I will also turn away from the people of Israel, and they will dishonor my treasured place. Then robbers will enter and dishonor it.
EZK.7.23	“Make chains for captives, because the land is full of bloody crimes and the city is full of violence. 
EZK.7.24	So I will bring the worst of the nations to take over the people’s houses. I will also end the pride of the strong, and their holy places will be dishonored. 
EZK.7.25	When the people are suffering greatly, they will look for peace, but there will be none. 
EZK.7.26	Disaster will come on top of disaster, and rumor will be added to rumor. Then they will try to get a vision from a prophet; the teachings of God from the priest and the advice from the elders will be lost. 
EZK.7.27	The king will cry greatly, the prince will give up hope, and the hands of the people who own land will shake with fear. I will punish them for the way they have lived. The way they have judged others is the way I will judge them. Then they will know that I am the L
EZK.8.1	It was the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month of our captivity. I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah in front of me. There I felt the power of the Lord G
EZK.8.2	I looked and saw something that looked like a human. From the waist down it looked like fire, and from the waist up it looked like bright glowing metal. 
EZK.8.3	It stretched out the shape of a hand and caught me by the hair on my head. The Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the sky. He took me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance to the north gate of the inner courtyard of the Temple. In the courtyard was the idol that caused God to be jealous. 
EZK.8.4	I saw the glory of the God of Israel there, as I had seen on the plain.
EZK.8.5	Then he said to me, “Human, now look toward the north.” So I looked up toward the north, and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar was the idol that caused God to be jealous.
EZK.8.6	He said to me, “Human, do you see what they are doing? Do you see how many hateful things the people of Israel are doing here that drive me far away from my Temple? But you will see things more hateful than these.”
EZK.8.7	Then he brought me to the entry of the courtyard. When I looked, I saw a hole in the wall. 
EZK.8.8	He said to me, “Human, dig through the wall.” So I dug through the wall and saw an entrance.
EZK.8.9	Then he said to me, “Go in and see the hateful, evil things they are doing here.” 
EZK.8.10	So I entered and looked, and I saw every kind of crawling thing and hateful beast and all the idols of the people of Israel, carved on the wall all around. 
EZK.8.11	Standing in front of these carvings and idols were seventy of the elders of Israel and Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each man had his pan for burning incense in his hand, and a sweet-smelling cloud of incense was rising.
EZK.8.12	Then he said to me, “Human, have you seen what the elders of Israel are doing in the dark? Have you seen each man in the room of his own idol? They say, ‘The L
EZK.8.13	He also said to me, “You will see even more hateful things that they are doing.”
EZK.8.14	Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the Temple of the L
EZK.8.15	He said to me, “Do you see, human? You will see things even more hateful than these.”
EZK.8.16	Then he brought me into the inner courtyard of the Temple. There I saw about twenty-five men at the entrance to the Temple of the L
EZK.8.17	He said to me, “Do you see, human? Is it unimportant that the people of Judah are doing the hateful things they have done here? They have filled the land with violence and made me continually angry. Look, they are insulting me every way they can. 
EZK.8.18	So I will act in anger. I will have no pity, nor will I show mercy. Even if they shout in my ears, I won’t listen to them.”
EZK.9.1	Then he shouted with a loud voice in my ears, “You who are chosen to punish this city, come near with your weapon in your hand.” 
EZK.9.2	Then six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, each with his powerful weapon in his hand. Among them was a man dressed in linen with a writing case at his side. The men went in and stood by the bronze altar.
EZK.9.3	Then the glory of the God of Israel went up from above the creatures with wings, where it had been, to the place in the Temple where the door opened. He called to the man dressed in linen who had the writing case at his side. 
EZK.9.4	He said to the man, “Go through Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of the people who groan and cry about all the hateful things being done among them.”
EZK.9.5	As I listened, he said to the other men, “Go through the city behind the man dressed in linen and kill. Don’t pity anyone, and don’t show mercy. 
EZK.9.6	Kill and destroy old men, young men and women, little children, and older women, but don’t touch any who have the mark on them. Start at my Temple.” So they started with the elders who were in front of the Temple.
EZK.9.7	Then he said to the men, “Make the Temple unclean, and fill the courtyards with those who have been killed. Go out!” So the men went out and killed the people in the city. 
EZK.9.8	While the men were killing the people, I was left alone. I bowed facedown on the ground and I cried out, “Oh, Lord 
EZK.9.9	Then he said to me, “The sin of the people of Israel and Judah is very great. The land is filled with people who murder, and the city is full of people who are not fair. The people say, ‘The L
EZK.9.10	But I will have no pity, nor will I show mercy. I will bring their evil back on their heads.”
EZK.9.11	Then the man dressed in linen with the writing case at his side reported, “I have done just as you commanded me.”
EZK.10.1	Then I looked and saw in the dome above the heads of the living creatures something like a sapphire gem which looked like a throne. 
EZK.10.2	The L
EZK.10.2	As I watched, the man with linen clothes went in. 
EZK.10.3	Now the living creatures were standing on the south side of the Temple when the man went in. And a cloud filled the inner courtyard. 
EZK.10.4	Then the glory of the L
EZK.10.5	The sound of the wings of the living creatures was heard all the way to the outer courtyard. It was like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.
EZK.10.6	When the L
EZK.10.7	One living creature put out his hand to the fire that was among them, took some of the fire, and put it in the hands of the man dressed in linen. Then the man took the fire and went out.
EZK.10.8	Something that looked like a human hand could be seen under the wings of the living creatures. 
EZK.10.9	I saw the four wheels by the living creatures, one wheel by each living creature. The wheels looked like shining chrysolite. 
EZK.10.10	All four wheels looked alike: Each looked like a wheel crossways inside another wheel. 
EZK.10.11	When the wheels moved, they went in any of the directions that the four living creatures faced. The wheels did not turn about, and the living creatures did not turn their bodies as they went. 
EZK.10.12	All their bodies, their backs, their hands, their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes all over. Each of the four living creatures had a wheel. 
EZK.10.13	I heard the wheels being called “whirling wheels.” 
EZK.10.14	Each living creature had four faces. The first face was the face of a creature with wings. The second face was a human face, the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle.
EZK.10.15	Then the living creatures flew up. They were the same living creatures I had seen by the Kebar River. 
EZK.10.16	When the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them. When the living creatures lifted their wings to fly up from the ground, the wheels did not leave their place beside them. 
EZK.10.17	When the living creatures stopped, the wheels stopped. When the creatures went up, the wheels went up also, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.
EZK.10.18	Then the glory of the L
EZK.10.19	As I watched, the living creatures spread their wings and flew up from the ground, with the wheels beside them. They stood where the east gate of the Temple of the L
EZK.10.20	These were the living creatures I had seen under the God of Israel by the Kebar River. I knew they were called cherubim. 
EZK.10.21	Each one had four faces and four wings, and under their wings were things that looked like human hands. 
EZK.10.22	Their faces looked the same as the ones I had seen by the Kebar River. They each went straight ahead.
EZK.11.1	The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the front gate of the Temple of the L
EZK.11.2	Then the L
EZK.11.3	They say, ‘It is almost time for us to build houses. This city is like a cooking pot, and we are like the best meat.’ 
EZK.11.4	So prophesy against them, prophesy, human.”
EZK.11.5	Then the Spirit of the L

EZK.11.19	I will give them a desire to respect me completely, and I will put inside them a new way of thinking. I will take out the stubborn heart of stone from their bodies, and I will give them an obedient heart of flesh. 
EZK.11.20	Then they will live by my rules and obey my laws and keep them. They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
EZK.11.21	But those who want to serve their evil statues and hateful idols, I will pay back for their evil ways, says the Lord G
EZK.11.22	Then the living creatures lifted their wings with the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them. 
EZK.11.23	The glory of the L
EZK.11.24	The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the captives who had been taken from Judah to Babylonia. This happened in a vision given by the Spirit of God, and then the vision I had seen ended. 
EZK.11.25	And I told the captives from Judah all the things the L
EZK.12.1	Again the L
EZK.12.2	“Human, you are living among a people who refuse to obey. They have eyes to see, but they do not see, and they have ears to hear, but they do not hear, because they are a people who refuse to obey.
EZK.12.3	“So, human, pack your things as if you will be taken away captive, and walk away like a captive in the daytime with the people watching. Move from your place to another with the people watching. Maybe they will understand, even though they are a people who refuse to obey. 
EZK.12.4	During the day when the people are watching, bring out the things you would pack as captive. At evening, with the people watching, leave your place like those who are taken away as captives from their country. 
EZK.12.5	Dig a hole through the wall while they watch, and bring your things out through it. 
EZK.12.6	Lift them onto your shoulders with the people watching, and carry them out in the dark. Cover your face so you cannot see the ground, because I have made you a sign to the people of Israel.”
EZK.12.7	I did these things as I was commanded. In the daytime I brought what I had packed as if I were being taken away captive. Then in the evening I dug through the wall with my hands. I brought my things out in the dark and carried them on my shoulders as the people watched.
EZK.12.8	Then in the morning the L
EZK.12.9	“Human, didn’t Israel, who refuses to obey, ask you, ‘What are you doing?’
EZK.12.10	“Say to them, ‘This is what the Lord G
EZK.12.11	Say, ‘I am a sign to you.’
EZK.12.11	“The same things I have done will be done to the people in Jerusalem. They will be taken away from their country as captives. 
EZK.12.12	The king among them will put his things on his shoulder in the dark and will leave. The people will dig a hole through the wall to bring him out. He will cover his face so he cannot see the ground. 
EZK.12.13	But I will spread my net over him, and he will be caught in my trap. Then I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Babylonians. He will not see that land, but he will die there. 
EZK.12.14	All who are around the king—his helpers and all his army—I will scatter in every direction, and I will chase them with a sword.

EZK.18.2	and that caused the children to grind their teeth from the sour taste’?
EZK.18.3	“As surely as I live, says the Lord G
EZK.18.4	Every living thing belongs to me. The life of the parent is mine, and the life of the child is mine. The person who sins is the one who will die.
EZK.18.5	“Suppose a person is good and does what is fair and right. 
EZK.18.6	He does not eat at the mountain places of worship. He does not look to the idols of Israel for help. He does not have sexual relations with his neighbor’s wife or with a woman during her time of monthly bleeding. 
EZK.18.7	He does not mistreat anyone but returns what was given as a promise for a loan. He does not rob other people. He gives bread to the hungry and clothes to those who have none. 
EZK.18.8	He does not lend money to get too much interest or profit. He keeps his hand from doing wrong. He judges fairly between one person and another. 
EZK.18.9	He lives by my rules and obeys my laws faithfully. Whoever does these things is good and will surely live, says the Lord G

EZK.18.12	He mistreats the poor and needy. He steals and refuses to return what was promised for a loan. He looks to idols for help. He does things which I hate. 
EZK.18.13	He lends money for too much interest and profit. Will this son live? No, he will not live! He has done all these hateful things, so he will surely be put to death. He will be responsible for his own death.

EZK.18.17	He keeps his hand from doing wrong. He does not take too much interest or profit when he lends money. He obeys my laws and lives by my rules. He will not die for his father’s sin; he will surely live. 
EZK.18.18	But his father took other people’s money unfairly and robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people. So he will die for his own sin.
EZK.18.19	“But you ask, ‘Why is the son not punished for the father’s sin?’ The son has done what is fair and right. He obeys all my rules, so he will surely live. 
EZK.18.20	The person who sins is the one who will die. A child will not be punished for a parent’s sin, and a parent will not be punished for a child’s sin. Those who do right will enjoy the results of their own goodness; evil people will suffer the results of their own evil.

EZK.18.24	“But suppose good people stop doing good and do wrong and do the same hateful things the wicked do. Will they live? All their good acts will be forgotten, because they became unfaithful. They have sinned, so they will die because of their sins.

EZK.18.27	When the wicked stop being wicked and do what is fair and right, they will save their lives. 
EZK.18.28	Because they thought about it and stopped doing all the sins they had done, they will surely live; they will not die. 
EZK.18.29	But the people of Israel still say, ‘What the Lord does isn’t fair.’ People of Israel, I am fair. It is what you do that is not fair.

EZK.20.10	So I took them out of Egypt and brought them into the desert. 
EZK.20.11	I gave them my rules and told them about my laws, by which people will live if they obey them.

EZK.20.25	I also allowed them to follow rules that were not good and laws by which they could not live.

EZK.23.23	Men from Babylon and all Babylonia and men from Pekod, Shoa, and Koa will attack you. All the Assyrians will attack you: handsome young captains and lieutenants, all of them important men and all riding horses. 
EZK.23.24	Those men will attack with great armies and with their weapons, chariots, and wagons. They will surround you with large and small shields and with helmets. And I will give them the right to punish you, and they will give you their own kind of punishment. 
EZK.23.25	Then you will see how strong my anger can be when they punish you in their anger. They will cut off your noses and ears. They will take away your sons and daughters, and those who are left will be burned.

EZK.23.30	have brought this on you. You have had sexual relations with the nations and made yourselves unclean by worshiping their idols. 
EZK.23.31	You did the same things your sister did, so you will get the same punishment, like a bitter cup to drink.

EZK.23.34	You will drink everything in it,
EZK.23.34	and then you will smash it
EZK.23.34	and tear at your breasts.

EZK.23.38	They have also done this to me: They made my Temple unclean at the same time they dishonored my Sabbaths. 
EZK.23.39	They sacrificed their children to their idols. Then they entered my Temple at that very time to dishonor it. That is what they did inside my Temple!
EZK.23.40	“They even sent for men from far away, who came after a messenger was sent to them. The two sisters bathed themselves for them, painted their eyes, and put on jewelry. 
EZK.23.41	They sat on a fine bed with a table set before it, on which they put my incense and my oil.
EZK.23.42	“There was the noise of a reckless crowd in the city. Common people gathered, and drunkards were brought from the desert. They put bracelets on the wrists of the two sisters and beautiful crowns on their heads. 
EZK.23.43	Then I said about the one who was worn out by her acts of adultery, ‘Let them continue their sexual sins with her. She is nothing but a prostitute.’ 
EZK.23.44	They kept going to her as they would go to a prostitute. So they continued to go to Samaria and Jerusalem, these shameful women. 
EZK.23.45	But men who do right will punish them as they punish women who take part in adultery and who murder people, because they are guilty of adultery and murder.
EZK.23.46	“This is what the Lord 
EZK.23.47	Let the mob kill them by throwing stones at them, and let them cut them down with their swords. Let them kill their sons and daughters and burn their houses down.
EZK.23.48	“So I will put an end to sexual sins in the land. Then all women will be warned, and they will not do the sexual sins you have done.

EZK.38.13	Sheba, Dedan, and the traders of Tarshish, with all its villages, will say to you, “Did you come to capture treasure? Did you bring your troops together to take loot? Did you bring them to carry away silver and gold and to take away farm animals and property?” ’

EZK.40.2	In the visions of God he brought me to the land of Israel and put me down on a very high mountain. On the south of the mountain there were some buildings that looked like a city. 
EZK.40.3	He took me closer to the buildings, and I saw a man who looked as if he were made of bronze, standing in the gateway. He had a cord made of linen and a stick in his hand, both for measuring. 
EZK.40.4	The man said to me, “Human, look with your eyes and hear with your ears. Pay attention to all that I will show you, because that’s why you have been brought here. Tell the people of Israel all that you see.”
EZK.40.5	I saw a wall that surrounded the Temple area. The measuring stick in the man’s hand was ten and one-half feet long. So the man measured the wall, which was ten and one-half feet thick and ten and one-half feet high.
EZK.40.6	Then the man went to the east gateway. He went up its steps and measured the opening of the gateway. It was ten and one-half feet deep. 
EZK.40.7	The rooms for the guards were ten and one-half feet long and ten and one-half feet wide. The walls that came out between the guards’ rooms were about nine feet thick. The opening of the gateway next to the porch that faced the Temple was ten and one-half feet deep.
EZK.40.8	Then the man measured the porch of the gateway. 
EZK.40.9	It was about fourteen feet deep, and its side walls were three and one-half feet thick. The porch of the gateway faced the Temple.
EZK.40.10	On each side of the east gateway were three rooms, which measured the same on each side. The walls between each room were the same thickness. 
EZK.40.11	The man measured the width of the entrance to the gateway, which was seventeen and one-half feet wide. The width of the gate was about twenty-three feet. 
EZK.40.12	And there was a low wall about twenty-one inches high in front of each room. The rooms were ten and one-half feet on each side. 
EZK.40.13	The man measured the gateway from the roof of one room to the roof of the opposite room. It was about forty-four feet from one door to the opposite door. 
EZK.40.14	The man also measured the porch, which was about thirty-five feet wide. The courtyard was around the porch. 
EZK.40.15	From the front of the outer side of the gateway to the front of the porch of the inner side of the gateway was eighty-seven and one-half feet. 
EZK.40.16	The rooms and porch had small windows on both sides. The windows were narrower on the side facing the gateway. Carvings of palm trees were on each side wall of the rooms.
EZK.40.17	Then the man brought me into the outer courtyard where I saw rooms and a pavement of stones all around the court. Thirty rooms were along the edge of the paved walkway. 
EZK.40.18	The pavement ran alongside the gates and was as deep as the gates were wide. This was the lower pavement. 
EZK.40.19	Then the man measured from the outer wall to the inner wall. The outer court between these two walls was one hundred seventy-five feet on the east and on the north.
EZK.40.20	The man measured the length and width of the north gateway leading to the outer courtyard. 
EZK.40.21	Its three rooms on each side, its inner walls, and its porch measured the same as the first gateway. It was eighty-seven and one-half feet long and forty-four feet wide. 
EZK.40.22	Its windows, porch, and carvings of palm trees measured the same as the east gateway. Seven steps went up to the gateway, and the gateway’s porch was at the inner end. 
EZK.40.23	The inner courtyard had a gateway across from the northern gateway like the one on the east. The man measured it and found it was one hundred seventy-five feet from inner gateway to outer gateway.
EZK.40.24	Then the man led me south where I saw a gateway facing south. He measured its inner walls and its porch, and they measured the same as the other gateways. 
EZK.40.25	The gateway and its porch had windows all around like the other gateways. It was eighty-seven and one-half feet long and forty-four feet wide. 
EZK.40.26	Seven steps went up to this gateway. Its porch was at the inner end, and it had carvings of palm trees on its inner walls. 
EZK.40.27	The inner courtyard had a gateway on its south side. The man measured from gate to gate on the south side, which was one hundred seventy-five feet.
EZK.40.28	Then the man brought me through the south gateway into the inner courtyard. The inner south gateway measured the same as the gateways in the outer wall. 
EZK.40.29	The inner south gateway’s rooms, inner walls, and porch measured the same as the gateways in the outer wall. There were windows all around the gateway and its porch. The gateway was eighty-seven and one-half feet long and forty-four feet wide. 
EZK.40.30	Each porch of each inner gateway was about forty-four feet long and about nine feet wide. 
EZK.40.31	The inner south gateway’s porch faced the outer courtyard. Carvings of palm trees were on its side walls, and its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.32	The man brought me into the inner courtyard on the east side. He measured the inner east gateway, and it was the same as the other gateways. 
EZK.40.33	The inner east gateway’s rooms, inside walls, and porch measured the same as the other gateways. Windows were all around the gateway and its porch. The inner east gateway was eighty-seven and one-half feet long and forty-four feet wide. 
EZK.40.34	Its porch faced the outer courtyard. Carvings of palm trees were on its inner walls on each side, and its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.35	Then the man brought me to the inner north gateway. He measured it, and it was the same as the other gateways. 
EZK.40.36	Its rooms, inner walls, and porch measured the same as the other gateways. There were windows all around the gateway, which was eighty-seven and one-half feet long and forty-four feet wide. 
EZK.40.37	Its porch faced the outer courtyard. Carvings of palm trees were on its inner walls on each side, and its stairway had eight steps.
EZK.40.38	There was a room with a door that opened onto the porch of the inner north gateway. In this room the priests washed animals for the burnt offerings. 
EZK.40.39	There were two tables on each side of the porch, on which animals for burnt offerings, sin offerings, and penalty offerings were killed. 
EZK.40.40	Outside, by each side wall of the porch, at the entrance to the north gateway, were two more tables. 
EZK.40.41	So there were four tables inside the gateway, and four tables outside. In all there were eight tables on which the priests killed animals for sacrifices. 
EZK.40.42	There were four tables made of cut stone for the burnt offering. These tables were about three feet long, three feet wide, and about two feet high. On these tables the priests put their tools which they used to kill animals for burnt offerings and the other sacrifices. 
EZK.40.43	Double shelves three inches wide were put up on all the walls. The flesh for the offering was put on the tables.
EZK.40.44	There were two rooms in the inner courtyard. One was beside the north gateway and faced south. The other room was beside the south gateway and faced north. 
EZK.40.45	The man said to me, “The room which faces south is for the priests who serve in the Temple area, 
EZK.40.46	while the room that faces north is for the priests who serve at the altar. This second group of priests are descendants of Zadok, the only descendants of Levi who can come near the L
EZK.40.47	The man measured the inner courtyard. It was a square—one hundred seventy-five feet long and one hundred seventy-five feet wide. The altar was in front of the Temple.
EZK.40.48	The man brought me to the porch of the Temple and measured each side wall of the porch. Each was about nine feet thick. The doorway was twenty-four and one-half feet wide. The side walls of the doorway were each about five feet wide. 
EZK.40.49	The porch was thirty-five feet long and twenty-one feet wide, with ten steps leading up to it. Pillars were by the side walls, one on each side of the entrance.
EZK.41.1	The man brought me to the Holy Place and measured its side walls, which were each ten and one-half feet thick. 
EZK.41.2	The entrance was seventeen and one-half feet wide. The walls alongside the entrance were each about nine feet wide. The man measured the Holy Place, which was seventy feet long and thirty-five feet wide.
EZK.41.3	Then the man went inside and measured the side walls of the next doorway. Each was three and one-half feet thick. The doorway was ten and one-half feet wide, and the walls next to it were each more than twelve feet thick. 
EZK.41.4	Then the man measured the room at the end of the Holy Place. It was thirty-five feet long and thirty-five feet wide. The man said to me, “This is the Most Holy Place.”
EZK.41.5	Then the man measured the wall of the Temple, which was ten and one-half feet thick. There were side rooms seven feet wide all around the Temple. 
EZK.41.6	The side rooms were on three different stories, each above the other, with thirty rooms on each story. All around the Temple walls there were ledges for the side rooms. The upper rooms rested on the ledges but were not attached to the Temple walls. 
EZK.41.7	The side rooms around the Temple were wider on each higher story, so rooms were wider on the top story. A stairway went up from the lowest story to the highest through the middle story.
EZK.41.8	I also saw that the Temple had a raised base all around. Its edge was the foundation for the side rooms, and it was ten and one-half feet thick. 
EZK.41.9	The outer wall of the side rooms was about nine feet thick. There was an open area between the side rooms of the Temple 
EZK.41.10	and some other rooms. It was thirty-five feet wide and went all around the Temple. 
EZK.41.11	The side rooms had doors which led to the open area around the outside of the Temple. One door faced north, and the other faced south. The open area was about nine feet wide all around.
EZK.41.12	The building facing the private area at the west side was one hundred twenty-two and one-half feet wide. The wall around the building was about nine feet thick and one hundred fifty-seven and one-half feet long.
EZK.41.13	Then the man measured the Temple. It was one hundred seventy-five feet long. The private area, including the building and its walls, was in all one hundred seventy-five feet long. 
EZK.41.14	Also the front of the Temple and the private area on its east side were one hundred seventy-five feet wide.
EZK.41.15	The man measured the length of the building facing the private area on the west side, and it was one hundred seventy-five feet from one wall to the other.
EZK.41.15	The Holy Place, the Most Holy Place, and the outer porch 
EZK.41.16	had wood panels on the walls. By the doorway, the Temple had wood panels on the walls. The wood covered all the walls from the floor up to the windows, 
EZK.41.17	up to the part of the wall above the entrance.
EZK.41.17	All the walls inside the Most Holy Place and the Holy Place, and on the outside, in the porch, 
EZK.41.18	had carvings of creatures with wings and palm trees. A palm tree was between each carved creature, and every creature had two faces. 
EZK.41.19	One was a human face looking toward the palm tree on one side. The other was a lion’s face looking toward the palm tree on the other side. They were carved all around the Temple walls. 
EZK.41.20	From the floor to above the entrance, palm trees and creatures with wings were carved. The walls of the Holy Place 
EZK.41.21	had square doorposts. In front of the Most Holy Place was something that looked like 
EZK.41.22	an altar of wood. It was more than five feet high and three feet wide. Its corners, base, and sides were wood. The man said to me, “This is the table that is in the presence of the L
EZK.41.23	Both the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place had double doors. 
EZK.41.24	Each of the doors had two pieces that would swing open. 
EZK.41.25	Carved on the doors of the Holy Place were palm trees and creatures with wings, like those carved on the walls. And there was a wood roof over the front Temple porch. 
EZK.41.26	There were windows and palm trees on both side walls of the porch. The side rooms of the Temple were also covered by a roof over the stairway.
EZK.42.1	Then the man led me north out into the outer courtyard and to the rooms across from the private area and the building. 
EZK.42.2	These rooms on the north side were one hundred seventy-five feet long and eighty-seven and one-half feet wide. 
EZK.42.3	There was thirty-five feet of the inner courtyard between them and the Temple. On the other side, they faced the stone pavement of the outer courtyard. The rooms were built in three stories like steps and had balconies. 
EZK.42.4	There was a path on the north side of the rooms, which was seventeen and one-half feet wide and one hundred seventy-five feet long. Doors led into the rooms from this path. 
EZK.42.5	The top rooms were narrower, because the balconies took more space from them. The rooms on the first and second stories of the building were wider. 
EZK.42.6	The rooms were on three stories. They did not have pillars like the pillars of the courtyards. So the top rooms were farther back than those on the first and second stories. 
EZK.42.7	There was a wall outside parallel to the rooms and to the outer courtyard. It ran in front of the rooms for eighty-seven and one-half feet. 
EZK.42.8	The row of rooms along the outer courtyard was eighty-seven and one-half feet long, and the rooms that faced the Temple were about one hundred seventy-five feet long. 
EZK.42.9	The lower rooms had an entrance on the east side so a person could enter them from the outer courtyard, 
EZK.42.10	at the start of the wall beside the courtyard.
EZK.42.10	There were rooms on the south side, which were across from the private area and the building. 
EZK.42.11	These rooms had a path in front of them. They were like the rooms on the north with the same length and width and the same doors. 
EZK.42.12	The doors of the south rooms were like the doors of the north rooms. There was an entrance at the open end of a path beside the wall, so a person could enter at the east end.
EZK.42.13	The man said to me, “The north and south rooms across from the private area are holy rooms. There the priests who go near the L
EZK.42.14	The priests who enter the Holy Place must leave their serving clothes there before they go into the outer courtyard, because these clothes are holy. After they put on other clothes, they may go to the part of the Temple area which is for the people.”
EZK.42.15	When the man finished measuring inside the Temple area, he brought me out through the east gateway. He measured the area all around. 
EZK.42.16	The man measured the east side with the measuring stick; it was eight hundred seventy-five feet by the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.17	He measured the north side; it was eight hundred seventy-five feet by the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.18	He measured the south side; it was eight hundred seventy-five feet by the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.19	He went around to the west side; it measured eight hundred seventy-five feet by the measuring stick. 
EZK.42.20	So he measured the Temple area on all four sides. The Temple area had a wall all around it that was eight hundred seventy-five feet long and eight hundred seventy-five feet wide. It separated what was holy from that which was not holy.
EZK.43.1	Then the man led me to the outer east gateway, 
EZK.43.2	and I saw the glory of the God of Israel coming from the east. It sounded like the roar of rushing water, and its brightness made the earth shine. 
EZK.43.3	The vision I saw was like the vision I had seen when the L
EZK.43.4	The glory of the L
EZK.43.5	Then the Spirit picked me up and brought me into the inner courtyard. There I saw the 
EZK.43.6	As the man stood at my side, I heard someone speaking to me from inside the Temple. 
EZK.43.7	The voice from the Temple said to me, “Human, this is my throne and the place where my feet rest. I will live here among the Israelites forever. The people of Israel will not make my holy name unclean again. Neither the people nor their kings will make it unclean with their sexual sins or with the dead bodies of their kings. 
EZK.43.8	The kings made my name unclean by putting their doorway next to my doorway, and their doorpost next to my doorpost so only a wall separated me from them. When they did their acts that I hate, they made my holy name unclean, and so I destroyed them in my anger. 
EZK.43.9	Now let them stop their sexual sins and take the dead bodies of their kings far away from me. Then I will live among them forever.
EZK.43.10	“Human, tell the people of Israel about the Temple so they will be ashamed of their sins. Let them think about the plan of the Temple. 
EZK.43.11	If they are ashamed of all they have done, let them know the design of the Temple and how it is built. Show them its exits and entrances, all its designs, and also all its rules and teachings. Write the rules as they watch so they will obey all the teachings and rules about the Temple. 
EZK.43.12	This is the teaching about the Temple: All the area around the top of the mountain is most holy. This is the teaching about the Temple.
EZK.43.13	“These are the measurements of the altar, using the measuring stick. The altar’s gutter is twenty-one inches high and twenty-one inches wide, and its rim is about nine inches around its edge. And the altar is this tall: 
EZK.43.14	From the ground up to the lower ledge, it measures three and one-half feet. It is twenty-one inches wide. It measures seven feet from the smaller ledge to the larger ledge and is twenty-one inches wide. 
EZK.43.15	The place where the sacrifice is burned on the altar is seven feet high, with its four corners shaped like horns and reaching up above it. 
EZK.43.16	It is square, twenty-one feet long and twenty-one feet wide. 
EZK.43.17	The upper ledge is also square, twenty-four and one-half feet long and twenty-four and one-half feet wide. The rim around the altar is ten and one-half inches wide, and its gutter is twenty-one inches wide all around. Its steps are on the east side.”
EZK.43.18	Then the man said to me, “Human, this is what the Lord 
EZK.43.19	You must give a young bull as a sin offering to the priests, the Levites who are from the family of Zadok and who come near me to serve me, says the Lord 
EZK.43.20	Take some of the bull’s blood and put it on the four corners of the altar, on the four corners of the ledge, and all around the rim. This is how you will make the altar pure and ready for God’s service. 
EZK.43.21	Then take the bull for the sin offering and burn it in the proper place in the Temple area, outside the Temple building.
EZK.43.22	“On the second day offer a male goat that has nothing wrong with it for a sin offering. The priests will make the altar pure and ready for God’s service as they did with the young bull. 
EZK.43.23	When you finish making the altar pure and ready, offer a young bull and a male sheep from the flock, which have nothing wrong with them. 
EZK.43.24	You must offer them in the presence of the L
EZK.43.25	“You must prepare a goat every day for seven days as a sin offering. Also, the priests must prepare a young bull and male sheep from the flock, which have nothing wrong with them. 
EZK.43.26	For seven days the priests are to make the altar pure and ready for God’s service. Then they will give the altar to God. 
EZK.43.27	After these seven days, on the eighth day, the priests must offer your burnt offerings and your fellowship offerings on the altar. Then I will accept you, says the Lord 
EZK.44.1	Then the man brought me back to the outer east gateway of the Temple area, but the gate was shut. 
EZK.44.2	The L
EZK.44.3	Only the ruler himself may sit in the gateway to eat a meal in the presence of the L
EZK.44.4	Then the man brought me through the outer north gate to the front of the Temple. As I looked, I saw the glory of the L
EZK.44.5	The L
EZK.44.6	Then speak to those who refuse to obey. Say to the people of Israel, ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.44.7	You brought foreigners into my Holy Place who were not circumcised in the flesh and had not given themselves to serving me. You dishonored my Temple when you offered me food, fat, and blood. You broke my agreement by all the things you did that I hate. 
EZK.44.8	You did not take care of my holy things yourselves but put foreigners in charge of my Temple. 
EZK.44.9	This is what the Lord 
EZK.44.10	“ ‘But the Levites who stopped obeying me when Israel left me and who followed their idols must be punished for their sin. 
EZK.44.11	These Levites are to be servants in my Holy Place. They may guard the gates of the Temple and serve in the Temple area. They may kill the animals for the burnt offering and the sacrifices for the people. They may stand before the people to serve them. 
EZK.44.12	But these Levites helped the people worship their idols and caused the people of Israel to fall, so I make this promise: They will be punished for their sin, says the Lord 
EZK.44.13	They will not come near me to serve as priests, nor will they come near any of my holy things or the most holy offerings. But they will be made ashamed of the things they did that I hate. 
EZK.44.14	I will put them in charge of taking care of the Temple area, all the work that must be done in it.
EZK.44.15	“ ‘But the priests who are Levites and descendants of Zadok took care of my Holy Place when Israel left me, so they may come near to serve me. They may stand in my presence to offer me the fat and blood of the animals they sacrifice, says the Lord 
EZK.44.16	They are the only ones who may enter my Holy Place. Only they may come near my table to serve me and take care of the things I gave them to do.
EZK.44.17	“ ‘When they enter the gates of the inner courtyard, they must wear linen robes. They must not wear wool to serve at the gates of the inner courtyard or in the Temple. 
EZK.44.18	They will wear linen turbans on their heads and linen underclothes. They will not wear anything that makes them perspire. 
EZK.44.19	When they go out into the outer courtyard to the people, they must take off their serving clothes before they go. They must leave these clothes in the holy rooms and put on other clothes. Then they will not let their holy clothes hurt the people.
EZK.44.20	“ ‘They must not shave their heads or let their hair grow long but must keep the hair of their heads trimmed. 
EZK.44.21	None of the priests may drink wine when they enter the inner courtyard. 
EZK.44.22	The priests must not marry widows or divorced women. They may marry only virgins from the people of Israel or widows of priests. 
EZK.44.23	They must teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is not holy. They must help my people know what is unclean and what is clean.
EZK.44.24	“ ‘In court they will act as judges. When they judge, they will follow my teachings. They must obey my laws and my rules at all my special feasts and keep my Sabbaths holy.
EZK.44.25	“ ‘They must not go near a dead person, making themselves unclean. But they are allowed to make themselves unclean if the dead person is their father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or a sister who has not married. 
EZK.44.26	After a priest has been made clean again, he must wait seven days. 
EZK.44.27	Then he may go into the inner courtyard to serve in the Temple, but he must offer a sin offering for himself, says the Lord 
EZK.44.28	“ ‘These are the rules about the priests and their property: They will have me instead of property. You will not give them any land to own in Israel; I am what they will own. 
EZK.44.29	They will eat the grain offerings, sin offerings, and penalty offerings. Everything Israel gives to me will be theirs. 
EZK.44.30	The best fruits of all the first harvests and all the special gifts offered to me will belong to the priests. You will also give to the priests the first part of your grain that you grind and so bring a blessing on your family. 
EZK.44.31	The priests must not eat any bird or animal that died a natural death or one that has been torn by wild animals.
EZK.45.1	“ ‘When you divide the land for the Israelite tribes by throwing lots, you must give a part of the land to belong to the L
EZK.45.2	From this land, an area eight hundred seventy-five feet square will be for the Temple. There will be an open space around the Temple that is eighty-seven and one-half feet wide. 
EZK.45.3	In the holy area you will measure a part about seven miles long and three miles wide, and in it will be the Most Holy Place. 
EZK.45.4	This holy part of the land will be for the priests who serve in the Temple, who come near to the L
EZK.45.5	Another area about seven miles long and more than three miles wide will be for the Levites, who serve in the Temple area. It will belong to them so they will have cities in which to live.
EZK.45.6	“ ‘You must give the city an area that is about one and one-half miles wide and about seven miles long, along the side of the holy area. It will belong to all the people of Israel.
EZK.45.7	“ ‘The ruler will have land on both sides of the holy area and the city. On the west of the holy area, his land will reach to the Mediterranean Sea. On the east of the holy area, his land will reach to the eastern border. It will be as long as the land given to each tribe. 
EZK.45.8	Only this land will be the ruler’s property in Israel. So my rulers will not be cruel to my people anymore, but they will let each tribe in the nation of Israel have its share of the land.
EZK.45.9	“ ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.45.10	You must have honest scales, an honest dry measurement and an honest liquid measurement. 
EZK.45.11	The dry measure and the liquid measure will be the same: The liquid measure will always be a tenth of a homer, and the ephah will always be a tenth of a homer. The measurement they follow will be the homer. 
EZK.45.12	The shekel will be worth twenty gerahs, and a mina will be worth sixty shekels.
EZK.45.13	“ ‘This is the gift you should offer: a sixth of an ephah from every homer of wheat, and a sixth of an ephah from every homer of barley. 
EZK.45.14	The amount of oil you are to offer is a tenth of a bath from each cor. (Ten baths make a homer and also make a cor.) 
EZK.45.15	You should give one sheep from each flock of two hundred from the watering places of Israel. All these are to be offered for the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and fellowship offerings to remove sins so you will belong to God, says the Lord 
EZK.45.16	All people in the land will give this special offering to the ruler of Israel. 
EZK.45.17	It will be the ruler’s responsibility to supply the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings. These offerings will be given at the feasts, at the New Moons, on the Sabbaths, and at all the other feasts of Israel. The ruler will supply the sin offerings, grain offerings, and fellowship offerings to pay for the sins of Israel.
EZK.45.18	“ ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.45.19	The priest will take some of the blood from this sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the Temple, on the four corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate to the inner courtyard. 
EZK.45.20	You will do the same thing on the seventh day of the month for anyone who has sinned by accident or without knowing it. This is how you make the Temple pure and ready for God’s service.
EZK.45.21	“ ‘On the fourteenth day of the first month you will celebrate the Feast of Passover. It will be a feast of seven days when you eat bread made without yeast. 
EZK.45.22	On that day the ruler must offer a bull for himself and for all the people of the land as a sin offering. 
EZK.45.23	During the seven days of the feast he must offer seven bulls and seven male sheep that have nothing wrong with them. They will be burnt offerings to the L
EZK.45.24	The ruler must give as a grain offering one-half bushel for each bull and one-half bushel for each sheep. He must give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel.
EZK.45.25	“ ‘Beginning on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you celebrate the Feast of Shelters, the ruler will supply the same things for seven days: the sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the olive oil.
EZK.46.1	“ ‘This is what the Lord 
EZK.46.2	The ruler will enter from outside through the porch of the gateway and stand by the gatepost, while the priests offer the ruler’s burnt offering and fellowship offering. The ruler will worship at the entrance of the gateway, and then he will go out. But the gate will not be shut until evening. 
EZK.46.3	The people of the land will worship at the entrance of that gateway in the presence of the L

EZK.46.5	He must give a half-bushel grain offering with the male sheep, but he may give as much grain offering with the lambs as he pleases. He must also give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel of grain. 
EZK.46.6	On the day of the New Moon he must offer a young bull that has nothing wrong with it. He must also offer six lambs and a male sheep that have nothing wrong with them. 
EZK.46.7	The ruler must give a half-bushel grain offering with the bull and one-half bushel with the male sheep. With the lambs, he may give as much grain as he pleases. But he must give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel of grain.

But with an offering of lambs, the ruler may give as much grain as he pleases. He should give a gallon of olive oil for each half bushel of grain.

EZK.46.18	The ruler must not take any of the people’s land, forcing them out of their land. He must give his sons some of his own land so my people will not be scattered out of their own land.’ ”
EZK.46.19	The man led me through the entrance at the side of the gateway to the priests’ holy rooms that face north. There I saw a place at the west end. 
EZK.46.20	The man said to me, “This is where the priests will boil the meat of the penalty offering and sin offering and bake the grain offering. Then they will not need to bring these holy offerings into the outer courtyard, because that would hurt the people.”
EZK.46.21	Then the man brought me out into the outer courtyard and led me to its four corners. In each corner of the courtyard was a smaller courtyard. 
EZK.46.22	Small courtyards were in the four corners of the courtyard. Each small courtyard was the same size, seventy feet long and fifty-two and one-half feet wide. 
EZK.46.23	A stone wall was around each of the four small courtyards, and places for cooking were built in each of the stone walls. 
EZK.46.24	The man said to me, “These are the kitchens where those who work in the Temple will boil the sacrifices offered by the people.”
EZK.47.1	The man led me back to the door of the Temple, and I saw water coming out from under the doorway and flowing east. (The Temple faced east.) The water flowed down from the south side wall of the Temple and then south of the altar. 
EZK.47.2	The man brought me out through the outer north gate and led me around outside to the outer east gate. I found the water coming out on the south side of the gate.
EZK.47.3	The man went toward the east with a line in his hand and measured about one-third of a mile. Then he led me through water that came up to my ankles. 
EZK.47.4	The man measured about one-third of a mile again and led me through water that came up to my knees. Then he measured about one-third of a mile again and led me through water up to my waist. 
EZK.47.5	The man measured about one-third of a mile again, but it was now a river that I could not cross. The water had risen too high; it was deep enough for swimming; it was a river that no one could cross. 
EZK.47.6	The man asked me, “Human, do you see this?”
EZK.47.6	Then the man led me back to the bank of the river. 
EZK.47.7	As I went back, I saw many trees on both sides of the river. 
EZK.47.8	The man said to me, “This water will flow toward the eastern areas and go down into the Jordan Valley. When it enters the Dead Sea, it will become fresh. 
EZK.47.9	Everywhere the river goes, there will be many fish. Wherever this water goes the Dead Sea will become fresh, and so where the river goes there will be many living things. 
EZK.47.10	Fishermen will stand by the Dead Sea. From En Gedi all the way to En Eglaim there will be places to spread fishing nets. There will be many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea, as many as in the Mediterranean Sea. 
EZK.47.11	But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they will be left for salt. 
EZK.47.12	All kinds of fruit trees will grow on both banks of the river, and their leaves will not dry and die. The trees will have fruit every month, because the water for them comes from the Temple. The fruit from the trees will be used for food, and their leaves for medicine.”
EZK.47.13	This is what the Lord 
EZK.47.14	You will divide the land equally. I promised to give it to your ancestors, so this land will belong to you as family property.
EZK.47.15	“This will be the border line of the land: “On the north side it will start at the Mediterranean Sea. It will go through Hethlon, toward Lebo Hamath and on to the towns of Zedad, 
EZK.47.16	Berothah, and Sibraim on the border between Damascus and Hamath. Then it will go on to the town of Hazer Hatticon on the border of the country of Hauran. 
EZK.47.17	So the border line will go from the Mediterranean Sea east to the town of Hazar Enan, where the land belonging to Damascus and Hamath lies on the north side. This will be the north side of the land.
EZK.47.18	“On the east side the border runs south from a point between Hauran and Damascus. It will go along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel and will continue to the town of Tamar on the Dead Sea. This will be the east side of the land.
EZK.47.19	“On the south side the border line will go east from Tamar all the way to the waters of Meribah Kadesh. Then it will run along the brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the south side of the land.
EZK.47.20	“On the west side the Mediterranean Sea will be the border line up to a place across from Lebo Hamath. This will be the west side of your land.
EZK.47.21	“You will divide this land among the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.22	You will divide it as family property for yourselves and for the foreigners who live and have children among you. You are to treat these foreigners the same as people born in Israel; they are to share the land with the tribes of Israel. 
EZK.47.23	In whatever tribe the foreigner lives, you will give him some land,” says the Lord 
EZK.48.1	“These are the areas of the tribes named here: Dan will have one share at the northern border. It will go from the sea through Hethlon to Lebo Hamath, all the way to Hazar Enan, where Damascus lies to the north. It will stop there next to Hamath. This will be Dan’s northern border from the east side to the Mediterranean Sea on the west side.
EZK.48.2	“South of Dan’s border, Asher will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side.
EZK.48.3	“South of Asher’s border, Naphtali will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side.
EZK.48.4	“South of Naphtali’s border, Manasseh will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side.
EZK.48.5	“South of Manasseh’s border, Ephraim will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side.
EZK.48.6	“South of Ephraim’s border, Reuben will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side.
EZK.48.7	“South of Reuben’s border, Judah will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side.
EZK.48.8	“South of Judah’s border will be the holy area which you are to give. It will be about seven miles wide and as long and wide as one of the tribes’ shares. It will run from the east side to the west side. The Temple will be in the middle of this area.

EZK.48.14	The Levites are not to sell or trade any of this land. They are not to let anyone else own any of this best part of the land, because it belongs to the L
EZK.48.15	“The rest of the area will be about one and one-half miles wide and seven miles long. It will not be holy but will belong to the city and be used for homes and pastures. The city will be in the middle of it. 
EZK.48.16	These are the city’s measurements: the north side will be about one mile, the south side about one mile, the east side about one mile, and the west side about one mile. 
EZK.48.17	The city’s land for pastures will be about four hundred thirty-seven feet on the north, four hundred thirty-seven feet on the south, four hundred thirty-seven feet on the east, and four hundred thirty-seven feet on the west. 
EZK.48.18	Along the long side of the holy area there will be left three miles on the east and three miles on the west. It will be used to grow food for the city workers. 
EZK.48.19	The city workers from all the tribes of Israel will farm this land.

That land will extend east of the holy area to the eastern border and west of it to the Mediterranean Sea. Both of these areas run the length of the lands of the tribes, and they belong to the ruler. The holy area with the Holy Place of the Temple will be in the middle. 
EZK.48.22	The Levites’ land and the city property will be in the middle of the lands belonging to the ruler. Those lands will be between Judah’s border and Benjamin’s border.
EZK.48.23	“Here is what the rest of the tribes will receive: Benjamin will have one share. It will go from the east side to the Mediterranean Sea on the west side.
EZK.48.24	“South of Benjamin’s land, Simeon will have one share. It will go from the east side to the west side.

DAN.1.1	During the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came to Jerusalem and surrounded it with his army. 
DAN.1.2	The Lord allowed Nebuchadnezzar to capture Jehoiakim king of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the things from the Temple of God, which he carried to Babylonia and put in the temple of his gods.
DAN.1.3	Then King Nebuchadnezzar ordered Ashpenaz, his chief officer, to bring some of the men of Judah into his palace. He wanted them to be from important families, including the family of the king of Judah. 
DAN.1.4	King Nebuchadnezzar wanted only young Israelite men who had nothing wrong with them. They were to be handsome and well educated, capable of learning and understanding, and able to serve in his palace. Ashpenaz was to teach them the language and writings of the Babylonians. 
DAN.1.5	The king gave the young men a certain amount of food and wine every day, just like the food he ate. The young men were to be trained for three years, and then they would become servants of the king of Babylon. 
DAN.1.6	Among those young men were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah from the people of Judah.
DAN.1.7	Ashpenaz, the chief officer, gave them Babylonian names. Daniel’s new name was Belteshazzar, Hananiah’s was Shadrach, Mishael’s was Meshach, and Azariah’s was Abednego.
DAN.1.8	Daniel decided not to eat the king’s food or drink his wine because that would make him unclean. So he asked Ashpenaz for permission not to make himself unclean in this way.
DAN.1.9	God made Ashpenaz, the chief officer, want to be kind and merciful to Daniel, 
DAN.1.10	but Ashpenaz said to Daniel, “I am afraid of my master, the king. He ordered me to give you this food and drink. If you begin to look worse than other young men your age, the king will see this. Then he will cut off my head because of you.”
DAN.1.11	Ashpenaz had ordered a guard to watch Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
DAN.1.12	Daniel said to the guard, “Please give us this test for ten days: Don’t give us anything but vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
DAN.1.13	After ten days compare how we look with how the other young men look who eat the king’s food. See for yourself and then decide how you want to treat us, your servants.”
DAN.1.14	So the guard agreed to test them for ten days. 
DAN.1.15	After ten days they looked healthier and better fed than all the young men who ate the king’s food. 
DAN.1.16	So the guard took away the king’s special food and wine, feeding them vegetables instead.
DAN.1.17	God gave these four young men wisdom and the ability to learn many things that people had written and studied. Daniel could also understand visions and dreams.
DAN.1.18	At the end of the time set for them by the king, Ashpenaz brought all the young men to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.1.19	The king talked to them and found that none of the young men were as good as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So those four young men became the king’s servants. 
DAN.1.20	Every time the king asked them about something important, they showed much wisdom and understanding. They were ten times better than all the fortune-tellers and magicians in his kingdom! 
DAN.1.21	So Daniel continued to be the king’s servant until the first year Cyrus was king.
DAN.2.1	During Nebuchadnezzar’s second year as king, he had dreams that bothered him and kept him awake at night. 
DAN.2.2	So the king called for his fortune-tellers, magicians, wizards, and wise men, because he wanted them to tell him what he had dreamed. They came in and stood in front of the king.
DAN.2.3	Then the king said to them, “I had a dream that bothers me, and I want to know what it means.”
DAN.2.4	The wise men answered the king in the Aramaic language, “O king, live forever! Please tell us, your servants, your dream. Then we will tell you what it means.”
DAN.2.5	King Nebuchadnezzar said to them, “I meant what I said. You must tell me the dream and what it means. If you don’t, I will have you torn apart, and I will turn your houses into piles of stones. 
DAN.2.6	But if you tell me my dream and its meaning, I will reward you with gifts and great honor. So tell me the dream and what it means.”
DAN.2.7	Again the wise men said to the king, “Tell us, your servants, the dream, and we will tell you what it means.”
DAN.2.8	King Nebuchadnezzar answered, “I know you are trying to get more time, because you know that I meant what I said. 
DAN.2.9	If you don’t tell me my dream, you will be punished. You have all agreed to tell me lies and wicked things, hoping things will change. Now, tell me the dream so that I will know you can tell me what it really means!”
DAN.2.10	The wise men answered the king, saying, “No one on earth can do what the king asks! No great and powerful king has ever asked the fortune-tellers, magicians, or wise men to do this; 
DAN.2.11	the king is asking something that is too hard. Only the gods could tell the king this, but the gods do not live among people.”
DAN.2.12	When the king heard their answer, he became very angry. He ordered that all the wise men of Babylon be killed. 
DAN.2.13	So King Nebuchadnezzar’s order to kill the wise men was announced, and men were sent to look for Daniel and his friends to kill them.
DAN.2.14	Arioch, the commander of the king’s guards, was going to kill the wise men of Babylon. But Daniel spoke to him with wisdom and skill, 
DAN.2.15	saying, “Why did the king order such a terrible punishment?” Then Arioch explained everything to Daniel. 
DAN.2.16	So Daniel went to King Nebuchadnezzar and asked for an appointment so that he could tell the king what his dream meant.
DAN.2.17	Then Daniel went to his house and explained the whole story to his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
DAN.2.18	Daniel asked his friends to pray that the God of heaven would show them mercy and help them understand this secret so he and his friends would not be killed with the other wise men of Babylon.
DAN.2.19	During the night God explained the secret to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven. 
DAN.2.20	Daniel said:
DAN.2.20	“Praise God forever and ever,
DAN.2.20	because he has wisdom and power.
DAN.2.21	He changes the times and seasons of the year.
DAN.2.21	He takes away the power of kings
DAN.2.21	and gives their power to new kings.
DAN.2.21	He gives wisdom to those who are wise
DAN.2.21	and knowledge to those who understand.
DAN.2.22	He makes known secrets that are deep and hidden;
DAN.2.22	he knows what is hidden in darkness,
DAN.2.22	and light is all around him.
DAN.2.23	I thank you and praise you, God of my ancestors,
DAN.2.23	because you have given me wisdom and power.
DAN.2.23	You told me what we asked of you;
DAN.2.23	you told us about the king’s dream.”
DAN.2.24	Then Daniel went to Arioch, the man King Nebuchadnezzar had chosen to kill the wise men of Babylon. Daniel said to him, “Don’t put the wise men of Babylon to death. Take me to the king, and I will tell him what his dream means.”
DAN.2.25	Very quickly Arioch took Daniel to the king and said, “I have found a man among the captives from Judah who can tell the king what his dream means.”
DAN.2.26	The king asked Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar, “Are you able to tell me what I dreamed and what it means?”
DAN.2.27	Daniel answered, “No wise man, magician, or fortune-teller can explain to the king the secret he has asked about. 
DAN.2.28	But there is a God in heaven who explains secret things, and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen at a later time. This is your dream, the vision you saw while lying on your bed: 
DAN.2.29	O king, as you were lying there, you thought about things to come. God, who can tell people about secret things, showed you what is going to happen. 
DAN.2.30	God also told this secret to me, not because I have greater wisdom than any other living person, but so that you may know what it means. In that way you will understand what went through your mind.
DAN.2.31	“O king, in your dream you saw a huge, shiny, and frightening statue in front of you. 
DAN.2.32	The head of the statue was made of pure gold. Its chest and arms were made of silver. Its stomach and the upper part of its legs were made of bronze. 
DAN.2.33	The lower part of the legs were made of iron, while its feet were made partly of iron and partly of baked clay. 
DAN.2.34	While you were looking at the statue, you saw a rock cut free, but no human being touched the rock. It hit the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them. 
DAN.2.35	Then the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold broke to pieces at the same time. They became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summertime; the wind blew them away, and there was nothing left. Then the rock that hit the statue became a very large mountain that filled the whole earth.
DAN.2.36	“That was your dream. Now we will tell the king what it means. 
DAN.2.37	O king, you are the greatest king. God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, strength, and glory. 
DAN.2.38	Wherever people, wild animals, and birds live, God made you ruler over them. King Nebuchadnezzar, you are the head of gold on that statue.
DAN.2.39	“Another kingdom will come after you, but it will not be as great as yours. Next a third kingdom, the bronze part, will rule over the earth. 
DAN.2.40	Then there will be a fourth kingdom, strong as iron. In the same way that iron crushes and smashes things to pieces, the fourth kingdom will smash and crush all the other kingdoms.
DAN.2.41	“You saw that the statue’s feet and toes were partly baked clay and partly iron. That means the fourth kingdom will be a divided kingdom. It will have some of the strength of iron in it, just as you saw iron was mixed with clay. 
DAN.2.42	The toes of the statue were partly iron and partly clay. So the fourth kingdom will be partly strong like iron and partly breakable like clay. 
DAN.2.43	You saw the iron mixed with clay, but iron and clay do not hold together. In the same way the people of the fourth kingdom will be a mixture, but they will not be united as one people.
DAN.2.44	“During the time of those kings, the God of heaven will set up another kingdom that will never be destroyed or given to another group of people. This kingdom will crush all the other kingdoms and bring them to an end, but it will continue forever.
DAN.2.45	“King Nebuchadnezzar, you saw a rock cut from a mountain, but no human being touched it. The rock broke the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold to pieces. In this way the great God showed you what will happen. The dream is true, and you can trust this explanation.”
DAN.2.46	Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell facedown on the ground in front of Daniel. The king honored him and commanded that an offering and incense be presented to him. 
DAN.2.47	Then the king said to Daniel, “Truly I know your God is the greatest of all gods, the Lord of all the kings. He tells people about things they cannot know. I know this is true, because you were able to tell these secret things to me.”
DAN.2.48	Then the king gave Daniel many gifts plus an important position in his kingdom. Nebuchadnezzar made him ruler over the whole area of Babylon and put him in charge of all the wise men of Babylon. 
DAN.2.49	Daniel asked the king to make Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego leaders over the area of Babylon, so the king did as Daniel asked. Daniel himself became one of the people who stayed at the royal court.
DAN.3.1	King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue ninety feet high and nine feet wide and set it up on the plain of Dura in the area of Babylon. 
DAN.3.2	Then he called for the leaders: the governors, assistant governors, captains of the soldiers, people who advised the king, keepers of the treasury, judges, rulers, and all other officers in his kingdom. He wanted them to come to the special service for the statue he had set up. 
DAN.3.3	So they all came for the special service and stood in front of the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
DAN.3.4	Then the man who made announcements for the king said in a loud voice, “People, nations, and those of every language, this is what you are commanded to do: 
DAN.3.5	When you hear the sound of the horns, flutes, lyres, zithers, harps, pipes, and all the other musical instruments, you must bow down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
DAN.3.6	Anyone who doesn’t bow down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.”
DAN.3.7	Now people, nations, and those who spoke every language were there. When they heard the sound of the horns, flutes, lyres, zithers, pipes, and all the other musical instruments, they bowed down and worshiped the gold statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
DAN.3.8	Then some Babylonians came up to the king and began speaking against the men of Judah. 
DAN.3.9	They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, “O king, live forever! 
DAN.3.10	O king, you gave a command that everyone who heard the horns, lyres, zithers, harps, pipes, and all the other musical instruments would have to bow down and worship the gold statue. 
DAN.3.11	Anyone who wouldn’t do this was to be thrown into a blazing furnace. 
DAN.3.12	O king, there are some men of Judah whom you made officers in the area of Babylon that did not pay attention to your order. Their names are Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. They do not serve your gods and do not worship the gold statue you have set up.”
DAN.3.13	Nebuchadnezzar became very angry and called for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. When they were brought to the king, 
DAN.3.14	Nebuchadnezzar said, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you do not serve my gods nor worship the gold statue I have set up? 
DAN.3.15	In a moment you will again hear the sound of the horns, flutes, lyres, zithers, harps, pipes, and all the other musical instruments. If you bow down and worship the statue I made, that will be good. But if you do not worship it, you will immediately be thrown into the blazing furnace. What god will be able to save you from my power then?”
DAN.3.16	Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered the king, saying, “Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves to you. 
DAN.3.17	If you throw us into the blazing furnace, the God we serve is able to save us from the furnace. He will save us from your power, O king. 
DAN.3.18	But even if God does not save us, we want you, O king, to know this: We will not serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.”
DAN.3.19	Then Nebuchadnezzar was furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and he changed his mind. He ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual. 
DAN.3.20	Then he commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace.
DAN.3.21	So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego were tied up and thrown into the blazing furnace while still wearing their robes, trousers, turbans, and other clothes. 
DAN.3.22	The king’s command was very strict, and the furnace was made so hot that the flames killed the strong soldiers who threw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into the furnace. 
DAN.3.23	Firmly tied, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell into the blazing furnace.
DAN.3.24	Then King Nebuchadnezzar was so surprised that he jumped to his feet. He asked the men who advised him, “Didn’t we tie up only three men and throw them into the fire?”
DAN.3.24	They answered, “Yes, O king.”
DAN.3.25	The king said, “Look! I see four men walking around in the fire. They are not tied up, and they are not burned. The fourth man looks like a son of the gods.”
DAN.3.26	Then Nebuchadnezzar went to the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted, “Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, come out! Servants of the Most High God, come here!”
DAN.3.26	So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire. 
DAN.3.27	When they came out, the governors, assistant governors, captains of the soldiers, and royal advisers crowded around them and saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies. Their hair was not burned, their robes were not burned, and they didn’t even smell like smoke!
DAN.3.28	Then Nebuchadnezzar said, “Praise the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Their God has sent his angel and saved his servants from the fire! These three men trusted their God and refused to obey my command. They were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god other than their own. 
DAN.3.29	So I now give this command: Anyone from any nation or language who says anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego will be torn apart and have his house turned into a pile of stones. No other god can save his people like this.” 
DAN.3.30	Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the area of Babylon.
DAN.4.1	King Nebuchadnezzar sent this letter to the people, nations, and those who speak every language in all the world:
DAN.4.1	I wish you peace and great wealth!
DAN.4.2	The Most High God has done miracles and wonderful things for me that I am happy to tell you about.
DAN.4.3	His wonderful acts are great,
DAN.4.3	and his miracles are mighty.
DAN.4.3	His kingdom goes on forever,
DAN.4.3	and his rule continues from now on.
DAN.4.4	I, Nebuchadnezzar, was happy and successful at my palace, 
DAN.4.5	but I had a dream that made me afraid. As I was lying on my bed, I saw pictures and visions in my mind that alarmed me. 
DAN.4.6	So I ordered all the wise men of Babylon to come to me and tell me what my dream meant. 
DAN.4.7	The fortune-tellers, magicians, and wise men came, and I told them about the dream. But they could not tell me what it meant.
DAN.4.8	Finally, Daniel came to me. (I called him Belteshazzar to honor my god, because the spirit of the holy gods is in him.) I told my dream to him. 
DAN.4.9	I said, “Belteshazzar, you are the most important of all the fortune-tellers. I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, so there is no secret that is too hard for you to understand. This was what I dreamed; tell me what it means. 
DAN.4.10	These are the visions I saw while I was lying in my bed: I looked, and there in front of me was a tree standing in the middle of the earth. And it was very tall. 
DAN.4.11	The tree grew large and strong. The top of the tree touched the sky and could be seen from anywhere on earth. 
DAN.4.12	The leaves of the tree were beautiful. It had plenty of good fruit on it, enough food for everyone. The wild animals found shelter under the tree, and the birds lived in its branches. Every animal ate from it.
DAN.4.13	“As I was looking at those things in the vision while lying on my bed, I saw an observer, a holy angel coming down from heaven. 
DAN.4.14	He spoke very loudly and said, ‘Cut down the tree and cut off its branches. Strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Let the animals under the tree run away, and let the birds in its branches fly away. 
DAN.4.15	But leave the stump and its roots in the ground with a band of iron and bronze around it; let it stay in the field with the grass around it.
DAN.4.15	“ ‘Let the man become wet with dew, and let him live among the animals and plants of the earth. 
DAN.4.16	Let him not think like a human any longer, but let him have the mind of an animal for seven years.
DAN.4.17	“ ‘The observers gave this command; the holy ones declared the sentence. This is so all people may know that the Most High God rules over every kingdom on earth. God gives those kingdoms to anyone he wants, and he chooses people to rule them who are not proud.’
DAN.4.18	“That is what I, King Nebuchadnezzar, dreamed. Now Belteshazzar, tell me what the dream means. None of the wise men in my kingdom can explain it to me, but you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.”
DAN.4.19	Then Daniel, who was called Belteshazzar, was very quiet for a while, because his understanding of the dream frightened him. So the king said, “Belteshazzar, do not let the dream or its meaning make you afraid.”
DAN.4.19	Then Belteshazzar answered, “My master, I wish the dream were about your enemies, and I wish its meaning were for those who are against you! 
DAN.4.20	You saw a tree in your dream that grew large and strong. Its top touched the sky, and it could be seen from all over the earth. 
DAN.4.21	Its leaves were beautiful, and it had plenty of fruit for everyone to eat. It was a home for the wild animals, and its branches were nesting places for the birds. 
DAN.4.22	O king, you are that tree! You have become great and powerful, like the tall tree that touched the sky. Your power reaches to the far parts of the earth.
DAN.4.23	“O king, you saw an observer, a holy angel, coming down from heaven who said, ‘Cut down the tree and destroy it. But leave the stump and its roots in the ground with a band of iron and bronze around it; leave it in the field with the grass. Let him become wet with dew and live like a wild animal for seven years.’
DAN.4.24	“This is the meaning of the dream, O king. The Most High God has commanded these things to happen to my master the king: 
DAN.4.25	You will be forced away from people to live among the wild animals. People will feed you grass like an ox, and dew from the sky will make you wet. Seven years will pass, and then you will learn this lesson: The Most High God is ruler over every kingdom on earth, and he gives those kingdoms to anyone he chooses.
DAN.4.26	“Since the stump of the tree and its roots were left in the ground, your kingdom will be given back to you when you learn that one in heaven rules your kingdom. 
DAN.4.27	So, O king, please accept my advice. Stop sinning and do what is right. Stop doing wicked things and be kind to the poor. Then you might continue to be successful.”
DAN.4.28	All these things happened to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
DAN.4.29	Twelve months later as he was walking on the roof of his palace in Babylon, 
DAN.4.30	he said, “I have built this great Babylon as my royal home. I built it by my power to show my glory and my majesty.”
DAN.4.31	The words were still in his mouth when a voice from heaven said, “King Nebuchadnezzar, these things will happen to you: Your royal power has been taken away from you. 
DAN.4.32	You will be forced away from people. You will live with the wild animals and will be fed grass like an ox. Seven years will pass before you learn this lesson: The Most High God rules over every kingdom on earth and gives those kingdoms to anyone he chooses.”
DAN.4.33	Immediately the words came true. Nebuchadnezzar was forced to go away from people, and he began eating grass like an ox. He became wet from dew. His hair grew long like the feathers of an eagle, and his nails grew like the claws of a bird.
DAN.4.34	At the end of that time, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up toward heaven, and I could think normally again! Then I gave praise to the Most High God; I gave honor and glory to him who lives forever.
DAN.4.34	God’s rule is forever,
DAN.4.34	and his kingdom continues for all time.
DAN.4.35	People on earth
DAN.4.35	are not truly important.
DAN.4.35	God does what he wants
DAN.4.35	with the powers of heaven
DAN.4.35	and the people on earth.
DAN.4.35	No one can stop his powerful hand
DAN.4.35	or question what he does.
DAN.4.36	At that time I could think normally again, and God gave back my great honor and power and returned the glory to my kingdom. The people who advised me and the royal family came to me for help again. I became king again and was even greater and more powerful than before. 
DAN.4.37	Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, give praise and honor and glory to the King of heaven. Everything he does is right and fair, and he is able to make proud people humble.
DAN.5.1	King Belshazzar gave a big banquet for a thousand royal guests and drank wine with them. 
DAN.5.2	As Belshazzar was drinking his wine, he gave orders to bring the gold and silver cups that his ancestor Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem. This was so the king, his royal guests, his wives, and his slave women could drink from those cups. 
DAN.5.3	So they brought the gold cups that had been taken from the Temple of God in Jerusalem. And the king and his royal guests, his wives, and his slave women drank from them. 
DAN.5.4	As they were drinking, they praised their gods, which were made from gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
DAN.5.5	Suddenly the fingers of a person’s hand appeared and began writing on the plaster of the wall, near the lampstand in the royal palace. The king watched the hand as it wrote.
DAN.5.6	King Belshazzar was very frightened. His face turned white, his knees knocked together, and he could not stand up because his legs were too weak. 
DAN.5.7	The king called for the magicians, wise men, and wizards of Babylon and said to them, “Anyone who can read this writing and explain it will receive purple clothes fit for a king and a gold chain around his neck. And I will make that person the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.8	Then all the king’s wise men came in, but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant. 
DAN.5.9	King Belshazzar became even more afraid, and his face became even whiter. His royal guests were confused.
DAN.5.10	Then the king’s mother, who had heard the voices of the king and his royal guests, came into the banquet room. She said, “O king, live forever! Don’t be afraid or let your face be white with fear! 
DAN.5.11	There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, this man showed understanding, knowledge, and wisdom like the gods. Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar, put this man in charge of all the wise men, fortune-tellers, magicians, and wizards. 
DAN.5.12	The man I am talking about is named Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar. He was very wise and had knowledge and understanding. He could explain dreams and secrets and could answer very hard problems. Call for Daniel. He will tell you what the writing on the wall means.”
DAN.5.13	So they brought Daniel to the king, and the king asked, “Is your name Daniel? Are you one of the captives my father the king brought from Judah? 
DAN.5.14	I have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that you are very wise and have knowledge and extraordinary understanding. 
DAN.5.15	The wise men and magicians were brought to me to read this writing and to explain what it means, but they could not explain it. 
DAN.5.16	I have heard that you are able to explain what things mean and can find the answers to hard problems. Read this writing on the wall and explain it to me. If you can, I will give you purple clothes fit for a king and a gold chain to wear around your neck. And you will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom.”
DAN.5.17	Then Daniel answered the king, “You may keep your gifts for yourself, or you may give those rewards to someone else. But I will read the writing on the wall for you and will explain to you what it means.
DAN.5.18	“O king, the Most High God made your father Nebuchadnezzar a great, important, and powerful king. 
DAN.5.19	Because God made him important, all the people, nations, and those who spoke every language were very frightened of Nebuchadnezzar. If he wanted someone to die, he killed that person. If he wanted someone to live, he let that person live. Those he wanted to promote, he promoted. Those he wanted to be less important, he made less important.
DAN.5.20	“But Nebuchadnezzar became too proud and stubborn, so he was taken off his royal throne. His glory was taken away. 
DAN.5.21	He was forced away from people, and his mind became like the mind of an animal. He lived with the wild donkeys and was fed grass like an ox and became wet with dew. These things happened to him until he learned his lesson: The Most High God rules over every kingdom on earth, and he sets anyone he chooses over those kingdoms.
DAN.5.22	“Belshazzar, you already knew these things, because you are a descendant of Nebuchadnezzar. Still you have not been sorry for what you have done. 
DAN.5.23	Instead, you have set yourself against the Lord of heaven. You ordered the drinking cups from the Temple of the Lord to be brought to you. Then you and your royal guests, your wives, and your slave women drank wine from them. You praised the gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone that are not really gods; they cannot see or hear or understand anything. You did not honor God, who has power over your life and everything you do. 
DAN.5.24	So God sent the hand that wrote on the wall.
DAN.5.25	“These are the words that were written on the wall: ‘Mene, mene, tekel, and parsin.’
DAN.5.26	“This is what the words mean: Mene: God has counted the days until your kingdom will end. 
DAN.5.27	Tekel: You have been weighed on the scales and found not good enough. 
DAN.5.28	Parsin: Your kingdom is being divided and will be given to the Medes and the Persians.”
DAN.5.29	Then Belshazzar gave an order for Daniel to be dressed in purple clothes and to have a gold chain put around his neck. And it was announced that Daniel was the third highest ruler in the kingdom. 
DAN.5.30	That very same night Belshazzar, king of the Babylonian people, was killed. 
DAN.5.31	So Darius the Mede became the new king when he was sixty-two years old.
DAN.6.1	Darius thought it would be a good idea to choose one hundred twenty governors who would rule his kingdom. 
DAN.6.2	He chose three men as supervisors over those governors, and Daniel was one of the supervisors. The supervisors were to ensure that the governors did not try to cheat the king. 
DAN.6.3	Daniel showed that he could do the work better than the other supervisors and governors, so the king planned to put Daniel in charge of the whole kingdom. 
DAN.6.4	Because of this, the other supervisors and governors tried to find reasons to accuse Daniel about his work in the government. But they could not find anything wrong with him or any reason to accuse him, because he was trustworthy and not lazy or dishonest. 
DAN.6.5	Finally these men said, “We will never find any reason to accuse Daniel unless it is about the law of his God.”
DAN.6.6	So the supervisors and governors went as a group to the king and said: “King Darius, live forever! 
DAN.6.7	The supervisors, assistant governors, governors, the people who advise you, and the captains of the soldiers have all agreed that you should make a new law for everyone to obey: For the next thirty days no one should pray to any god or human except to you, O king. Anyone who doesn’t obey will be thrown into the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.8	Now, O king, make the law and sign your name to it so that it cannot be changed, because then it will be a law of the Medes and Persians and cannot be canceled.” 
DAN.6.9	So King Darius signed the law.
DAN.6.10	Even though Daniel knew that the new law had been written, he went to pray in an upstairs room in his house, which had windows that opened toward Jerusalem. Three times each day Daniel would kneel down to pray and thank God, just as he always had done.
DAN.6.11	Then those men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. 
DAN.6.12	So they went to the king and talked to him about the law he had made. They said, “Didn’t you sign a law that says no one may pray to any god or human except you, O king? Doesn’t it say that anyone who disobeys during the next thirty days will be thrown into the lions’ den?”
DAN.6.12	The king answered, “Yes, that is the law, and the laws of the Medes and Persians cannot be canceled.”
DAN.6.13	Then they said to the king, “Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, is not paying attention to you, O king, or to the law you signed. Daniel still prays to his God three times every day.” 
DAN.6.14	The king became very upset when he heard this. He wanted to save Daniel, and he worked hard until sunset trying to think of a way to save him.
DAN.6.15	Then those men went as a group to the king. They said, “Remember, O king, the law of the Medes and Persians says that no law or command given by the king can be changed.”
DAN.6.16	So King Darius gave the order, and Daniel was brought in and thrown into the lions’ den. The king said to Daniel, “May the God you serve all the time save you!” 
DAN.6.17	A big stone was brought and placed over the opening of the lions’ den. Then the king used his signet ring and the rings of his royal officers to put special seals on the rock. This ensured that no one would move the rock and bring Daniel out. 
DAN.6.18	Then King Darius went back to his palace. He did not eat that night, he did not have any entertainment brought to him, and he could not sleep.
DAN.6.19	The next morning King Darius got up at dawn and hurried to the lions’ den. 
DAN.6.20	As he came near the den, he was worried. He called out to Daniel, “Daniel, servant of the living God! Has your God that you always worship been able to save you from the lions?”
DAN.6.21	Daniel answered, “O king, live forever! 
DAN.6.22	My God sent his angel to close the lions’ mouths. They have not hurt me, because my God knows I am innocent. I never did anything wrong to you, O king.”
DAN.6.23	King Darius was very happy and told his servants to lift Daniel out of the lions’ den. So they lifted him out and did not find any injury on him, because Daniel had trusted in his God.
DAN.6.24	Then the king commanded that the men who had accused Daniel be brought to the lions’ den. They, their wives, and their children were thrown into the den. The lions grabbed them before they hit the floor of the den and crushed their bones.
DAN.6.25	Then King Darius wrote a letter to all people and all nations, to those who spoke every language in the world:
DAN.6.25	I wish you great peace and wealth.
DAN.6.26	I am making a new law for people in every part of my kingdom. All of you must fear and respect the God of Daniel.
DAN.6.26	Daniel’s God is the living God;
DAN.6.26	he lives forever.
DAN.6.26	His kingdom will never be destroyed,
DAN.6.26	and his rule will never end.
DAN.6.27	God rescues and saves people
DAN.6.27	and does mighty miracles
DAN.6.27	in heaven and on earth.
DAN.6.27	He is the one who saved Daniel
DAN.6.27	from the power of the lions.
DAN.6.28	So Daniel was successful during the time Darius was king and when Cyrus the Persian was king.
DAN.7.1	In Belshazzar’s first year as king of Babylon, Daniel had a dream. He saw visions as he was lying on his bed, and he wrote down what he had dreamed.
DAN.7.2	Daniel said: “I saw my vision at night. In the vision the wind was blowing from all four directions, which made the sea very rough. 
DAN.7.3	I saw four huge animals come up from the sea, and each animal was different from the others.
DAN.7.4	“The first animal looked like a lion, but had wings like an eagle. I watched this animal until its wings were torn off. It was lifted from the ground so that it stood up on two feet like a human, and it was given the mind of a human.
DAN.7.5	“Then I saw a second animal before me that looked like a bear. It was raised up on one of its sides and had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. It was told, ‘Get up and eat all the meat you want!’
DAN.7.6	“After that, I looked, and there before me was another animal. This animal looked like a leopard with four wings on its back that looked like a bird’s wings. This animal had four heads and was given power to rule.
DAN.7.7	“After that, in my vision at night I saw in front of me a fourth animal that was cruel, terrible, and very strong. It had large iron teeth. It crushed and ate what it killed, and then it walked on whatever was left. This fourth animal was different from any animal I had seen before, and it had ten horns.
DAN.7.8	“While I was thinking about the horns, another horn grew up among them. It was a little horn with eyes like a human’s eyes. It also had a mouth, and the mouth was bragging. The little horn pulled out three of the other horns.
DAN.7.9	“As I looked,
DAN.7.9	thrones were put in their places,
DAN.7.9	and God, the Eternal One, sat on his throne.
DAN.7.9	His clothes were white like snow,
DAN.7.9	and the hair on his head was white like wool.
DAN.7.9	His throne was made from fire,
DAN.7.9	and the wheels of his throne were blazing with fire.
DAN.7.10	A river of fire was flowing
DAN.7.10	from in front of him.
DAN.7.10	Many thousands of angels were serving him,
DAN.7.10	and millions of angels stood before him.
DAN.7.10	Court was ready to begin,
DAN.7.10	and the books were opened.
DAN.7.11	“I kept on looking because the little horn was bragging. I kept watching until finally the fourth animal was killed. Its body was destroyed, and it was thrown into the burning fire. 
DAN.7.12	(The power and rule of the other animals had been taken from them, but they were permitted to live for a certain period of time.)
DAN.7.13	“In my vision at night I saw in front of me someone who looked like a human being coming on the clouds in the sky. He came near God, who has been alive forever, and he was led to God. 
DAN.7.14	He was given authority, glory, and the strength of a king. People of every tribe, nation, and language will serve him. His rule will last forever, and his kingdom will never be destroyed.
DAN.7.15	“I, Daniel, was worried. The visions that went through my mind frightened me. 
DAN.7.16	I came near one of those standing there and asked what all this meant.
DAN.7.16	“So he told me and explained to me what these things meant: 
DAN.7.17	‘The four great animals are four kingdoms that will come from the earth. 
DAN.7.18	But the holy people who belong to the Most High God will receive the power to rule and will have the power to rule forever, from now on.’
DAN.7.19	“Then I wanted to know what the fourth animal meant, because it was different from all the others. It was very terrible and had iron teeth and bronze claws. It was the animal that crushed and ate what it killed and then walked on whatever was left. 
DAN.7.20	I also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the little horn that grew there. It had pulled out three of the other ten horns and looked greater than the others. It had eyes and a mouth that kept bragging. 
DAN.7.21	As I watched, the little horn began making war against God’s holy people and was defeating them 
DAN.7.22	until God, who has been alive forever, came. He judged in favor of the holy people who belong to the Most High God; then the time came for them to receive the power to rule.
DAN.7.23	“And he explained this to me: ‘The fourth animal is a fourth kingdom that will come on the earth. It will be different from all the other kingdoms and will destroy people all over the world. It will walk on and crush the whole earth. 
DAN.7.24	The ten horns are ten kings who will come from this fourth kingdom. After those ten kings are gone, another king will come. He will be different from the kings who ruled before him, and he will defeat three of the other kings. 
DAN.7.25	This king will speak against the Most High God, and he will hurt and kill God’s holy people. He will try to change times and laws that have already been set. The holy people that belong to God will be in that king’s power for three and one-half years.
DAN.7.26	“ ‘But the court will decide what should happen. The power of the king will be taken away, and his kingdom will be completely destroyed. 
DAN.7.27	Then the holy people who belong to the Most High God will have the power to rule. They will rule over all the kingdoms under heaven with power and greatness, and their power to rule will last forever. People from all the other kingdoms will respect and serve them.’
DAN.7.28	“That was the end of the dream. I, Daniel, was very afraid. My face became white from fear, but I kept everything to myself.”
DAN.8.1	During the third year of King Belshazzar’s rule, I, Daniel, saw another vision, which was like the first one. 
DAN.8.2	In this vision I saw myself in the capital city of Susa, in the area of Elam. I was standing by the Ulai Canal 
DAN.8.3	when I looked up and saw a male sheep standing beside the canal. It had two long horns, but one horn was longer and newer than the other. 
DAN.8.4	I watched the sheep charge to the west, the north, and the south. No animal could stand before him, and none could save another animal from his power. He did whatever he wanted and became very powerful.
DAN.8.5	While I was watching this, I saw a male goat come from the west. This goat had one large horn between his eyes that was easy to see. He crossed over the whole earth so fast that his feet hardly touched the ground.
DAN.8.6	In his anger the goat charged the sheep with the two horns that I had seen standing by the canal. 
DAN.8.7	I watched the angry goat attack the sheep and break the sheep’s two horns. The sheep was not strong enough to stop it. The goat knocked the sheep to the ground and then walked all over him. No one was able to save the sheep from the goat, 
DAN.8.8	so the male goat became very great. But when he was strong, his big horn broke off and four horns grew in place of the one big horn. Those four horns pointed in four different directions and were easy to see.
DAN.8.9	Then a little horn grew from one of those four horns, and it became very big. It grew to the south, the east, and toward the beautiful land of Judah. 
DAN.8.10	That little horn grew until it reached to the sky. It even threw some of the army of heaven to the ground and walked on them! 
DAN.8.11	That little horn set itself up as equal to God, the Commander of heaven’s armies. It stopped the daily sacrifices that were offered to him, and the Temple, the place where people worshiped him, was pulled down. 
DAN.8.12	Because there was a turning away from God, the people stopped the daily sacrifices. Truth was thrown down to the ground, and the horn was successful in everything it did.
DAN.8.13	Then I heard a holy angel speaking. Another holy angel asked the first one, “How long will the things in this vision last—the daily sacrifices, the turning away from God that brings destruction, the Temple being pulled down, and the army of heaven being walked on?”
DAN.8.14	The angel said to me, “This will happen for twenty-three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the holy place will be repaired.”
DAN.8.15	I, Daniel, saw this vision and tried to understand what it meant. In it I saw someone who looked like a man standing near me. 
DAN.8.16	And I heard a man’s voice calling from the Ulai Canal: “Gabriel, explain the vision to this man.”
DAN.8.17	Gabriel came to where I was standing. When he came close to me, I was very afraid and bowed facedown on the ground. But Gabriel said to me, “Human being, understand that this vision is about the time of the end.”
DAN.8.18	While Gabriel was speaking, I fell into a deep sleep with my face on the ground. Then he touched me and lifted me to my feet. 
DAN.8.19	He said, “Now, I will explain to you what will happen in the time of God’s anger. Your vision was about the set time of the end.
DAN.8.20	“You saw a male sheep with two horns, which are the kings of Media and Persia. 
DAN.8.21	The male goat is the king of Greece, and the big horn between its eyes is the first king. 
DAN.8.22	The four horns that grew in the place of the broken horn are four kingdoms. Those four kingdoms will come from the nation of the first king, but they will not be as strong as the first king.
DAN.8.23	“When the end comes near for those kingdoms, a bold and cruel king who tells lies will come. This will happen when many people have turned against God. 
DAN.8.24	This king will be very powerful, but his power will not come from himself. He will cause terrible destruction and will be successful in everything he does. He will destroy powerful people and even God’s holy people. 
DAN.8.25	This king will succeed by using lies and force. He will think that he is very important. He will destroy many people without warning; he will try to fight even the Prince of princes! But that cruel king will be destroyed, and not by human power.
DAN.8.26	“The vision that has been shown to you about these evenings and mornings is true. But seal up the vision, because those things won’t happen for a long time.”
DAN.8.27	I, Daniel, became very weak and was sick for several days after that vision. Then I got up and went back to work for the king, but I was very upset about the vision. I didn’t understand what it meant.
DAN.9.1	These things happened during the first year Darius son of Xerxes was king over Babylon. He was a descendant of the Medes. 
DAN.9.2	During Darius’ first year as king, I, Daniel, was reading the Scriptures. I saw that the L
DAN.9.3	Then I turned to the Lord God and prayed and asked him for help. To show my sadness, I fasted, put on rough cloth, and sat in ashes. 
DAN.9.4	I prayed to the L
DAN.9.5	“But we have sinned and done wrong. We have been wicked and turned against you, your commands, and your laws. 
DAN.9.6	We did not listen to your servants, the prophets, who spoke for you to our kings, our leaders, our ancestors, and all the people of the land.
DAN.9.7	“Lord, you are good and right, but we are full of shame today—the people of Judah and Jerusalem, all the people of Israel, those near and far whom you scattered among many nations because they were not loyal to you. 
DAN.9.8	L
DAN.9.9	“But, Lord our God, you show us mercy and forgive us even though we have turned against you. 
DAN.9.10	We have not obeyed the L
DAN.9.11	All the people of Israel have disobeyed your teachings and have turned away, refusing to obey you. So you brought on us the curses and promises of punishment written in the Teachings of Moses, the servant of God, because we sinned against you.
DAN.9.12	“You said these things would happen to us and our leaders, and you made them happen; you brought on us a great disaster. Nothing has ever been done on earth like what was done to Jerusalem. 
DAN.9.13	All this disaster came to us just as it is written in the Teachings of Moses. But we have not pleaded with the L
DAN.9.14	The L
DAN.9.15	“Lord our God, you used your power and brought us out of Egypt. Because of that, your name is known even today. But we have sinned and have done wrong. 
DAN.9.16	Lord, you do what is right, but please do not be angry with Jerusalem, your city on your holy hill. Because of our sins and the evil things done by our ancestors, people all around insult and make fun of Jerusalem and your people.
DAN.9.17	“Now, our God, hear the prayers of your servant. Listen to my prayer for help, and for your sake do good things for your holy place that is in ruins. 
DAN.9.18	My God, pay attention and hear me. Open your eyes and see all the terrible things that have happened to us. See how our lives have been ruined and what has happened to the city that is called by your name. We do not ask these things because we are good; instead, we ask because of your mercy. 
DAN.9.19	Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, hear us and do something! For your sake, don’t wait, because your city and your people are called by your name.”
DAN.9.20	While I was saying these things in my prayer to the L
DAN.9.21	Gabriel came to me. (I had seen him in my last vision.) He came flying quickly to me about the time of the evening sacrifice, while I was still praying. 
DAN.9.22	He taught me and said to me, “Daniel, I have come to give you wisdom and to help you understand. 
DAN.9.23	When you first started praying, an answer was given, and I came to tell you, because God loves you very much. So think about the message and understand the vision.
DAN.9.24	“God has ordered four hundred ninety years for your people and your holy city for these reasons: to stop people from turning against God; to put an end to sin; to take away evil; to bring in goodness that continues forever; to bring about the vision and prophecy; and to appoint a most holy place.
DAN.9.25	“Learn and understand these things. A command will come to rebuild Jerusalem. The time from this command until the appointed leader comes will be forty-nine years and four hundred thirty-four years. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and a trench filled with water around it, but it will be built in times of trouble. 
DAN.9.26	After the four hundred thirty-four years the appointed leader will be killed; he will have nothing. The people of the leader who is to come will destroy the city and the holy place. The end of the city will come like a flood, and war will continue until the end. God has ordered that place to be completely destroyed. 
DAN.9.27	That leader will make firm an agreement with many people for seven years. He will stop the offerings and sacrifices after three and one-half years. A destroyer will do blasphemous things until the ordered end comes to the destroyed city.”
DAN.10.1	During Cyrus’ third year as king of Persia, Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, received a vision about a great war. It was a true message that Daniel understood.
DAN.10.2	At that time I, Daniel, had been very sad for three weeks. 
DAN.10.3	I did not eat any fancy food or meat, or drink any wine, or use any perfumed oil for three weeks.
DAN.10.4	On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, I was standing beside the great Tigris River. 
DAN.10.5	While standing there, I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen clothes with a belt of fine gold wrapped around his waist. 
DAN.10.6	His body was like shiny yellow quartz. His face was bright like lightning, and his eyes were like fire. His arms and legs were shiny like polished bronze, and his voice sounded like the roar of a crowd.
DAN.10.7	I, Daniel, was the only person who saw the vision. The men with me did not see it, because they were so frightened that they ran away and hid. 
DAN.10.8	So I was left alone, watching this great vision. I lost my strength, my face turned white like a dead person, and I was helpless. 
DAN.10.9	Then I heard the man in the vision speaking. As I listened, I fell into a deep sleep with my face on the ground.
DAN.10.10	Then a hand touched me and set me on my hands and knees. I was so afraid that I was shaking. 
DAN.10.11	The man in the vision said to me, “Daniel, God loves you very much. Think carefully about the words I will speak to you, and stand up, because I have been sent to you.” When he said this, I stood up, but I was still shaking.
DAN.10.12	Then the man said to me, “Daniel, do not be afraid. Some time ago you decided to get understanding and to humble yourself before your God. Since that time God has listened to you, and I have come because of your prayers. 
DAN.10.13	But the prince of Persia has been fighting against me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the most important angels, came to help me, because I had been left there with the king of Persia. 
DAN.10.14	Now I have come to explain to you what will happen to your people, because the vision is about a time in the future.”
DAN.10.15	While he was speaking to me, I bowed facedown and could not speak. 
DAN.10.16	Then one who looked like a man touched my lips, so I opened my mouth and started to speak. I said to the one standing in front of me, “Master, I am upset and afraid because of what I saw in the vision. I feel helpless. 
DAN.10.17	Master, how can I, your servant, talk with you? My strength is gone, and it is hard for me to breathe.”
DAN.10.18	The one who looked like a man touched me again and gave me strength. 
DAN.10.19	He said, “Daniel, don’t be afraid. God loves you very much. Peace be with you. Be strong now; be courageous.”
DAN.10.19	When he spoke to me, I became stronger and said, “Master, speak, since you have given me strength.”
DAN.10.20	Then he said, “Daniel, do you know why I have come to you? Soon I must go back to fight against the prince of Persia. When I go, the prince of Greece will come, 
DAN.10.21	but I must first tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. No one stands with me against these enemies except Michael, the angel ruling over your people.
DAN.11.1	In the first year that Darius the Mede was king, I stood up to support Michael in his fight against the prince of Persia.
DAN.11.2	“Now then, Daniel, I tell you the truth: Three more kings will rule in Persia, and then a fourth king will come. He will be much richer than all the kings of Persia before him and will use his riches to get power. He will stir up everyone against the kingdom of Greece. 
DAN.11.3	Then a mighty king will come, who will rule with great power and will do anything he wants. 
DAN.11.4	After that king has come, his kingdom will be broken up and divided out toward the four parts of the world. His kingdom will not go to his descendants, and it will not have the power that he had, because his kingdom will be pulled up and given to other people.
DAN.11.5	“The king of the South will become strong, but one of his commanders will become even stronger. He will begin to rule his own kingdom with great power. 
DAN.11.6	Then after a few years, a new friendship will develop. The daughter of the king of the South will marry the king of the North in order to bring peace. But she will not keep her power, and his family will not last. She, her husband, her child, and those who brought her to that country will be killed.
DAN.11.7	“But a person from her family will become king of the South and will attack the armies of the king of the North. He will go into that king’s strong, walled city and will fight and win. 
DAN.11.8	He will take their gods, their metal idols, and their valuable things made of silver and gold back to Egypt. Then he will not bother the king of the North for a few years. 
DAN.11.9	Next, the king of the North will attack the king of the South, but he will be beaten back to his own country.
DAN.11.10	“The sons of the king of the North will prepare for war. They will get a large army together that will move through the land very quickly, like a powerful flood. Later, that army will come back and fight all the way to the strong, walled city of the king of the South. 
DAN.11.11	Then the king of the South will become very angry and will march out to fight against the king of the North. The king of the North will have a large army, but he will lose the battle, 
DAN.11.12	and the soldiers will be carried away. The king of the South will then be very proud and will kill thousands of soldiers from the northern army, but he will not continue to be successful. 
DAN.11.13	The king of the North will gather another army, larger than the first one. After several years he will attack with a large army and many weapons.
DAN.11.14	“In those times many people will be against the king of the South. Some of your own people who love to fight will turn against the king of the South, thinking it is time for God’s promises to come true. But they will fail. 
DAN.11.15	Then the king of the North will come. He will build ramps to the tops of the city walls and will capture a strong, walled city. The southern army will not have the power to fight back; even their best soldiers will not be strong enough to stop the northern army. 
DAN.11.16	So the king of the North will do whatever he wants; no one will be able to stand against him. He will gain power and control in the beautiful land of Israel and will have the power to destroy it. 
DAN.11.17	The king of the North will decide to use all his power to fight against the king of the South, but he will make a peace agreement with the king of the South. The king of the North will give one of his daughters as a wife to the king of the South so that he can defeat him. But those plans will not succeed or help him. 
DAN.11.18	Then the king of the North will turn his attention to cities along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and will capture them. But a commander will put an end to the pride of the king of the North, turning his pride back on him. 
DAN.11.19	After that happens the king of the North will go back to the strong, walled cities of his own country, but he will lose his power. That will be the end of him.
DAN.11.20	“The next king of the North will send out a tax collector so he will have plenty of money. In a few years that ruler will be killed, although he will not die in anger or in a battle.
DAN.11.21	“That ruler will be followed by a very cruel and hated man, who will not have the honor of being from a king’s family. He will attack the kingdom when the people feel safe, and he will take power by lying to the people. 
DAN.11.22	He will sweep away in defeat large and powerful armies and even a prince who made an agreement. 
DAN.11.23	Many nations will make agreements with that cruel and hated ruler, but he will lie to them. He will gain much power, but only a few people will support him. 
DAN.11.24	The richest areas will feel safe, but that cruel and hated ruler will attack them. He will succeed where his ancestors did not. He will rob the countries he defeats and will give those things to his followers. He will plan to defeat and destroy strong cities, but he will be successful for only a short time.
DAN.11.25	“That very cruel and hated ruler will have a large army that he will use to stir up his strength and courage. He will attack the king of the South. The king of the South will gather a large and very powerful army and prepare for war. But the people who are against him will make secret plans, and the king of the South will be defeated. 
DAN.11.26	People who were supposed to be his good friends will try to destroy him. His army will be swept away in defeat; many of his soldiers will be killed in battle. 
DAN.11.27	Those two kings will want to hurt each other. They will sit at the same table and lie to each other, but it will not do either one any good, because God has set a time for their end to come. 
DAN.11.28	The king of the North will go back to his own country with much wealth. Then he will decide to go against the holy agreement. He will take action and then return to his own country.
DAN.11.29	“At the right time the king of the North will attack the king of the South again, but this time he will not be successful as he was before. 
DAN.11.30	Ships from the west will come and fight against the king of the North, so he will be afraid. Then he will return and show his anger against the holy agreement. He will be good to those who have stopped obeying the holy agreement.
DAN.11.31	“The king of the North will send his army to make the Temple in Jerusalem unclean. They will stop the people from offering the daily sacrifice, and then they will set up a blasphemous object that brings destruction. 
DAN.11.32	The king of the North will tell lies and cause those who have not obeyed God to be ruined. But those who know God and obey him will be strong and fight back.
DAN.11.33	“Those who are wise will help the others understand what is happening. But they will be killed with swords, or burned, or taken captive, or robbed of their homes and possessions. These things will continue for many days. 
DAN.11.34	When the wise ones are suffering, they will get a little help, but many who join the wise ones will not help them in their time of need. 
DAN.11.35	Some of the wise ones will be killed. But the hard times must come so they can be made stronger and purer and without faults until the time of the end comes. Then, at the right time, the end will come.
DAN.11.36	“The king of the North will do whatever he wants. He will brag about himself and praise himself and think he is even better than a god. He will say things against the God of gods that no one has ever heard. And he will be successful until all the bad things have happened. Then what God has planned to happen will happen. 
DAN.11.37	The king of the North will not care about the gods his ancestors worshiped or the god that women worship. He won’t care about any god. Instead, he will make himself more important than any god. 
DAN.11.38	The king of the North will worship power and strength, which his ancestors did not worship. He will honor the god of power with gold and silver, expensive jewels and gifts. 
DAN.11.39	That king will attack strong, walled cities with the help of a foreign god. He will give much honor to the people who join him, making them rulers in charge of many other people. And he will make them pay him for the land they rule.
DAN.11.40	“At the time of the end, the king of the South will fight a battle against the king of the North. The king of the North will attack with chariots, soldiers on horses, and many large ships. He will invade many countries and sweep through their lands like a flood. 
DAN.11.41	The king of the North will attack the beautiful land of Judah. He will defeat many countries, but Edom, Moab, and the leaders of Ammon will be saved from him. 
DAN.11.42	The king of the North will show his power in many countries; Egypt will not escape. 
DAN.11.43	The king will get treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of Egypt. The Libyan and Nubian people will obey him. 
DAN.11.44	But the king of the North will hear news from the east and the north that will make him afraid and angry. He will go to destroy completely many nations. 
DAN.11.45	He will set up his royal tents between the sea and the beautiful mountain where the holy Temple is built. But, finally, his end will come, and no one will help him.
DAN.12.1	“At that time Michael, the great prince who protects your people, will stand up. There will be a time of much trouble, the worst time since nations have been on earth, but your people will be saved. Everyone whose name is written in God’s book will be saved. 
DAN.12.2	Many people who have already died will live again. Some of them will wake up to have life forever, but some will wake up to find shame and disgrace forever. 
DAN.12.3	The wise people will shine like the brightness of the sky. Those who teach others to live right will shine like stars forever and ever.
DAN.12.4	“But you, Daniel, close up the book and seal it. These things will happen at the time of the end. Many people will go here and there to find true knowledge.”
DAN.12.5	Then I, Daniel, looked, and saw two other men. One was standing on my side of the river, and the other was standing on the far side. 
DAN.12.6	The man who was dressed in linen was standing over the water in the river. One of the two men spoke to him and asked, “How long will it be before these amazing things come true?”
DAN.12.7	The man dressed in linen, who stood over the water, raised his hands toward heaven. And I heard him swear by the name of God who lives forever, “It will be for three and one-half years. The power of the holy people will finally be broken, and then all these things will come true.”
DAN.12.8	I heard the answer, but I did not really understand, so I asked, “Master, what will happen after all these things come true?”
DAN.12.9	He answered, “Go your way, Daniel. The message is closed up and sealed until the time of the end. 
DAN.12.10	Many people will be made clean, pure, and spotless, but the wicked will continue to be wicked. Those wicked people will not understand these things, but the wise will understand them.
DAN.12.11	“The daily sacrifice will be stopped. Then, after 1,290 days from that time, a blasphemous object that brings destruction will be set up. 
DAN.12.12	Those who wait for the end of the 1,335 days will be happy.
DAN.12.13	“As for you, Daniel, go your way until the end. You will get your rest, and at the end you will rise to receive your reward.”

HOS.2.4	I will not take pity on her children,

HOS.2.5	Their mother has acted like a prostitute;

HOS.2.5	She said, ‘I will chase after my lovers,

HOS.2.16	The L
HOS.2.16	no longer will she call me ‘my baal.’
HOS.2.17	I will never let her say the names of Baal again;

HOS.2.23	I will say, ‘You are my people’

HOS.3.1	The L

HOS.3.3	Then I told her, “You must wait for me for many days. You must not be a prostitute, and you must not have sexual relations with any other man. I will act the same way toward you.”
HOS.3.4	In the same way Israel will live many days without a king or leader, without sacrifices or holy stone pillars, and without the holy vest or an idol. 
HOS.3.5	After this, the people of Israel will return to the L
HOS.4.1	People of Israel, listen to the L
HOS.4.1	The L
HOS.4.1	against you who live in the land:
HOS.4.1	“The people are not true, not loyal to God,
HOS.4.1	nor do those who live in the land even know him.
HOS.4.2	Cursing, lying, killing, stealing and adultery are everywhere.
HOS.4.2	One murder follows another.
HOS.4.3	Because of this the land dries up,
HOS.4.3	and all its people are dying.
HOS.4.3	Even the wild animals and the birds of the air
HOS.4.3	and the fish of the sea are dying.
HOS.4.4	“No one should accuse
HOS.4.4	or blame another person.
HOS.4.4	Don’t blame the people, you priests,
HOS.4.4	when they quarrel with you.
HOS.4.5	You will be ruined in the day,
HOS.4.5	and your prophets will be ruined with you in the night.
HOS.4.5	I will also destroy your mother.
HOS.4.6	My people will be destroyed,
HOS.4.6	because they have no knowledge.
HOS.4.6	You have refused to learn,
HOS.4.6	so I will refuse to let you be priests to me.
HOS.4.6	You have forgotten the teachings of your God,
HOS.4.6	so I will forget your children.
HOS.4.7	The more priests there are,
HOS.4.7	the more they sin against me.
HOS.4.7	I will take away their honor
HOS.4.7	and give them shame.
HOS.4.8	Since the priests live off the sin offerings of the people,
HOS.4.8	they want the people to sin more and more.
HOS.4.9	The priests are as wrong as the people,
HOS.4.9	and I will punish them both for what they have done.
HOS.4.9	I will repay them for the wrong they have done.
HOS.4.10	“They will eat
HOS.4.10	but not have enough;
HOS.4.10	they will have sexual relations with the prostitutes,
HOS.4.10	but they will not have children,
HOS.4.10	because they have left the L
HOS.4.10	to give themselves to 
HOS.4.11	prostitution,
HOS.4.11	to old and new wine,
HOS.4.11	which take away their ability to understand.
HOS.4.12	“My people ask wooden idols for advice;
HOS.4.12	they ask those sticks of wood to advise them!
HOS.4.12	Like prostitutes, they have chased after other gods
HOS.4.12	and have left their own God.
HOS.4.13	They make sacrifices on the tops of the mountains.
HOS.4.13	They burn offerings on the hills,
HOS.4.13	under oaks, poplars, and other trees,
HOS.4.13	because their shade is nice.
HOS.4.13	So your daughters become prostitutes,
HOS.4.13	and your daughters-in-law are guilty of adultery.
HOS.4.14	“But I will not punish your daughters
HOS.4.14	for becoming prostitutes,
HOS.4.14	nor your daughters-in-law
HOS.4.14	for their sins of adultery.
HOS.4.14	I will not punish them,
HOS.4.14	because the men have sexual relations with prostitutes
HOS.4.14	and offer sacrifices with the temple prostitutes.
HOS.4.14	A foolish people will be ruined.
HOS.4.15	“Israel, you act like a prostitute,
HOS.4.15	but do not be guilty toward the L
HOS.4.15	Don’t go to Gilgal
HOS.4.15	or go up to Beth Aven.

HOS.4.18	they love these disgraceful ways.
HOS.4.19	They will be swept away as if by a whirlwind,
HOS.4.19	and their sacrifices will bring them only shame.
HOS.5.1	“Listen, you priests.
HOS.5.1	Pay attention, people of Israel.
HOS.5.1	Listen, royal family,
HOS.5.1	because you will all be judged.
HOS.5.1	You have been like a trap at Mizpah
HOS.5.1	and like a net spread out at Mount Tabor.
HOS.5.2	You have done many evil things,
HOS.5.2	so I will punish you all.
HOS.5.3	I know all about the people of Israel;
HOS.5.3	what they have done is not hidden from me.
HOS.5.3	Now that Israel acts like a prostitute,
HOS.5.3	it has made itself unclean.
HOS.5.4	“They will not give up their deeds
HOS.5.4	and return to their God.
HOS.5.4	They are determined to be unfaithful to me;
HOS.5.4	they do not know the L
HOS.5.5	Israel’s pride testifies against them.
HOS.5.5	The people of Israel will stumble because of their sin,
HOS.5.5	and the people of Judah will stumble with them.
HOS.5.6	They will come to worship the L
HOS.5.6	bringing their flocks and herds,
HOS.5.6	but they will not be able to find him,
HOS.5.6	because he has left them.
HOS.5.7	They have not been true to the L
HOS.5.7	they are children who do not belong to him.
HOS.5.7	So their false worship
HOS.5.7	will destroy them and their land.
HOS.5.8	“Blow the horn in Gibeah
HOS.5.8	and the trumpet in Ramah.
HOS.5.8	Give the warning at Beth Aven,
HOS.5.8	and be first into battle, people of Benjamin.
HOS.5.9	Israel will be ruined
HOS.5.9	on the day of punishment.
HOS.5.9	To the tribes of Israel
HOS.5.9	I tell the truth.
HOS.5.10	The leaders of Judah are like those
HOS.5.10	who steal other people’s land.
HOS.5.10	I will pour my punishment over them
HOS.5.10	like a flood of water.
HOS.5.11	Israel is crushed by the punishment,
HOS.5.11	because it decided to follow idols.
HOS.5.12	I am like a moth to Israel,
HOS.5.12	like a rot to the people of Judah.
HOS.5.13	“When Israel saw its illness
HOS.5.13	and Judah saw its wounds,
HOS.5.13	Israel went to Assyria for help
HOS.5.13	and sent to the great king of Assyria.
HOS.5.13	But he cannot heal you
HOS.5.13	or cure your wounds.
HOS.5.14	I will be like a lion to Israel,
HOS.5.14	like a young lion to Judah.
HOS.5.14	I will attack them
HOS.5.14	and tear them to pieces.
HOS.5.14	I will drag them off,
HOS.5.14	and no one will be able to save them.
HOS.5.15	Then I will go back to my place
HOS.5.15	until they suffer for their guilt and turn back to me.
HOS.5.15	In their trouble they will look for me.”

HOS.7.9	Israel is weak and feeble, like an old man,

HOS.7.15	Though I trained them and gave them strength,

HOS.7.16	They did not turn to the Most High God.
HOS.7.16	They are like a loose bow that can’t shoot.

HOS.9.3	and in Assyria they will eat food that they are not allowed to eat.
HOS.9.4	The Israelites will not give offerings of wine to the L
HOS.9.4	they will not give him sacrifices.
HOS.9.4	Their sacrifices will be like food that is eaten at a funeral;
HOS.9.4	it is unclean, and everyone who eats it becomes unclean.
HOS.9.4	Their food will only satisfy their hunger;
HOS.9.4	they cannot sacrifice it in the Temple.
HOS.9.5	What will you do then on the day of feasts
HOS.9.5	and on the day of the L
HOS.9.6	Even if the people are not destroyed,
HOS.9.6	Egypt will capture them;
HOS.9.6	Memphis will bury them.
HOS.9.6	Weeds will grow over their silver treasures,
HOS.9.6	and thorns will drive them out of their tents.
HOS.9.7	The time of punishment has come,
HOS.9.7	the time to pay for sins.
HOS.9.7	Let Israel know this:
HOS.9.7	You think the prophet is a fool,
HOS.9.7	and you say the spiritual person is crazy.
HOS.9.7	You have sinned very much,
HOS.9.7	and your hatred is great.
HOS.9.8	Is Israel a watchman?
HOS.9.8	Are God’s people prophets?
HOS.9.8	Everywhere Israel goes, traps are set for him.
HOS.9.8	He is an enemy in God’s house.
HOS.9.9	The people of Israel have gone deep into sin
HOS.9.9	as the people of Gibeah did.
HOS.9.9	The Lord will remember the evil things they have done,
HOS.9.9	and he will punish their sins.
HOS.9.10	“When I found Israel,
HOS.9.10	it was like finding grapes in the desert.
HOS.9.10	Your ancestors were like
HOS.9.10	finding the first figs on the fig tree.
HOS.9.10	But when they came to Baal Peor,
HOS.9.10	they began worshiping an idol,
HOS.9.10	and they became as hateful as the thing they worshiped.
HOS.9.11	Israel’s glory will fly away like a bird;
HOS.9.11	there will be no more pregnancy, no more births, no more getting pregnant.
HOS.9.12	But even if the Israelites bring up children,
HOS.9.12	I will take them all away.
HOS.9.12	How terrible it will be for them
HOS.9.12	when I go away from them!
HOS.9.13	I have seen Israel, like Tyre,
HOS.9.13	given a pleasant place.
HOS.9.13	But the people of Israel will soon bring out
HOS.9.13	their children to be killed.”
HOS.9.14	L
HOS.9.14	What will you give them?
HOS.9.14	Make their women unable to have children;
HOS.9.14	give them dried-up breasts that cannot feed their babies.
HOS.9.15	“The Israelites were very wicked in Gilgal,
HOS.9.15	so I have hated them there.
HOS.9.15	Because of the sinful things they have done,
HOS.9.15	I will force them to leave my land.
HOS.9.15	I will no longer love them;
HOS.9.15	their leaders have turned against me.
HOS.9.16	Israel is beaten down;
HOS.9.16	its root is dying, and it has no fruit.
HOS.9.16	If they have more children,
HOS.9.16	I will kill the children they love.”
HOS.9.17	God will reject them,
HOS.9.17	because they have not obeyed him;
HOS.9.17	they will wander among the nations.
HOS.10.1	Israel is like a large vine
HOS.10.1	that produced plenty of fruit.
HOS.10.1	As the people became richer,
HOS.10.1	they built more altars for idols.
HOS.10.1	As their land became better,
HOS.10.1	they put up better stone pillars to honor gods.
HOS.10.2	Their heart was false,
HOS.10.2	and now they must pay for their guilt.
HOS.10.2	The L
HOS.10.2	he will destroy their holy stone pillars.
HOS.10.3	Then they will say, “We have no king,
HOS.10.3	because we didn’t honor the L
HOS.10.3	As for the king,
HOS.10.3	he couldn’t do anything for us.”
HOS.10.4	They make many false promises
HOS.10.4	and agreements which they don’t keep.
HOS.10.4	So people sue each other in court;
HOS.10.4	they are like poisonous weeds growing in a plowed field.
HOS.10.5	The people from Israel are worried about
HOS.10.5	the calf-shaped idol at Beth Aven.
HOS.10.5	The people will cry about it,
HOS.10.5	and the priests will cry about it.
HOS.10.5	They used to shout for joy about its glory,
HOS.10.6	but it will be carried off to Assyria
HOS.10.6	as a gift to the great king.
HOS.10.6	Israel will be disgraced,
HOS.10.6	and the people will be ashamed for not obeying.
HOS.10.7	Israel will be destroyed;
HOS.10.7	its king will be like a chip of wood floating on the water.
HOS.10.8	The places of false worship will be destroyed,
HOS.10.8	the places where Israel sins.
HOS.10.8	Thorns and weeds will grow up
HOS.10.8	and cover their altars.
HOS.10.8	Then they will say to the mountains, “Cover us!”
HOS.10.8	and to the hills, “Fall on us!”
HOS.10.9	“Israel, you have sinned since the time of Gibeah,
HOS.10.9	and the people there have continued sinning.
HOS.10.9	But war will surely overwhelm them in Gibeah,
HOS.10.9	because of the evil they have done there.
HOS.10.10	When I am ready,
HOS.10.10	I will come to punish them.
HOS.10.10	Nations will come together against them,
HOS.10.10	and they will be punished for their double sins.
HOS.10.11	Israel is like a well-trained young cow
HOS.10.11	that likes to thresh grain.
HOS.10.11	I will put a yoke on her neck
HOS.10.11	and make her work hard in the field.
HOS.10.11	Israel will plow,
HOS.10.11	and Judah will break up the ground.
HOS.10.12	I said, ‘Plant goodness,
HOS.10.12	harvest the fruit of loyalty,
HOS.10.12	plow the new ground of knowledge.
HOS.10.12	Look for the L
HOS.10.12	and pours goodness on you like water.’
HOS.10.13	But you have plowed evil
HOS.10.13	and harvested trouble;
HOS.10.13	you have eaten the fruit of your lies.
HOS.10.13	Because you have trusted in your own power
HOS.10.13	and your many soldiers,
HOS.10.14	your people will hear the noise of battle,
HOS.10.14	and all your strong, walled cities will be destroyed.
HOS.10.14	It will be like the time King Shalman
HOS.10.14	destroyed Beth Arbel in battle,
HOS.10.14	when mothers and their children were bashed to death.
HOS.10.15	The same will happen to you, people of Bethel,
HOS.10.15	because you did so much evil.
HOS.10.15	When the sun comes up,
HOS.10.15	the king of Israel will die.
HOS.11.1	“When Israel was a child, I loved him,
HOS.11.1	and I called my son out of Egypt.
HOS.11.2	But when I called the people of Israel,
HOS.11.2	they went away from me.
HOS.11.2	They offered sacrifices to the Baals
HOS.11.2	and burned incense to the idols.
HOS.11.3	It was I who taught Israel to walk,
HOS.11.3	and I took them by the arms,
HOS.11.3	but they did not understand
HOS.11.3	that I had healed them.
HOS.11.4	I led them with cords of human kindness,
HOS.11.4	with ropes of love.
HOS.11.4	I lifted the yoke from their neck
HOS.11.4	and bent down and fed them.
HOS.11.5	“The Israelites will become captives again, as they were in Egypt,
HOS.11.5	and Assyria will become their king,
HOS.11.5	because they refuse to turn back to God.
HOS.11.6	War will sweep through their cities
HOS.11.6	and will destroy them
HOS.11.6	and kill them because of their wicked plans.
HOS.11.7	My people have made up their minds
HOS.11.7	to turn away from me.
HOS.11.7	The prophets call them to turn to me,
HOS.11.7	but none of them honors me at all.
HOS.11.8	“Israel, how can I give you up?
HOS.11.8	How can I give you away, Israel?
HOS.11.8	I don’t want to make you like Admah
HOS.11.8	or treat you like Zeboiim.
HOS.11.8	My heart beats for you,
HOS.11.8	and my love for you stirs up my pity.
HOS.11.9	I won’t punish you in my anger,
HOS.11.9	and I won’t destroy Israel again.
HOS.11.9	I am God and not a human;
HOS.11.9	I am the Holy One, and I am among you.
HOS.11.9	I will not come against you in anger.
HOS.11.10	They will go after the L
HOS.11.10	and he will roar like a lion.
HOS.11.10	When he roars,
HOS.11.10	his children will hurry to him from the west.
HOS.11.11	They will come swiftly
HOS.11.11	like birds from Egypt
HOS.11.11	and like doves from Assyria.
HOS.11.11	I will settle them again in their homes,”
HOS.11.11	says the L
HOS.11.12	Israel has surrounded me with lies;
HOS.11.12	the people have made evil plans.
HOS.11.12	And Judah turns against God,
HOS.11.12	the faithful Holy One.
HOS.12.1	What Israel does is as useless as chasing the wind;
HOS.12.1	he chases the east wind all day.
HOS.12.1	They tell more and more lies
HOS.12.1	and do more and more violence.
HOS.12.1	They make agreements with Assyria,
HOS.12.1	and they send a gift of olive oil to Egypt.
HOS.12.2	The L
HOS.12.2	He will punish Israel for what they have done;
HOS.12.2	he will give them what they deserve.
HOS.12.3	Their ancestor Jacob held on to his brother’s heel
HOS.12.3	while the two of them were being born.
HOS.12.3	When he grew to be a man,
HOS.12.3	he wrestled with God.
HOS.12.4	When Jacob wrestled with the angel and won,
HOS.12.4	he cried and asked for his blessing.
HOS.12.4	Later, God met with him at Bethel
HOS.12.4	and spoke with him there.
HOS.12.5	It was the L
HOS.12.5	the L
HOS.12.6	You must return to your God;
HOS.12.6	love him, do what is just,
HOS.12.6	and always trust in him as your God.
HOS.12.7	The merchants use dishonest scales;
HOS.12.7	they like to cheat people.
HOS.12.8	Israel said, “I am rich! I am someone with power!”
HOS.12.8	All their money will do them no good
HOS.12.8	because of the sins they have done.
HOS.12.9	“But I am the L
HOS.12.9	who brought you out of Egypt.
HOS.12.9	I will make you live in tents again
HOS.12.9	as you used to do on worship days.
HOS.12.10	I spoke to the prophets
HOS.12.10	and gave them many visions;
HOS.12.10	through them, I taught my lessons to you.”
HOS.12.11	The people of Gilead are evil,
HOS.12.11	worth nothing.
HOS.12.11	Though people sacrifice bulls at Gilgal,
HOS.12.11	their altars will become like piles of stone
HOS.12.11	in a plowed field.
HOS.12.12	Your ancestor Jacob fled to Northwest Mesopotamia
HOS.12.12	where he worked to get a wife;
HOS.12.12	he tended sheep to pay for her.
HOS.12.13	Later the L
HOS.12.13	to bring Jacob’s descendants out of Egypt;
HOS.12.13	he used a prophet
HOS.12.13	to take care of the Israelites.
HOS.12.14	But the Israelites made the Lord angry when they killed other people,
HOS.12.14	and they deserve to die for their crimes.
HOS.12.14	The Lord will make them pay
HOS.12.14	for the disgraceful things they have done.
HOS.13.1	People used to fear the tribe of Ephraim;
HOS.13.1	they were important people in Israel.
HOS.13.1	But they sinned by worshiping Baal,
HOS.13.1	so they must die.
HOS.13.2	But they still keep on sinning more and more.
HOS.13.2	They make idols of their silver,
HOS.13.2	idols that are cleverly made,
HOS.13.2	the work of a craftsman.
HOS.13.2	Yet the people of Israel say to each other,
HOS.13.2	“Kiss those calf idols and sacrifice to them.”
HOS.13.3	So those people will be like the morning mist;
HOS.13.3	they will disappear like the morning dew.
HOS.13.3	They will be like chaff blown from the threshing floor,
HOS.13.3	like smoke going out a window.
HOS.13.4	“I, the L
HOS.13.4	since you were in the land of Egypt.
HOS.13.4	You should have known no other God except me.
HOS.13.4	I am the only one who saves.
HOS.13.5	I cared for them in the desert
HOS.13.5	where it was hot and dry.
HOS.13.6	I gave them food, and they became full and satisfied.
HOS.13.6	But then they became too proud and forgot me.
HOS.13.7	That is why I will be like a lion to them,
HOS.13.7	like a leopard waiting by the road.
HOS.13.8	I will attack like a bear robbed of her cubs,
HOS.13.8	ripping their bodies open.
HOS.13.8	I will devour them like a lion
HOS.13.8	and tear them apart like a wild animal.
HOS.13.9	“Israel, I will destroy you.
HOS.13.9	Who will be your helper then?
HOS.13.10	What good is your king?
HOS.13.10	Can he save you in any of your towns?
HOS.13.10	What good are your leaders?
HOS.13.10	You said, ‘Give us a king and leaders.’
HOS.13.11	So I gave you a king, but only in anger,
HOS.13.11	and I took him away in my great anger.
HOS.13.12	The sins of Israel are on record,
HOS.13.12	stored away, waiting for punishment.
HOS.13.13	The pain of birth will come for him,
HOS.13.13	but he is like a foolish baby
HOS.13.13	who won’t come out of its mother’s womb.
HOS.13.14	Will I save them from the place of the dead?
HOS.13.14	Will I rescue them from death?
HOS.13.14	Where is your sickness, death?
HOS.13.14	Where is your pain, place of death?
HOS.13.14	I will show them no mercy.
HOS.13.15	Israel is doing well among the nations,
HOS.13.15	but the L
HOS.13.15	coming from the desert,
HOS.13.15	that will dry up his springs and wells of water.
HOS.13.15	He will destroy from their treasure houses everything of value.
HOS.13.16	The nation of Israel will be ruined,
HOS.13.16	because it fought against God.
HOS.13.16	The people of Israel will die in war;
HOS.13.16	their children will be torn to pieces,
HOS.13.16	and their pregnant women will be ripped open.”
HOS.14.1	Israel, return to the L
HOS.14.1	because your sins have made you fall.
HOS.14.2	Come back to the L
HOS.14.2	and say these words to him:
HOS.14.2	“Take away all our sin
HOS.14.2	and kindly receive us,
HOS.14.2	and we will keep the promises we made to you.
HOS.14.3	Assyria cannot save us,
HOS.14.3	nor will we trust in our horses.
HOS.14.3	We will not say again, ‘Our gods,’
HOS.14.3	to the things our hands have made.
HOS.14.3	You show mercy to orphans.”
HOS.14.4	The L
HOS.14.4	“I will forgive them for leaving me
HOS.14.4	and will love them freely,
HOS.14.4	because I am not angry with them anymore.
HOS.14.5	I will be like the dew to Israel,
HOS.14.5	and they will blossom like a lily.
HOS.14.5	Like the cedar trees in Lebanon,
HOS.14.5	their roots will be firm.
HOS.14.6	They will be like spreading branches,
HOS.14.6	like the beautiful olive trees

HOS.14.7	The people of Israel will again live under my protection.
HOS.14.7	They will grow like the grain,
HOS.14.7	they will bloom like a vine,

HOS.14.8	Israel, have nothing to do with idols.

JOL.2.19	No more will I shame you
JOL.2.19	among the nations.
JOL.2.20	I will force the army from the north to leave your land
JOL.2.20	and go into a dry, empty land.
JOL.2.20	Their soldiers in front will be forced into the Dead Sea,
JOL.2.20	and those in the rear into the Mediterranean Sea.
JOL.2.20	Their bodies will rot and stink.
JOL.2.20	The L

JOL.2.22	because the open pastures have grown grass.
JOL.2.22	The trees have given fruit;
JOL.2.22	the fig trees and the grapevines have grown much fruit.
JOL.2.23	So be happy, people of Jerusalem;

JOL.2.23	Because he does what is right,
JOL.2.23	he has brought you rain;
JOL.2.23	he has sent the fall rain

JOL.2.24	And the threshing floors will be full of grain;
JOL.2.24	the barrels will overflow with new wine and olive oil.
JOL.2.25	“Though I sent my great army against you—
JOL.2.25	those swarming locusts and hopping locusts,
JOL.2.25	the destroying locusts and the cutting locusts that ate your crops—

JOL.2.25	for those years of trouble.

JOL.2.26	You will praise the name of the L

JOL.2.28	Your sons and daughters will prophesy,

AMO.6.4	You eat tender lambs
AMO.6.4	and fattened calves.
AMO.6.5	You make up songs on your harps,
AMO.6.5	and, like David, you compose songs on musical instruments.
AMO.6.6	You drink wine by the bowlful
AMO.6.6	and use the best perfumed lotions.
AMO.6.6	But you are not sad over the ruin of Israel,
AMO.6.7	so you will be some of the first ones taken as slaves.
AMO.6.7	Your feasting and lying around will come to an end.
AMO.6.8	The Lord G
AMO.6.8	“I hate the pride of the Israelites,
AMO.6.8	and I hate their strong buildings,
AMO.6.8	so I will let the enemy take the city
AMO.6.8	and everything in it.”
AMO.6.9	At that time there might be only ten people left alive in just one house, but they will also die. 
AMO.6.10	When the relatives come to get the bodies to take them outside, one of them will call to the other and ask, “Are there any other dead bodies with you?”
AMO.6.10	That person will answer, “No.”
AMO.6.10	Then the one who asked will say, “Hush! We must not say the name of the L
AMO.6.11	The L
AMO.6.11	the large house will be broken into pieces,
AMO.6.11	and the small house into bits.
AMO.6.12	Horses do not run on rocks,
AMO.6.12	and people do not plow rocks with oxen.
AMO.6.12	But you have changed fairness into poison;
AMO.6.12	you have changed what is right into a bitter taste.
AMO.6.13	You are happy that the town of Lo Debar was captured,
AMO.6.13	and you say, “We have taken Karnaim by our own strength.”
AMO.6.14	The L
AMO.6.14	“Israel, I will bring a nation against you
AMO.6.14	that will make your people suffer from Lebo Hamath in the north
AMO.6.14	to the valley south of the Dead Sea.”
AMO.7.1	This is what the Lord G
AMO.7.2	When the locusts ate all the crops in the country, I said, “Lord G
AMO.7.3	So the L
AMO.7.4	This is what the Lord G
AMO.7.5	Then I cried out, “Lord G
AMO.7.6	So the L
AMO.7.7	This is what he showed me: The Lord stood by a straight wall, with a plumb line in his hand. 
AMO.7.8	The L
AMO.7.8	I said, “A plumb line.”
AMO.7.8	Then the Lord said, “See, I will put a plumb line among my people Israel to show how crooked they are. I will not look the other way any longer.
AMO.7.9	“The places where Isaac’s descendants worship will be destroyed,
AMO.7.9	Israel’s holy places will be turned into ruins,
AMO.7.9	and I will attack King Jeroboam’s family with the sword.”
AMO.7.10	Amaziah, a priest at Bethel, sent this message to Jeroboam king of Israel: “Amos is making evil plans against you with the people of Israel. He has been speaking so much that this land can’t hold all his words. 
AMO.7.11	This is what Amos has said:
AMO.7.11	‘Jeroboam will die by the sword,
AMO.7.11	and the people of Israel will be taken as captives
AMO.7.11	out of their own country.’ ”
AMO.7.12	Then Amaziah said to Amos, “Seer, go back right now to Judah. Do your prophesying and earn your living there, 
AMO.7.13	but don’t prophesy anymore here at Bethel. This is the king’s holy place, and it is the nation’s temple.”
AMO.7.14	Then Amos answered Amaziah, “I do not make my living as a prophet, nor am I a member of a group of prophets. I make my living as a shepherd, and I take care of sycamore trees. 
AMO.7.15	But the L
AMO.7.16	So listen to the L
AMO.7.16	‘Don’t prophesy against Israel,
AMO.7.16	and stop prophesying against the descendants of Isaac.’
AMO.7.17	“Because you have said this, the L
AMO.7.17	‘Your wife will become a prostitute in the city,
AMO.7.17	and your sons and daughters will be killed with swords.
AMO.7.17	Other people will measure your land and divide it among themselves,
AMO.7.17	and you will die in a foreign country.
AMO.7.17	The people of Israel will definitely be taken
AMO.7.17	from their own land as captives.’ ”
AMO.8.1	This is what the Lord G
AMO.8.2	He said to me, “Amos, what do you see?”
AMO.8.2	I said, “A basket of summer fruit.”
AMO.8.2	Then the L
AMO.8.3	“On that day the palace songs will become funeral songs,” says the Lord G
AMO.8.4	Listen to me, you who walk on helpless people,
AMO.8.4	you who are trying to destroy the poor people of this country, saying,
AMO.8.5	“When will the New Moon festival be over
AMO.8.5	so we can sell grain?
AMO.8.5	When will the Sabbath be over
AMO.8.5	so we can bring out wheat to sell?
AMO.8.5	We can charge them more
AMO.8.5	and give them less,
AMO.8.5	and we can change the scales to cheat the people.
AMO.8.6	We will buy poor people for silver,
AMO.8.6	and needy people for the price of a pair of sandals.
AMO.8.6	We will even sell the wheat that was swept up from the floor.”
AMO.8.7	The L
AMO.8.8	The whole land will shake because of it,
AMO.8.8	and everyone who lives in the land will cry for those who died.
AMO.8.8	The whole land will rise like the Nile;
AMO.8.8	it will be shaken, and then it will fall
AMO.8.8	like the Nile River in Egypt.”
AMO.8.9	The Lord G
AMO.8.9	“At that time I will cause the sun to go down at noon
AMO.8.9	and make the earth dark on a bright day.
AMO.8.10	I will change your festivals into days of crying for the dead,
AMO.8.10	and all your songs will become songs of sadness.
AMO.8.10	I will make all of you wear rough cloth to show your sadness;
AMO.8.10	I will make you shave your heads as well.
AMO.8.10	I will make it like a time of crying for the death of an only son,
AMO.8.10	and its end like the end of an awful day.”
AMO.8.11	The Lord G
AMO.8.11	when I will cause a time of hunger in the land.
AMO.8.11	The people will not be hungry for bread or thirsty for water,
AMO.8.11	but they will be hungry for words from the L
AMO.8.12	They will wander from the Mediterranean Sea to the Dead Sea,
AMO.8.12	from the north to the east.
AMO.8.12	They will search for the word of the L
AMO.8.12	but they won’t find it.
AMO.8.13	At that time the beautiful young women and the young men
AMO.8.13	will become weak from thirst.
AMO.8.14	They make promises by the idol in Samaria
AMO.8.14	and say, ‘As surely as the god of Dan lives … ’
AMO.8.14	and, ‘As surely as the god of Beersheba lives, we promise . . . ’
AMO.8.14	So they will fall
AMO.8.14	and never get up again.”
AMO.9.1	I saw the Lord standing by the altar, and he said:
AMO.9.1	“Smash the top of the pillars
AMO.9.1	so that even the bottom of the doors will shake.
AMO.9.1	Make the pillars fall on the people’s heads;
AMO.9.1	anyone left alive I will kill with a sword.
AMO.9.1	Not one person will get away;
AMO.9.1	no one will escape.
AMO.9.2	If they dig down as deep as the place of the dead,
AMO.9.2	I will pull them up from there.
AMO.9.2	If they climb up into heaven,
AMO.9.2	I will bring them down from there.
AMO.9.3	If they hide at the top of Mount Carmel,
AMO.9.3	I will find them and take them away.
AMO.9.3	If they try to hide from me at the bottom of the sea,
AMO.9.3	I will command a snake to bite them.
AMO.9.4	If they are captured and taken away by their enemies,
AMO.9.4	I will command the sword to kill them.
AMO.9.4	I will keep watch over them,
AMO.9.4	but I will keep watch to give them trouble, not to do them good.”
AMO.9.5	The Lord G
AMO.9.5	and the land shakes.
AMO.9.5	Then everyone who lives in the land cries for the dead.
AMO.9.5	The whole land rises like the Nile River

JON.1.14	So the men cried to the L

MIC.2.4	‘We are completely ruined;
MIC.2.4	the L
MIC.2.4	Yes, he has taken it away from me
MIC.2.4	and divided our fields among our enemies!’ ”
MIC.2.5	So you will have no one from the 
MIC.2.5	to throw lots to divide the land.
MIC.2.6	The prophets say, “Don’t prophesy to us!
MIC.2.6	Don’t prophesy about these things!
MIC.2.6	Nothing to make us feel bad will happen!”
MIC.2.7	But I must say this, people of Jacob:
MIC.2.7	The L
MIC.2.7	My words are welcome
MIC.2.7	to the person who does what is right.
MIC.2.8	But you are fighting against my people like an enemy.
MIC.2.8	You take the coats from people who pass by;
MIC.2.8	you rob them of their safety;
MIC.2.8	you plan war.
MIC.2.9	You’ve forced the women of my people
MIC.2.9	from their nice houses;
MIC.2.9	you’ve taken my glory
MIC.2.9	from their children forever.
MIC.2.10	Get up and leave.
MIC.2.10	This is not your place of rest anymore.
MIC.2.10	You have made this place unclean,
MIC.2.10	and it is doomed to destruction.
MIC.2.11	But you people want a false prophet
MIC.2.11	who will tell you nothing but lies.
MIC.2.11	You want one who promises to prophesy good things for you
MIC.2.11	if you give him wine and beer.
MIC.2.11	He’s just the prophet for you.
MIC.2.12	“Yes, people of Jacob, I will bring all of you together;
MIC.2.12	I will bring together all those left alive in Israel.
MIC.2.12	I will put them together like sheep in a pen,
MIC.2.12	like a flock in its pasture;
MIC.2.12	the place will be filled with many people.
MIC.2.13	Someone will open the way and lead the people out.
MIC.2.13	The people will break through the gate and leave the city where they were held captive.
MIC.2.13	Their king will go out in front of them,
MIC.2.13	and the L
MIC.3.1	Then I said,
MIC.3.1	“Listen, leaders of the people of Jacob;
MIC.3.1	listen, you rulers of the nation of Israel.
MIC.3.1	You should know how to decide cases fairly,
MIC.3.2	but you hate good and love evil.
MIC.3.2	You skin my people alive
MIC.3.2	and tear the flesh off their bones.
MIC.3.3	You eat my people’s flesh
MIC.3.3	and skin them and break their bones;
MIC.3.3	you chop them up like meat for the pot,
MIC.3.3	like meat in a cooking pan.
MIC.3.4	They will cry to the L
MIC.3.4	but he won’t answer them.
MIC.3.4	At that time he will hide his face from them,
MIC.3.4	because what they have done is evil.”
MIC.3.5	The L
MIC.3.5	“If these prophets are given food to eat,
MIC.3.5	they shout, ‘Peace!’
MIC.3.5	But if someone doesn’t give them what they ask for,
MIC.3.5	they call for a holy war against that person.
MIC.3.6	So it will become like night for them, without visions.
MIC.3.6	It will become dark for them, without any way to tell the future.
MIC.3.6	The sun is about to set for the prophets;
MIC.3.6	their day will become dark.
MIC.3.7	The seers will be ashamed;
MIC.3.7	the people who see the future will be embarrassed.
MIC.3.7	Yes, all of them will cover their mouths,
MIC.3.7	because there will be no answer from God.”
MIC.3.8	But I am filled with power,
MIC.3.8	with the Spirit of the L
MIC.3.8	and with justice and strength,
MIC.3.8	to tell the people of Jacob how they have turned against God,
MIC.3.8	and the people of Israel how they have sinned.
MIC.3.9	Leaders of Jacob and rulers of Israel,
MIC.3.9	listen to me,
MIC.3.9	you who hate fairness
MIC.3.9	and twist what is right.
MIC.3.10	You build Jerusalem by murdering people;
MIC.3.10	you build it with evil.
MIC.3.11	Its judges take money
MIC.3.11	to decide who wins in court.
MIC.3.11	Its priests only teach for pay,
MIC.3.11	and its prophets only look into the future when they get paid.
MIC.3.11	But they lean on the L
MIC.3.11	“The L
MIC.3.11	so nothing bad will happen to us.”
MIC.3.12	Because of you,
MIC.3.12	Jerusalem will be plowed like a field.
MIC.3.12	The city will become a pile of rocks,
MIC.3.12	and the hill on which the Temple stands will be covered with bushes.
MIC.4.1	In the last days
MIC.4.1	the mountain on which the 
MIC.4.1	will become the most important of all mountains.
MIC.4.1	It will be raised above the hills,
MIC.4.1	and people from other nations will come streaming to it.
MIC.4.2	Many nations will come and say,
MIC.4.2	“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the L
MIC.4.2	to the Temple of the God of Jacob,
MIC.4.2	so that he can teach us his ways,
MIC.4.2	and we can obey his teachings.”
MIC.4.2	His teachings will go out from Jerusalem,
MIC.4.2	the word of the L
MIC.4.3	The Lord will judge many nations;
MIC.4.3	he will make decisions about strong nations that are far away.
MIC.4.3	They will hammer their swords into plow blades
MIC.4.3	and their spears into hooks for trimming trees.
MIC.4.3	Nations will no longer raise swords against other nations;
MIC.4.3	they will not train for war anymore.
MIC.4.4	Everyone will sit under his own vine and fig tree,
MIC.4.4	and no one will make him afraid,
MIC.4.4	because the L
MIC.4.5	All other nations may follow their own gods,
MIC.4.5	but we will follow the L
MIC.4.6	The L
MIC.4.6	I will gather the crippled;
MIC.4.6	I will bring together those who were sent away,
MIC.4.6	those whom I caused to have trouble.
MIC.4.7	I will keep alive those who were crippled,
MIC.4.7	and I will make a strong nation of those who were sent away.
MIC.4.7	The L
MIC.4.8	And you, watchtower of the flocks, hill of Jerusalem,
MIC.4.8	to you will come the kingdom as in the past.
MIC.4.8	Jerusalem, the right to rule will come again to you.”
MIC.4.9	Now, why do you cry so loudly?
MIC.4.9	Is your king gone?
MIC.4.9	Have you lost your helper,
MIC.4.9	so that you are in pain, like a woman trying to give birth?
MIC.4.10	People of Jerusalem, strain and be in pain.
MIC.4.10	Be like a woman trying to give birth,
MIC.4.10	because now you must leave the city
MIC.4.10	and live in the field.
MIC.4.10	You will go to Babylon,
MIC.4.10	but you will be saved from that place.
MIC.4.10	The L
MIC.4.10	and buy you back from your enemies.
MIC.4.11	But now many nations
MIC.4.11	have come to fight against you,
MIC.4.11	saying, “Let’s destroy Jerusalem.
MIC.4.11	We will look at her and be glad we have defeated her.”
MIC.4.12	But they don’t know
MIC.4.12	what the L
MIC.4.12	they don’t understand his plan.
MIC.4.12	He has gathered them like bundles of grain to the threshing floor.
MIC.4.13	“Get up and beat them, people of Jerusalem.
MIC.4.13	I will make you strong as if you had horns of iron
MIC.4.13	and hoofs of bronze.
MIC.4.13	You will beat many nations into small pieces
MIC.4.13	and give their wealth to the L
MIC.4.13	their treasure to the Lord of all the earth.”
MIC.5.1	So, strong city, gather your soldiers together,
MIC.5.1	because we are surrounded and attacked.
MIC.5.1	They will hit the leader of Israel
MIC.5.1	in the face with a club.
MIC.5.2	“But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
MIC.5.2	though you are too small to be among the army groups from Judah,
MIC.5.2	from you will come one who will rule Israel for me.
MIC.5.2	He comes from very old times,
MIC.5.2	from days long ago.”
MIC.5.3	The L
MIC.5.3	until the one who is having a baby gives birth;
MIC.5.3	then the rest of his relatives will return
MIC.5.3	to the people of Israel.
MIC.5.4	At that time the ruler of Israel will stand
MIC.5.4	and take care of his people
MIC.5.4	with the 
MIC.5.4	and with the power of the name of the L
MIC.5.4	The Israelites will live in safety,
MIC.5.4	because his greatness will reach all over the earth.
MIC.5.5	He will bring peace.
MIC.5.5	Assyria will surely come into our country
MIC.5.5	and walk over our large buildings.
MIC.5.5	We will set up seven shepherds,
MIC.5.5	eight leaders of the people.
MIC.5.6	They will destroy the Assyrians with their swords;
MIC.5.6	they will conquer the land of Assyria with their swords drawn.
MIC.5.6	They will rescue us from the Assyrians when they come into our land,
MIC.5.6	when they walk over our borders.
MIC.5.7	Then the people of Jacob who are left alive
MIC.5.7	will be to other people
MIC.5.7	like dew from the L
MIC.5.7	or rain on the grass—
MIC.5.7	it does not wait for human beings;
MIC.5.7	it does not pause for any person.
MIC.5.8	Those of Jacob’s people who are left alive
MIC.5.8	will be scattered among many nations and peoples.
MIC.5.8	They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest,
MIC.5.8	like a young lion in a flock of sheep:
MIC.5.8	As it goes, it jumps on them
MIC.5.8	and tears them to pieces,
MIC.5.8	and no one can save them.
MIC.5.9	So you will raise your fist in victory over your enemies,
MIC.5.9	and all your enemies will be destroyed.
MIC.5.10	The L
MIC.5.10	I will take your horses from you
MIC.5.10	and destroy your chariots.
MIC.5.11	I will destroy the cities in your country
MIC.5.11	and tear down all your defenses.
MIC.5.12	I will take away the magic charms you use
MIC.5.12	so you will have no more fortune-tellers.
MIC.5.13	I will destroy your statues of gods
MIC.5.13	and the stone pillars you worship
MIC.5.13	so that you will no longer worship
MIC.5.13	what your hands have made.
MIC.5.14	I will tear down Asherah idols from you
MIC.5.14	and destroy your cities.
MIC.5.15	In my anger and rage,
MIC.5.15	I will pay back the nations that have not listened.”
MIC.6.1	Now hear what the L
MIC.6.1	“Get up; plead your case in front of the mountains;
MIC.6.1	let the hills hear your story.
MIC.6.2	Mountains, listen to the 
MIC.6.2	Foundations of the earth, listen.
MIC.6.2	The L
MIC.6.2	and he will accuse Israel.”
MIC.6.3	He says, “My people, what did I do to you?
MIC.6.3	How did I make you tired of me?
MIC.6.3	Tell me.
MIC.6.4	I brought you from the land of Egypt
MIC.6.4	and freed you from slavery;
MIC.6.4	I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to you.
MIC.6.5	My people, remember
MIC.6.5	the evil plans of Balak king of Moab
MIC.6.5	and what Balaam son of Beor told Balak.
MIC.6.5	Remember what happened from Acacia to Gilgal
MIC.6.5	so that you will know the L
MIC.6.6	You say, “What can I bring with me
MIC.6.6	when I come before the L
MIC.6.6	when I bow before God on high?
MIC.6.6	Should I come before him with burnt offerings,
MIC.6.6	with year-old calves?
MIC.6.7	Will the L
MIC.6.7	Will he be pleased with ten thousand rivers of oil?
MIC.6.7	Should I give my first child for the evil I have done?
MIC.6.7	Should I give my very own child for my sin?”
MIC.6.8	The L
MIC.6.8	he has told you what he wants from you:
MIC.6.8	to do what is right to other people,
MIC.6.8	love being kind to others,
MIC.6.8	and live humbly, obeying your God.
MIC.6.9	The voice of the L
MIC.6.9	and the wise person honors him.
MIC.6.9	So pay attention to the rod of punishment;
MIC.6.9	pay attention to the One who threatens to punish.
MIC.6.10	Are there still in the wicked house
MIC.6.10	wicked treasures
MIC.6.10	and the cursed false measure?
MIC.6.11	Can I forgive people who cheat others
MIC.6.11	with wrong weights and scales?
MIC.6.12	The rich people of the city
MIC.6.12	do cruel things.
MIC.6.12	Its people tell lies;
MIC.6.12	they do not tell the truth.
MIC.6.13	As for me, I will make you sick.
MIC.6.13	I will attack you, ruining you because of your sins.
MIC.6.14	You will eat, but you won’t become full;
MIC.6.14	you will still be hungry and empty.
MIC.6.14	You will store up, but save nothing,
MIC.6.14	and what you store up, the sword will destroy.
MIC.6.15	You will plant,
MIC.6.15	but you won’t harvest.
MIC.6.15	You will step on your olives,
MIC.6.15	but you won’t get any oil from them.
MIC.6.15	You will crush the grapes,
MIC.6.15	but you will not drink the new wine.
MIC.6.16	This is because you obey the laws of King Omri
MIC.6.16	and do all the things that Ahab’s family does;
MIC.6.16	you follow their advice.
MIC.6.16	So I will let you be destroyed.
MIC.6.16	The people in your city will be laughed at,
MIC.6.16	and other nations will make fun of you.
MIC.7.1	Poor me! I am like a hungry man,
MIC.7.1	and all the summer fruit has been picked—
MIC.7.1	there are no grapes left to eat,
MIC.7.1	none of the early figs I love.
MIC.7.2	All of the faithful people are gone;
MIC.7.2	there is not one good person left in this country.
MIC.7.2	Everyone is waiting to kill someone;
MIC.7.2	everyone is trying to trap someone else.
MIC.7.3	With both hands they are doing evil.
MIC.7.3	Rulers ask for money,
MIC.7.3	and judges’ decisions are bought for a price.
MIC.7.3	Rich people tell what they want,
MIC.7.3	and they get it.
MIC.7.4	Even the best of them is like a thornbush;
MIC.7.4	the most honest of them is worse than a prickly plant.
MIC.7.4	The day that your watchmen warned you about has come.
MIC.7.4	Now they will be confused.
MIC.7.5	Don’t believe your neighbor
MIC.7.5	or trust a friend.
MIC.7.5	Don’t say anything,
MIC.7.5	even to your wife.
MIC.7.6	A son will not honor his father,
MIC.7.6	a daughter will turn against her mother,
MIC.7.6	and a daughter-in-law will be against her mother-in-law;
MIC.7.6	a person’s enemies will be members of his own family.
MIC.7.7	Israel says, “I will look to the L
MIC.7.7	I will wait for God to save me;
MIC.7.7	my God will hear me.
MIC.7.8	Enemy, don’t laugh at me.
MIC.7.8	I have fallen, but I will get up again.
MIC.7.8	I sit in the shadow of trouble now,
MIC.7.8	but the L
MIC.7.9	I sinned against the L
MIC.7.9	so he was angry with me,
MIC.7.9	but he will defend my case in court.
MIC.7.9	He will bring about what is right for me.
MIC.7.9	Then he will bring me out into the light,
MIC.7.9	and I will see him set things right.
MIC.7.10	Then my enemies will see this,
MIC.7.10	and they will be ashamed,
MIC.7.10	those who said to me,
MIC.7.10	‘Where is the L
MIC.7.10	I will look down on them.
MIC.7.10	They will get walked on, like mud in the street.”
MIC.7.11	The time will come when your walls will be built again,
MIC.7.11	when your country will grow.
MIC.7.12	At that time your people will come back to you
MIC.7.12	from Assyria and the cities of Egypt,
MIC.7.12	and from Egypt to the Euphrates River,
MIC.7.12	and from sea to sea and mountain to mountain.
MIC.7.13	The earth will be ruined for the people who live in it
MIC.7.13	because of their deeds.
MIC.7.14	So shepherd your people with your stick;
MIC.7.14	tend the flock of people who belong to you.
MIC.7.14	That flock now lives alone in the forest
MIC.7.14	in the middle of a garden land.
MIC.7.14	Let them feed in Bashan and Gilead
MIC.7.14	as in days long ago.
MIC.7.15	“As in the days when I brought you out of Egypt,
MIC.7.15	I will show them miracles.”
MIC.7.16	When the nations see those miracles,
MIC.7.16	they will no longer brag about their power.
MIC.7.16	They will put their hands over their mouths,
MIC.7.16	refusing to listen.
MIC.7.17	They will crawl in the dust like a snake,
MIC.7.17	like insects crawling on the ground.
MIC.7.17	They will come trembling from their holes to the L
MIC.7.17	and will turn in fear before you.
MIC.7.18	There is no God like you.
MIC.7.18	You forgive those who are guilty of sin;
MIC.7.18	you don’t look at the sins of your people
MIC.7.18	who are left alive.
MIC.7.18	You will not stay angry forever,
MIC.7.18	because you enjoy being kind.
MIC.7.19	You will have mercy on us again;
MIC.7.19	you will conquer our sins.
MIC.7.19	You will throw away all our sins
MIC.7.19	into the deepest part of the sea.
MIC.7.20	You will be true to the people of Jacob,
MIC.7.20	and you will be kind to the people of Abraham
MIC.7.20	as you promised to our ancestors long ago. 
NAM.1.1	This is the message for the city of Nineveh. This is the book of the vision of Nahum, who was from the town of Elkosh.
NAM.1.2	The L
NAM.1.2	the L
NAM.1.2	The L

NAM.1.3	The L
NAM.1.3	Where the L
NAM.1.3	and the clouds are the dust beneath his feet.
NAM.1.4	He speaks to the sea and makes it dry;
NAM.1.4	he dries up all the rivers.
NAM.1.4	The areas of Bashan and Carmel dry up,
NAM.1.4	and the flowers of Lebanon dry up.
NAM.1.5	The mountains shake in front of him,
NAM.1.5	and the hills melt.
NAM.1.5	The earth trembles when he comes;
NAM.1.5	the world and all who live in it shake with fear.
NAM.1.6	No one can stay alive when he is angry;
NAM.1.6	no one can survive his strong anger.
NAM.1.6	His anger is poured out like fire;
NAM.1.6	the rocks are smashed by him.
NAM.1.7	The L
NAM.1.7	giving protection in times of trouble.
NAM.1.7	He knows who trusts in him.
NAM.1.8	But like a rushing flood,
NAM.1.8	he will completely destroy Nineveh;
NAM.1.8	he will chase his enemies until he kills them.
NAM.1.9	The L
NAM.1.9	anyone making plans against him.
NAM.1.9	Trouble will not come a second time.
NAM.1.10	Those people will be like tangled thorns
NAM.1.10	or like people drunk from their wine;
NAM.1.10	they will be burned up quickly like dry weeds.
NAM.1.11	Someone has come from Nineveh
NAM.1.11	who makes evil plans against the L
NAM.1.11	and gives wicked advice.
NAM.1.12	This is what the L
NAM.1.12	“Although Assyria is strong and has many people,
NAM.1.12	it will be defeated and brought to an end.
NAM.1.12	Although I have made you suffer, Judah,
NAM.1.12	I will make you suffer no more.
NAM.1.13	Now I will free you from their control
NAM.1.13	and tear away your chains.”
NAM.1.14	The L
NAM.1.14	“You will not have descendants to carry on your name.
NAM.1.14	I will destroy the idols and metal images
NAM.1.14	that are in the temple of your gods.
NAM.1.14	I will make a grave for you,
NAM.1.14	because you are wicked.”
NAM.1.15	Look, there on the hills,
NAM.1.15	someone is bringing good news!
NAM.1.15	He is announcing peace!
NAM.1.15	Celebrate your feasts, people of Judah,
NAM.1.15	and give your promised sacrifices to God.
NAM.1.15	The wicked will not come to attack you again;
NAM.1.15	they have been completely destroyed.
NAM.2.1	The destroyer is coming to attack you, Nineveh.
NAM.2.1	Guard the defenses.
NAM.2.1	Watch the road.
NAM.2.1	Get ready.
NAM.2.1	Gather all your strength!
NAM.2.2	Destroyers have destroyed God’s people
NAM.2.2	and ruined their vines,
NAM.2.2	but the L
NAM.2.2	like Israel’s greatness.
NAM.2.3	The shields of his soldiers are red;
NAM.2.3	the army is dressed in red.
NAM.2.3	The metal on the chariots flashes like fire
NAM.2.3	when they are ready to attack;
NAM.2.3	their horses are excited.
NAM.2.4	The chariots race through the streets
NAM.2.4	and rush back and forth through the city squares.
NAM.2.4	They look like torches;
NAM.2.4	they run like lightning.
NAM.2.5	He calls his officers,
NAM.2.5	but they stumble on the way.
NAM.2.5	They hurry to the city wall,
NAM.2.5	and the shield is put into place.
NAM.2.6	The river gates are thrown open,
NAM.2.6	and the palace is destroyed.
NAM.2.7	It has been announced that the people of Nineveh
NAM.2.7	will be captured and carried away.
NAM.2.7	The slave girls moan like doves
NAM.2.7	and beat their breasts, because they are sad.
NAM.2.8	Nineveh is like a pool,
NAM.2.8	and now its water is draining away.
NAM.2.8	“Stop! Stop!” the people yell,
NAM.2.8	but no one turns back.
NAM.2.9	Take the silver!
NAM.2.9	Take the gold!
NAM.2.9	There is no end to the treasure—
NAM.2.9	piles of wealth of every kind.
NAM.2.10	Nineveh is robbed, ruined, and destroyed.
NAM.2.10	The people lose their courage, and their knees knock.
NAM.2.10	Stomachs ache, and everyone’s face grows pale.
NAM.2.11	Where is the lions’ den
NAM.2.11	and the place where they feed their young?
NAM.2.11	Where did the lion, lioness, and cubs go
NAM.2.11	without being afraid?
NAM.2.12	The lion killed enough for his cubs,
NAM.2.12	enough for his mate.
NAM.2.12	He filled his cave with the animals he caught;
NAM.2.12	he filled his den with meat he had killed.
NAM.2.13	“I am against you, Nineveh,”
NAM.2.13	says the L
NAM.2.13	“I will burn up your chariots in smoke,
NAM.2.13	and the sword will kill your young lions.
NAM.2.13	I will stop you from hunting down others on the earth,
NAM.2.13	and your messengers’ voices
NAM.2.13	will no longer be heard.”
NAM.3.1	How terrible it will be for the city that has killed so many.
NAM.3.1	It is full of lies
NAM.3.1	and goods stolen from other countries.
NAM.3.1	It is always killing somebody.
NAM.3.2	Hear the sound of whips
NAM.3.2	and the noise of the wheels.
NAM.3.2	Hear horses galloping
NAM.3.2	and chariots bouncing along!
NAM.3.3	Horses are charging,
NAM.3.3	swords are shining,
NAM.3.3	spears are gleaming!
NAM.3.3	Many are dead;
NAM.3.3	their bodies are piled up—
NAM.3.3	too many to count.
NAM.3.3	People stumble over the dead bodies.
NAM.3.4	The city was like a prostitute;
NAM.3.4	she was charming and a lover of magic.
NAM.3.4	She made nations slaves with her prostitution
NAM.3.4	and her witchcraft.
NAM.3.5	“I am against you, Nineveh,” says the L
NAM.3.5	“I will pull your dress up over your face
NAM.3.5	and show the nations your nakedness
NAM.3.5	and the kingdoms your shame.
NAM.3.6	I will throw filthy garbage on you
NAM.3.6	and make a fool of you.
NAM.3.6	I will make people stare at you.
NAM.3.7	Everyone who sees you will run away and say,
NAM.3.7	‘Nineveh is in ruins. Who will cry for her?’
NAM.3.7	Nineveh, where will I find anyone to comfort you?”
NAM.3.8	You are no better than Thebes,
NAM.3.8	who sits by the Nile River
NAM.3.8	with water all around her.
NAM.3.8	The river was her defense;
NAM.3.8	the waters were like a wall around her.
NAM.3.9	Cush and Egypt gave her endless strength;
NAM.3.9	Put and Libya supported her.
NAM.3.10	But Thebes was captured
NAM.3.10	and went into captivity.
NAM.3.10	Her small children were beaten to death
NAM.3.10	at every street corner.
NAM.3.10	Lots were thrown for her important men,
NAM.3.10	and all of her leaders were put in chains.
NAM.3.11	Nineveh, you will be drunk, too.
NAM.3.11	You will hide;
NAM.3.11	you will look for a place safe from the enemy.
NAM.3.12	All your defenses are like fig trees with ripe fruit.
NAM.3.12	When the tree is shaken, the figs fall into the mouth of the eater.
NAM.3.13	Look at your soldiers.
NAM.3.13	They are all women!
NAM.3.13	The gates of your land
NAM.3.13	are wide open for your enemies;
NAM.3.13	fire has burned the bars of your gates.
NAM.3.14	Get enough water before the long war begins.
NAM.3.14	Make your defenses strong!
NAM.3.14	Get mud,
NAM.3.14	mix clay,
NAM.3.14	make bricks!
NAM.3.15	There the fire will burn you up.
NAM.3.15	The sword will kill you;
NAM.3.15	like grasshoppers eating crops, the battle will completely destroy you.
NAM.3.15	Grow in number like hopping locusts;
NAM.3.15	grow in number like swarming locusts!
NAM.3.16	Your traders are more than the stars in the sky,
NAM.3.16	but like locusts, they strip the land and then fly away.
NAM.3.17	Your guards are like locusts.
NAM.3.17	Your officers are like swarms of locusts
NAM.3.17	that hang on the walls on a cold day.
NAM.3.17	When the sun comes up, they fly away,
NAM.3.17	and no one knows where they have gone.
NAM.3.18	King of Assyria, your rulers are asleep;
NAM.3.18	your important men lie down to rest.
NAM.3.18	Your people have been scattered on the mountains,
NAM.3.18	and there is no one to bring them back.
NAM.3.19	Nothing can heal your wound;
NAM.3.19	your injury will not heal.
NAM.3.19	Everyone who hears about you applauds,
NAM.3.19	because everyone has felt your endless cruelty. 
HAB.1.1	This is the message Habakkuk the prophet received.
HAB.1.2	L
HAB.1.2	and you ignore me?
HAB.1.2	I cry out to you about violence,
HAB.1.2	but you do not save us!
HAB.1.3	Why do you make me see wrong things
HAB.1.3	and make me look at trouble?
HAB.1.3	People are destroying things and hurting others in front of me;
HAB.1.3	they are arguing and fighting.
HAB.1.4	So the teachings are weak,
HAB.1.4	and justice never comes.
HAB.1.4	Evil people gain while good people lose;
HAB.1.4	the judges no longer make fair decisions.
HAB.1.5	“Look at the nations!
HAB.1.5	Watch them and be amazed and shocked.
HAB.1.5	I will do something in your lifetime
HAB.1.5	that you won’t believe even when you are told about it.
HAB.1.6	I will use the Babylonians,
HAB.1.6	those cruel and wild people
HAB.1.6	who march across the earth
HAB.1.6	and take lands that don’t belong to them.
HAB.1.7	They scare and frighten people.
HAB.1.7	They do what they want to do
HAB.1.7	and are good only to themselves.
HAB.1.8	Their horses are faster than leopards
HAB.1.8	and quicker than wolves at sunset.
HAB.1.8	Their horse soldiers attack quickly;
HAB.1.8	they come from places far away.
HAB.1.8	They attack quickly, like an eagle swooping down for food.
HAB.1.9	They all come to fight.
HAB.1.9	Nothing can stop them.
HAB.1.9	Their prisoners are as many as the grains of sand.
HAB.1.10	They laugh at kings
HAB.1.10	and make fun of rulers.
HAB.1.10	They laugh at all the strong, walled cities
HAB.1.10	and build dirt piles to the top of the walls to capture them.
HAB.1.11	Then they leave like the wind and move on.
HAB.1.11	They are guilty of worshiping their own strength.”
HAB.1.12	L
HAB.1.12	my God, my holy God.
HAB.1.12	We will not die.
HAB.1.12	L
HAB.1.12	our Rock, you picked them to punish.
HAB.1.13	Your eyes are too good to look at evil;
HAB.1.13	you cannot stand to see those who do wrong.
HAB.1.13	So how can you put up with those evil people?
HAB.1.13	How can you be quiet when the wicked swallow up people who are better than they are?
HAB.1.14	You treat people like fish in the sea,
HAB.1.14	like sea animals without a leader.
HAB.1.15	The enemy brings them in with hooks.
HAB.1.15	He catches them in his net
HAB.1.15	and drags them in his fishnet.
HAB.1.15	So he rejoices and sings for joy.
HAB.1.16	The enemy offers sacrifices to his net
HAB.1.16	and burns incense to worship it,
HAB.1.16	because it lets him live like the rich
HAB.1.16	and enjoy the best food.
HAB.1.17	Will he keep on taking riches with his net?
HAB.1.17	Will he go on destroying people without showing mercy?
HAB.2.1	I will stand like a guard to watch
HAB.2.1	and place myself at the tower.
HAB.2.1	I will wait to see what he will say to me;
HAB.2.1	I will wait to learn how God will answer my complaint.
HAB.2.2	The L
HAB.2.2	“Write down the vision;
HAB.2.2	write it clearly on clay tablets
HAB.2.2	so whoever reads it can run to tell others.
HAB.2.3	It is not yet time for the message to come true,
HAB.2.3	but that time is coming soon;
HAB.2.3	the message will come true.
HAB.2.3	It may seem like a long time,
HAB.2.3	but be patient and wait for it,
HAB.2.3	because it will surely come;
HAB.2.3	it will not be delayed.
HAB.2.4	The evil nation is very proud of itself;
HAB.2.4	it is not living as it should.
HAB.2.4	But those who are right with God will live by faith.
HAB.2.5	“Just as wine can trick a person,
HAB.2.5	those who are too proud will not last,
HAB.2.5	because their desire is like a grave’s desire for death,
HAB.2.5	and like death they always want more.
HAB.2.5	They gather other nations for themselves
HAB.2.5	and collect for themselves all the countries.
HAB.2.6	But all the nations the Babylonians have hurt will laugh at them.
HAB.2.6	They will make fun of the Babylonians
HAB.2.6	and say, ‘How terrible it will be for the one that steals many things.
HAB.2.6	How long will that nation get rich by forcing others to pay them?’
HAB.2.7	“One day the people from whom you have taken money will turn against you.
HAB.2.7	They will realize what is happening and make you shake with fear.
HAB.2.7	Then they will take everything you have.
HAB.2.8	Because you have stolen from many nations,
HAB.2.8	those who are left will take much from you.
HAB.2.8	This is because you have killed many people,
HAB.2.8	destroying countries and cities and everyone in them.
HAB.2.9	“How terrible it will be for the nation that becomes rich by doing wrong,
HAB.2.9	thinking they will live in a safe place
HAB.2.9	and escape harm.
HAB.2.10	Because you have made plans to destroy many people,
HAB.2.10	you have made your own houses ashamed of you.
HAB.2.10	Because of it, you will lose your lives.
HAB.2.11	The stones of the walls will cry out against you,
HAB.2.11	and the boards that support the roof will agree that you are wrong.
HAB.2.12	“How terrible it will be for the nation that kills people to build a city,
HAB.2.12	that wrongs others to start a town.
HAB.2.13	The L
HAB.2.13	to destroy what those people have built;
HAB.2.13	all the nations’ work will be for nothing.
HAB.2.14	Then, just as water covers the sea,
HAB.2.14	people everywhere will know the 
HAB.2.15	“How terrible for the nation that makes its neighbors drink,
HAB.2.15	pouring from the jug of wine until they are drunk
HAB.2.15	so that it can look at their naked bodies.
HAB.2.16	You Babylonians will be filled with disgrace, not respect.
HAB.2.16	It’s your turn to drink and fall to the ground like a drunk person.
HAB.2.16	The cup of anger from the 
HAB.2.16	You will receive disgrace, not respect.
HAB.2.17	You hurt many people in Lebanon,
HAB.2.17	but now you will be hurt.
HAB.2.17	You killed many animals there,
HAB.2.17	and now you must be afraid
HAB.2.17	because of what you did
HAB.2.17	to that land, those cities, and the people who lived in them.
HAB.2.18	“An idol does no good, because a human made it;
HAB.2.18	it is only a statue that teaches lies.
HAB.2.18	The one who made it expects his own work to help him,
HAB.2.18	but he makes idols that can’t even speak!
HAB.2.19	How terrible it will be for the one who says to a wooden statue, ‘Come to life!’
HAB.2.19	How terrible it will be for the one who says to a silent stone, ‘Get up!’
HAB.2.19	It cannot tell you what to do.
HAB.2.19	It is only a statue covered with gold and silver;
HAB.2.19	there is no life in it.
HAB.2.20	The L
HAB.2.20	all the earth should be silent in his presence.”
HAB.3.1	This is the prayer of Habakkuk the prophet, on shigionoth.
HAB.3.2	L
HAB.3.2	I am amazed at what you have done.
HAB.3.2	L
HAB.3.2	make those things happen again in our own days.
HAB.3.2	Even when you are angry,
HAB.3.2	remember to be kind.
HAB.3.3	God is coming from Teman;
HAB.3.3	the Holy One comes from Mount Paran.
HAB.3.3	His glory covers the skies,
HAB.3.3	and his praise fills the earth.
HAB.3.4	He is like a bright light.
HAB.3.4	Rays of light shine from his hand,
HAB.3.4	and there he hides his power.
HAB.3.5	Sickness goes before him,
HAB.3.5	and disease follows behind him.
HAB.3.6	He stands and shakes the earth.
HAB.3.6	He looks, and the nations shake with fear.
HAB.3.6	The mountains, which stood for ages, break into pieces;
HAB.3.6	the old hills fall down.
HAB.3.6	God has always done this.
HAB.3.7	I saw that the tents of Cushan were in trouble
HAB.3.7	and that the tents of Midian trembled.
HAB.3.8	L
HAB.3.8	or were you angry at the streams?
HAB.3.8	Were you angry with the sea
HAB.3.8	when you rode your horses and chariots of victory?
HAB.3.9	You uncovered your bow
HAB.3.9	and commanded many arrows to be brought to you.
HAB.3.9	You split the earth with rivers.
HAB.3.10	The mountains saw you and shook with fear.
HAB.3.10	The rushing water flowed.
HAB.3.10	The sea made a loud noise,
HAB.3.10	and its waves rose high.
HAB.3.11	The sun and moon stood still in the sky;
HAB.3.11	they stopped when they saw the flash of your flying arrows
HAB.3.11	and the gleam of your shining spear.
HAB.3.12	In anger you marched on the earth;
HAB.3.12	in anger you punished the nations.
HAB.3.13	You came out to save your people,
HAB.3.13	to save your chosen one.
HAB.3.13	You crushed the leader of the wicked ones
HAB.3.13	and took everything he had, from head to toe.
HAB.3.14	With the enemy’s own spear you stabbed the leader of his army.
HAB.3.14	His soldiers rushed out like a storm to scatter us.
HAB.3.14	They were happy
HAB.3.14	as they were robbing the poor people in secret.
HAB.3.15	But you marched through the sea with your horses,
HAB.3.15	stirring the great waters.
HAB.3.16	I hear these things, and my body trembles;
HAB.3.16	my lips tremble when I hear the sound.
HAB.3.16	My bones feel weak,
HAB.3.16	and my legs shake.
HAB.3.16	But I will wait patiently for the day of disaster
HAB.3.16	that will come to the people who attack us.
HAB.3.17	Fig trees may not grow figs,
HAB.3.17	and there may be no grapes on the vines.
HAB.3.17	There may be no olives growing
HAB.3.17	and no food growing in the fields.
HAB.3.17	There may be no sheep in the pens
HAB.3.17	and no cattle in the barns.
HAB.3.18	But I will still be glad in the L
HAB.3.18	I will rejoice in God my Savior.
HAB.3.19	The Lord 
HAB.3.19	He makes me like a deer that does not stumble
HAB.3.19	so I can walk on the steep mountains.

ZEP.3.4	Its prophets are proud;
ZEP.3.4	they are people who cannot be trusted.

ZEC.1.8	During the night I had a vision. I saw a man riding a red horse. He was standing among some myrtle trees in a ravine, with red, brown, and white horses behind him.
ZEC.1.9	I asked, “What are these, sir?”
ZEC.1.9	The angel who was talking with me answered, “I’ll show you what they are.”

ZEC.1.18	Then I looked up and saw four animal horns. 
ZEC.1.19	I asked the angel who was talking with me, “What are these?”
ZEC.1.19	He said, “These are the horns that scattered the people of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.”
ZEC.1.20	Then the L
ZEC.1.21	I asked, “What are they coming to do?”
ZEC.1.21	He answered, “They have come to scare and throw down the horns. These horns scattered the people of Judah so that no one could even lift up his head. These horns stand for the nations that attacked the people of Judah and scattered them.”
ZEC.2.1	Then I looked up and saw a man holding a line for measuring things. 
ZEC.2.2	I asked him, “Where are you going?”
ZEC.2.2	He said to me, “I am going to measure Jerusalem, to see how wide and how long it is.”
ZEC.2.3	Then the angel who was talking with me left, and another angel came out to meet him. 
ZEC.2.4	The second angel said to him, “Run and tell that young man, ‘Jerusalem will become a city without walls, because there will be so many people and cattle in it. 
ZEC.2.5	I will be a wall of fire around it,’ says the L
ZEC.2.6	“Oh no! Oh no! Run away from Babylon, because I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven,” says the L

ZEC.3.4	Then the angel said to Joshua, “Look, I have taken away your sin from you, and I am giving you beautiful, fine clothes.”

ZEC.4.1	Then the angel who was talking with me returned and woke me up as if I had been asleep. 
ZEC.4.2	He asked me, “What do you see?”
ZEC.4.2	I said, “I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top. And there are seven lamps and also seven places for wicks. 
ZEC.4.3	There are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on the left.”
ZEC.4.4	I asked the angel who talked with me, “Sir, what are these?”
ZEC.4.5	The angel said, “Don’t you know what they are?”
ZEC.4.5	“No, sir,” I said.
ZEC.4.6	Then he told me, “This is the word of the L

ZEC.4.11	Then I asked the angel, “What are the two olive trees on the right and left of the lampstand?”
ZEC.4.12	I also asked him, “What are the two olive branches beside the two gold pipes, from which the olive oil flows to the lamps?”
ZEC.4.13	He answered, “Don’t you know what they are?”
ZEC.4.13	“No, sir,” I said.
ZEC.4.14	So he said, “They are symbols of the two who have been appointed to serve the Lord of all the earth.”
ZEC.5.1	I looked up again and saw a flying scroll.
ZEC.5.2	The angel asked me, “What do you see?”
ZEC.5.2	I answered, “I see a flying scroll, thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide.”
ZEC.5.3	And he said to me, “This is the curse that will go all over the land. One side says every thief will be taken away. The other side says everyone who makes false promises will be taken away. 
ZEC.5.4	The L
ZEC.5.5	Then the angel who was talking with me came forward and said to me, “Look up and see what is going out.”
ZEC.5.6	“What is it?” I asked.
ZEC.5.6	He answered, “It is a measuring basket going out.” He also said, “It is a symbol of the people’s sins in all the land.”
ZEC.5.7	Then the lid made of lead was raised, and there was a woman sitting inside the basket. 
ZEC.5.8	The angel said, “The woman stands for wickedness.” Then he pushed her back into the basket and put the lid back down.
ZEC.5.9	Then I looked up and saw two women going out with the wind in their wings. Their wings were like those of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and the sky.
ZEC.5.10	I asked the angel who was talking with me, “Where are they taking the basket?”
ZEC.5.11	“They are going to Babylonia to build a temple for it,” he answered. “When the temple is ready, they will set the basket there in its place.”
ZEC.6.1	I looked up again and saw four chariots going out between two mountains, mountains of bronze. 
ZEC.6.2	Red horses pulled the first chariot. Black horses pulled the second chariot. 
ZEC.6.3	White horses pulled the third chariot, and strong, spotted horses pulled the fourth chariot. 
ZEC.6.4	I asked the angel who was talking with me, “What are these, sir?”
ZEC.6.5	He said, “These are the four spirits of heaven. They have just come from the presence of the Lord of the whole world. 
ZEC.6.6	The chariot pulled by the black horses will go to the land of the north. The white horses will go to the land of the west, and the spotted horses will go to the land of the south.”
ZEC.6.7	When the powerful horses went out, they were eager to go through all the earth. So he said, “Go through all the earth,” and they did.
ZEC.6.8	Then he called to me, “Look, the horses that went north have caused my spirit to rest in the land of the north.”

ZEC.11.9	I said, “I will no longer take care of you like a shepherd. Let those that are dying die, and let those that are to be destroyed be destroyed. Let those that are left eat each other.”
ZEC.11.10	Then I broke the stick named Pleasant to break the agreement God made with all the nations.

MAT.1.7	Abijah was the father of Asa.
MAT.1.8	Asa was the father of Jehoshaphat.
MAT.1.8	Jehoshaphat was the father of Jehoram.
MAT.1.8	Jehoram was the ancestor of Uzziah.
MAT.1.9	Uzziah was the father of Jotham.
MAT.1.9	Jotham was the father of Ahaz.
MAT.1.9	Ahaz was the father of Hezekiah.
MAT.1.10	Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh.
MAT.1.10	Manasseh was the father of Amon.
MAT.1.10	Amon was the father of Josiah.
MAT.1.11	Josiah was the grandfather of Jehoiachin and his brothers.
MAT.1.11	(This was at the time that the people were taken to Babylon.)
MAT.1.12	After they were taken to Babylon:
MAT.1.12	Jehoiachin was the father of Shealtiel.
MAT.1.12	Shealtiel was the grandfather of Zerubbabel.
MAT.1.13	Zerubbabel was the father of Abiud.
MAT.1.13	Abiud was the father of Eliakim.

MAT.1.15	Eleazar was the father of Matthan.
MAT.1.15	Matthan was the father of Jacob.
MAT.1.16	Jacob was the father of Joseph.
MAT.1.16	Joseph was the husband of Mary,
MAT.1.16	and Mary was the mother of Jesus.
MAT.1.16	Jesus is called the Christ.
MAT.1.17	So there were fourteen generations from Abraham to David. And there were fourteen generations from David until the people were taken to Babylon. And there were fourteen generations from the time when the people were taken to Babylon until Christ was born.
MAT.1.18	This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about. His mother Mary was engaged to marry Joseph, but before they married, she learned she was pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
MAT.1.19	Because Mary’s husband, Joseph, was a good man, he did not want to disgrace her in public, so he planned to divorce her secretly.
MAT.1.20	While Joseph thought about these things, an angel of the Lord came to him in a dream. The angel said, “Joseph, descendant of David, don’t be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the baby in her is from the Holy Spirit. 
MAT.1.21	She will give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins.”
MAT.1.22	All this happened to bring about what the Lord had said through the prophet: 
MAT.1.23	“The virgin will be pregnant. She will have a son, and they will name him Immanuel,” which means “God is with us.”
MAT.1.24	When Joseph woke up, he did what the Lord’s angel had told him to do. Joseph took Mary as his wife, 
MAT.1.25	but he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to the son. And Joseph named him Jesus.
MAT.2.1	Jesus was born in the town of Bethlehem in Judea during the time when Herod was king. When Jesus was born, some wise men from the east came to Jerusalem. 
MAT.2.2	They asked, “Where is the baby who was born to be the king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”
MAT.2.3	When King Herod heard this, he was troubled, as were all the people in Jerusalem. 
MAT.2.4	Herod called a meeting of all the leading priests and teachers of the law and asked them where the Christ would be born. 
MAT.2.5	They answered, “In the town of Bethlehem in Judea. The prophet wrote about this in the Scriptures:
MAT.2.6	‘But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,
MAT.2.6	are not just an insignificant village in Judah.
MAT.2.6	A ruler will come from you
MAT.2.6	who will be like a shepherd for my people Israel.’ ”
MAT.2.7	Then Herod had a secret meeting with the wise men and learned from them the exact time they first saw the star. 
MAT.2.8	He sent the wise men to Bethlehem, saying, “Look carefully for the child. When you find him, come tell me so I can worship him too.”
MAT.2.9	After the wise men heard the king, they left. The star that they had seen in the east went before them until it stopped above the place where the child was. 
MAT.2.10	When the wise men saw the star, they were filled with joy. 
MAT.2.11	They came to the house where the child was and saw him with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their gifts and gave him treasures of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. 
MAT.2.12	But God warned the wise men in a dream not to go back to Herod, so they returned to their own country by a different way.
MAT.2.13	After they left, an angel of the Lord came to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up! Take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt, because Herod is starting to look for the child so he can kill him. Stay in Egypt until I tell you to return.”
MAT.2.14	So Joseph got up and left for Egypt during the night with the child and his mother. 
MAT.2.15	And Joseph stayed in Egypt until Herod died. This happened to bring about what the Lord had said through the prophet: “I called my son out of Egypt.”
MAT.2.16	When Herod saw that the wise men had tricked him, he was furious. So he gave an order to kill all the baby boys in Bethlehem and in the surrounding area who were two years old or younger. This was in keeping with the time he learned from the wise men. 
MAT.2.17	So what God had said through the prophet Jeremiah came true:
MAT.2.18	“A voice was heard in Ramah
MAT.2.18	of painful crying and deep sadness:
MAT.2.18	Rachel crying for her children.
MAT.2.18	She refused to be comforted,
MAT.2.18	because her children are dead.”
MAT.2.19	After Herod died, an angel of the Lord spoke to Joseph in a dream while he was in Egypt. 
MAT.2.20	The angel said, “Get up! Take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, because the people who were trying to kill the child are now dead.”
MAT.2.21	So Joseph took the child and his mother and went to Israel. 
MAT.2.22	But he heard that Archelaus was now king in Judea since his father Herod had died. So Joseph was afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he went to the area of Galilee, 
MAT.2.23	to a town called Nazareth, and lived there. And so what God had said through the prophets came true: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
MAT.3.1	About that time John the Baptist began preaching in the desert area of Judea. 
MAT.3.2	John said, “Change your hearts and lives because the kingdom of heaven is near.” 
MAT.3.3	John the Baptist is the one Isaiah the prophet was talking about when he said:
MAT.3.3	“This is a voice of one
MAT.3.3	who calls out in the desert:
MAT.3.3	‘Prepare the way for the Lord.
MAT.3.3	Make the road straight for him.’ ”
MAT.3.4	John’s clothes were made from camel’s hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food, he ate locusts and wild honey. 
MAT.3.5	Many people came from Jerusalem and Judea and all the area around the Jordan River to hear John. 
MAT.3.6	They confessed their sins, and he baptized them in the Jordan River.
MAT.3.7	Many of the Pharisees and Sadducees came to the place where John was baptizing people. When John saw them, he said, “You are snakes! Who warned you to run away from God’s coming punishment? 
MAT.3.8	Do the things that show you really have changed your hearts and lives. 
MAT.3.9	And don’t think you can say to yourselves, ‘Abraham is our father.’ I tell you that God could make children for Abraham from these rocks. 
MAT.3.10	The ax is now ready to cut down the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
MAT.3.11	“I baptize you with water to show that your hearts and lives have changed. But there is one coming after me who is greater than I am, whose sandals I am not good enough to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
MAT.3.12	He will come ready to clean the grain, separating the good grain from the chaff. He will put the good part of the grain into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with a fire that cannot be put out.”
MAT.3.13	At that time Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River and wanted John to baptize him. 
MAT.3.14	But John tried to stop him, saying, “Why do you come to me to be baptized? I need to be baptized by you!”
MAT.3.15	Jesus answered, 
MAT.3.16	As soon as Jesus was baptized, he came up out of the water. Then heaven opened, and he saw God’s Spirit coming down on him like a dove. 
MAT.3.17	And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love, and I am very pleased with him.”
MAT.4.1	Then the Spirit led Jesus into the desert to be tempted by the devil. 
MAT.4.2	Jesus fasted for forty days and nights. After this, he was very hungry. 
MAT.4.3	The devil came to Jesus to tempt him, saying, “If you are the Son of God, tell these rocks to become bread.”
MAT.4.4	Jesus answered, 
MAT.4.5	Then the devil led Jesus to the holy city of Jerusalem and put him on a high place of the Temple. 
MAT.4.6	The devil said, “If you are the Son of God, jump down, because it is written in the Scriptures:
MAT.4.6	‘He has put his angels in charge of you.
MAT.4.6	They will catch you in their hands
MAT.4.6	so that you will not hit your foot on a rock.’ ”
MAT.4.7	Jesus answered him, 
MAT.4.8	Then the devil led Jesus to the top of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and all their splendor. 
MAT.4.9	The devil said, “If you will bow down and worship me, I will give you all these things.”
MAT.4.10	Jesus said to the devil, 
MAT.4.11	So the devil left Jesus, and angels came and took care of him.
MAT.4.12	When Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, he went back to Galilee. 
MAT.4.13	He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum, a town near Lake Galilee, in the area near Zebulun and Naphtali. 
MAT.4.14	Jesus did this to bring about what the prophet Isaiah had said:
MAT.4.15	“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali
MAT.4.15	along the sea,
MAT.4.15	beyond the Jordan River.
MAT.4.15	This is Galilee where the non-Jewish people live.
MAT.4.16	These people who live in darkness
MAT.4.16	will see a great light.
MAT.4.16	They live in a place covered with the shadows of death,
MAT.4.16	but a light will shine on them.”
MAT.4.17	From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, 
MAT.4.18	As Jesus was walking by Lake Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (called Peter) and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen. 
MAT.4.19	Jesus said, 
MAT.4.20	So Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed him.
MAT.4.21	As Jesus continued walking by Lake Galilee, he saw two other brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. Jesus told them to come with him. 
MAT.4.22	Immediately they left the boat and their father, and they followed Jesus.
MAT.4.23	Jesus went everywhere in Galilee, teaching in the synagogues, preaching the Good News about the kingdom of heaven, and healing all the people’s diseases and sicknesses. 
MAT.4.24	The news about Jesus spread all over Syria, and people brought all the sick to him. They were suffering from different kinds of diseases. Some were in great pain, some had demons, some were epileptics, and some were paralyzed. Jesus healed all of them. 
MAT.4.25	Many people from Galilee, the Ten Towns, Jerusalem, Judea, and the land across the Jordan River followed him.
MAT.5.1	When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a hill and sat down. His followers came to him, 
MAT.5.2	and he began to teach them, saying:
MAT.7.28	When Jesus finished saying these things, the people were amazed at his teaching, 
MAT.7.29	because he did not teach like their teachers of the law. He taught like a person who had authority.
MAT.8.1	When Jesus came down from the hill, great crowds followed him. 
MAT.8.2	Then a man with a skin disease came to Jesus. The man bowed down before him and said, “Lord, you can heal me if you will.”
MAT.8.3	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man and said, 
MAT.8.4	Then Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.5	When Jesus entered the city of Capernaum, an army officer came to him, begging for help. 
MAT.8.6	The officer said, “Lord, my servant is at home in bed. He can’t move his body and is in much pain.”
MAT.8.7	Jesus said to the officer, 
MAT.8.8	The officer answered, “Lord, I am not worthy for you to come into my house. You only need to command it, and my servant will be healed. 
MAT.8.9	I, too, am a man under the authority of others, and I have soldiers under my command. I tell one soldier, ‘Go,’ and he goes. I tell another soldier, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and my servant does it.
MAT.8.10	When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. He said to those who were following him, 
MAT.8.13	Then Jesus said to the officer, 
MAT.8.14	When Jesus went to Peter’s house, he saw that Peter’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever. 
MAT.8.15	Jesus touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she stood up and began to serve Jesus.
MAT.8.16	That evening people brought to Jesus many who had demons. Jesus spoke and the demons left them, and he healed all the sick. 
MAT.8.17	He did these things to bring about what Isaiah the prophet had said:
MAT.8.17	“He took our suffering on him
MAT.8.17	and carried our diseases.”
MAT.8.18	When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he told his followers to go to the other side of the lake. 
MAT.8.19	Then a teacher of the law came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, I will follow you any place you go.”
MAT.8.20	Jesus said to him, 
MAT.8.21	Another man, one of Jesus’ followers, said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
MAT.8.22	But Jesus told him, 
MAT.8.23	Jesus got into a boat, and his followers went with him. 
MAT.8.24	A great storm arose on the lake so that waves covered the boat, but Jesus was sleeping. 
MAT.8.25	His followers went to him and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We will drown!”
MAT.8.26	Jesus answered, 
MAT.8.27	The men were amazed and said, “What kind of man is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”
MAT.8.28	When Jesus arrived at the other side of the lake in the area of the Gadarene people, two men who had demons in them met him. These men lived in the burial caves and were so dangerous that people could not use the road by those caves. 
MAT.8.29	They shouted, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Did you come here to torture us before the right time?”
MAT.8.30	Near that place there was a large herd of pigs feeding. 
MAT.8.31	The demons begged Jesus, “If you make us leave these men, please send us into that herd of pigs.”
MAT.8.32	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.8.33	The herdsmen ran away and went into town, where they told about all of this and what had happened to the men who had demons. 
MAT.8.34	Then the whole town went out to see Jesus. When they saw him, they begged him to leave their area.
MAT.9.1	Jesus got into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town. 
MAT.9.2	Some people brought to Jesus a man who was paralyzed and lying on a mat. When Jesus saw the faith of these people, he said to the paralyzed man, 
MAT.9.3	Some of the teachers of the law said to themselves, “This man speaks as if he were God. That is blasphemy!”
MAT.9.4	Knowing their thoughts, Jesus said, 
MAT.9.6	 Then Jesus said to the paralyzed man, 
MAT.9.7	And the man stood up and went home. 
MAT.9.8	When the people saw this, they were amazed and praised God for giving power like this to human beings.
MAT.9.9	When Jesus was leaving, he saw a man named Matthew sitting in the tax collector’s booth. Jesus said to him, 
MAT.9.10	As Jesus was having dinner at Matthew’s house, many tax collectors and “sinners” came and ate with Jesus and his followers. 
MAT.9.11	When the Pharisees saw this, they asked Jesus’ followers, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
MAT.9.12	When Jesus heard them, he said, 
MAT.9.14	Then the followers of John came to Jesus and said, “Why do we and the Pharisees often fast for a certain time, but your followers don’t?”
MAT.9.15	Jesus answered, 
MAT.9.18	While Jesus was saying these things, a leader of the synagogue came to him. He bowed down before Jesus and said, “My daughter has just died. But if you come and lay your hand on her, she will live again.” 
MAT.9.19	So Jesus and his followers stood up and went with the leader.
MAT.9.20	Then a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years came behind Jesus and touched the edge of his coat. 
MAT.9.21	She was thinking, “If I can just touch his clothes, I will be healed.”
MAT.9.22	Jesus turned and saw the woman and said, 
MAT.9.23	Jesus continued along with the leader and went into his house. There he saw the funeral musicians and many people crying. 
MAT.9.24	Jesus said, 
MAT.9.25	After the crowd had been thrown out of the house, Jesus went into the girl’s room and took hold of her hand, and she stood up. 
MAT.9.26	The news about this spread all around the area.
MAT.9.27	When Jesus was leaving there, two blind men followed him. They cried out, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”
MAT.9.28	After Jesus went inside, the blind men went with him. He asked the men, 
MAT.9.28	They answered, “Yes, Lord.”
MAT.9.29	Then Jesus touched their eyes and said, 
MAT.9.30	Then the men were able to see. But Jesus warned them strongly, saying, 
MAT.9.31	But the blind men left and spread the news about Jesus all around that area.
MAT.9.32	When the two men were leaving, some people brought another man to Jesus. This man could not talk because he had a demon in him. 
MAT.9.33	After Jesus forced the demon to leave the man, he was able to speak. The crowd was amazed and said, “We have never seen anything like this in Israel.”
MAT.9.34	But the Pharisees said, “The prince of demons is the one that gives him power to force demons out.”
MAT.9.35	Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the Good News about the kingdom, and healing all kinds of diseases and sicknesses. 
MAT.9.36	When he saw the crowds, he felt sorry for them because they were hurting and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 
MAT.9.37	Jesus said to his followers, 
MAT.10.1	Jesus called his twelve followers together and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every kind of disease and sickness. 
MAT.10.2	These are the names of the twelve apostles: Simon (also called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother John; 
MAT.10.3	Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew, the tax collector; James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; 
MAT.10.4	Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot, who turned against Jesus.
MAT.10.5	Jesus sent out these twelve men with the following order: 
MAT.11.1	After Jesus finished telling these things to his twelve followers, he left there and went to the towns in Galilee to teach and preach.
MAT.11.2	John the Baptist was in prison, but he heard about what the Christ was doing. So John sent some of his followers to Jesus. 
MAT.11.3	They asked him, “Are you the One who is to come, or should we wait for someone else?”
MAT.11.4	Jesus answered them, 
MAT.11.7	As John’s followers were leaving, Jesus began talking to the people about John. Jesus said, 
MAT.11.20	Then Jesus criticized the cities where he did most of his miracles, because the people did not change their lives and stop sinning. 
MAT.11.21	He said, 
MAT.11.25	At that time Jesus said, 
MAT.12.1	At that time Jesus was walking through some fields of grain on a Sabbath day. His followers were hungry, so they began to pick the grain and eat it. 
MAT.12.2	When the Pharisees saw this, they said to Jesus, “Look! Your followers are doing what is unlawful to do on the Sabbath day.”
MAT.12.3	Jesus answered, 
MAT.12.9	Jesus left there and went into their synagogue, 
MAT.12.10	where there was a man with a crippled hand. They were looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, so they asked him, “Is it right to heal on the Sabbath day?”
MAT.12.11	Jesus answered, 
MAT.12.13	Then Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand, 
MAT.12.14	But the Pharisees left and made plans to kill Jesus.
MAT.12.15	Jesus knew what the Pharisees were doing, so he left that place. Many people followed him, and he healed all who were sick. 
MAT.12.16	But Jesus warned the people not to tell who he was. 
MAT.12.17	He did these things to bring about what Isaiah the prophet had said:
MAT.12.18	“Here is my servant whom I have chosen.
MAT.12.18	I love him, and I am pleased with him.
MAT.12.18	I will put my Spirit upon him,
MAT.12.18	and he will tell of my justice to all people.
MAT.12.19	He will not argue or cry out;
MAT.12.19	no one will hear his voice in the streets.
MAT.12.20	He will not break a crushed blade of grass
MAT.12.20	or put out even a weak flame
MAT.12.20	until he makes justice win the victory.
MAT.12.21	In him will the non-Jewish people find hope.”
MAT.12.22	Then some people brought to Jesus a man who was blind and could not talk, because he had a demon. Jesus healed the man so that he could talk and see. 
MAT.12.23	All the people were amazed and said, “Perhaps this man is the Son of David!”
MAT.12.24	When the Pharisees heard this, they said, “Jesus uses the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, to force demons out of people.”
MAT.12.25	Jesus knew what the Pharisees were thinking, so he said to them, 
MAT.12.38	Then some of the Pharisees and teachers of the law answered Jesus, saying, “Teacher, we want to see you work a miracle as a sign.”
MAT.12.39	Jesus answered, 
MAT.12.46	While Jesus was talking to the people, his mother and brothers stood outside, trying to find a way to talk to him. 
MAT.12.47	Someone told Jesus, “Your mother and brothers are standing outside, and they want to talk to you.”
MAT.12.48	He answered, 
MAT.12.49	Then he pointed to his followers and said, 
MAT.13.1	That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake. 
MAT.13.2	Large crowds gathered around him, so he got into a boat and sat down, while the people stood on the shore. 
MAT.13.3	Then Jesus used stories to teach them many things. He said: 
MAT.13.10	The followers came to Jesus and asked, “Why do you use stories to teach the people?”
MAT.13.11	Jesus answered, 
MAT.13.24	Then Jesus told them another story: 
MAT.13.31	Then Jesus told another story: 
MAT.13.33	Then Jesus told another story: 
MAT.13.34	Jesus used stories to tell all these things to the people; he always used stories to teach them. 
MAT.13.35	This is as the prophet said:
MAT.13.35	“I will speak using stories;
MAT.13.35	I will tell things that have been secret since the world was made.”
MAT.13.36	Then Jesus left the crowd and went into the house. His followers came to him and said, “Explain to us the meaning of the story about the weeds in the field.”
MAT.13.37	Jesus answered, 
MAT.13.51	Jesus asked his followers, 
MAT.13.51	They answered, “Yes, we understand.”
MAT.13.52	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.13.53	When Jesus finished teaching with these stories, he left there. 
MAT.13.54	He went to his hometown and taught the people in the synagogue, and they were amazed. They said, “Where did this man get this wisdom and this power to do miracles? 
MAT.13.55	He is just the son of a carpenter. His mother is Mary, and his brothers are James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas. 
MAT.13.56	And all his sisters are here with us. Where then does this man get all these things?” 
MAT.13.57	So the people were upset with Jesus.
MAT.13.57	But Jesus said to them, 
MAT.13.58	So he did not do many miracles there because they had no faith.
MAT.14.1	At that time Herod, the ruler of Galilee, heard the reports about Jesus. 
MAT.14.2	So he said to his servants, “Jesus is John the Baptist, who has risen from the dead. That is why he can work these miracles.”
MAT.14.3	Sometime before this, Herod had arrested John, tied him up, and put him into prison. Herod did this because of Herodias, who had been the wife of Philip, Herod’s brother. 
MAT.14.4	John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to be married to Herodias.” 
MAT.14.5	Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of the people, because they believed John was a prophet.
MAT.14.6	On Herod’s birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests, and she pleased him. 
MAT.14.7	So he promised with an oath to give her anything she wanted. 
MAT.14.8	Herodias told her daughter what to ask for, so she said to Herod, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.” 
MAT.14.9	Although King Herod was very sad, he had made a promise, and his dinner guests had heard him. So Herod ordered that what she asked for be done. 
MAT.14.10	He sent soldiers to the prison to cut off John’s head. 
MAT.14.11	And they brought it on a platter and gave it to the girl, and she took it to her mother. 
MAT.14.12	John’s followers came and got his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.
MAT.14.13	When Jesus heard what had happened to John, he left in a boat and went to a lonely place by himself. But the crowds heard about it and followed him on foot from the towns. 
MAT.14.14	When he arrived, he saw a great crowd waiting. He felt sorry for them and healed those who were sick.
MAT.14.15	When it was evening, his followers came to him and said, “No one lives in this place, and it is already late. Send the people away so they can go to the towns and buy food for themselves.”
MAT.14.16	But Jesus answered, 
MAT.14.17	They said to him, “But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish.”
MAT.14.18	Jesus said, 
MAT.14.19	Then he told the people to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and the two fish and, looking to heaven, he thanked God for the food. Jesus divided the bread and gave it to his followers, who gave it to the people. 
MAT.14.20	All the people ate and were satisfied. Then the followers filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of food. 
MAT.14.21	There were about five thousand men there who ate, not counting women and children.
MAT.14.22	Immediately Jesus told his followers to get into the boat and go ahead of him across the lake. He stayed there to send the people home. 
MAT.14.23	After he had sent them away, he went by himself up into the hills to pray. It was late, and Jesus was there alone. 
MAT.14.24	By this time, the boat was already far away from land. It was being hit by waves, because the wind was blowing against it.
MAT.14.25	Between three and six o’clock in the morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the water. 
MAT.14.26	When his followers saw him walking on the water, they were afraid. They said, “It’s a ghost!” and cried out in fear.
MAT.14.27	But Jesus quickly spoke to them, 
MAT.14.28	Peter said, “Lord, if it is really you, then command me to come to you on the water.”
MAT.14.29	Jesus said, 
MAT.14.29	And Peter left the boat and walked on the water to Jesus. 
MAT.14.30	But when Peter saw the wind and the waves, he became afraid and began to sink. He shouted, “Lord, save me!”
MAT.14.31	Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught Peter. Jesus said, 
MAT.14.32	After they got into the boat, the wind became calm. 
MAT.14.33	Then those who were in the boat worshiped Jesus and said, “Truly you are the Son of God!”
MAT.14.34	When they had crossed the lake, they came to shore at Gennesaret. 
MAT.14.35	When the people there recognized Jesus, they told people all around there that Jesus had come, and they brought all their sick to him. 
MAT.14.36	They begged Jesus to let them touch just the edge of his coat, and all who touched it were healed.
MAT.15.1	Then some Pharisees and teachers of the law came to Jesus from Jerusalem. They asked him, 
MAT.15.2	“Why don’t your followers obey the unwritten laws which have been handed down to us? They don’t wash their hands before they eat.”
MAT.15.3	Jesus answered, 
MAT.15.10	After Jesus called the crowd to him, he said, 
MAT.15.12	Then his followers came to him and asked, “Do you know that the Pharisees are angry because of what you said?”
MAT.15.13	Jesus answered, 
MAT.15.15	Peter said, “Explain the example to us.”
MAT.15.16	Jesus said, 
MAT.15.21	Jesus left that place and went to the area of Tyre and Sidon. 
MAT.15.22	A Canaanite woman from that area came to Jesus and cried out, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on me! My daughter has a demon, and she is suffering very much.”
MAT.15.23	But Jesus did not answer the woman. So his followers came to Jesus and begged him, “Tell the woman to go away. She is following us and shouting.”
MAT.15.24	Jesus answered, 
MAT.15.25	Then the woman came to Jesus again and bowed before him and said, “Lord, help me!”
MAT.15.26	Jesus answered, 
MAT.15.27	The woman said, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.”
MAT.15.28	Then Jesus answered, 
MAT.15.29	After leaving there, Jesus went along the shore of Lake Galilee. He went up on a hill and sat there.
MAT.15.30	Great crowds came to Jesus, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those who could not speak, and many others. They put them at Jesus’ feet, and he healed them. 
MAT.15.31	The crowd was amazed when they saw that people who could not speak before were now able to speak. The crippled were made strong. The lame could walk, and the blind could see. And they praised the God of Israel for this.
MAT.15.32	Jesus called his followers to him and said, 
MAT.15.33	His followers asked him, “How can we get enough bread to feed all these people? We are far away from any town.”
MAT.15.34	Jesus asked, 
MAT.15.34	They answered, “Seven, and a few small fish.”
MAT.15.35	Jesus told the people to sit on the ground. 
MAT.15.36	He took the seven loaves of bread and the fish and gave thanks to God. Then he divided the food and gave it to his followers, and they gave it to the people. 
MAT.15.37	All the people ate and were satisfied. Then his followers filled seven baskets with the leftover pieces of food. 
MAT.15.38	There were about four thousand men there who ate, besides women and children. 
MAT.15.39	After sending the people home, Jesus got into the boat and went to the area of Magadan.
MAT.16.1	The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus, wanting to trick him. So they asked him to show them a miracle from God.
MAT.16.2	Jesus answered, 
MAT.16.4	 Then Jesus left them and went away.
MAT.16.5	Jesus’ followers went across the lake, but they had forgotten to bring bread. 
MAT.16.6	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.16.7	His followers discussed the meaning of this, saying, “He said this because we forgot to bring bread.”
MAT.16.8	Knowing what they were talking about, Jesus asked them, 
MAT.16.12	Then the followers understood that Jesus was not telling them to beware of the yeast used in bread but to beware of the teaching of the Pharisees and the Sadducees.
MAT.16.13	When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his followers, 
MAT.16.14	They answered, “Some say you are John the Baptist. Others say you are Elijah, and still others say you are Jeremiah or one of the prophets.”
MAT.16.15	Then Jesus asked them, 
MAT.16.16	Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”
MAT.16.17	Jesus answered, 
MAT.16.20	Then Jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone he was the Christ.
MAT.16.21	From that time on Jesus began telling his followers that he must go to Jerusalem, where the Jewish elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of the law would make him suffer many things. He told them he must be killed and then be raised from the dead on the third day.
MAT.16.22	Peter took Jesus aside and told him not to talk like that. He said, “God save you from those things, Lord! Those things will never happen to you!”
MAT.16.23	Then Jesus said to Peter, 
MAT.16.24	Then Jesus said to his followers, 
MAT.17.1	Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John, the brother of James, up on a high mountain by themselves. 
MAT.17.2	While they watched, Jesus’ appearance was changed; his face became bright like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. 
MAT.17.3	Then Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
MAT.17.4	Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here. If you want, I will put up three tents here—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
MAT.17.5	While Peter was talking, a bright cloud covered them. A voice came from the cloud and said, “This is my Son, whom I love, and I am very pleased with him. Listen to him!”
MAT.17.6	When his followers heard the voice, they were so frightened they fell to the ground. 
MAT.17.7	But Jesus went to them and touched them and said, 
MAT.17.8	When they looked up, they saw Jesus was now alone.
MAT.17.9	As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone about what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
MAT.17.10	Then his followers asked him, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?”
MAT.17.11	Jesus answered, 
MAT.17.13	Then the followers understood that Jesus was talking about John the Baptist.
MAT.17.14	When Jesus and his followers came back to the crowd, a man came to Jesus and bowed before him. 
MAT.17.15	The man said, “Lord, have mercy on my son. He has epilepsy and is suffering very much, because he often falls into the fire or into the water. 
MAT.17.16	I brought him to your followers, but they could not cure him.”
MAT.17.17	Jesus answered, 
MAT.17.18	Jesus commanded the demon inside the boy. Then the demon came out, and the boy was healed from that time on.
MAT.17.19	The followers came to Jesus when he was alone and asked, “Why couldn’t we force the demon out?”
MAT.17.20	Jesus answered, 
MAT.17.22	While Jesus’ followers were gathering in Galilee, he said to them, 
MAT.17.23	 And the followers were filled with sadness.
MAT.17.24	When Jesus and his followers came to Capernaum, the men who collected the Temple tax came to Peter. They asked, “Does your teacher pay the Temple tax?”
MAT.17.25	Peter answered, “Yes, Jesus pays the tax.”
MAT.17.25	Peter went into the house, but before he could speak, Jesus said to him, 
MAT.17.26	Peter answered, “Other people pay the taxes.”
MAT.17.26	Jesus said to Peter, 
MAT.18.1	At that time the followers came to Jesus and asked, “Who is greatest in the kingdom of heaven?”
MAT.18.2	Jesus called a little child to him and stood the child before his followers. 
MAT.18.3	Then he said, 
MAT.18.21	Then Peter came to Jesus and asked, “Lord, when my fellow believer sins against me, how many times must I forgive him? Should I forgive him as many as seven times?”
MAT.18.22	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.1	After Jesus said all these things, he left Galilee and went into the area of Judea on the other side of the Jordan River. 
MAT.19.2	Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.
MAT.19.3	Some Pharisees came to Jesus and tried to trick him. They asked, “Is it right for a man to divorce his wife for any reason he chooses?”
MAT.19.4	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.7	The Pharisees asked, “Why then did Moses give a command for a man to divorce his wife by giving her divorce papers?”
MAT.19.8	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.10	The followers said to him, “If that is the only reason a man can divorce his wife, it is better not to marry.”
MAT.19.11	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.13	Then the people brought their little children to Jesus so he could put his hands on them and pray for them. His followers told them to stop, 
MAT.19.14	but Jesus said, 
MAT.19.15	After Jesus put his hands on the children, he left there.
MAT.19.16	A man came to Jesus and asked, “Teacher, what good thing must I do to have life forever?”
MAT.19.17	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.18	The man asked, “Which commands?”
MAT.19.18	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.20	The young man said, “I have obeyed all these things. What else do I need to do?”
MAT.19.21	Jesus answered, 
MAT.19.22	But when the young man heard this, he left sorrowfully, because he was rich.
MAT.19.23	Then Jesus said to his followers, 
MAT.19.25	When Jesus’ followers heard this, they were very surprised and asked, “Then who can be saved?”
MAT.19.26	Jesus looked at them and said, 
MAT.19.27	Peter said to Jesus, “Look, we have left everything and followed you. So what will we have?”
MAT.19.28	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.20.17	While Jesus was going to Jerusalem, he took his twelve followers aside privately and said to them, 
MAT.20.20	Then the wife of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons. She bowed before him and asked him to do something for her.
MAT.20.21	Jesus asked, 
MAT.20.21	She said, “Promise that one of my sons will sit at your right side and the other will sit at your left side in your kingdom.”
MAT.20.22	But Jesus said, 
MAT.20.22	The sons answered, “Yes, we can.”
MAT.20.23	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.20.24	When the other ten followers heard this, they were angry with the two brothers.
MAT.20.25	Jesus called all the followers together and said, 
MAT.20.29	When Jesus and his followers were leaving Jericho, a great many people followed him. 
MAT.20.30	Two blind men sitting by the road heard that Jesus was going by, so they shouted, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
MAT.20.31	The people warned the blind men to be quiet, but they shouted even more, “Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!”
MAT.20.32	Jesus stopped and said to the blind men, 
MAT.20.33	They answered, “Lord, we want to see.”
MAT.20.34	Jesus felt sorry for the blind men and touched their eyes, and at once they could see. Then they followed Jesus.
MAT.21.1	As Jesus and his followers were coming closer to Jerusalem, they stopped at Bethphage at the hill called the Mount of Olives. From there Jesus sent two of his followers 
MAT.21.2	and said to them, 
MAT.21.4	This was to bring about what the prophet had said:
MAT.21.5	“Tell the people of Jerusalem,
MAT.21.5	‘Your king is coming to you.
MAT.21.5	He is gentle and riding on a donkey,
MAT.21.5	on the colt of a donkey.’ ”
MAT.21.6	The followers went and did what Jesus told them to do. 
MAT.21.7	They brought the donkey and the colt to Jesus and laid their coats on them, and Jesus sat on them. 
MAT.21.8	Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. 
MAT.21.9	The people were walking ahead of Jesus and behind him, shouting,
MAT.21.9	“Praise to the Son of David!
MAT.21.9	God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord!
MAT.21.9	Praise to God in heaven!”
MAT.21.10	When Jesus entered Jerusalem, all the city was filled with excitement. The people asked, “Who is this man?”
MAT.21.11	The crowd said, “This man is Jesus, the prophet from the town of Nazareth in Galilee.”
MAT.21.12	Jesus went into the Temple and threw out all the people who were buying and selling there. He turned over the tables of those who were exchanging different kinds of money, and he upset the benches of those who were selling doves. 
MAT.21.13	Jesus said to all the people there, 
MAT.21.14	The blind and crippled people came to Jesus in the Temple, and he healed them. 
MAT.21.15	The leading priests and the teachers of the law saw that Jesus was doing wonderful things and that the children were praising him in the Temple, saying, “Praise to the Son of David.” All these things made the priests and the teachers of the law very angry.
MAT.21.16	They asked Jesus, “Do you hear the things these children are saying?”
MAT.21.16	Jesus answered, 
MAT.21.17	Then Jesus left and went out of the city to Bethany, where he spent the night.
MAT.21.18	Early the next morning, as Jesus was going back to the city, he became hungry. 
MAT.21.19	Seeing a fig tree beside the road, Jesus went to it, but there were no figs on the tree, only leaves. So Jesus said to the tree, 
MAT.21.20	When his followers saw this, they were amazed. They asked, “How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?”
MAT.21.21	Jesus answered, 
MAT.21.23	Jesus went to the Temple, and while he was teaching there, the leading priests and the elders of the people came to him. They said, “What authority do you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”
MAT.21.24	Jesus answered, 
MAT.21.25	They argued about Jesus’ question, saying, “If we answer, ‘John’s baptism was from God,’ Jesus will say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 
MAT.21.26	But if we say, ‘It was from people,’ we are afraid of what the crowd will do because they all believe that John was a prophet.”
MAT.21.27	So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
MAT.21.27	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.31	The priests and leaders answered, “The first son.”
MAT.21.31	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.41	The priests and leaders said, “He will surely kill those evil men. Then he will lease the vineyard to some other farmers who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time.”
MAT.21.42	Jesus said to them, 
MAT.21.45	When the leading priests and the Pharisees heard these stories, they knew Jesus was talking about them. 
MAT.21.46	They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the people, because the people believed that Jesus was a prophet.
MAT.22.1	Jesus again used stories to teach them. He said, 
MAT.22.15	Then the Pharisees left that place and made plans to trap Jesus in saying something wrong. 
MAT.22.16	They sent some of their own followers and some people from the group called Herodians. They said, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest man and that you teach the truth about God’s way. You are not afraid of what other people think about you, because you pay no attention to who they are. 
MAT.22.17	So tell us what you think. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
MAT.22.18	But knowing that these leaders were trying to trick him, Jesus said, 
MAT.22.19	 So the men showed him a coin. 
MAT.22.20	Then Jesus asked, 
MAT.22.21	The men answered, “Caesar’s.”
MAT.22.21	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.22.22	When the men heard what Jesus said, they were amazed and left him and went away.
MAT.22.23	That same day some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question. (Sadducees believed that people would not rise from the dead.) 
MAT.22.24	They said, “Teacher, Moses said if a married man dies without having children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for him. 
MAT.22.25	Once there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died. Since he had no children, his brother married the widow. 
MAT.22.26	Then the second brother also died. The same thing happened to the third brother and all the other brothers. 
MAT.22.27	Finally, the woman died. 
MAT.22.28	Since all seven men had married her, when people rise from the dead, whose wife will she be?”
MAT.22.29	Jesus answered, 
MAT.22.33	When the people heard this, they were amazed at Jesus’ teaching.
MAT.22.34	When the Pharisees learned that the Sadducees could not argue with Jesus’ answers to them, the Pharisees met together. 
MAT.22.35	One Pharisee, who was an expert on the law of Moses, asked Jesus this question to test him: 
MAT.22.36	“Teacher, which command in the law is the most important?”
MAT.22.37	Jesus answered, 
MAT.22.41	While the Pharisees were together, Jesus asked them, 
MAT.22.42	They answered, “The Christ is the Son of David.”
MAT.22.43	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.22.46	None of the Pharisees could answer Jesus’ question, and after that day no one was brave enough to ask him any more questions.
MAT.23.1	Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his followers, 
MAT.24.1	As Jesus left the Temple and was walking away, his followers came up to show him the Temple’s buildings. 
MAT.24.2	Jesus asked, 
MAT.24.3	Later, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, his followers came to be alone with him. They said, “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that it is time for you to come again and for this age to end?”
MAT.24.4	Jesus answered, 
MAT.24.15	(You who read this should understand what it means.) 
MAT.26.1	After Jesus finished saying all these things, he told his followers, 
MAT.26.3	Then the leading priests and the elders had a meeting at the palace of the high priest, named Caiaphas. 
MAT.26.4	At the meeting, they planned to set a trap to arrest Jesus and kill him. 
MAT.26.5	But they said, “We must not do it during the feast, because the people might cause a riot.”
MAT.26.6	Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon, who had a skin disease. 
MAT.26.7	While Jesus was there, a woman approached him with an alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume. She poured this perfume on Jesus’ head while he was eating.
MAT.26.8	His followers were upset when they saw the woman do this. They asked, “Why waste that perfume? 
MAT.26.9	It could have been sold for a great deal of money and the money given to the poor.”
MAT.26.10	Knowing what had happened, Jesus said, 
MAT.26.14	Then one of the twelve apostles, Judas Iscariot, went to talk to the leading priests. 
MAT.26.15	He said, “What will you pay me for giving Jesus to you?” And they gave him thirty silver coins. 
MAT.26.16	After that, Judas watched for the best time to turn Jesus in.
MAT.26.17	On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the followers came to Jesus. They said, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?”
MAT.26.18	Jesus answered, 
MAT.26.19	The followers did what Jesus told them to do, and they prepared the Passover meal.
MAT.26.20	In the evening Jesus was sitting at the table with his twelve followers. 
MAT.26.21	As they were eating, Jesus said, 
MAT.26.22	This made the followers very sad. Each one began to say to Jesus, “Surely, Lord, I am not the one who will turn against you, am I?”
MAT.26.23	Jesus answered, 
MAT.26.25	Then Judas, who would give Jesus to his enemies, said to Jesus, “Teacher, surely I am not the one, am I?”
MAT.26.25	Jesus answered, 
MAT.26.26	While they were eating, Jesus took some bread and thanked God for it and broke it. Then he gave it to his followers and said, 
MAT.26.27	Then Jesus took a cup and thanked God for it and gave it to the followers. He said, 
MAT.26.30	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MAT.26.31	Jesus told his followers, 
MAT.26.33	Peter said, “Everyone else may stumble in their faith because of you, but I will not.”
MAT.26.34	Jesus said, 
MAT.26.35	But Peter said, “I will never say that I don’t know you! I will even die with you!” And all the other followers said the same thing.
MAT.26.36	Then Jesus went with his followers to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, 
MAT.26.37	He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and he began to be very sad and troubled. 
MAT.26.38	He said to them, 
MAT.26.39	After walking a little farther away from them, Jesus fell to the ground and prayed, 
MAT.26.40	Then Jesus went back to his followers and found them asleep. He said to Peter, 
MAT.26.42	Then Jesus went away a second time and prayed, 
MAT.26.43	Then he went back to his followers, and again he found them asleep, because their eyes were heavy. 
MAT.26.44	So Jesus left them and went away and prayed a third time, saying the same thing.
MAT.26.45	Then Jesus went back to his followers and said, 
MAT.26.47	While Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, came up. With him were many people carrying swords and clubs who had been sent from the leading priests and the Jewish elders of the people. 
MAT.26.48	Judas had planned to give them a signal, saying, “The man I kiss is Jesus. Arrest him.” 
MAT.26.49	At once Judas went to Jesus and said, “Greetings, Teacher!” and kissed him.
MAT.26.50	Jesus answered, 
MAT.26.50	Then the people came and grabbed Jesus and arrested him. 
MAT.26.51	When that happened, one of Jesus’ followers reached for his sword and pulled it out. He struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
MAT.26.52	Jesus said to the man, 
MAT.26.55	Then Jesus said to the crowd, 
MAT.26.56	 Then all of Jesus’ followers left him and ran away.
MAT.26.57	Those people who arrested Jesus led him to the house of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders were gathered. 
MAT.26.58	Peter followed far behind to the courtyard of the high priest’s house, and he sat down with the guards to see what would happen to Jesus.
MAT.26.59	The leading priests and the whole Jewish council tried to find something false against Jesus so they could kill him. 
MAT.26.60	Many people came and told lies about him, but the council could find no real reason to kill him. Then two people came and said, 
MAT.26.61	“This man said, ‘I can destroy the Temple of God and build it again in three days.’ ”
MAT.26.62	Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Aren’t you going to answer? Don’t you have something to say about their charges against you?” 
MAT.26.63	But Jesus said nothing.
MAT.26.63	Again the high priest said to Jesus, “I command you by the power of the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”
MAT.26.64	Jesus answered, 
MAT.26.65	When the high priest heard this, he tore his clothes and said, “This man has said things that are against God! We don’t need any more witnesses; you all heard him say these things against God. 
MAT.26.66	What do you think?”
MAT.26.66	The people answered, “He should die.”
MAT.26.67	Then the people there spat in Jesus’ face and beat him with their fists. Others slapped him. 
MAT.26.68	They said, “Prove to us that you are a prophet, you Christ! Tell us who hit you!”
MAT.26.69	At that time, as Peter was sitting in the courtyard, a servant girl came to him and said, “You also were with Jesus of Galilee.”
MAT.26.70	But Peter said to all the people there that he was never with Jesus. He said, “I don’t know what you are talking about.”
MAT.26.71	When he left the courtyard and was at the gate, another girl saw him. She said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”
MAT.26.72	Again, Peter said he was never with him, saying, “I swear I don’t know this man Jesus!”
MAT.26.73	A short time later, some people standing there went to Peter and said, “Surely you are one of those who followed Jesus. The way you talk shows it.”
MAT.26.74	Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear, “I don’t know the man.” At once, a rooster crowed. 
MAT.26.75	And Peter remembered what Jesus had told him: 
MAT.27.1	Early the next morning, all the leading priests and elders of the people decided that Jesus should die. 
MAT.27.2	They tied him, led him away, and turned him over to Pilate, the governor.
MAT.27.3	Judas, the one who had given Jesus to his enemies, saw that they had decided to kill Jesus. Then he was very sorry for what he had done. So he took the thirty silver coins back to the priests and the leaders, 
MAT.27.4	saying, “I sinned; I handed over to you an innocent man.”
MAT.27.4	The leaders answered, “What is that to us? That’s your problem, not ours.”
MAT.27.5	So Judas threw the money into the Temple. Then he went off and hanged himself.
MAT.27.6	The leading priests picked up the silver coins in the Temple and said, “Our law does not allow us to keep this money with the Temple money, because it has paid for a man’s death.” 
MAT.27.7	So they decided to use the coins to buy Potter’s Field as a place to bury strangers who died in Jerusalem. 
MAT.27.8	That is why that field is still called the Field of Blood. 
MAT.27.9	So what Jeremiah the prophet had said came true: “They took thirty silver coins. That is how little the Israelites thought he was worth. 
MAT.27.10	They used those thirty silver coins to buy the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”
MAT.27.11	Jesus stood before Pilate the governor, and Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
MAT.27.11	Jesus answered, 
MAT.27.12	When the leading priests and the elders accused Jesus, he said nothing.
MAT.27.13	So Pilate said to Jesus, “Don’t you hear them accusing you of all these things?”
MAT.27.14	But Jesus said nothing in answer to Pilate, and Pilate was very surprised at this.
MAT.27.15	Every year at the time of Passover the governor would free one prisoner whom the people chose. 
MAT.27.16	At that time there was a man in prison, named Barabbas, who was known to be very bad. 
MAT.27.17	When the people gathered at Pilate’s house, Pilate said, “Whom do you want me to set free: Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?” 
MAT.27.18	Pilate knew that they turned Jesus in to him because they were jealous.
MAT.27.19	While Pilate was sitting there on the judge’s seat, his wife sent this message to him: “Don’t do anything to that man, because he is innocent. Today I had a dream about him, and it troubled me very much.”
MAT.27.20	But the leading priests and elders convinced the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be freed and for Jesus to be killed.
MAT.27.21	Pilate said, “I have Barabbas and Jesus. Which do you want me to set free for you?”
MAT.27.21	The people answered, “Barabbas.”
MAT.27.22	Pilate asked, “So what should I do with Jesus, the one called the Christ?”
MAT.27.22	They all answered, “Crucify him!”
MAT.27.23	Pilate asked, “Why? What wrong has he done?”
MAT.27.23	But they shouted louder, “Crucify him!”
MAT.27.24	When Pilate saw that he could do nothing about this and that a riot was starting, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. Then he said, “I am not guilty of this man’s death. You are the ones who are causing it!”
MAT.27.25	All the people answered, “We and our children will be responsible for his death.”
MAT.27.26	Then he set Barabbas free. But Jesus was beaten with whips and handed over to the soldiers to be crucified.
MAT.27.27	The governor’s soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace, and they all gathered around him. 
MAT.27.28	They took off his clothes and put a red robe on him. 
MAT.27.29	Using thorny branches, they made a crown, put it on his head, and put a stick in his right hand. Then the soldiers bowed before Jesus and made fun of him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MAT.27.30	They spat on Jesus. Then they took his stick and began to beat him on the head. 
MAT.27.31	After they finished, the soldiers took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.
MAT.27.32	As the soldiers were going out of the city with Jesus, they forced a man from Cyrene, named Simon, to carry the cross for Jesus. 
MAT.27.33	They all came to the place called Golgotha, which means the Place of the Skull. 
MAT.27.34	The soldiers gave Jesus wine mixed with gall to drink. He tasted the wine but refused to drink it. 
MAT.27.35	When the soldiers had crucified him, they threw lots to decide who would get his clothes. 
MAT.27.36	The soldiers sat there and continued watching him. 
MAT.27.37	They put a sign above Jesus’ head with a charge against him. It said: 
MAT.27.38	Two robbers were crucified beside Jesus, one on the right and the other on the left. 
MAT.27.39	People walked by and insulted Jesus and shook their heads, 
MAT.27.40	saying, “You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days. So save yourself! Come down from that cross if you are really the Son of God!”
MAT.27.41	The leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the Jewish elders were also making fun of Jesus. 
MAT.27.42	They said, “He saved others, but he can’t save himself! He says he is the king of Israel! If he is the king, let him come down now from the cross. Then we will believe in him. 
MAT.27.43	He trusts in God, so let God save him now, if God really wants him. He himself said, ‘I am the Son of God.’ ” 
MAT.27.44	And in the same way, the robbers who were being crucified beside Jesus also insulted him.
MAT.27.45	At noon the whole country became dark, and the darkness lasted for three hours. 
MAT.27.46	About three o’clock Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 
MAT.27.47	Some of the people standing there who heard this said, “He is calling Elijah.”
MAT.27.48	Quickly one of them ran and got a sponge and filled it with vinegar and tied it to a stick and gave it to Jesus to drink. 
MAT.27.49	But the others said, “Don’t bother him. We want to see if Elijah will come to save him.”
MAT.27.50	But Jesus cried out again in a loud voice and died.
MAT.27.51	Then the curtain in the Temple was torn into two pieces, from the top to the bottom. Also, the earth shook and rocks broke apart. 
MAT.27.52	The graves opened, and many of God’s people who had died were raised from the dead. 
MAT.27.53	They came out of the graves after Jesus was raised from the dead and went into the holy city, where they appeared to many people.
MAT.27.54	When the army officer and the soldiers guarding Jesus saw this earthquake and everything else that happened, they were very frightened and said, “He really was the Son of God!”
MAT.27.55	Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to help him were standing at a distance from the cross, watching. 
MAT.27.56	Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of James and John were there.
MAT.27.57	That evening a rich man named Joseph, a follower of Jesus from the town of Arimathea, came to Jerusalem. 
MAT.27.58	Joseph went to Pilate and asked to have Jesus’ body. So Pilate gave orders for the soldiers to give it to Joseph. 
MAT.27.59	Then Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. 
MAT.27.60	He put Jesus’ body in a new tomb that he had cut out of a wall of rock, and he rolled a very large stone to block the entrance of the tomb. Then Joseph went away. 
MAT.27.61	Mary Magdalene and the other woman named Mary were sitting near the tomb.
MAT.27.62	The next day, the day after Preparation Day, the leading priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate. 
MAT.27.63	They said, “Sir, we remember that while that liar was still alive he said, 
MAT.27.64	So give the order for the tomb to be guarded closely till the third day. Otherwise, his followers might come and steal the body and tell people that he has risen from the dead. That lie would be even worse than the first one.”
MAT.27.65	Pilate said, “Take some soldiers and go guard the tomb the best way you know.” 
MAT.27.66	So they all went to the tomb and made it safe from thieves by sealing the stone in the entrance and putting soldiers there to guard it.
MAT.28.1	The day after the Sabbath day was the first day of the week. At dawn on the first day, Mary Magdalene and another woman named Mary went to look at the tomb.
MAT.28.2	At that time there was a strong earthquake. An angel of the Lord came down from heaven, went to the tomb, and rolled the stone away from the entrance. Then he sat on the stone. 
MAT.28.3	He was shining as bright as lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. 
MAT.28.4	The soldiers guarding the tomb shook with fear because of the angel, and they became like dead men.
MAT.28.5	The angel said to the women, “Don’t be afraid. I know that you are looking for Jesus, who has been crucified. 
MAT.28.6	He is not here. He has risen from the dead as he said he would. Come and see the place where his body was. 
MAT.28.7	And go quickly and tell his followers, ‘Jesus has risen from the dead. He is going into Galilee ahead of you, and you will see him there.’ ” Then the angel said, “Now I have told you.”
MAT.28.8	The women left the tomb quickly. They were afraid, but they were also very happy. They ran to tell Jesus’ followers what had happened. 
MAT.28.9	Suddenly, Jesus met them and said, 
MAT.28.10	Then Jesus said to them, 
MAT.28.11	While the women went to tell Jesus’ followers, some of the soldiers who had been guarding the tomb went into the city to tell the leading priests everything that had happened. 
MAT.28.12	Then the priests met with the elders and made a plan. They paid the soldiers a large amount of money 
MAT.28.13	and said to them, “Tell the people that Jesus’ followers came during the night and stole the body while you were asleep. 
MAT.28.14	If the governor hears about this, we will satisfy him and save you from trouble.” 
MAT.28.15	So the soldiers kept the money and did as they were told. And that story is still spread among the people even today.
MAT.28.16	The eleven followers went to Galilee to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. 
MAT.28.17	On the mountain they saw Jesus and worshiped him, but some of them did not believe it was really Jesus. 
MAT.28.18	Then Jesus came to them and said, 
MRK.1.1	This is the beginning of the Good News about Jesus Christ, the Son of God, 
MRK.1.2	as the prophet Isaiah wrote:
MRK.1.2	“I will send my messenger ahead of you,
MRK.1.2	who will prepare your way.” 
MRK.1.3	“This is a voice of one
MRK.1.3	who calls out in the desert:
MRK.1.3	‘Prepare the way for the Lord.
MRK.1.3	Make the road straight for him.’ ”
MRK.1.4	John was baptizing people in the desert and preaching a baptism of changed hearts and lives for the forgiveness of sins. 
MRK.1.5	All the people from Judea and Jerusalem were going out to him. They confessed their sins and were baptized by him in the Jordan River. 
MRK.1.6	John wore clothes made from camel’s hair, had a leather belt around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey. 
MRK.1.7	This is what John preached to the people: “There is one coming after me who is greater than I; I am not good enough even to kneel down and untie his sandals. 
MRK.1.8	I baptize you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”
MRK.1.9	At that time Jesus came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River. 
MRK.1.10	Immediately, as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw heaven open. The Holy Spirit came down on him like a dove, 
MRK.1.11	and a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love, and I am very pleased with you.”
MRK.1.12	Then the Spirit sent Jesus into the desert. 
MRK.1.13	He was in the desert forty days and was tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals, and the angels came and took care of him.
MRK.1.14	After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, preaching the Good News from God. 
MRK.1.15	He said, 
MRK.1.16	When Jesus was walking by Lake Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the lake because they were fishermen. 
MRK.1.17	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.1.18	So Simon and Andrew immediately left their nets and followed him.
MRK.1.19	Going a little farther, Jesus saw two more brothers, James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat, mending their nets. 
MRK.1.20	Jesus immediately called them, and they left their father in the boat with the hired workers and followed Jesus.
MRK.1.21	Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum. On the Sabbath day He went to the synagogue and began to teach. 
MRK.1.22	The people were amazed at his teaching, because he taught like a person who had authority, not like their teachers of the law. 
MRK.1.23	Just then, a man was there in the synagogue who had an evil spirit in him. He shouted, 
MRK.1.24	“Jesus of Nazareth! What do you want with us? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are—God’s Holy One!”
MRK.1.25	Jesus commanded the evil spirit, 
MRK.1.26	The evil spirit shook the man violently, gave a loud cry, and then came out of him.
MRK.1.27	The people were so amazed they asked each other, “What is happening here? This man is teaching something new, and with authority. He even gives commands to evil spirits, and they obey him.” 
MRK.1.28	And the news about Jesus spread quickly everywhere in the area of Galilee.
MRK.1.29	As soon as Jesus and his followers left the synagogue, they went with James and John to the home of Simon and Andrew. 
MRK.1.30	Simon’s mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, and the people told Jesus about her. 
MRK.1.31	So Jesus went to her bed, took her hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began serving them.
MRK.1.32	That evening, after the sun went down, the people brought to Jesus all who were sick and had demons in them. 
MRK.1.33	The whole town gathered at the door. 
MRK.1.34	Jesus healed many who had different kinds of sicknesses, and he forced many demons to leave people. But he would not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who he was.
MRK.1.35	Early the next morning, while it was still dark, Jesus woke and left the house. He went to a lonely place, where he prayed. 
MRK.1.36	Simon and his friends went to look for Jesus. 
MRK.1.37	When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you!”
MRK.1.38	Jesus answered, 
MRK.1.39	So he went everywhere in Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and forcing out demons.
MRK.1.40	A man with a skin disease came to Jesus. He fell to his knees and begged Jesus, “You can heal me if you will.”
MRK.1.41	Jesus felt sorry for the man, so he reached out his hand and touched him and said, 
MRK.1.42	Immediately the disease left the man, and he was healed.
MRK.1.43	Jesus told the man to go away at once, but he warned him strongly, 
MRK.1.45	The man left there, but he began to tell everyone that Jesus had healed him, and so he spread the news about Jesus. As a result, Jesus could not enter a town if people saw him. He stayed in places where nobody lived, but people came to him from everywhere.
MRK.2.1	A few days later, when Jesus came back to Capernaum, the news spread that he was at home. 
MRK.2.2	Many people gathered together so that there was no room in the house, not even outside the door. And Jesus was teaching them God’s message. 
MRK.2.3	Four people came, carrying a paralyzed man. 
MRK.2.4	Since they could not get to Jesus because of the crowd, they dug a hole in the roof right above where he was speaking. When they got through, they lowered the mat with the paralyzed man on it. 
MRK.2.5	When Jesus saw the faith of these people, he said to the paralyzed man, 
MRK.2.6	Some of the teachers of the law were sitting there, thinking to themselves, 
MRK.2.7	“Why does this man say things like that? He is speaking as if he were God. Only God can forgive sins.”
MRK.2.8	Jesus knew immediately what these teachers of the law were thinking. So he said to them, 
MRK.2.10	 So Jesus said to the paralyzed man, 
MRK.2.12	Immediately the paralyzed man stood up, took his mat, and walked out while everyone was watching him.
MRK.2.12	The people were amazed and praised God. They said, “We have never seen anything like this!”
MRK.2.13	Jesus went to the lake again. The whole crowd followed him there, and he taught them. 
MRK.2.14	While he was walking along, he saw a man named Levi son of Alphaeus, sitting in the tax collector’s booth. Jesus said to him, 
MRK.2.15	Later, as Jesus was having dinner at Levi’s house, many tax collectors and “sinners” were eating there with Jesus and his followers. Many people like this followed Jesus. 
MRK.2.16	When the teachers of the law who were Pharisees saw Jesus eating with the tax collectors and “sinners,” they asked his followers, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”
MRK.2.17	Jesus heard this and said to them, 
MRK.2.18	Now the followers of John and the Pharisees often fasted for a certain time. Some people came to Jesus and said, “Why do John’s followers and the followers of the Pharisees often fast, but your followers don’t?”
MRK.2.19	Jesus answered, 
MRK.2.23	One Sabbath day, as Jesus was walking through some fields of grain, his followers began to pick some grain to eat. 
MRK.2.24	The Pharisees said to Jesus, “Why are your followers doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”
MRK.2.25	Jesus answered, 
MRK.2.27	Then Jesus said to the Pharisees, 
MRK.3.1	Another time when Jesus went into a synagogue, a man with a crippled hand was there. 
MRK.3.2	Some people watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man on the Sabbath day so they could accuse him.
MRK.3.3	Jesus said to the man with the crippled hand, 
MRK.3.4	Then Jesus asked the people, 
MRK.3.5	Jesus was angry as he looked at the people, and he felt very sad because they were stubborn. Then he said to the man, 
MRK.3.6	Then the Pharisees left and began making plans with the Herodians about a way to kill Jesus.
MRK.3.7	Jesus left with his followers for the lake, and a large crowd from Galilee followed him. 
MRK.3.8	Also many people came from Judea, from Jerusalem, from Idumea, from the lands across the Jordan River, and from the area of Tyre and Sidon. When they heard what Jesus was doing, many people came to him. 
MRK.3.9	When Jesus saw the crowds, he told his followers to get a boat ready for him to keep people from crowding against him. 
MRK.3.10	He had healed many people, so all the sick were pushing toward him to touch him. 
MRK.3.11	When evil spirits saw Jesus, they fell down before him and shouted, “You are the Son of God!” 
MRK.3.12	But Jesus strongly warned them not to tell who he was.
MRK.3.13	Then Jesus went up on a mountain and called to him those he wanted, and they came to him. 
MRK.3.14	Jesus chose twelve and called them apostles. He wanted them to be with him, and he wanted to send them out to preach 
MRK.3.15	and to have the authority to force demons out of people. 
MRK.3.16	These are the twelve men he chose: Simon (Jesus named him Peter), 
MRK.3.17	James and John, the sons of Zebedee (Jesus named them Boanerges, which means “Sons of Thunder”), 
MRK.3.18	Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, 
MRK.3.19	and Judas Iscariot, who later turned against Jesus.
MRK.3.20	Then Jesus went home, but again a crowd gathered. There were so many people that Jesus and his followers could not eat. 
MRK.3.21	When his family heard this, they went to get him because they thought he was out of his mind. 
MRK.3.22	But the teachers of the law from Jerusalem were saying, “Beelzebul is living inside him! He uses power from the ruler of demons to force demons out of people.”
MRK.3.23	So Jesus called the people together and taught them with stories. He said, 
MRK.3.30	Jesus said this because the teachers of the law said that he had an evil spirit inside him.
MRK.3.31	Then Jesus’ mother and brothers arrived. Standing outside, they sent someone in to tell him to come out. 
MRK.3.32	Many people were sitting around Jesus, and they said to him, “Your mother and brothers are waiting for you outside.”
MRK.3.33	Jesus asked, 
MRK.3.34	Then he looked at those sitting around him and said, 
MRK.4.1	Again Jesus began teaching by the lake. A great crowd gathered around him, so he sat down in a boat near the shore. All the people stayed on the shore close to the water. 
MRK.4.2	Jesus taught them many things, using stories. He said, 
MRK.4.9	Then Jesus said, 
MRK.4.10	Later, when Jesus was alone, the twelve apostles and others around him asked him about the stories.
MRK.4.11	Jesus said, 
MRK.4.13	Then Jesus said to his followers, 
MRK.4.21	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.4.26	Then Jesus said, 
MRK.4.30	Then Jesus said, 
MRK.4.33	Jesus used many stories like these to teach the crowd God’s message—as much as they could understand. 
MRK.4.34	He always used stories to teach them. But when he and his followers were alone, Jesus explained everything to them.
MRK.4.35	That evening, Jesus said to his followers, 
MRK.4.36	Leaving the crowd behind, they took him in the boat just as he was. There were also other boats with them. 
MRK.4.37	A very strong wind came up on the lake. The waves came over the sides and into the boat so that it was already full of water. 
MRK.4.38	Jesus was at the back of the boat, sleeping with his head on a cushion. His followers woke him and said, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are drowning!”
MRK.4.39	Jesus stood up and commanded the wind and said to the waves, 
MRK.4.40	Jesus said to his followers, 
MRK.4.41	The followers were very afraid and asked each other, “Who is this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!”
MRK.5.1	Jesus and his followers went to the other side of the lake to the area of the Gerasene people. 
MRK.5.2	When Jesus got out of the boat, instantly a man with an evil spirit came to him from the burial caves. 
MRK.5.3	This man lived in the caves, and no one could tie him up, not even with a chain. 
MRK.5.4	Many times people had used chains to tie the man’s hands and feet, but he always broke them off. No one was strong enough to control him. 
MRK.5.5	Day and night he would wander around the burial caves and on the hills, screaming and cutting himself with stones. 
MRK.5.6	While Jesus was still far away, the man saw him, ran to him, and fell down before him.
MRK.5.7	The man shouted in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I command you in God’s name not to torture me!” 
MRK.5.8	He said this because Jesus was saying to him, 
MRK.5.9	Then Jesus asked him, 
MRK.5.9	He answered, “My name is Legion, because we are many spirits.” 
MRK.5.10	He begged Jesus again and again not to send them out of that area.
MRK.5.11	A large herd of pigs was feeding on a hill near there. 
MRK.5.12	The demons begged Jesus, “Send us into the pigs; let us go into them.” 
MRK.5.13	So Jesus allowed them to do this. The evil spirits left the man and went into the pigs. Then the herd of pigs—about two thousand of them—rushed down the hill into the lake and were drowned.
MRK.5.14	The herdsmen ran away and went to the town and to the countryside, telling everyone about this. So people went out to see what had happened. 
MRK.5.15	They came to Jesus and saw the man who used to have the many evil spirits, sitting, clothed, and in his right mind. And they were frightened. 
MRK.5.16	The people who saw this told the others what had happened to the man who had the demons living in him, and they told about the pigs. 
MRK.5.17	Then the people began to beg Jesus to leave their area.
MRK.5.18	As Jesus was getting back into the boat, the man who was freed from the demons begged to go with him.
MRK.5.19	But Jesus would not let him. He said, 
MRK.5.20	So the man left and began to tell the people in the Ten Towns about what Jesus had done for him. And everyone was amazed.
MRK.5.21	When Jesus went in the boat back to the other side of the lake, a large crowd gathered around him there. 
MRK.5.22	A leader of the synagogue, named Jairus, came there, saw Jesus, and fell at his feet. 
MRK.5.23	He begged Jesus, saying again and again, “My daughter is dying. Please come and put your hands on her so she will be healed and will live.” 
MRK.5.24	So Jesus went with him.
MRK.5.24	A large crowd followed Jesus and pushed very close around him. 
MRK.5.25	Among them was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years. 
MRK.5.26	She had suffered very much from many doctors and had spent all the money she had, but instead of improving, she was getting worse. 
MRK.5.27	When the woman heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his coat. 
MRK.5.28	She thought, “If I can just touch his clothes, I will be healed.” 
MRK.5.29	Instantly her bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her disease.
MRK.5.30	At once Jesus felt power go out from him. So he turned around in the crowd and asked, 
MRK.5.31	His followers said, “Look at how many people are pushing against you! And you ask, 
MRK.5.32	But Jesus continued looking around to see who had touched him. 
MRK.5.33	The woman, knowing that she was healed, came and fell at Jesus’ feet. Shaking with fear, she told him the whole truth. 
MRK.5.34	Jesus said to her, 
MRK.5.35	While Jesus was still speaking, some people came from the house of the synagogue leader. They said, “Your daughter is dead. There is no need to bother the teacher anymore.”
MRK.5.36	But Jesus paid no attention to what they said. He told the synagogue leader, 
MRK.5.37	Jesus let only Peter, James, and John the brother of James go with him. 
MRK.5.38	When they came to the house of the synagogue leader, Jesus found many people there making lots of noise and crying loudly. 
MRK.5.39	Jesus entered the house and said to them, 
MRK.5.40	But they laughed at him. So, after throwing them out of the house, Jesus took the child’s father and mother and his three followers into the room where the child was. 
MRK.5.41	Taking hold of the girl’s hand, he said to her, 
MRK.5.42	At once the girl stood right up and began walking. (She was twelve years old.) Everyone was completely amazed. 
MRK.5.43	Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell people about this. Then he told them to give the girl something to eat.
MRK.6.1	Jesus left there and went to his hometown, and his followers went with him. 
MRK.6.2	On the Sabbath day he taught in the synagogue. Many people heard him and were amazed, saying, “Where did this man get these teachings? What is this wisdom that has been given to him? And where did he get the power to do miracles? 
MRK.6.3	He is just the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon. And his sisters are here with us.” So the people were upset with Jesus.
MRK.6.4	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.6.5	So Jesus was not able to work any miracles there except to heal a few sick people by putting his hands on them. 
MRK.6.6	He was amazed at how many people had no faith.
MRK.6.6	Then Jesus went to other villages in that area and taught. 
MRK.6.7	He called his twelve followers together and got ready to send them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits. 
MRK.6.8	This is what Jesus commanded them: 
MRK.6.12	So the followers went out and preached that people should change their hearts and lives. 
MRK.6.13	They forced many demons out and put olive oil on many sick people and healed them.
MRK.6.14	King Herod heard about Jesus, because he was now well known. Some people said, “He is John the Baptist, who has risen from the dead. That is why he can work these miracles.”
MRK.6.15	Others said, “He is Elijah.”
MRK.6.15	Other people said, “Jesus is a prophet, like the prophets who lived long ago.”
MRK.6.16	When Herod heard this, he said, “I killed John by cutting off his head. Now he has risen from the dead!”
MRK.6.17	Herod himself had ordered his soldiers to arrest John and put him in prison in order to please his wife, Herodias. She had been the wife of Philip, Herod’s brother, but then Herod had married her. 
MRK.6.18	John had been telling Herod, “It is not lawful for you to be married to your brother’s wife.” 
MRK.6.19	So Herodias hated John and wanted to kill him. But she couldn’t, 
MRK.6.20	because Herod was afraid of John and protected him. He knew John was a good and holy man. Also, though John’s preaching always bothered him, he enjoyed listening to John.
MRK.6.21	Then the perfect time came for Herodias to cause John’s death. On Herod’s birthday, he gave a dinner party for the most important government leaders, the commanders of his army, and the most important people in Galilee. 
MRK.6.22	When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and the people eating with him.
MRK.6.22	So King Herod said to the girl, “Ask me for anything you want, and I will give it to you.” 
MRK.6.23	He promised her, “Anything you ask for I will give to you—up to half of my kingdom.”
MRK.6.24	The girl went to her mother and asked, “What should I ask for?”
MRK.6.24	Her mother answered, “Ask for the head of John the Baptist.”
MRK.6.25	At once the girl went back to the king and said to him, “I want the head of John the Baptist right now on a platter.”
MRK.6.26	Although the king was very sad, he had made a promise, and his dinner guests had heard it. So he did not want to refuse what she asked. 
MRK.6.27	Immediately the king sent a soldier to bring John’s head. The soldier went and cut off John’s head in the prison 
MRK.6.28	and brought it back on a platter. He gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. 
MRK.6.29	When John’s followers heard this, they came and got John’s body and put it in a tomb.
MRK.6.30	The apostles gathered around Jesus and told him about all the things they had done and taught. 
MRK.6.31	Crowds of people were coming and going so that Jesus and his followers did not even have time to eat. He said to them, 
MRK.6.32	So they went in a boat by themselves to a lonely place. 
MRK.6.33	But many people saw them leave and recognized them. So from all the towns they ran to the place where Jesus was going, and they got there before him. 
MRK.6.34	When he arrived, he saw a great crowd waiting. He felt sorry for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them many things.
MRK.6.35	When it was late in the day, his followers came to him and said, “No one lives in this place, and it is already very late. 
MRK.6.36	Send the people away so they can go to the countryside and towns around here to buy themselves something to eat.”
MRK.6.37	But Jesus answered, 
MRK.6.37	They said to him, “We would all have to work a month to earn enough money to buy that much bread!”
MRK.6.38	Jesus asked them, 
MRK.6.38	When they found out, they said, “Five loaves and two fish.”
MRK.6.39	Then Jesus told his followers to have the people sit in groups on the green grass. 
MRK.6.40	So they sat in groups of fifty or a hundred. 
MRK.6.41	Jesus took the five loaves and two fish and, looking up to heaven, he thanked God for the food. He divided the bread and gave it to his followers for them to give to the people. Then he divided the two fish among them all. 
MRK.6.42	All the people ate and were satisfied. 
MRK.6.43	The followers filled twelve baskets with the leftover pieces of bread and fish. 
MRK.6.44	There were five thousand men who ate.
MRK.6.45	Immediately Jesus told his followers to get into the boat and go ahead of him to Bethsaida across the lake. He stayed there to send the people home. 
MRK.6.46	After sending them away, he went into the hills to pray.
MRK.6.47	That night, the boat was in the middle of the lake, and Jesus was alone on the land. 
MRK.6.48	He saw his followers struggling hard to row the boat, because the wind was blowing against them. Between three and six o’clock in the morning, Jesus came to them, walking on the water, and he wanted to walk past the boat. 
MRK.6.49	But when they saw him walking on the water, they thought he was a ghost and cried out. 
MRK.6.50	They all saw him and were afraid. But quickly Jesus spoke to them and said, 
MRK.6.51	Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind became calm. The followers were greatly amazed. 
MRK.6.52	They did not understand about the miracle of the five loaves, because their minds were closed.
MRK.6.53	When they had crossed the lake, they came to shore at Gennesaret and tied the boat there. 
MRK.6.54	When they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized Jesus. 
MRK.6.55	They ran everywhere in that area and began to bring sick people on mats wherever they heard he was. 
MRK.6.56	And everywhere he went—into towns, cities, or countryside—the people brought the sick to the marketplaces. They begged him to let them touch just the edge of his coat, and all who touched it were healed.
MRK.7.1	When some Pharisees and some teachers of the law came from Jerusalem, they gathered around Jesus. 
MRK.7.2	They saw that some of Jesus’ followers ate food with hands that were not clean, that is, they hadn’t washed them. 
MRK.7.3	(The Pharisees and all the Jews never eat before washing their hands in the way required by their unwritten laws. 
MRK.7.4	And when they buy something in the market, they never eat it until they wash themselves in a special way. They also follow many other unwritten laws, such as the washing of cups, pitchers, and pots.)
MRK.7.5	The Pharisees and the teachers of the law said to Jesus, “Why don’t your followers obey the unwritten laws which have been handed down to us? Why do your followers eat their food with hands that are not clean?”
MRK.7.6	Jesus answered, 
MRK.7.9	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.7.14	After Jesus called the crowd to him again, he said, 
MRK.7.17	When Jesus left the people and went into the house, his followers asked him about this story. 
MRK.7.18	Jesus said, 
MRK.7.19	 (When Jesus said this, he meant that no longer was any food unclean for people to eat.)
MRK.7.20	And Jesus said, 
MRK.7.24	Jesus left that place and went to the area around Tyre. When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know he was there, but he could not stay hidden. 
MRK.7.25	A woman whose daughter had an evil spirit in her heard that he was there. So she quickly came to Jesus and fell at his feet. 
MRK.7.26	She was Greek, born in Phoenicia, in Syria. She begged Jesus to force the demon out of her daughter.
MRK.7.27	Jesus told the woman, 
MRK.7.28	But she answered, “Yes, Lord, but even the dogs under the table can eat the children’s crumbs.”
MRK.7.29	Then Jesus said, 
MRK.7.30	The woman went home and found her daughter lying in bed; the demon was gone.
MRK.7.31	Then Jesus left the area around Tyre and went through Sidon to Lake Galilee, to the area of the Ten Towns. 
MRK.7.32	While he was there, some people brought a man to him who was deaf and could not talk plainly. The people begged Jesus to put his hand on the man to heal him.
MRK.7.33	Jesus led the man away from the crowd, by himself. He put his fingers in the man’s ears and then spit and touched the man’s tongue. 
MRK.7.34	Looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to the man, 
MRK.7.35	Instantly the man was able to hear and to use his tongue so that he spoke clearly.
MRK.7.36	Jesus commanded the people not to tell anyone about what happened. But the more he commanded them, the more they told about it. 
MRK.7.37	They were completely amazed and said, “Jesus does everything well. He makes the deaf hear! And those who can’t talk he makes able to speak.”
MRK.8.1	Another time there was a great crowd with Jesus that had nothing to eat. So Jesus called his followers and said, 
MRK.8.4	Jesus’ followers answered, “How can we get enough bread to feed all these people? We are far away from any town.”
MRK.8.5	Jesus asked, 
MRK.8.5	They answered, “Seven.”
MRK.8.6	Jesus told the people to sit on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, gave thanks to God, and divided the bread. He gave the pieces to his followers to give to the people, and they did so. 
MRK.8.7	The followers also had a few small fish. After Jesus gave thanks for the fish, he told his followers to give them to the people also. 
MRK.8.8	All the people ate and were satisfied. Then his followers filled seven baskets with the leftover pieces of food. 
MRK.8.9	There were about four thousand people who ate. After they had eaten, Jesus sent them home. 
MRK.8.10	Then right away he got into a boat with his followers and went to the area of Dalmanutha.
MRK.8.11	The Pharisees came to Jesus and began to ask him questions. Hoping to trap him, they asked Jesus for a miracle from God. 
MRK.8.12	Jesus sighed deeply and said, 
MRK.8.13	Then Jesus left the Pharisees and went in the boat to the other side of the lake.
MRK.8.14	His followers had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat; they had forgotten to bring more. 
MRK.8.15	Jesus warned them, 
MRK.8.16	His followers discussed the meaning of this, saying, “He said this because we have no bread.”
MRK.8.17	Knowing what they were talking about, Jesus asked them, 
MRK.8.19	They answered, “Twelve.”
MRK.8.20	They answered, “Seven.”
MRK.8.21	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.8.22	Jesus and his followers came to Bethsaida. There some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch the man. 
MRK.8.23	So Jesus took the blind man’s hand and led him out of the village. Then he spit on the man’s eyes and put his hands on the man and asked, 
MRK.8.24	The man looked up and said, “Yes, I see people, but they look like trees walking around.”
MRK.8.25	Again Jesus put his hands on the man’s eyes. Then the man opened his eyes wide and they were healed, and he was able to see everything clearly. 
MRK.8.26	Jesus told him to go home, saying, 
MRK.8.27	Jesus and his followers went to the towns around Caesarea Philippi. While they were traveling, Jesus asked them, 
MRK.8.28	They answered, “Some say you are John the Baptist. Others say you are Elijah, and others say you are one of the prophets.”
MRK.8.29	Then Jesus asked, 
MRK.8.29	Peter answered, “You are the Christ.”
MRK.8.30	Jesus warned his followers not to tell anyone who he was.
MRK.8.31	Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and that he would be rejected by the Jewish elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of the law. He told them that the Son of Man must be killed and then rise from the dead after three days. 
MRK.8.32	Jesus told them plainly what would happen. Then Peter took Jesus aside and began to tell him not to talk like that. 
MRK.8.33	But Jesus turned and looked at his followers. Then he told Peter not to talk that way. He said, 
MRK.8.34	Then Jesus called the crowd to him, along with his followers. He said, 
MRK.9.1	Then Jesus said to the people, 
MRK.9.2	Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John up on a high mountain by themselves. While they watched, Jesus’ appearance was changed. 
MRK.9.3	His clothes became shining white, whiter than any person could make them. 
MRK.9.4	Then Elijah and Moses appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
MRK.9.5	Peter said to Jesus, “Teacher, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” 
MRK.9.6	Peter did not know what to say, because he and the others were so frightened.
MRK.9.7	Then a cloud came and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!”
MRK.9.8	Suddenly Peter, James, and John looked around, but they saw only Jesus there alone with them.
MRK.9.9	As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them not to tell anyone about what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
MRK.9.10	So the followers obeyed Jesus, but they discussed what he meant about rising from the dead.
MRK.9.11	Then they asked Jesus, “Why do the teachers of the law say that Elijah must come first?”
MRK.9.12	Jesus answered, 
MRK.9.14	When Jesus, Peter, James, and John came back to the other followers, they saw a great crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them. 
MRK.9.15	But as soon as the crowd saw Jesus, the people were surprised and ran to welcome him.
MRK.9.16	Jesus asked, 
MRK.9.17	A man answered, “Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has an evil spirit in him that stops him from talking. 
MRK.9.18	When the spirit attacks him, it throws him on the ground. Then my son foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes very stiff. I asked your followers to force the evil spirit out, but they couldn’t.”
MRK.9.19	Jesus answered, 
MRK.9.20	So the followers brought him to Jesus. As soon as the evil spirit saw Jesus, it made the boy lose control of himself, and he fell down and rolled on the ground, foaming at the mouth.
MRK.9.21	Jesus asked the boy’s father, 
MRK.9.21	The father answered, “Since he was very young. 
MRK.9.22	The spirit often throws him into a fire or into water to kill him. If you can do anything for him, please have pity on us and help us.”
MRK.9.23	Jesus said to the father, 
MRK.9.24	Immediately the father cried out, “I do believe! Help me to believe more!”
MRK.9.25	When Jesus saw that a crowd was quickly gathering, he ordered the evil spirit, saying, 
MRK.9.26	The evil spirit screamed and caused the boy to fall on the ground again. Then the spirit came out. The boy looked as if he were dead, and many people said, “He is dead!” 
MRK.9.27	But Jesus took hold of the boy’s hand and helped him to stand up.
MRK.9.28	When Jesus went into the house, his followers began asking him privately, “Why couldn’t we force that evil spirit out?”
MRK.9.29	Jesus answered, 
MRK.9.30	Then Jesus and his followers left that place and went through Galilee. He didn’t want anyone to know where he was, 
MRK.9.31	because he was teaching his followers. He said to them, 
MRK.9.32	But the followers did not understand what Jesus meant, and they were afraid to ask him.
MRK.9.33	Jesus and his followers went to Capernaum. When they went into a house there, he asked them, 
MRK.9.34	But the followers did not answer, because their argument on the road was about which one of them was the greatest.
MRK.9.35	Jesus sat down and called the twelve apostles to him. He said, 
MRK.9.36	Then Jesus took a small child and had him stand among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said, 
MRK.9.38	Then John said, “Teacher, we saw someone using your name to force demons out of a person. We told him to stop, because he does not belong to our group.”
MRK.9.39	But Jesus said, 
MRK.10.1	Then Jesus left that place and went into the area of Judea and across the Jordan River. Again, crowds came to him, and he taught them as he usually did.
MRK.10.2	Some Pharisees came to Jesus and tried to trick him. They asked, “Is it right for a man to divorce his wife?”
MRK.10.3	Jesus answered, 
MRK.10.4	They said, “Moses allowed a man to write out divorce papers and send her away.”
MRK.10.5	Jesus said, 
MRK.10.10	Later, in the house, his followers asked Jesus again about the question of divorce. 
MRK.10.11	He answered, 
MRK.10.13	Some people brought their little children to Jesus so he could touch them, but his followers told them to stop. 
MRK.10.14	When Jesus saw this, he was upset and said to them, 
MRK.10.16	Then Jesus took the children in his arms, put his hands on them, and blessed them.
MRK.10.17	As Jesus started to leave, a man ran to him and fell on his knees before Jesus. The man asked, “Good teacher, what must I do to have life forever?”
MRK.10.18	Jesus answered, 
MRK.10.20	The man said, “Teacher, I have obeyed all these things since I was a boy.”
MRK.10.21	Jesus, looking at the man, loved him and said, 
MRK.10.22	He was very sad to hear Jesus say this, and he left sorrowfully, because he was rich.
MRK.10.23	Then Jesus looked at his followers and said, 
MRK.10.24	The followers were amazed at what Jesus said. But he said again, 
MRK.10.26	The followers were even more surprised and said to each other, “Then who can be saved?”
MRK.10.27	Jesus looked at them and said, 
MRK.10.28	Peter said to Jesus, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”
MRK.10.29	Jesus said, 
MRK.10.32	As Jesus and the people with him were on the road to Jerusalem, he was leading the way. His followers were amazed, but others in the crowd who followed were afraid. Again Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and began to tell them what was about to happen in Jerusalem. 
MRK.10.33	He said, 
MRK.10.35	Then James and John, sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, we want to ask you to do something for us.”
MRK.10.36	Jesus asked, 
MRK.10.37	They answered, “Let one of us sit at your right side and one of us sit at your left side in your glory in your kingdom.”
MRK.10.38	Jesus said, 
MRK.10.39	They answered, “Yes, we can.”
MRK.10.39	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.10.41	When the other ten followers heard this, they began to be angry with James and John.
MRK.10.42	Jesus called them together and said, 
MRK.10.46	Then they came to the town of Jericho. As Jesus was leaving there with his followers and a great many people, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting by the road. 
MRK.10.47	When he heard that Jesus from Nazareth was walking by, he began to shout, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
MRK.10.48	Many people warned the blind man to be quiet, but he shouted even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
MRK.10.49	Jesus stopped and said, 
MRK.10.49	So they called the blind man, saying, “Cheer up! Get to your feet. Jesus is calling you.” 
MRK.10.50	The blind man jumped up, left his coat there, and went to Jesus.
MRK.10.51	Jesus asked him, 
MRK.10.51	The blind man answered, “Teacher, I want to see.”
MRK.10.52	Jesus said, 
MRK.11.1	As Jesus and his followers were coming closer to Jerusalem, they came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany near the Mount of Olives. From there Jesus sent two of his followers 
MRK.11.2	and said to them, 
MRK.11.4	The followers went into the town, found a colt tied in the street near the door of a house, and untied it. 
MRK.11.5	Some people were standing there and asked, “What are you doing? Why are you untying that colt?” 
MRK.11.6	The followers answered the way Jesus told them to answer, and the people let them take the colt.
MRK.11.7	They brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it, and Jesus sat on it. 
MRK.11.8	Many people spread their coats on the road. Others cut branches in the fields and spread them on the road. 
MRK.11.9	The people were walking ahead of Jesus and behind him, shouting,
MRK.11.9	“Praise God!
MRK.11.9	God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord! 
MRK.11.10	God bless the kingdom of our father David!
MRK.11.10	That kingdom is coming!
MRK.11.10	Praise to God in heaven!”
MRK.11.11	Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the Temple. After he had looked at everything, since it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve apostles.
MRK.11.12	The next day as Jesus was leaving Bethany, he became hungry. 
MRK.11.13	Seeing a fig tree in leaf from far away, he went to see if it had any figs on it. But he found no figs, only leaves, because it was not the right season for figs. 
MRK.11.14	So Jesus said to the tree, 
MRK.11.15	When Jesus returned to Jerusalem, he went into the Temple and began to throw out those who were buying and selling there. He turned over the tables of those who were exchanging different kinds of money, and he upset the benches of those who were selling doves. 
MRK.11.16	Jesus refused to allow anyone to carry goods through the Temple courts. 
MRK.11.17	Then he taught the people, saying, 
MRK.11.18	The leading priests and the teachers of the law heard all this and began trying to find a way to kill Jesus. They were afraid of him, because all the people were amazed at his teaching. 
MRK.11.19	That evening, Jesus and his followers left the city.
MRK.11.20	The next morning as Jesus was passing by with his followers, they saw the fig tree dry and dead, even to the roots. 
MRK.11.21	Peter remembered the tree and said to Jesus, “Teacher, look! The fig tree you cursed is dry and dead!”
MRK.11.22	Jesus answered, 
MRK.11.27	Jesus and his followers went again to Jerusalem. As Jesus was walking in the Temple, the leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the elders came to him. 
MRK.11.28	They said to him, “What authority do you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”
MRK.11.29	Jesus answered, 
MRK.11.31	They argued about Jesus’ question, saying, “If we answer, ‘John’s baptism was from God,’ Jesus will say, ‘Then why didn’t you believe him?’ 
MRK.11.32	But if we say, ‘It was from other people,’ the crowd will be against us.” (These leaders were afraid of the people, because all the people believed that John was a prophet.)
MRK.11.33	So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.”
MRK.11.33	Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.1	Jesus began to use stories to teach the people. He said, 
MRK.12.12	The Jewish leaders knew that the story was about them. So they wanted to find a way to arrest Jesus, but they were afraid of the people. So the leaders left him and went away.
MRK.12.13	Later, the Jewish leaders sent some Pharisees and Herodians to Jesus to trap him in saying something wrong. 
MRK.12.14	They came to him and said, “Teacher, we know that you are an honest man. You are not afraid of what other people think about you, because you pay no attention to who they are. And you teach the truth about God’s way. Tell us: Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? 
MRK.12.15	Should we pay them, or not?”
MRK.12.15	But knowing what these men were really trying to do, Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.16	They gave Jesus a coin, and he asked, 
MRK.12.16	They answered, “Caesar’s.”
MRK.12.17	Then Jesus said to them, 
MRK.12.18	Then some Sadducees came to Jesus and asked him a question. (Sadducees believed that people would not rise from the dead.) 
MRK.12.19	They said, “Teacher, Moses wrote that if a man’s brother dies, leaving a wife but no children, then that man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. 
MRK.12.20	Once there were seven brothers. The first brother married and died, leaving no children. 
MRK.12.21	So the second brother married the widow, but he also died and had no children. The same thing happened with the third brother. 
MRK.12.22	All seven brothers married her and died, and none of the brothers had any children. Finally the woman died too. 
MRK.12.23	Since all seven brothers had married her, when people rise from the dead, whose wife will she be?”
MRK.12.24	Jesus answered, 
MRK.12.28	One of the teachers of the law came and heard Jesus arguing with the Sadducees. Seeing that Jesus gave good answers to their questions, he asked Jesus, “Which of the commands is most important?”
MRK.12.29	Jesus answered, 
MRK.12.32	The man answered, “That was a good answer, Teacher. You were right when you said God is the only Lord and there is no other God besides him. 
MRK.12.33	One must love God with all his heart, all his mind, and all his strength. And one must love his neighbor as he loves himself. These commands are more important than all the animals and sacrifices we offer to God.”
MRK.12.34	When Jesus saw that the man answered him wisely, Jesus said to him, 
MRK.12.35	As Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he asked, 
MRK.12.37	 The large crowd listened to Jesus with pleasure.
MRK.12.38	Jesus continued teaching and said, 
MRK.12.41	Jesus sat near the Temple money box and watched the people put in their money. Many rich people gave large sums of money. 
MRK.12.42	Then a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which were only worth a few cents.
MRK.12.43	Calling his followers to him, Jesus said, 
MRK.13.1	As Jesus was leaving the Temple, one of his followers said to him, “Look, Teacher! How beautiful the buildings are! How big the stones are!”
MRK.13.2	Jesus said, 
MRK.13.3	Later, as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, opposite the Temple, he was alone with Peter, James, John, and Andrew. They asked Jesus, 
MRK.13.4	“Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are going to happen?”
MRK.13.5	Jesus began to answer them, 
MRK.13.14	(You who read this should understand what it means.)
MRK.14.1	It was now only two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. The leading priests and teachers of the law were trying to find a trick to arrest Jesus and kill him. 
MRK.14.2	But they said, “We must not do it during the feast, because the people might cause a riot.”
MRK.14.3	Jesus was in Bethany at the house of Simon, who had a skin disease. While Jesus was eating there, a woman approached him with an alabaster jar filled with very expensive perfume, made of pure nard. She opened the jar and poured the perfume on Jesus’ head.
MRK.14.4	Some who were there became upset and said to each other, “Why waste that perfume? 
MRK.14.5	It was worth a full year’s work. It could have been sold and the money given to the poor.” And they got very angry with the woman.
MRK.14.6	Jesus said, 
MRK.14.10	One of the twelve apostles, Judas Iscariot, went to talk to the leading priests to offer to hand Jesus over to them. 
MRK.14.11	These priests were pleased about this and promised to pay Judas money. So he watched for the best time to turn Jesus in.
MRK.14.12	It was now the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread when the Passover lamb was sacrificed. Jesus’ followers said to him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare for you to eat the Passover meal?”
MRK.14.13	Jesus sent two of his followers and said to them, 
MRK.14.16	So the followers left and went into the city. Everything happened as Jesus had said, so they prepared the Passover meal.
MRK.14.17	In the evening, Jesus went to that house with the twelve. 
MRK.14.18	While they were all eating, Jesus said, 
MRK.14.19	The followers were very sad to hear this. Each one began to say to Jesus, “I am not the one, am I?”
MRK.14.20	Jesus answered, 
MRK.14.22	While they were eating, Jesus took some bread and thanked God for it and broke it. Then he gave it to his followers and said, 
MRK.14.23	Then Jesus took a cup and thanked God for it and gave it to the followers, and they all drank from the cup.
MRK.14.24	Then Jesus said, 
MRK.14.26	After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.
MRK.14.27	Then Jesus told the followers, 
MRK.14.29	Peter said, “Everyone else may stumble in their faith, but I will not.”
MRK.14.30	Jesus answered, 
MRK.14.31	But Peter insisted, “I will never say that I don’t know you! I will even die with you!” And all the other followers said the same thing.
MRK.14.32	Jesus and his followers went to a place called Gethsemane. He said to them, 
MRK.14.33	Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him, and he began to be very sad and troubled. 
MRK.14.34	He said to them, 
MRK.14.35	After walking a little farther away from them, Jesus fell to the ground and prayed that, if possible, he would not have this time of suffering. 
MRK.14.36	He prayed, 
MRK.14.37	Then Jesus went back to his followers and found them asleep. He said to Peter, 
MRK.14.39	Again Jesus went away and prayed the same thing. 
MRK.14.40	Then he went back to his followers, and again he found them asleep, because their eyes were very heavy. And they did not know what to say to him.
MRK.14.41	After Jesus prayed a third time, he went back to his followers and said to them, 
MRK.14.43	At once, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve apostles, came up. With him were many people carrying swords and clubs who had been sent from the leading priests, the teachers of the law, and the Jewish elders.
MRK.14.44	Judas had planned a signal for them, saying, “The man I kiss is Jesus. Arrest him and guard him while you lead him away.” 
MRK.14.45	So Judas went straight to Jesus and said, “Teacher!” and kissed him. 
MRK.14.46	Then the people grabbed Jesus and arrested him. 
MRK.14.47	One of his followers standing nearby pulled out his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear.
MRK.14.48	Then Jesus said, 
MRK.14.50	Then all of Jesus’ followers left him and ran away.
MRK.14.51	A young man, wearing only a linen cloth, was following Jesus, and the people also grabbed him. 
MRK.14.52	But the cloth he was wearing came off, and he ran away naked.
MRK.14.53	The people who arrested Jesus led him to the house of the high priest, where all the leading priests, the elders, and the teachers of the law were gathered. 
MRK.14.54	Peter followed far behind and entered the courtyard of the high priest’s house. There he sat with the guards, warming himself by the fire.
MRK.14.55	The leading priests and the whole Jewish council tried to find something that Jesus had done wrong so they could kill him. But the council could find no proof of anything. 
MRK.14.56	Many people came and told false things about him, but all said different things—none of them agreed.
MRK.14.57	Then some people stood up and lied about Jesus, saying, 
MRK.14.58	“We heard this man say, ‘I will destroy this Temple that people made. And three days later, I will build another Temple not made by people.’ ” 
MRK.14.59	But even the things these people said did not agree.
MRK.14.60	Then the high priest stood before them and asked Jesus, “Aren’t you going to answer? Don’t you have something to say about their charges against you?” 
MRK.14.61	But Jesus said nothing; he did not answer.
MRK.14.61	The high priest asked Jesus another question: “Are you the Christ, the Son of the blessed God?”
MRK.14.62	Jesus answered, 
MRK.14.63	When the high priest heard this, he tore his clothes and said, “We don’t need any more witnesses! 
MRK.14.64	You all heard him say these things against God. What do you think?”
MRK.14.64	They all said that Jesus was guilty and should die. 
MRK.14.65	Some of the people there began to spit at Jesus. They blindfolded him and beat him with their fists and said, “Prove you are a prophet!” Then the guards led Jesus away and beat him.
MRK.14.66	While Peter was in the courtyard, a servant girl of the high priest came there. 
MRK.14.67	She saw Peter warming himself at the fire and looked closely at him.
MRK.14.67	Then she said, “You also were with Jesus, that man from Nazareth.”
MRK.14.68	But Peter said that he was never with Jesus. He said, “I don’t know or understand what you are talking about.” Then Peter left and went toward the entrance of the courtyard. And the rooster crowed.
MRK.14.69	The servant girl saw Peter there, and again she said to the people who were standing nearby, “This man is one of those who followed Jesus.” 
MRK.14.70	Again Peter said that it was not true.
MRK.14.70	A short time later, some people were standing near Peter saying, “Surely you are one of those who followed Jesus, because you are from Galilee, too.”
MRK.14.71	Then Peter began to place a curse on himself and swear, “I don’t know this man you’re talking about!”
MRK.14.72	At once, the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had told him: 
MRK.15.1	Very early in the morning, the leading priests, the elders, the teachers of the law, and all the Jewish council decided what to do with Jesus. They tied him, led him away, and turned him over to Pilate, the governor.
MRK.15.2	Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
MRK.15.2	Jesus answered, 
MRK.15.3	The leading priests accused Jesus of many things. 
MRK.15.4	So Pilate asked Jesus another question, “You can see that they are accusing you of many things. Aren’t you going to answer?”
MRK.15.5	But Jesus still said nothing, so Pilate was very surprised.
MRK.15.6	Every year at the time of the Passover the governor would free one prisoner whom the people chose. 
MRK.15.7	At that time, there was a man named Barabbas in prison who was a rebel and had committed murder during a riot. 
MRK.15.8	The crowd came to Pilate and began to ask him to free a prisoner as he always did.
MRK.15.9	So Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to free the king of the Jews?” 
MRK.15.10	Pilate knew that the leading priests had turned Jesus in to him because they were jealous. 
MRK.15.11	But the leading priests had persuaded the people to ask Pilate to free Barabbas, not Jesus.
MRK.15.12	Then Pilate asked the crowd again, “So what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews?”
MRK.15.13	They shouted, “Crucify him!”
MRK.15.14	Pilate asked, “Why? What wrong has he done?”
MRK.15.14	But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”
MRK.15.15	Pilate wanted to please the crowd, so he freed Barabbas for them. After having Jesus beaten with whips, he handed Jesus over to the soldiers to be crucified.
MRK.15.16	The soldiers took Jesus into the governor’s palace (called the Praetorium) and called all the other soldiers together. 
MRK.15.17	They put a purple robe on Jesus and used thorny branches to make a crown for his head. 
MRK.15.18	They began to call out to him, “Hail, King of the Jews!” 
MRK.15.19	The soldiers beat Jesus on the head many times with a stick. They spit on him and made fun of him by bowing on their knees and worshiping him. 
MRK.15.20	After they finished, the soldiers took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him out of the palace to be crucified.
MRK.15.21	A man named Simon from Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, was coming from the fields to the city. The soldiers forced Simon to carry the cross for Jesus. 
MRK.15.22	They led Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means the Place of the Skull. 
MRK.15.23	The soldiers tried to give Jesus wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he refused. 
MRK.15.24	The soldiers crucified Jesus and divided his clothes among themselves, throwing lots to decide what each soldier would get.
MRK.15.25	It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified Jesus. 
MRK.15.26	There was a sign with this charge against Jesus written on it: 
MRK.15.27	They also put two robbers on crosses beside Jesus, one on the right, and the other on the left. [
MRK.15.28	And the Scripture came true that says, “They put him with criminals.”] 
MRK.15.29	People walked by and insulted Jesus and shook their heads, saying, “You said you could destroy the Temple and build it again in three days. 
MRK.15.30	So save yourself! Come down from that cross!”
MRK.15.31	The leading priests and the teachers of the law were also making fun of Jesus. They said to each other, “He saved other people, but he can’t save himself. 
MRK.15.32	If he is really the Christ, the king of Israel, let him come down now from the cross. When we see this, we will believe in him.” The robbers who were being crucified beside Jesus also insulted him.
MRK.15.33	At noon the whole country became dark, and the darkness lasted for three hours. 
MRK.15.34	At three o’clock Jesus cried in a loud voice, 
MRK.15.35	When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “Listen! He is calling Elijah.”
MRK.15.36	Someone there ran and got a sponge, filled it with vinegar, tied it to a stick, and gave it to Jesus to drink. He said, “We want to see if Elijah will come to take him down from the cross.”
MRK.15.37	Then Jesus cried in a loud voice and died.
MRK.15.38	The curtain in the Temple was torn into two pieces, from the top to the bottom. 
MRK.15.39	When the army officer who was standing in front of the cross saw what happened when Jesus died, he said, “This man really was the Son of God!”
MRK.15.40	Some women were standing at a distance from the cross, watching; among them were Mary Magdalene, Salome, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph. (James was her youngest son.) 
MRK.15.41	These women had followed Jesus in Galilee and helped him. Many other women were also there who had come with Jesus to Jerusalem.
MRK.15.42	This was Preparation Day. (That means the day before the Sabbath day.) That evening, 
MRK.15.43	Joseph from Arimathea was brave enough to go to Pilate and ask for Jesus’ body. Joseph, an important member of the Jewish council, was one of the people who was waiting for the kingdom of God to come. 
MRK.15.44	Pilate was amazed that Jesus would have already died, so he called the army officer who had guarded Jesus and asked him if Jesus had already died. 
MRK.15.45	The officer told Pilate that he was dead, so Pilate told Joseph he could have the body. 
MRK.15.46	Joseph bought some linen cloth, took the body down from the cross, and wrapped it in the linen. He put the body in a tomb that was cut out of a wall of rock. Then he rolled a very large stone to block the entrance of the tomb. 
MRK.15.47	And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw the place where Jesus was laid.
MRK.16.1	The day after the Sabbath day, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought some sweet-smelling spices to put on Jesus’ body. 
MRK.16.2	Very early on that day, the first day of the week, soon after sunrise, the women were on their way to the tomb. 
MRK.16.3	They said to each other, “Who will roll away for us the stone that covers the entrance of the tomb?”
MRK.16.4	Then the women looked and saw that the stone had already been rolled away, even though it was very large. 
MRK.16.5	The women entered the tomb and saw a young man wearing a white robe and sitting on the right side, and they were afraid.
MRK.16.6	But the man said, “Don’t be afraid. You are looking for Jesus from Nazareth, who has been crucified. He has risen from the dead; he is not here. Look, here is the place they laid him. 
MRK.16.7	Now go and tell his followers and Peter, ‘Jesus is going into Galilee ahead of you, and you will see him there as he told you before.’ ”
MRK.16.8	The women were confused and shaking with fear, so they left the tomb and ran away. They did not tell anyone about what happened, because they were afraid.
MRK.16.8	______________________________
MRK.16.8	Verses 9–20 are not included in some of the earliest surviving Greek copies of Mark.
MRK.16.8	[
MRK.16.9	After Jesus rose from the dead early on the first day of the week, he showed himself first to Mary Magdalene. One time in the past, he had forced seven demons out of her. 
MRK.16.10	After Mary saw Jesus, she went and told his followers, who were very sad and were crying. 
MRK.16.11	But Mary told them that Jesus was alive. She said that she had seen him, but the followers did not believe her.
MRK.16.12	Later, Jesus showed himself to two of his followers while they were walking in the country, but he did not look the same as before. 
MRK.16.13	These followers went back to the others and told them what had happened, but again, the followers did not believe them.
MRK.16.14	Later Jesus showed himself to the eleven apostles while they were eating, and he criticized them because they had no faith. They were stubborn and refused to believe those who had seen him after he had risen from the dead.
MRK.16.15	Jesus said to his followers, 
MRK.16.19	After the Lord Jesus said these things to his followers, he was carried up into heaven, and he sat at the right side of God. 
MRK.16.20	The followers went everywhere in the world and told the Good News to people, and the Lord helped them. The Lord proved that the Good News they told was true by giving them power to work miracles.]
LUK.1.1	Many have tried to report on the things that happened among us. 
LUK.1.2	They have written the same things that we learned from others—the people who saw those things from the beginning and served God by telling people his message. 
LUK.1.3	Since I myself have studied everything carefully from the beginning, most excellent Theophilus, it seemed good for me to write it out for you. I arranged it in order, 
LUK.1.4	to help you know that what you have been taught is true.
LUK.1.5	During the time Herod ruled Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to Abijah’s group. Zechariah’s wife, Elizabeth, came from the family of Aaron. 
LUK.1.6	Zechariah and Elizabeth truly did what God said was good. They did everything the Lord commanded and were without fault in keeping his law. 
LUK.1.7	But they had no children, because Elizabeth could not have a baby, and both of them were very old.
LUK.1.8	One day Zechariah was serving as a priest before God, because his group was on duty. 
LUK.1.9	According to the custom of the priests, he was chosen by lot to go into the Temple of the Lord and burn incense. 
LUK.1.10	There were a great many people outside praying at the time the incense was offered. 
LUK.1.11	Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah, standing on the right side of the incense table. 
LUK.1.12	When he saw the angel, Zechariah was startled and frightened. 
LUK.1.13	But the angel said to him, “Zechariah, don’t be afraid. God has heard your prayer. Your wife, Elizabeth, will give birth to a son, and you will name him John. 
LUK.1.14	He will bring you joy and gladness, and many people will be happy because of his birth. 
LUK.1.15	John will be a great man for the Lord. He will never drink wine or beer, and even from birth, he will be filled with the Holy Spirit. 
LUK.1.16	He will help many people of Israel return to the Lord their God. 
LUK.1.17	He will go before the Lord in spirit and power like Elijah. He will make peace between parents and their children and will bring those who are not obeying God back to the right way of thinking, to make a people ready for the coming of the Lord.”
LUK.1.18	Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I know that what you say is true? I am an old man, and my wife is old, too.”
LUK.1.19	The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel. I stand before God, who sent me to talk to you and to tell you this good news. 
LUK.1.20	Now, listen! You will not be able to speak until the day these things happen, because you did not believe what I told you. But they will really happen.”
LUK.1.21	Outside, the people were still waiting for Zechariah and were surprised that he was staying so long in the Temple. 
LUK.1.22	When Zechariah came outside, he could not speak to them, and they knew he had seen a vision in the Temple. He could only make signs to them and remained unable to speak. 
LUK.1.23	When his time of service at the Temple was finished, he went home.
LUK.1.24	Later, Zechariah’s wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and did not go out of her house for five months. Elizabeth said, 
LUK.1.25	“Look what the Lord has done for me! My people were ashamed of me, but now the Lord has taken away that shame.”
LUK.1.26	During Elizabeth’s sixth month of pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, 
LUK.1.27	to a virgin. She was engaged to marry a man named Joseph from the family of David. Her name was Mary. 
LUK.1.28	The angel came to her and said, “Greetings! The Lord has blessed you and is with you.”
LUK.1.29	But Mary was very startled by what the angel said and wondered what this greeting might mean.
LUK.1.30	The angel said to her, “Don’t be afraid, Mary; God has shown you his grace. 
LUK.1.31	Listen! You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus. 
LUK.1.32	He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of King David, his ancestor. 
LUK.1.33	He will rule over the people of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.”
LUK.1.34	Mary said to the angel, “How will this happen since I am a virgin?”
LUK.1.35	The angel said to Mary, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will cover you. For this reason the baby will be holy and will be called the Son of God. 
LUK.1.36	Now Elizabeth, your relative, is also pregnant with a son though she is very old. Everyone thought she could not have a baby, but she has been pregnant for six months. 
LUK.1.37	God can do anything!”
LUK.1.38	Mary said, “I am the servant of the Lord. Let this happen to me as you say!” Then the angel went away.
LUK.1.39	Mary got up and went quickly to a town in the hills of Judea. 
LUK.1.40	She came to Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth. 
LUK.1.41	When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the unborn baby inside her jumped, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. 
LUK.1.42	She cried out in a loud voice, “God has blessed you more than any other woman, and he has blessed the baby to which you will give birth. 
LUK.1.43	Why has this good thing happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? 
LUK.1.44	When I heard your voice, the baby inside me jumped with joy. 
LUK.1.45	You are blessed because you believed that what the Lord said to you would really happen.”
LUK.1.46	Then Mary said,
LUK.1.46	“My soul praises the Lord;
LUK.1.47	my heart rejoices in God my Savior,
LUK.1.48	because he has shown his concern for his humble servant girl.
LUK.1.48	From now on, all people will say that I am blessed,
LUK.1.49	because the Powerful One has done great things for me.
LUK.1.49	His name is holy.
LUK.1.50	God will show his mercy forever and ever
LUK.1.50	to those who worship and serve him.
LUK.1.51	He has done mighty deeds by his power.
LUK.1.51	He has scattered the people who are proud
LUK.1.51	and think great things about themselves.
LUK.1.52	He has brought down rulers from their thrones
LUK.1.52	and raised up the humble.
LUK.1.53	He has filled the hungry with good things
LUK.1.53	and sent the rich away with nothing.
LUK.1.54	He has helped his servant, the people of Israel,
LUK.1.54	remembering to show them mercy
LUK.1.55	as he promised to our ancestors,
LUK.1.55	to Abraham and to his children forever.”
LUK.1.56	Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months and then returned home.
LUK.1.57	When it was time for Elizabeth to give birth, she had a boy. 
LUK.1.58	Her neighbors and relatives heard how good the Lord was to her, and they rejoiced with her.
LUK.1.59	When the baby was eight days old, they came to circumcise him. They wanted to name him Zechariah because this was his father’s name, 
LUK.1.60	but his mother said, “No! He will be named John.”
LUK.1.61	The people said to Elizabeth, “But no one in your family has this name.” 
LUK.1.62	Then they made signs to his father to find out what he would like to name him.
LUK.1.63	Zechariah asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John,” and everyone was surprised. 
LUK.1.64	Immediately Zechariah could talk again, and he began praising God. 
LUK.1.65	All their neighbors became alarmed, and in all the mountains of Judea people continued talking about all these things. 
LUK.1.66	The people who heard about them wondered, saying, “What will this child be?” because the Lord was with him.
LUK.1.67	Then Zechariah, John’s father, was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied:
LUK.1.68	“Let us praise the Lord, the God of Israel,
LUK.1.68	because he has come to help his people and has given them freedom.
LUK.1.69	He has given us a powerful Savior
LUK.1.69	from the family of God’s servant David.
LUK.1.70	He said that he would do this
LUK.1.70	through his holy prophets who lived long ago:
LUK.1.71	He promised he would save us from our enemies
LUK.1.71	and from the power of all those who hate us.
LUK.1.72	He said he would give mercy to our ancestors
LUK.1.72	and that he would remember his holy promise.
LUK.1.73	God promised Abraham, our father,
LUK.1.74	that he would save us from the power of our enemies
LUK.1.74	so we could serve him without fear,
LUK.1.75	being holy and good before God as long as we live.
LUK.1.76	“Now you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High God.
LUK.1.76	You will go before the Lord to prepare his way.
LUK.1.77	You will make his people know that they will be saved
LUK.1.77	by having their sins forgiven.
LUK.1.78	With the loving mercy of our God,
LUK.1.78	a new day from heaven will dawn upon us.
LUK.1.79	It will shine on those who live in darkness,
LUK.1.79	in the shadow of death.
LUK.1.79	It will guide us into the path of peace.”
LUK.1.80	And so the child grew up and became strong in spirit. John lived in the desert until the time when he came out to preach to Israel.
LUK.2.1	At that time, Augustus Caesar sent an order that all people in the countries under Roman rule must list their names in a register. 
LUK.2.2	This was the first registration; it was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. 
LUK.2.3	And all went to their own towns to be registered.
LUK.2.4	So Joseph left Nazareth, a town in Galilee, and went to the town of Bethlehem in Judea, known as the town of David. Joseph went there because he was from the family of David. 
LUK.2.5	Joseph registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was now pregnant. 
LUK.2.6	While they were in Bethlehem, the time came for Mary to have the baby, 
LUK.2.7	and she gave birth to her first son. Because there were no rooms left in the inn, she wrapped the baby with pieces of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough.
LUK.2.8	That night, some shepherds were in the fields nearby watching their sheep. 
LUK.2.9	Then an angel of the Lord stood before them. The glory of the Lord was shining around them, and they became very frightened. 
LUK.2.10	The angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I am bringing you good news that will be a great joy to all the people. 
LUK.2.11	Today your Savior was born in the town of David. He is Christ, the Lord. 
LUK.2.12	This is how you will know him: You will find a baby wrapped in pieces of cloth and lying in a feeding box.”
LUK.2.13	Then a very large group of angels from heaven joined the first angel, praising God and saying:
LUK.2.14	“Give glory to God in heaven,
LUK.2.14	and on earth let there be peace among the people who please God.”
LUK.2.15	When the angels left them and went back to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, “Let’s go to Bethlehem. Let’s see this thing that has happened which the Lord has told us about.”
LUK.2.16	So the shepherds went quickly and found Mary and Joseph and the baby, who was lying in a feeding trough. 
LUK.2.17	When they had seen him, they told what the angels had said about this child. 
LUK.2.18	Everyone was amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 
LUK.2.19	But Mary treasured these things and continued to think about them. 
LUK.2.20	Then the shepherds went back to their sheep, praising God and thanking him for everything they had seen and heard. It had been just as the angel had told them.
LUK.2.21	When the baby was eight days old, he was circumcised and was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before the baby began to grow inside Mary.
LUK.2.22	When the time came for Mary and Joseph to do what the law of Moses taught about being made pure, they took Jesus to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord. 
LUK.2.23	(It is written in the law of the Lord: “Every firstborn male shall be given to the Lord.”) 
LUK.2.24	Mary and Joseph also went to offer a sacrifice, as the law of the Lord says: “You must sacrifice two doves or two young pigeons.”
LUK.2.25	In Jerusalem lived a man named Simeon who was a good man and godly. He was waiting for the time when God would take away Israel’s sorrow, and the Holy Spirit was in him. 
LUK.2.26	Simeon had been told by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he saw the Christ promised by the Lord. 
LUK.2.27	The Spirit led Simeon to the Temple. When Mary and Joseph brought the baby Jesus to the Temple to do what the law said they must do, 
LUK.2.28	Simeon took the baby in his arms and thanked God:
LUK.2.29	“Now, Lord, you can let me, your servant,
LUK.2.29	die in peace as you said.
LUK.2.30	With my own eyes I have seen your salvation,
LUK.2.31	which you prepared before all people.
LUK.2.32	It is a light for the non-Jewish people to see
LUK.2.32	and an honor for your people, the Israelites.”
LUK.2.33	Jesus’ father and mother were amazed at what Simeon had said about him. 
LUK.2.34	Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, “God has chosen this child to cause the fall and rise of many in Israel. He will be a sign from God that many people will not accept 
LUK.2.35	so that the thoughts of many will be made known. And the things that will happen will make your heart sad, too.”
LUK.2.36	There was a prophetess, Anna, from the family of Phanuel in the tribe of Asher. Anna was very old. She had once been married for seven years. 
LUK.2.37	Then her husband died, and she was a widow for eighty-four years. Anna never left the Temple but worshiped God, going without food and praying day and night. 
LUK.2.38	Standing there at that time, she thanked God and spoke about Jesus to all who were waiting for God to free Jerusalem.
LUK.2.39	When Joseph and Mary had done everything the law of the Lord commanded, they went home to Nazareth, their own town in Galilee. 
LUK.2.40	The little child grew and became strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God’s goodness was upon him.
LUK.2.41	Every year Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast. 
LUK.2.42	When he was twelve years old, they went to the feast as they always did. 
LUK.2.43	After the feast days were over, they started home. The boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it. 
LUK.2.44	Thinking that Jesus was with them in the group, they traveled for a whole day. Then they began to look for him among their family and friends. 
LUK.2.45	When they did not find him, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him there. 
LUK.2.46	After three days they found Jesus sitting in the Temple with the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. 
LUK.2.47	All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and answers. 
LUK.2.48	When Jesus’ parents saw him, they were astonished. His mother said to him, “Son, why did you do this to us? Your father and I were very worried about you and have been looking for you.”
LUK.2.49	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.2.50	But they did not understand the meaning of what he said.
LUK.2.51	Jesus went with them to Nazareth and was obedient to them. But his mother kept in her mind all that had happened. 
LUK.2.52	Jesus became wiser and grew physically. People liked him, and he pleased God.
LUK.3.1	It was the fifteenth year of the rule of Tiberius Caesar. These men were under Caesar: Pontius Pilate, the ruler of Judea; Herod, the ruler of Galilee; Philip, Herod’s brother, the ruler of Iturea and Traconitis; and Lysanias, the ruler of Abilene. 
LUK.3.2	Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. At this time, the word of God came to John son of Zechariah in the desert. 
LUK.3.3	He went all over the area around the Jordan River preaching a baptism of changed hearts and lives for the forgiveness of sins. 
LUK.3.4	As it is written in the book of Isaiah the prophet:
LUK.3.4	“This is a voice of one
LUK.3.4	who calls out in the desert:
LUK.3.4	‘Prepare the way for the Lord.
LUK.3.4	Make the road straight for him.
LUK.3.5	Every valley should be filled in,
LUK.3.5	and every mountain and hill should be made flat.
LUK.3.5	Roads with turns should be made straight,
LUK.3.5	and rough roads should be made smooth.
LUK.3.6	And all people will know about the salvation of God!’ ” 
LUK.3.7	To the crowds of people who came to be baptized by John, he said, “You are all snakes! Who warned you to run away from God’s coming punishment? 
LUK.3.8	Do the things that show you really have changed your hearts and lives. Don’t begin to say to yourselves, ‘Abraham is our father.’ I tell you that God could make children for Abraham from these rocks. 
LUK.3.9	The ax is now ready to cut down the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.”
LUK.3.10	The people asked John, “Then what should we do?”
LUK.3.11	John answered, “If you have two shirts, share with the person who does not have one. If you have food, share that also.”
LUK.3.12	Even tax collectors came to John to be baptized. They said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?”
LUK.3.13	John said to them, “Don’t take more taxes from people than you have been ordered to take.”
LUK.3.14	The soldiers asked John, “What about us? What should we do?”
LUK.3.14	John said to them, “Don’t force people to give you money, and don’t lie about them. Be satisfied with the pay you get.”
LUK.3.15	Since the people were hoping for the Christ to come, they wondered if John might be the one.
LUK.3.16	John answered everyone, “I baptize you with water, but there is one coming who is greater than I am. I am not good enough to untie his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. 
LUK.3.17	He will come ready to clean the grain, separating the good grain from the chaff. He will put the good part of the grain into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with a fire that cannot be put out.” 
LUK.3.18	And John continued to preach the Good News, saying many other things to encourage the people.
LUK.3.19	But John spoke against Herod, the governor, because of his sin with Herodias, the wife of Herod’s brother, and because of the many other evil things Herod did. 
LUK.3.20	So Herod did something even worse: He put John in prison.
LUK.3.21	When all the people were being baptized by John, Jesus also was baptized. While Jesus was praying, heaven opened 
LUK.3.22	and the Holy Spirit came down on him in the form of a dove. Then a voice came from heaven, saying, “You are my Son, whom I love, and I am very pleased with you.”

LUK.4.1	Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River. The Spirit led Jesus into the desert 
LUK.4.2	where the devil tempted Jesus for forty days. Jesus ate nothing during that time, and when those days were ended, he was very hungry.
LUK.4.3	The devil said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, tell this rock to become bread.”
LUK.4.4	Jesus answered, 
LUK.4.5	Then the devil took Jesus and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant. 
LUK.4.6	The devil said to Jesus, “I will give you all these kingdoms and all their power and glory. It has all been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I wish. 
LUK.4.7	If you worship me, then it will all be yours.”
LUK.4.8	Jesus answered, 
LUK.4.9	Then the devil led Jesus to Jerusalem and put him on a high place of the Temple. He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, jump down. 
LUK.4.10	It is written in the Scriptures:
LUK.4.10	‘He has put his angels in charge of you
LUK.4.10	to watch over you.’
LUK.4.11	It is also written:
LUK.4.11	‘They will catch you in their hands
LUK.4.11	so that you will not hit your foot on a rock.’ ”
LUK.4.12	Jesus answered, 
LUK.4.13	After the devil had tempted Jesus in every way, he left him to wait until a better time.
LUK.4.14	Jesus returned to Galilee in the power of the Holy Spirit, and stories about him spread all through the area. 
LUK.4.15	He began to teach in their synagogues, and everyone praised him.
LUK.4.16	Jesus traveled to Nazareth, where he had grown up. On the Sabbath day he went to the synagogue, as he always did, and stood up to read. 
LUK.4.17	The book of Isaiah the prophet was given to him. He opened the book and found the place where this is written:
LUK.4.20	Jesus closed the book, gave it back to the assistant, and sat down. Everyone in the synagogue was watching Jesus closely. 
LUK.4.21	He began to say to them, 
LUK.4.22	All the people spoke well of Jesus and were amazed at the words of grace he spoke. They asked, “Isn’t this Joseph’s son?”
LUK.4.23	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.4.24	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.4.28	When all the people in the synagogue heard these things, they became very angry. 
LUK.4.29	They got up, forced Jesus out of town, and took him to the edge of the cliff on which the town was built. They planned to throw him off the edge, 
LUK.4.30	but Jesus walked through the crowd and went on his way.
LUK.4.31	Jesus went to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and on the Sabbath day, he taught the people. 
LUK.4.32	They were amazed at his teaching, because he spoke with authority. 
LUK.4.33	In the synagogue a man who had within him an evil spirit shouted in a loud voice, 
LUK.4.34	“Jesus of Nazareth! What do you want with us? Did you come to destroy us? I know who you are—God’s Holy One!”
LUK.4.35	Jesus commanded the evil spirit, 
LUK.4.36	The people were amazed and said to each other, “What does this mean? With authority and power he commands evil spirits, and they come out.” 
LUK.4.37	And so the news about Jesus spread to every place in the whole area.
LUK.4.38	Jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon. Simon’s mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. 
LUK.4.39	He came to her side and commanded the fever to leave. It left her, and immediately she got up and began serving them.
LUK.4.40	When the sun went down, the people brought those who were sick to Jesus. Putting his hands on each sick person, he healed every one of them. 
LUK.4.41	Demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God.” But Jesus commanded the demons and would not allow them to speak, because they knew Jesus was the Christ.
LUK.4.42	At daybreak, Jesus went to a lonely place, but the people looked for him. When they found him, they tried to keep him from leaving. 
LUK.4.43	But Jesus said to them, 
LUK.4.44	Then he kept on preaching in the synagogues of Judea.
LUK.5.1	One day while Jesus was standing beside Lake Galilee, many people were pressing all around him to hear the word of God. 
LUK.5.2	Jesus saw two boats at the shore of the lake. The fishermen had left them and were washing their nets. 
LUK.5.3	Jesus got into one of the boats, the one that belonged to Simon, and asked him to push off a little from the land. Then Jesus sat down and continued to teach the people from the boat.
LUK.5.4	When Jesus had finished speaking, he said to Simon, 
LUK.5.5	Simon answered, “Master, we worked hard all night trying to catch fish, and we caught nothing. But you say to put the nets in the water, so I will.” 
LUK.5.6	When the fishermen did as Jesus told them, they caught so many fish that the nets began to break. 
LUK.5.7	They called to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats so full that they were almost sinking.
LUK.5.8	When Simon Peter saw what had happened, he bowed down before Jesus and said, “Go away from me, Lord. I am a sinful man!” 
LUK.5.9	He and the other fishermen were amazed at the many fish they caught, as were 
LUK.5.10	James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon’s partners.
LUK.5.10	Jesus said to Simon, 
LUK.5.11	When the men brought their boats to the shore, they left everything and followed Jesus.
LUK.5.12	When Jesus was in one of the towns, there was a man covered with a skin disease. When he saw Jesus, he bowed before him and begged him, “Lord, you can heal me if you will.”
LUK.5.13	Jesus reached out his hand and touched the man and said, 
LUK.5.14	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.5.15	But the news about Jesus spread even more. Many people came to hear Jesus and to be healed of their sicknesses, 
LUK.5.16	but Jesus often slipped away to be alone so he could pray.
LUK.5.17	One day as Jesus was teaching the people, the Pharisees and teachers of the law from every town in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem were there. The Lord was giving Jesus the power to heal people. 
LUK.5.18	Just then, some men were carrying on a mat a man who was paralyzed. They tried to bring him in and put him down before Jesus. 
LUK.5.19	But because there were so many people there, they could not find a way in. So they went up on the roof and lowered the man on his mat through the ceiling into the middle of the crowd right before Jesus. 
LUK.5.20	Seeing their faith, Jesus said, 
LUK.5.21	The Jewish teachers of the law and the Pharisees thought to themselves, “Who is this man who is speaking as if he were God? Only God can forgive sins.”
LUK.5.22	But Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, 
LUK.5.24	 So Jesus said to the paralyzed man, 
LUK.5.25	At once the man stood up before them, picked up his mat, and went home, praising God. 
LUK.5.26	All the people were fully amazed and began to praise God. They were filled with much respect and said, “Today we have seen amazing things!”
LUK.5.27	After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax collector’s booth. Jesus said to him, 
LUK.5.28	So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.
LUK.5.29	Then Levi gave a big dinner for Jesus at his house. Many tax collectors and other people were eating there, too. 
LUK.5.30	But the Pharisees and the men who taught the law for the Pharisees began to complain to Jesus’ followers, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?”
LUK.5.31	Jesus answered them, 
LUK.5.33	They said to Jesus, “John’s followers often fast for a certain time and pray, just as the Pharisees do. But your followers eat and drink all the time.”
LUK.5.34	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.5.36	Jesus told them this story: 
LUK.6.1	One Sabbath day Jesus was walking through some fields of grain. His followers picked the heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them. 
LUK.6.2	Some Pharisees said, “Why do you do what is not lawful on the Sabbath day?”
LUK.6.3	Jesus answered, 
LUK.6.5	Then Jesus said to the Pharisees, 
LUK.6.6	On another Sabbath day Jesus went into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man with a crippled right hand was there. 
LUK.6.7	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees were watching closely to see if Jesus would heal on the Sabbath day so they could accuse him. 
LUK.6.8	But he knew what they were thinking, and he said to the man with the crippled hand, 
LUK.6.9	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.6.10	Jesus looked around at all of them and said to the man, 
LUK.6.11	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law were very angry and discussed with each other what they could do to Jesus.
LUK.6.12	At that time Jesus went off to a mountain to pray, and he spent the night praying to God. 
LUK.6.13	The next morning, Jesus called his followers to him and chose twelve of them, whom he named apostles: 
LUK.6.14	Simon (Jesus named him Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, 
LUK.6.15	Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon (called the Zealot), 
LUK.6.16	Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who later turned Jesus over to his enemies.
LUK.6.17	Jesus and the apostles came down from the mountain, and he stood on level ground. A large group of his followers was there, as well as many people from all around Judea, Jerusalem, and the seacoast cities of Tyre and Sidon. 
LUK.6.18	They all came to hear Jesus teach and to be healed of their sicknesses, and he healed those who were troubled by evil spirits. 
LUK.6.19	All the people were trying to touch Jesus, because power was coming from him and healing them all.
LUK.6.20	Jesus looked at his followers and said,
LUK.6.39	Jesus told them this story: 
LUK.7.1	When Jesus finished saying all these things to the people, he went to Capernaum. 
LUK.7.2	There was an army officer who had a servant who was very important to him. The servant was so sick he was nearly dead. 
LUK.7.3	When the officer heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him to ask Jesus to come and heal his servant. 
LUK.7.4	The men went to Jesus and begged him, saying, “This officer is worthy of your help. 
LUK.7.5	He loves our people, and he built us a synagogue.”
LUK.7.6	So Jesus went with the men. He was getting near the officer’s house when the officer sent friends to say, “Lord, don’t trouble yourself, because I am not worthy to have you come into my house. 
LUK.7.7	That is why I did not come to you myself. But you only need to command it, and my servant will be healed. 
LUK.7.8	I, too, am a man under the authority of others, and I have soldiers under my command. I tell one soldier, ‘Go,’ and he goes. I tell another soldier, ‘Come,’ and he comes. I say to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and my servant does it.”
LUK.7.9	When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, 
LUK.7.10	Those who had been sent to Jesus went back to the house where they found the servant in good health.
LUK.7.11	Soon afterwards Jesus went to a town called Nain, and his followers and a large crowd traveled with him. 
LUK.7.12	When he came near the town gate, he saw a funeral. A mother, who was a widow, had lost her only son. A large crowd from the town was with the mother while her son was being carried out. 
LUK.7.13	When the Lord saw her, he felt very sorry for her and said, 
LUK.7.14	He went up and touched the coffin, and the people who were carrying it stopped. Jesus said, 
LUK.7.15	And the son sat up and began to talk. Then Jesus gave him back to his mother.
LUK.7.16	All the people were amazed and began praising God, saying, “A great prophet has come to us! God has come to help his people.”
LUK.7.17	This news about Jesus spread through all Judea and into all the places around there.
LUK.7.18	John’s followers told him about all these things. He called for two of his followers 
LUK.7.19	and sent them to the Lord to ask, “Are you the One who is to come, or should we wait for someone else?”
LUK.7.20	When the men came to Jesus, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you with this question: ‘Are you the One who is to come, or should we wait for someone else?’ ”
LUK.7.21	At that time, Jesus healed many people of their sicknesses, diseases, and evil spirits, and he gave sight to many blind people. 
LUK.7.22	Then Jesus answered John’s followers, 
LUK.7.24	When John’s followers left, Jesus began talking to the people about John: 
LUK.7.29	(When the people, including the tax collectors, heard this, they all agreed that God’s teaching was good, because they had been baptized by John. 
LUK.7.30	But the Pharisees and experts on the law refused to accept God’s plan for themselves; they did not let John baptize them.)
LUK.7.31	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.7.36	One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, so Jesus went into the Pharisee’s house and sat at the table. 
LUK.7.37	A sinful woman in the town learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee’s house. So she brought an alabaster jar of perfume 
LUK.7.38	and stood behind Jesus at his feet, crying. She began to wash his feet with her tears, and she dried them with her hair, kissing them many times and rubbing them with the perfume. 
LUK.7.39	When the Pharisee who asked Jesus to come to his house saw this, he thought to himself, “If Jesus were a prophet, he would know that the woman touching him is a sinner!”
LUK.7.40	Jesus said to the Pharisee, 
LUK.7.40	Simon said, “Teacher, tell me.”
LUK.7.41	Jesus said, 
LUK.7.43	Simon, the Pharisee, answered, “I think it would be the one who owed him the most money.”
LUK.7.43	Jesus said to Simon, 
LUK.7.44	Then Jesus turned toward the woman and said to Simon, 
LUK.7.48	Then Jesus said to her, 
LUK.7.49	The people sitting at the table began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”
LUK.7.50	Jesus said to the woman, 
LUK.8.1	After this, while Jesus was traveling through some cities and small towns, he preached and told the Good News about God’s kingdom. The twelve apostles were with him, 
LUK.8.2	and also some women who had been healed of sicknesses and evil spirits: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out; 
LUK.8.3	Joanna, the wife of Cuza (the manager of Herod’s house); Susanna; and many others. These women used their own money to help Jesus and his apostles.
LUK.8.4	When a great crowd was gathered, and people were coming to Jesus from every town, he told them this story:
LUK.8.8	As Jesus finished the story, he called out, 
LUK.8.9	Jesus’ followers asked him what this story meant.
LUK.8.10	Jesus said, 
LUK.8.19	Jesus’ mother and brothers came to see him, but there was such a crowd they could not get to him. 
LUK.8.20	Someone said to Jesus, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.”
LUK.8.21	Jesus answered them, 
LUK.8.22	One day Jesus and his followers got into a boat, and he said to them, 
LUK.8.23	While they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A very strong wind blew up on the lake, causing the boat to fill with water, and they were in danger.
LUK.8.24	The followers went to Jesus and woke him, saying, “Master! Master! We will drown!”
LUK.8.24	Jesus got up and gave a command to the wind and the waves. They stopped, and it became calm. 
LUK.8.25	Jesus said to his followers, 
LUK.8.25	The followers were afraid and amazed and said to each other, “Who is this that commands even the wind and the water, and they obey him?”
LUK.8.26	Jesus and his followers sailed across the lake from Galilee to the area of the Gerasene people. 
LUK.8.27	When Jesus got out on the land, a man from the town who had demons inside him came to Jesus. For a long time he had worn no clothes and had lived in the burial caves, not in a house. 
LUK.8.28	When he saw Jesus, he cried out and fell down before him. He said with a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, don’t torture me!” 
LUK.8.29	He said this because Jesus was commanding the evil spirit to come out of the man. Many times it had taken hold of him. Though he had been kept under guard and chained hand and foot, he had broken his chains and had been forced by the demon out into a lonely place.
LUK.8.30	Jesus asked him, 
LUK.8.30	He answered, “Legion,” because many demons were in him. 
LUK.8.31	The demons begged Jesus not to send them into eternal darkness. 
LUK.8.32	A large herd of pigs was feeding on a hill, and the demons begged Jesus to allow them to go into the pigs. So Jesus allowed them to do this. 
LUK.8.33	When the demons came out of the man, they went into the pigs, and the herd ran down the hill into the lake and was drowned.
LUK.8.34	When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran away and told about this in the town and the countryside. 
LUK.8.35	And people went to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus, they found the man sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind, because the demons were gone. But the people were frightened. 
LUK.8.36	The people who saw this happen told the others how Jesus had made the man well. 
LUK.8.37	All the people of the Gerasene country asked Jesus to leave, because they were all very afraid. So Jesus got into the boat and went back to Galilee.
LUK.8.38	The man whom Jesus had healed begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, 
LUK.8.39	 So the man went all over town telling how much Jesus had done for him.
LUK.8.40	When Jesus got back to Galilee, a crowd welcomed him, because everyone was waiting for him. 
LUK.8.41	A man named Jairus, a leader of the synagogue, came to Jesus and fell at his feet, begging him to come to his house. 
LUK.8.42	Jairus’ only daughter, about twelve years old, was dying.
LUK.8.42	While Jesus was on his way to Jairus’ house, the people were crowding all around him. 
LUK.8.43	A woman was in the crowd who had been bleeding for twelve years, but no one was able to heal her. 
LUK.8.44	She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his coat, and instantly her bleeding stopped. 
LUK.8.45	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.8.45	When all the people said they had not touched him, Peter said, “Master, the people are all around you and are pushing against you.”
LUK.8.46	But Jesus said, 
LUK.8.47	When the woman saw she could not hide, she came forward, shaking, and fell down before Jesus. While all the people listened, she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed. 
LUK.8.48	Jesus said to her, 
LUK.8.49	While Jesus was still speaking, someone came from the house of the synagogue leader and said to him, “Your daughter is dead. Don’t bother the teacher anymore.”
LUK.8.50	When Jesus heard this, he said to Jairus, 
LUK.8.51	When Jesus went to the house, he let only Peter, John, James, and the girl’s father and mother go inside with him. 
LUK.8.52	All the people were crying and feeling sad because the girl was dead, but Jesus said, 
LUK.8.53	The people laughed at Jesus because they knew the girl was dead. 
LUK.8.54	But Jesus took hold of her hand and called to her, 
LUK.8.55	Her spirit came back into her, and she stood up at once. Then Jesus ordered that she be given something to eat. 
LUK.8.56	The girl’s parents were amazed, but Jesus told them not to tell anyone what had happened.
LUK.9.1	Jesus called the twelve apostles together and gave them power and authority over all demons and the ability to heal sicknesses. 
LUK.9.2	He sent the apostles out to tell about God’s kingdom and to heal the sick. 
LUK.9.3	He said to them, 
LUK.9.6	So the apostles went out and traveled through all the towns, preaching the Good News and healing people everywhere.
LUK.9.7	Herod, the governor, heard about all the things that were happening and was confused, because some people said, “John the Baptist has risen from the dead.” 
LUK.9.8	Others said, “Elijah has come to us.” And still others said, “One of the prophets who lived long ago has risen from the dead.” 
LUK.9.9	Herod said, “I cut off John’s head, so who is this man I hear such things about?” And Herod kept trying to see Jesus.
LUK.9.10	When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then Jesus took them with him to a town called Bethsaida where they could be alone together. 
LUK.9.11	But the people learned where Jesus went and followed him. He welcomed them and talked with them about God’s kingdom and healed those who needed to be healed.
LUK.9.12	Late in the afternoon, the twelve apostles came to Jesus and said, “Send the people away. They need to go to the towns and countryside around here and find places to sleep and something to eat, because no one lives in this place.”
LUK.9.13	But Jesus said to them, 
LUK.9.13	They said, “We have only five loaves of bread and two fish, unless we go buy food for all these people.” 
LUK.9.14	(There were about five thousand men there.)
LUK.9.14	Jesus said to his followers, 
LUK.9.15	So the followers did this, and all the people sat down. 
LUK.9.16	Then Jesus took the five loaves of bread and two fish, and looking up to heaven, he thanked God for the food. Then he divided the food and gave it to the followers to give to the people. 
LUK.9.17	They all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was gathered up, filling twelve baskets.
LUK.9.18	One time when Jesus was praying alone, his followers were with him, and he asked them, 
LUK.9.19	They answered, “Some say you are John the Baptist. Others say you are Elijah. And others say you are one of the prophets from long ago who has come back to life.”
LUK.9.20	Then Jesus asked, 
LUK.9.20	Peter answered, “You are the Christ from God.”
LUK.9.21	Jesus warned them not to tell anyone, saying, 
LUK.9.23	Jesus said to all of them, 
LUK.9.28	About eight days after Jesus said these things, he took Peter, John, and James and went up on a mountain to pray. 
LUK.9.29	While Jesus was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became shining white. 
LUK.9.30	Then two men, Moses and Elijah, were talking with Jesus. 
LUK.9.31	They appeared in heavenly glory, talking about his departure which he would soon bring about in Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.32	Peter and the others were very sleepy, but when they awoke fully, they saw the glory of Jesus and the two men standing with him. 
LUK.9.33	When Moses and Elijah were about to leave, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” (Peter did not know what he was talking about.)
LUK.9.34	While he was saying these things, a cloud came and covered them, and they became afraid as the cloud covered them. 
LUK.9.35	A voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, whom I have chosen. Listen to him!”
LUK.9.36	When the voice finished speaking, only Jesus was there. Peter, John, and James said nothing and told no one at that time what they had seen.
LUK.9.37	The next day, when they came down from the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus. 
LUK.9.38	A man in the crowd shouted to him, “Teacher, please come and look at my son, because he is my only child. 
LUK.9.39	An evil spirit seizes my son, and suddenly he screams. It causes him to lose control of himself and foam at the mouth. The evil spirit keeps on hurting him and almost never leaves him. 
LUK.9.40	I begged your followers to force the evil spirit out, but they could not do it.”
LUK.9.41	Jesus answered, 
LUK.9.42	While the boy was coming, the demon threw him on the ground and made him lose control of himself. But Jesus gave a strong command to the evil spirit and healed the boy and gave him back to his father. 
LUK.9.43	All the people were amazed at the great power of God.
LUK.9.43	While everyone was wondering about all that Jesus did, he said to his followers, 
LUK.9.45	But the followers did not understand what this meant; the meaning was hidden from them so they could not understand. But they were afraid to ask Jesus about it.
LUK.9.46	Jesus’ followers began to have an argument about which one of them was the greatest. 
LUK.9.47	Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he took a little child and stood the child beside him. 
LUK.9.48	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.9.49	John answered, “Master, we saw someone using your name to force demons out of people. We told him to stop, because he does not belong to our group.”
LUK.9.50	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.9.51	When the time was coming near for Jesus to depart, he was determined to go to Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.52	He sent some messengers ahead of him, who went into a town in Samaria to make everything ready for him. 
LUK.9.53	But the people there would not welcome him, because he was set on going to Jerusalem. 
LUK.9.54	When James and John, followers of Jesus, saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven and destroy those people?”
LUK.9.55	But Jesus turned and scolded them. [And Jesus said, 
LUK.9.56	] Then they went to another town.
LUK.9.57	As they were going along the road, someone said to Jesus, “I will follow you any place you go.”
LUK.9.58	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.9.59	Jesus said to another man, 
LUK.9.59	But he said, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”
LUK.9.60	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.9.61	Another man said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me go and say good-bye to my family.”
LUK.9.62	Jesus said, 
LUK.10.1	After this, the Lord chose seventy-two others and sent them out in pairs ahead of him into every town and place where he planned to go. 
LUK.10.2	He said to them, 
LUK.10.17	When the seventy-two came back, they were very happy and said, “Lord, even the demons obeyed us when we used your name!”
LUK.10.18	Jesus said, 
LUK.10.21	Then Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, 
LUK.10.23	Then Jesus turned to his followers and said privately, 
LUK.10.25	Then an expert on the law stood up to test Jesus, saying, “Teacher, what must I do to get life forever?”
LUK.10.26	Jesus said, 
LUK.10.27	The man answered, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind.” Also, “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.”
LUK.10.28	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.29	But the man, wanting to show the importance of his question, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?”
LUK.10.30	Jesus answered, 
LUK.10.36	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.10.37	The expert on the law answered, “The one who showed him mercy.”
LUK.10.37	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.10.38	While Jesus and his followers were traveling, Jesus went into a town. A woman named Martha let Jesus stay at her house. 
LUK.10.39	Martha had a sister named Mary, who was sitting at Jesus’ feet and listening to him teach. 
LUK.10.40	But Martha was busy with all the work to be done. She went in and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me alone to do all the work? Tell her to help me.”
LUK.10.41	But the Lord answered her, 
LUK.11.1	One time Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his followers said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray as John taught his followers.”
LUK.11.2	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.11.5	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.11.14	One time Jesus was sending out a demon who could not talk. When the demon came out, the man who had been unable to speak, then spoke. The people were amazed. 
LUK.11.15	But some of them said, “Jesus uses the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons, to force demons out of people.”
LUK.11.16	Other people, wanting to test Jesus, asked him to give them a sign from heaven. 
LUK.11.17	But knowing their thoughts, he said to them, 
LUK.11.27	As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out to Jesus, “Blessed is the mother who gave birth to you and nursed you.”
LUK.11.28	But Jesus said, 
LUK.11.29	As the crowd grew larger, Jesus said, 
LUK.11.37	After Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee asked Jesus to eat with him. So Jesus went in and sat at the table. 
LUK.11.38	But the Pharisee was surprised when he saw that Jesus did not wash his hands before the meal. 
LUK.11.39	The Lord said to him, 
LUK.11.45	One of the experts on the law said to Jesus, “Teacher, when you say these things, you are insulting us, too.”
LUK.11.46	Jesus answered, 
LUK.11.53	When Jesus left, the teachers of the law and the Pharisees began to give him trouble, asking him questions about many things, 
LUK.11.54	trying to catch him saying something wrong.
LUK.12.1	So many thousands of people had gathered that they were stepping on each other. Jesus spoke first to his followers, saying, 
LUK.12.13	Someone in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell my brother to divide with me the property our father left us.”
LUK.12.14	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.12.15	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.12.16	Then Jesus told this story: 
LUK.12.22	Jesus said to his followers, 
LUK.12.41	Peter said, “Lord, did you tell this story to us or to all people?”
LUK.12.42	The Lord said, 
LUK.12.54	Then Jesus said to the people, 
LUK.13.1	At that time some people were there who told Jesus that Pilate had killed some people from Galilee while they were worshiping. He mixed their blood with the blood of the animals they were sacrificing to God. 
LUK.13.2	Jesus answered, 
LUK.13.6	Jesus told this story: 
LUK.13.10	Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath day. 
LUK.13.11	A woman was there who, for eighteen years, had an evil spirit in her that made her crippled. Her back was always bent; she could not stand up straight. 
LUK.13.12	When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said, 
LUK.13.13	Jesus put his hands on her, and immediately she was able to stand up straight and began praising God.
LUK.13.14	The synagogue leader was angry because Jesus healed on the Sabbath day. He said to the people, “There are six days when one has to work. So come to be healed on one of those days, and not on the Sabbath day.”
LUK.13.15	The Lord answered, 
LUK.13.17	When Jesus said this, all of those who were criticizing him were ashamed, but the entire crowd rejoiced at all the wonderful things Jesus was doing.
LUK.13.18	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.13.20	Jesus said again, 
LUK.13.22	Jesus was teaching in every town and village as he traveled toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.13.23	Someone said to Jesus, “Lord, will only a few people be saved?”
LUK.13.23	Jesus said, 
LUK.13.31	At that time some Pharisees came to Jesus and said, “Go away from here! Herod wants to kill you!”
LUK.13.32	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.14.1	On a Sabbath day, when Jesus went to eat at the home of a leading Pharisee, the people were watching Jesus very closely. 
LUK.14.2	And in front of him was a man with dropsy. 
LUK.14.3	Jesus said to the Pharisees and experts on the law, 
LUK.14.4	But they would not answer his question. So Jesus took the man, healed him, and sent him away. 
LUK.14.5	Jesus said to the Pharisees and teachers of the law, 
LUK.14.6	And they could not answer him.
LUK.14.7	When Jesus noticed that some of the guests were choosing the best places to sit, he told this story: 
LUK.14.12	Then Jesus said to the man who had invited him, 
LUK.14.15	One of those at the table with Jesus heard these things and said to him, “Blessed are the people who will share in the meal in God’s kingdom.”
LUK.14.16	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.14.25	Large crowds were traveling with Jesus, and he turned and said to them, 
LUK.15.1	The tax collectors and sinners all came to listen to Jesus. 
LUK.15.2	But the Pharisees and the teachers of the law began to complain: “Look, this man welcomes sinners and even eats with them.”
LUK.15.3	Then Jesus told them this story: 
LUK.15.11	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.16.1	Jesus also said to his followers, 
LUK.16.14	The Pharisees, who loved money, were listening to all these things and made fun of Jesus. 
LUK.16.15	He said to them, 
LUK.16.19	Jesus said, 
LUK.17.1	Jesus said to his followers, 
LUK.17.5	The apostles said to the Lord, “Give us more faith!”
LUK.17.6	The Lord said, 
LUK.17.11	While Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem, he was going through the area between Samaria and Galilee. 
LUK.17.12	As he came into a small town, ten men who had a skin disease met him there. They did not come close to Jesus 
LUK.17.13	but called to him, “Jesus! Master! Have mercy on us!”
LUK.17.14	When Jesus saw the men, he said, 
LUK.17.14	As the ten men were going, they were healed. 
LUK.17.15	When one of them saw that he was healed, he went back to Jesus, praising God in a loud voice. 
LUK.17.16	Then he bowed down at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. (And this man was a Samaritan.) 
LUK.17.17	Jesus said, 
LUK.17.19	Then Jesus said to him, 
LUK.17.20	Some of the Pharisees asked Jesus, “When will the kingdom of God come?”
LUK.17.20	Jesus answered, 
LUK.17.22	Then Jesus said to his followers, 
LUK.17.37	The followers asked Jesus, “Where will this be, Lord?”
LUK.17.37	Jesus answered, 
LUK.18.1	Then Jesus used this story to teach his followers that they should always pray and never lose hope. 
LUK.18.6	The Lord said, 
LUK.18.9	Jesus told this story to some people who thought they were very good and looked down on everyone else: 
LUK.18.15	Some people brought even their babies to Jesus so he could touch them. When the followers saw this, they told them to stop. 
LUK.18.16	But Jesus called for the children, saying, 
LUK.18.18	A certain leader asked Jesus, “Good Teacher, what must I do to have life forever?”
LUK.18.19	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.18.21	But the leader said, “I have obeyed all these commands since I was a boy.”
LUK.18.22	When Jesus heard this, he said to him, 
LUK.18.23	But when the man heard this, he became very sad, because he was very rich.
LUK.18.24	Jesus looked at him and said, 
LUK.18.26	When the people heard this, they asked, “Then who can be saved?”
LUK.18.27	Jesus answered, 
LUK.18.28	Peter said, “Look, we have left everything and followed you.”
LUK.18.29	Jesus said, 
LUK.18.31	Then Jesus took the twelve apostles aside and said to them, 
LUK.18.34	The apostles did not understand this; the meaning was hidden from them, and they did not realize what was said.
LUK.18.35	As Jesus came near the city of Jericho, a blind man was sitting beside the road, begging. 
LUK.18.36	When he heard the people coming down the road, he asked, “What is happening?”
LUK.18.37	They told him, “Jesus, from Nazareth, is going by.”
LUK.18.38	The blind man cried out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”
LUK.18.39	The people leading the group warned the blind man to be quiet. But the blind man shouted even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”
LUK.18.40	Jesus stopped and ordered the blind man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him, 
LUK.18.41	He said, “Lord, I want to see.”
LUK.18.42	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.18.43	At once the man was able to see, and he followed Jesus, thanking God. All the people who saw this praised God.
LUK.19.1	Jesus was going through the city of Jericho. 
LUK.19.2	A man was there named Zacchaeus, who was a very important tax collector, and he was wealthy. 
LUK.19.3	He wanted to see who Jesus was, but he was not able because he was too short to see above the crowd. 
LUK.19.4	He ran ahead to a place where Jesus would come, and he climbed a sycamore tree so he could see him. 
LUK.19.5	When Jesus came to that place, he looked up and said to him, 
LUK.19.6	Zacchaeus came down quickly and welcomed him gladly. 
LUK.19.7	All the people saw this and began to complain, “Jesus is staying with a sinner!”
LUK.19.8	But Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “I will give half of my possessions to the poor. And if I have cheated anyone, I will pay back four times more.”
LUK.19.9	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.19.11	As the people were listening to this, Jesus told them a story because he was near Jerusalem and they thought God’s kingdom would appear immediately. 
LUK.19.12	He said: 
LUK.19.28	After Jesus said this, he went on toward Jerusalem. 
LUK.19.29	As Jesus came near Bethphage and Bethany, towns near the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent out two of his followers. 
LUK.19.30	He said, 
LUK.19.32	The two followers went into town and found the colt just as Jesus had told them. 
LUK.19.33	As they were untying it, its owners came out and asked the followers, “Why are you untying our colt?”
LUK.19.34	The followers answered, “The Master needs it.” 
LUK.19.35	So they brought it to Jesus, threw their coats on the colt’s back, and put Jesus on it. 
LUK.19.36	As Jesus rode toward Jerusalem, others spread their coats on the road before him.
LUK.19.37	As he was coming close to Jerusalem, on the way down the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of followers began joyfully shouting praise to God for all the miracles they had seen. 
LUK.19.38	They said,
LUK.19.38	“God bless the king who comes in the name of the Lord! 
LUK.19.38	There is peace in heaven and glory to God!”
LUK.19.39	Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, “Teacher, tell your followers not to say these things.”
LUK.19.40	But Jesus answered, 
LUK.19.41	As Jesus came near Jerusalem, he saw the city and cried for it, 
LUK.19.42	saying, 
LUK.19.45	Jesus went into the Temple and began to throw out the people who were selling things there. 
LUK.19.46	He said, 
LUK.19.47	Jesus taught in the Temple every day. The leading priests, the experts on the law, and some of the leaders of the people wanted to kill Jesus. 
LUK.19.48	But they did not know how they could do it, because all the people were listening closely to him.
LUK.20.1	One day Jesus was in the Temple, teaching the people and telling them the Good News. The leading priests, teachers of the law, and elders came up to talk with him, 
LUK.20.2	saying, “Tell us what authority you have to do these things? Who gave you this authority?”
LUK.20.3	Jesus answered, 
LUK.20.5	They argued about this, saying, “If we answer, ‘John’s baptism was from God,’ Jesus will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’ 
LUK.20.6	But if we say, ‘It was from other people,’ all the people will stone us to death, because they believe John was a prophet.” 
LUK.20.7	So they answered that they didn’t know where it came from.
LUK.20.8	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.9	Then Jesus told the people this story: 
LUK.20.16	When the people heard this story, they said, “Let this never happen!”
LUK.20.17	But Jesus looked at them and said, 
LUK.20.19	The teachers of the law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus at once, because they knew the story was about them. But they were afraid of what the people would do.
LUK.20.20	So they watched Jesus and sent some spies who acted as if they were sincere. They wanted to trap Jesus in saying something wrong so they could hand him over to the authority and power of the governor. 
LUK.20.21	So the spies asked Jesus, “Teacher, we know that what you say and teach is true. You pay no attention to who people are, and you always teach the truth about God’s way. 
LUK.20.22	Tell us, is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”
LUK.20.23	But Jesus, knowing they were trying to trick him, said, 
LUK.20.24	They said, “Caesar’s.”
LUK.20.25	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.26	So they were not able to trap Jesus in anything he said in the presence of the people. And being amazed at his answer, they became silent.
LUK.20.27	Some Sadducees, who believed people would not rise from the dead, came to Jesus. 
LUK.20.28	They asked, “Teacher, Moses wrote that if a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, then that man must marry the widow and have children for his brother. 
LUK.20.29	Once there were seven brothers. The first brother married and died, but had no children. 
LUK.20.30	Then the second brother married the widow, and he died. 
LUK.20.31	And the third brother married the widow, and he died. The same thing happened with all seven brothers; they died and had no children. 
LUK.20.32	Finally, the woman died also. 
LUK.20.33	Since all seven brothers had married her, whose wife will she be when people rise from the dead?”
LUK.20.34	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.20.39	Some of the teachers of the law said, “Teacher, your answer was good.” 
LUK.20.40	No one was brave enough to ask him another question.
LUK.20.41	Then Jesus said, 
LUK.20.45	While all the people were listening, Jesus said to his followers, 
LUK.21.1	As Jesus looked up, he saw some rich people putting their gifts into the Temple money box. 
LUK.21.2	Then he saw a poor widow putting two small copper coins into the box. 
LUK.21.3	He said, 
LUK.21.5	Some people were talking about the Temple and how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts offered to God.
LUK.21.5	But Jesus said, 
LUK.21.7	They asked Jesus, “Teacher, when will these things happen? What will be the sign that they are about to take place?”
LUK.21.8	Jesus said, 
LUK.21.10	Then he said to them, 
LUK.21.29	Then Jesus told this story: 
LUK.21.37	During the day, Jesus taught the people in the Temple, and at night he went out of the city and stayed on the Mount of Olives. 
LUK.21.38	Every morning all the people got up early to go to the Temple to listen to him.
LUK.22.1	It was almost time for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, called the Passover Feast. 
LUK.22.2	The leading priests and teachers of the law were trying to find a way to kill Jesus, because they were afraid of the people.
LUK.22.3	Satan entered Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’ twelve apostles. 
LUK.22.4	Judas went to the leading priests and some of the soldiers who guarded the Temple and talked to them about a way to hand Jesus over to them. 
LUK.22.5	They were pleased and agreed to give Judas money. 
LUK.22.6	He agreed and watched for the best time to hand Jesus over to them when he was away from the crowd.
LUK.22.7	The Day of Unleavened Bread came when the Passover lambs had to be sacrificed. 
LUK.22.8	Jesus said to Peter and John, 
LUK.22.9	They asked, “Where do you want us to prepare it?” 
LUK.22.10	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.22.13	So Peter and John left and found everything as Jesus had said. And they prepared the Passover meal.
LUK.22.14	When the time came, Jesus and the apostles were sitting at the table. 
LUK.22.15	He said to them, 
LUK.22.17	Then Jesus took a cup, gave thanks, and said, 
LUK.22.19	Then Jesus took some bread, gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to the apostles, saying, 
LUK.22.20	In the same way, after supper, Jesus took the cup and said, 
LUK.22.23	Then the apostles asked each other which one of them would do that.
LUK.22.24	The apostles also began to argue about which one of them was the most important. 
LUK.22.25	But Jesus said to them, 
LUK.22.33	But Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, I am ready to go with you to prison and even to die with you!”
LUK.22.34	But Jesus said, 
LUK.22.35	Then Jesus said to the apostles, 
LUK.22.35	They said, “No.”
LUK.22.36	He said to them, 
LUK.22.38	His followers said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.”
LUK.22.38	He said to them, 
LUK.22.39	Jesus left the city and went to the Mount of Olives, as he often did, and his followers went with him. 
LUK.22.40	When he reached the place, he said to them, 
LUK.22.41	Then Jesus went about a stone’s throw away from them. He kneeled down and prayed, 
LUK.22.43	Then an angel from heaven appeared to him to strengthen him. 
LUK.22.44	Being full of pain, Jesus prayed even harder. His sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground. 
LUK.22.45	When he finished praying, he went to his followers and found them asleep because of their sadness. 
LUK.22.46	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.22.47	While Jesus was speaking, a crowd came up, and Judas, one of the twelve apostles, was leading them. He came close to Jesus so he could kiss him.
LUK.22.48	But Jesus said to him, 
LUK.22.49	When those who were standing around him saw what was happening, they said, “Lord, should we strike them with our swords?” 
LUK.22.50	And one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.
LUK.22.51	Jesus said, 
LUK.22.52	Those who came to arrest Jesus were the leading priests, the soldiers who guarded the Temple, and the elders. Jesus said to them, 
LUK.22.54	They arrested Jesus, and led him away, and brought him into the house of the high priest. Peter followed far behind them. 
LUK.22.55	After the soldiers started a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat together, Peter sat with them. 
LUK.22.56	A servant girl saw Peter sitting there in the firelight, and looking closely at him, she said, “This man was also with him.”
LUK.22.57	But Peter said this was not true; he said, “Woman, I don’t know him.”
LUK.22.58	A short time later, another person saw Peter and said, “You are also one of them.”
LUK.22.58	But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”
LUK.22.59	About an hour later, another man insisted, “Certainly this man was with him, because he is from Galilee, too.”
LUK.22.60	But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you are talking about!”
LUK.22.60	At once, while Peter was still speaking, a rooster crowed. 
LUK.22.61	Then the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter. And Peter remembered what the Lord had said: 
LUK.22.62	Then Peter went outside and cried painfully.
LUK.22.63	The men who were guarding Jesus began making fun of him and beating him.
LUK.22.64	They blindfolded him and said, “Prove that you are a prophet, and tell us who hit you.” 
LUK.22.65	They said many cruel things to Jesus.
LUK.22.66	When day came, the council of the elders of the people, both the leading priests and the teachers of the law, came together and led Jesus to their highest court. 
LUK.22.67	They said, “If you are the Christ, tell us.”
LUK.22.67	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.22.70	They all said, “Then are you the Son of God?”
LUK.22.70	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.22.71	They said, “Why do we need witnesses now? We ourselves heard him say this.”
LUK.23.1	Then the whole group stood up and led Jesus to Pilate. 
LUK.23.2	They began to accuse Jesus, saying, “We caught this man telling things that mislead our people. He says that we should not pay taxes to Caesar, and he calls himself the Christ, a king.”
LUK.23.3	Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
LUK.23.3	Jesus answered, 
LUK.23.4	Pilate said to the leading priests and the people, “I find nothing against this man.”
LUK.23.5	They were insisting, saying, “But Jesus makes trouble with the people, teaching all around Judea. He began in Galilee, and now he is here.”
LUK.23.6	Pilate heard this and asked if Jesus was from Galilee. 
LUK.23.7	Since Jesus was under Herod’s authority, Pilate sent Jesus to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at that time. 
LUK.23.8	When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, because he had heard about Jesus and had wanted to meet him for a long time. He was hoping to see Jesus work a miracle. 
LUK.23.9	Herod asked Jesus many questions, but Jesus said nothing. 
LUK.23.10	The leading priests and teachers of the law were standing there, strongly accusing Jesus. 
LUK.23.11	After Herod and his soldiers had made fun of Jesus, they dressed him in a kingly robe and sent him back to Pilate. 
LUK.23.12	In the past, Pilate and Herod had always been enemies, but on that day they became friends.
LUK.23.13	Pilate called the people together with the leading priests and the rulers. 
LUK.23.14	He said to them, “You brought this man to me, saying he makes trouble among the people. But I have questioned him before you all, and I have not found him guilty of what you say. 
LUK.23.15	Also, Herod found nothing wrong with him; he sent him back to us. Look, he has done nothing for which he should die. 
LUK.23.16	So, after I punish him, I will let him go free.” [
LUK.23.17	Every year at the Passover Feast, Pilate had to release one prisoner to the people.]
LUK.23.18	But the people shouted together, “Take this man away! Let Barabbas go free!” 
LUK.23.19	(Barabbas was a man who was in prison for his part in a riot in the city and for murder.)
LUK.23.20	Pilate wanted to let Jesus go free and told this to the crowd. 
LUK.23.21	But they shouted again, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
LUK.23.22	A third time Pilate said to them, “Why? What wrong has he done? I can find no reason to kill him. So I will have him punished and set him free.”
LUK.23.23	But they continued to shout, demanding that Jesus be crucified. Their yelling became so loud that 
LUK.23.24	Pilate decided to give them what they wanted. 
LUK.23.25	He set free the man who was in jail for rioting and murder, and he handed Jesus over to them to do with him as they wished.
LUK.23.26	As they led Jesus away, Simon, a man from Cyrene, was coming in from the fields. They forced him to carry Jesus’ cross and to walk behind him.
LUK.23.27	A large crowd of people was following Jesus, including some women who were sad and crying for him. 
LUK.23.28	But Jesus turned and said to them, 
LUK.23.32	There were also two criminals led out with Jesus to be put to death. 
LUK.23.33	When they came to a place called the Skull, the soldiers crucified Jesus and the criminals—one on his right and the other on his left. 
LUK.23.34	Jesus said, 
LUK.23.34	The soldiers threw lots to decide who would get his clothes. 
LUK.23.35	The people stood there watching. And the leaders made fun of Jesus, saying, “He saved others. Let him save himself if he is God’s Chosen One, the Christ.”
LUK.23.36	The soldiers also made fun of him, coming to Jesus and offering him some vinegar. 
LUK.23.37	They said, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!” 
LUK.23.38	At the top of the cross these words were written: 
LUK.23.39	One of the criminals on a cross began to shout insults at Jesus: “Aren’t you the Christ? Then save yourself and us.”
LUK.23.40	But the other criminal stopped him and said, “You should fear God! You are getting the same punishment he is. 
LUK.23.41	We are punished justly, getting what we deserve for what we did. But this man has done nothing wrong.” 
LUK.23.42	Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”
LUK.23.43	Jesus said to him, 
LUK.23.44	It was about noon, and the whole land became dark until three o’clock in the afternoon, 
LUK.23.45	because the sun did not shine. The curtain in the Temple was torn in two. 
LUK.23.46	Jesus cried out in a loud voice, 
LUK.23.47	When the army officer there saw what happened, he praised God, saying, “Surely this was a good man!”
LUK.23.48	When all the people who had gathered there to watch saw what happened, they returned home, beating their chests because they were so sad. 
LUK.23.49	But those who were close friends of Jesus, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance and watched.
LUK.23.50	There was a good and religious man named Joseph who was a member of the council. 
LUK.23.51	But he had not agreed to the other leaders’ plans and actions against Jesus. He was from the town of Arimathea and was waiting for the kingdom of God to come. 
LUK.23.52	Joseph went to Pilate to ask for the body of Jesus. 
LUK.23.53	He took the body down from the cross, wrapped it in cloth, and put it in a tomb that was cut out of a wall of rock. This tomb had never been used before. 
LUK.23.54	This was late on Preparation Day, and when the sun went down, the Sabbath day would begin.
LUK.23.55	The women who had come from Galilee with Jesus followed Joseph and saw the tomb and how Jesus’ body was laid. 
LUK.23.56	Then the women left to prepare spices and perfumes.
LUK.23.56	On the Sabbath day they rested, as the law of Moses commanded.
LUK.24.1	Very early on the first day of the week, at dawn, the women came to the tomb, bringing the spices they had prepared. 
LUK.24.2	They found the stone rolled away from the entrance of the tomb, 
LUK.24.3	but when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus. 
LUK.24.4	While they were wondering about this, two men in shining clothes suddenly stood beside them. 
LUK.24.5	The women were very afraid and bowed their heads to the ground. The men said to them, “Why are you looking for a living person in this place for the dead? 
LUK.24.6	He is not here; he has risen from the dead. Do you remember what he told you in Galilee? 
LUK.24.7	He said the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful people, be crucified, and rise from the dead on the third day.” 
LUK.24.8	Then the women remembered what Jesus had said.
LUK.24.9	The women left the tomb and told all these things to the eleven apostles and the other followers. 
LUK.24.10	It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some other women who told the apostles everything that had happened at the tomb. 
LUK.24.11	But they did not believe the women, because it sounded like nonsense. 
LUK.24.12	But Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Bending down and looking in, he saw only the cloth that Jesus’ body had been wrapped in. Peter went away to his home, wondering about what had happened.
LUK.24.13	That same day two of Jesus’ followers were going to a town named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. 
LUK.24.14	They were talking about everything that had happened. 
LUK.24.15	While they were talking and discussing, Jesus himself came near and began walking with them, 
LUK.24.16	but they were kept from recognizing him. 
LUK.24.17	Then he said, 
LUK.24.17	The two followers stopped, looking very sad. 
LUK.24.18	The one named Cleopas answered, “Are you the only visitor in Jerusalem who does not know what just happened there?”
LUK.24.19	Jesus said to them, 
LUK.24.19	They said, “About Jesus of Nazareth. He was a prophet who said and did many powerful things before God and all the people. 
LUK.24.20	Our leaders and the leading priests handed him over to be sentenced to death, and they crucified him. 
LUK.24.21	But we were hoping that he would free Israel. Besides this, it is now the third day since this happened. 
LUK.24.22	And today some women among us amazed us. Early this morning they went to the tomb, 
LUK.24.23	but they did not find his body there. They came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said that Jesus was alive! 
LUK.24.24	So some of our group went to the tomb, too. They found it just as the women said, but they did not see Jesus.”
LUK.24.25	Then Jesus said to them, 
LUK.24.27	Then starting with what Moses and all the prophets had said about him, Jesus began to explain everything that had been written about himself in the Scriptures.
LUK.24.28	They came near the town of Emmaus, and Jesus acted as if he were going farther. 
LUK.24.29	But they begged him, “Stay with us, because it is late; it is almost night.” So he went in to stay with them.
LUK.24.30	When Jesus was at the table with them, he took some bread, gave thanks, divided it, and gave it to them. 
LUK.24.31	And then, they were allowed to recognize Jesus. But when they saw who he was, he disappeared. 
LUK.24.32	They said to each other, “It felt like a fire burning in us when Jesus talked to us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us.”
LUK.24.33	So the two followers got up at once and went back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven apostles and others gathered. 
LUK.24.34	They were saying, “The Lord really has risen from the dead! He showed himself to Simon.”
LUK.24.35	Then the two followers told what had happened on the road and how they recognized Jesus when he divided the bread.
LUK.24.36	While the two followers were telling this, Jesus himself stood right in the middle of them and said, 
LUK.24.37	They were fearful and terrified and thought they were seeing a ghost. 
LUK.24.38	But Jesus said, 
LUK.24.40	After Jesus said this, he showed them his hands and feet. 
LUK.24.41	While they still could not believe it because they were amazed and happy, Jesus said to them, 
LUK.24.42	They gave him a piece of broiled fish. 
LUK.24.43	While the followers watched, Jesus took the fish and ate it.
LUK.24.44	He said to them, 
LUK.24.45	Then Jesus opened their minds so they could understand the Scriptures. 
LUK.24.46	He said to them, 
LUK.24.50	Jesus led his followers as far as Bethany, and he raised his hands and blessed them. 
LUK.24.51	While he was blessing them, he was separated from them and carried into heaven. 
LUK.24.52	They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem very happy. 
LUK.24.53	They stayed in the Temple all the time, praising God.
JHN.1.1	In the beginning there was the Word. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. 
JHN.1.2	He was with God in the beginning. 
JHN.1.3	All things were made by him, and nothing was made without him. 
JHN.1.4	In him there was life, and that life was the light of all people. 
JHN.1.5	The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overpowered it.
JHN.1.6	There was a man named John who was sent by God. 
JHN.1.7	He came to tell people the truth about the Light so that through him all people could hear about the Light and believe. 
JHN.1.8	John was not the Light, but he came to tell people the truth about the Light. 
JHN.1.9	The true Light that gives light to all was coming into the world!
JHN.1.10	The Word was in the world, and the world was made by him, but the world did not know him. 
JHN.1.11	He came to the world that was his own, but his own people did not accept him. 
JHN.1.12	But to all who did accept him and believe in him he gave the right to become children of God. 
JHN.1.13	They did not become his children in any human way—by any human parents or human desire. They were born of God.
JHN.1.14	The Word became a human and lived among us. We saw his glory—the glory that belongs to the only Son of the Father—and he was full of grace and truth. 
JHN.1.15	John tells the truth about him and cries out, saying, “This is the One I told you about: ‘The One who comes after me is greater than I am, because he was living before me.’ ”
JHN.1.16	Because he was full of grace and truth, from him we all received one gift after another. 
JHN.1.17	The law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. 
JHN.1.18	No one has ever seen God. But God the only Son is very close to the Father, and he has shown us what God is like.
JHN.1.19	Here is the truth John told when the leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him, “Who are you?”
JHN.1.20	John spoke freely and did not refuse to answer. He said, “I am not the Christ.”
JHN.1.21	So they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?”
JHN.1.21	He answered, “No, I am not.”
JHN.1.21	“Are you the Prophet?” they asked.
JHN.1.21	He answered, “No.”
JHN.1.22	Then they said, “Who are you? Give us an answer to tell those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”
JHN.1.23	John told them in the words of the prophet Isaiah:
JHN.1.23	“I am the voice of one
JHN.1.23	calling out in the desert:
JHN.1.23	‘Make the road straight for the Lord.’ ”
JHN.1.24	Some Pharisees who had been sent asked John: 
JHN.1.25	“If you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet, why do you baptize people?”
JHN.1.26	John answered, “I baptize with water, but there is one here with you that you don’t know about. 
JHN.1.27	He is the One who comes after me. I am not good enough to untie the strings of his sandals.”
JHN.1.28	This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan River, where John was baptizing people.
JHN.1.29	The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him. John said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! 
JHN.1.30	This is the One I was talking about when I said, ‘A man will come after me, but he is greater than I am, because he was living before me.’ 
JHN.1.31	Even I did not know who he was, although I came baptizing with water so that the people of Israel would know who he is.”
JHN.1.32+JHN.1.33	Then John said, “I saw the Spirit come down from heaven in the form of a dove and rest on him. Until then I did not know who the Christ was. But the God who sent me to baptize with water told me, ‘You will see the Spirit come down and rest on a man; he is the One who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.’ 
JHN.1.34	I have seen this happen, and I tell you the truth: This man is the Son of God.”
JHN.1.35	The next day John was there again with two of his followers. 
JHN.1.36	When he saw Jesus walking by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”
JHN.1.37	The two followers heard John say this, so they followed Jesus. 
JHN.1.38	When Jesus turned and saw them following him, he asked, 
JHN.1.38	They said, “Rabbi, where are you staying?” (“Rabbi” means “Teacher.”)
JHN.1.39	He answered, 
JHN.1.40	One of the two men who followed Jesus after they heard John speak about him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. 
JHN.1.41	The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and say to him, “We have found the Messiah.” (“Messiah” means “Christ.”)
JHN.1.42	Then Andrew took Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, 
JHN.1.43	The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, 
JHN.1.44	Philip was from the town of Bethsaida, where Andrew and Peter lived. 
JHN.1.45	Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the man that Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets also wrote about him. He is Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”
JHN.1.46	But Nathanael said to Philip, “Can anything good come from Nazareth?”
JHN.1.46	Philip answered, “Come and see.”
JHN.1.47	As Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, he said, 
JHN.1.48	Nathanael asked, “How do you know me?”
JHN.1.48	Jesus answered, 
JHN.1.49	Then Nathanael said to Jesus, “Teacher, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.”
JHN.1.50	Jesus said to Nathanael, 
JHN.1.51	And Jesus said to them, 
JHN.2.1	Two days later there was a wedding in the town of Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, 
JHN.2.2	and Jesus and his followers were also invited to the wedding. 
JHN.2.3	When all the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.”
JHN.2.4	Jesus answered, 
JHN.2.5	His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you to do.”
JHN.2.6	In that place there were six stone water jars that the Jews used in their washing ceremony. Each jar held about twenty or thirty gallons.
JHN.2.7	Jesus said to the servants, 
JHN.2.8	Then he said to them, 
JHN.2.8	So they took the water to the master. 
JHN.2.9	When he tasted it, the water had become wine. He did not know where the wine came from, but the servants who had brought the water knew. The master of the wedding called the bridegroom 
JHN.2.10	and said to him, “People always serve the best wine first. Later, after the guests have been drinking awhile, they serve the cheaper wine. But you have saved the best wine till now.”
JHN.2.11	So in Cana of Galilee Jesus did his first miracle. There he showed his glory, and his followers believed in him.
JHN.2.12	After this, Jesus went to the town of Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and followers. They stayed there for just a few days. 
JHN.2.13	When it was almost time for the Jewish Passover Feast, Jesus went to Jerusalem. 
JHN.2.14	In the Temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves. He saw others sitting at tables, exchanging different kinds of money. 
JHN.2.15	Jesus made a whip out of cords and forced all of them, both the sheep and cattle, to leave the Temple. He turned over the tables and scattered the money of those who were exchanging it. 
JHN.2.16	Then he said to those who were selling pigeons, 
JHN.2.17	When this happened, the followers remembered what was written in the Scriptures: “My strong love for your Temple completely controls me.”
JHN.2.18	Some of his people said to Jesus, “Show us a miracle to prove you have the right to do these things.”
JHN.2.19	Jesus answered them, 
JHN.2.20	They answered, “It took forty-six years to build this Temple! Do you really believe you can build it again in three days?”
JHN.2.21	(But the temple Jesus meant was his own body. 
JHN.2.22	After Jesus was raised from the dead, his followers remembered that Jesus had said this. Then they believed the Scripture and the words Jesus had said.)
JHN.2.23	When Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Feast, many people believed in him because they saw the miracles he did. 
JHN.2.24	But Jesus did not believe in them because he knew them all. 
JHN.2.25	He did not need anyone to tell him about people, because he knew what was in people’s minds.
JHN.3.1	There was a man named Nicodemus who was one of the Pharisees and an important Jewish leader. 
JHN.3.2	One night Nicodemus came to Jesus and said, “Teacher, we know you are a teacher sent from God, because no one can do the miracles you do unless God is with him.”
JHN.3.3	Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.4	Nicodemus said, “But if a person is already old, how can he be born again? He cannot enter his mother’s womb again. So how can a person be born a second time?”
JHN.3.5	But Jesus answered, 
JHN.3.9	Nicodemus asked, “How can this happen?”
JHN.3.10	Jesus said, 
JHN.3.22	After this, Jesus and his followers went into the area of Judea, where he stayed with his followers and baptized people. 
JHN.3.23	John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People were going there to be baptized. 
JHN.3.24	(This was before John was put into prison.)
JHN.3.25	Some of John’s followers had an argument with a Jew about religious washing. 
JHN.3.26	So they came to John and said, “Teacher, remember the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River, the one you spoke about so much? He is baptizing, and everyone is going to him.”
JHN.3.27	John answered, “A man can get only what God gives him. 
JHN.3.28	You yourselves heard me say, ‘I am not the Christ, but I am the one sent to prepare the way for him.’ 
JHN.3.29	The bride belongs only to the bridegroom. But the friend who helps the bridegroom stands by and listens to him. He is thrilled that he gets to hear the bridegroom’s voice. In the same way, I am really happy. 
JHN.3.30	He must become greater, and I must become less important.
JHN.3.31	“The One who comes from above is greater than all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and talks about things on the earth. But the One who comes from heaven is greater than all. 
JHN.3.32	He tells what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts what he says. 
JHN.3.33	Whoever accepts what he says has proven that God is true. 
JHN.3.34	The One whom God sent speaks the words of God, because God gives him the Spirit fully. 
JHN.3.35	The Father loves the Son and has given him power over everything. 
JHN.3.36	Those who believe in the Son have eternal life, but those who do not obey the Son will never have life. God’s anger stays on them.”
JHN.4.1	The Pharisees heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more followers than John, 
JHN.4.2	although Jesus himself did not baptize people, but his followers did. 
JHN.4.3	Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard about him, so he left Judea and went back to Galilee. 
JHN.4.4	But on the way he had to go through the country of Samaria.
JHN.4.5	In Samaria Jesus came to the town called Sychar, which is near the field Jacob gave to his son Joseph. 
JHN.4.6	Jacob’s well was there. Jesus was tired from his long trip, so he sat down beside the well. It was about twelve o’clock noon. 
JHN.4.7	When a Samaritan woman came to the well to get some water, Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.8	(This happened while Jesus’ followers were in town buying some food.)
JHN.4.9	The woman said, “I am surprised that you ask me for a drink, since you are a Jewish man and I am a Samaritan woman.” (Jewish people are not friends with Samaritans.)
JHN.4.10	Jesus said, 
JHN.4.11	The woman said, “Sir, where will you get this living water? The well is very deep, and you have nothing to get water with. 
JHN.4.12	Are you greater than Jacob, our father, who gave us this well and drank from it himself along with his sons and flocks?”
JHN.4.13	Jesus answered, 
JHN.4.15	The woman said to him, “Sir, give me this water so I will never be thirsty again and will not have to come back here to get more water.”
JHN.4.16	Jesus told her, 
JHN.4.17	The woman answered, “I have no husband.”
JHN.4.17	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.4.19	The woman said, “Sir, I can see that you are a prophet. 
JHN.4.20	Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is the place where people must worship.”
JHN.4.21	Jesus said, 
JHN.4.25	The woman said, “I know that the Messiah is coming.” (Messiah is the One called Christ.) “When the Messiah comes, he will explain everything to us.”
JHN.4.26	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.4.27	Just then his followers came back from town and were surprised to see him talking with a woman. But none of them asked, “What do you want?” or “Why are you talking with her?”
JHN.4.28	Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She said to the people, 
JHN.4.29	“Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did. Do you think he might be the Christ?” 
JHN.4.30	So the people left the town and went to see Jesus.
JHN.4.31	Meanwhile, his followers were begging him, “Teacher, eat something.”
JHN.4.32	But Jesus answered, 
JHN.4.33	So the followers asked themselves, “Did somebody already bring him food?”
JHN.4.34	Jesus said, 
JHN.4.39	Many of the Samaritans in that town believed in Jesus because of what the woman said: “He told me everything I ever did.” 
JHN.4.40	When the Samaritans came to Jesus, they begged him to stay with them, so he stayed there two more days. 
JHN.4.41	And many more believed because of the things he said.
JHN.4.42	They said to the woman, “First we believed in Jesus because of what you said, but now we believe because we heard him ourselves. We know that this man really is the Savior of the world.”
JHN.4.43	Two days later, Jesus left and went to Galilee. 
JHN.4.44	(Jesus had said before that a prophet is not respected in his own country.) 
JHN.4.45	When Jesus arrived in Galilee, the people there welcomed him. They had seen all the things he did at the Passover Feast in Jerusalem, because they had been there, too.
JHN.4.46	Jesus went again to visit Cana in Galilee where he had changed the water into wine. One of the king’s important officers lived in the city of Capernaum, and his son was sick. 
JHN.4.47	When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to Jesus and begged him to come to Capernaum and heal his son, because his son was almost dead. 
JHN.4.48	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.4.49	The officer said, “Sir, come before my child dies.”
JHN.4.50	Jesus answered, 
JHN.4.50	The man believed what Jesus told him and went home. 
JHN.4.51	On the way the man’s servants came and met him and told him, “Your son is alive.”
JHN.4.52	The man asked, “What time did my son begin to get well?”
JHN.4.52	They answered, “Yesterday at one o’clock the fever left him.”
JHN.4.53	The father knew that one o’clock was the exact time that Jesus had said, 
JHN.4.54	That was the second miracle Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee.
JHN.5.1	Later Jesus went to Jerusalem for a special feast. 
JHN.5.2	In Jerusalem there is a pool with five covered porches, which is called Bethesda in the Hebrew language. This pool is near the Sheep Gate. 
JHN.5.3	Many sick people were lying on the porches beside the pool. Some were blind, some were crippled, and some were paralyzed [, and they waited for the water to move. 
JHN.5.4	Sometimes an angel of the Lord came down to the pool and stirred up the water. After the angel did this, the first person to go into the pool was healed from any sickness he had]. 
JHN.5.5	A man was lying there who had been sick for thirty-eight years. 
JHN.5.6	When Jesus saw the man and knew that he had been sick for such a long time, Jesus asked him, 
JHN.5.7	The sick man answered, “Sir, there is no one to help me get into the pool when the water starts moving. While I am coming to the water, someone else always gets in before me.”
JHN.5.8	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.5.9	And immediately the man was well; he picked up his mat and began to walk.
JHN.5.9	The day this happened was a Sabbath day. 
JHN.5.10	So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, “Today is the Sabbath. It is against our law for you to carry your mat on the Sabbath day.”
JHN.5.11	But he answered, “The man who made me well told me, 
JHN.5.12	Then they asked him, “Who is the man who told you to pick up your mat and walk?”
JHN.5.13	But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, because there were many people in that place, and Jesus had left.
JHN.5.14	Later, Jesus found the man at the Temple and said to him, 
JHN.5.15	Then the man left and told his people that Jesus was the one who had made him well.
JHN.5.16	Because Jesus was doing this on the Sabbath day, some evil people began to persecute him. 
JHN.5.17	But Jesus said to them, 
JHN.5.18	This made them try still harder to kill him. They said, “First Jesus was breaking the law about the Sabbath day. Now he says that God is his own Father, making himself equal with God!”
JHN.5.19	But Jesus said, 
JHN.6.1	After this, Jesus went across Lake Galilee (or, Lake Tiberias). 
JHN.6.2	Many people followed him because they saw the miracles he did to heal the sick. 
JHN.6.3	Jesus went up on a hill and sat down there with his followers. 
JHN.6.4	It was almost the time for the Jewish Passover Feast.
JHN.6.5	When Jesus looked up and saw a large crowd coming toward him, he said to Philip, 
JHN.6.6	(Jesus asked Philip this question to test him, because Jesus already knew what he planned to do.)
JHN.6.7	Philip answered, “Someone would have to work almost a year to buy enough bread for each person to have only a little piece.”
JHN.6.8	Another one of his followers, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said, 
JHN.6.9	“Here is a boy with five loaves of barley bread and two little fish, but that is not enough for so many people.”
JHN.6.10	Jesus said, 
JHN.6.11	Then Jesus took the loaves of bread, thanked God for them, and gave them to the people who were sitting there. He did the same with the fish, giving as much as the people wanted.
JHN.6.12	When they had all had enough to eat, Jesus said to his followers, 
JHN.6.13	So they gathered up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with the pieces left from the five barley loaves.
JHN.6.14	When the people saw this miracle that Jesus did, they said, “He must truly be the Prophet who is coming into the world.”
JHN.6.15	Jesus knew that the people planned to come and take him by force and make him their king, so he left and went into the hills alone.
JHN.6.16	That evening Jesus’ followers went down to Lake Galilee. 
JHN.6.17	It was dark now, and Jesus had not yet come to them. The followers got into a boat and started across the lake to Capernaum. 
JHN.6.18	By now a strong wind was blowing, and the waves on the lake were getting bigger. 
JHN.6.19	When they had rowed the boat about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the water, coming toward the boat. The followers were afraid, 
JHN.6.20	but Jesus said to them, 
JHN.6.21	Then they were glad to take him into the boat. At once the boat came to land at the place where they wanted to go.
JHN.6.22	The next day the people who had stayed on the other side of the lake knew that Jesus had not gone in the boat with his followers but that they had left without him. And they knew that only one boat had been there. 
JHN.6.23	But then some boats came from Tiberias and landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. 
JHN.6.24	When the people saw that Jesus and his followers were not there now, they got into boats and went to Capernaum to find Jesus.
JHN.6.25	When the people found Jesus on the other side of the lake, they asked him, “Teacher, when did you come here?”
JHN.6.26	Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.28	The people asked Jesus, “What are the things God wants us to do?”
JHN.6.29	Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.30	So the people asked, “What miracle will you do? If we see a miracle, we will believe you. What will you do? 
JHN.6.31	Our ancestors ate the manna in the desert. This is written in the Scriptures: ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ”
JHN.6.32	Jesus said, 
JHN.6.34	The people said, “Sir, give us this bread always.”
JHN.6.35	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.6.41	Some people began to complain about Jesus because he said, 
JHN.6.42	They said, “This is Jesus, the son of Joseph. We know his father and mother. How can he say, 
JHN.6.43	But Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.52	Then the evil people began to argue among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”
JHN.6.53	Jesus said, 
JHN.6.59	Jesus said all these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
JHN.6.60	When the followers of Jesus heard this, many of them said, “This teaching is hard. Who can accept it?”
JHN.6.61	Knowing that his followers were complaining about this, Jesus said, 
JHN.6.64	 (Jesus knew from the beginning who did not believe and who would turn against him.) 
JHN.6.65	Jesus said, 
JHN.6.66	After Jesus said this, many of his followers left him and stopped following him.
JHN.6.67	Jesus asked the twelve followers, 
JHN.6.68	Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, who would we go to? You have the words that give eternal life. 
JHN.6.69	We believe and know that you are the Holy One from God.”
JHN.6.70	Then Jesus answered, 
JHN.6.71	Jesus was talking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot. Judas was one of the twelve, but later he was going to turn against Jesus.
JHN.7.1	After this, Jesus traveled around Galilee. He did not want to travel in Judea, because some evil people there wanted to kill him. 
JHN.7.2	It was time for the Feast of Shelters. 
JHN.7.3	So Jesus’ brothers said to him, “You should leave here and go to Judea so your followers there can see the miracles you do. 
JHN.7.4	Anyone who wants to be well known does not hide what he does. If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.” 
JHN.7.5	(Even Jesus’ brothers did not believe in him.)
JHN.7.6	Jesus said to his brothers, 
JHN.7.9	After saying this, Jesus stayed in Galilee.
JHN.7.10	But after Jesus’ brothers had gone to the feast, Jesus went also. But he did not let people see him. 
JHN.7.11	At the feast some people were looking for him and saying, “Where is that man?”
JHN.7.12	Within the large crowd there, many people were whispering to each other about Jesus. Some said, “He is a good man.”
JHN.7.12	Others said, “No, he fools the people.” 
JHN.7.13	But no one was brave enough to talk about Jesus openly, because they were afraid of the elders.
JHN.7.14	When the feast was about half over, Jesus went to the Temple and began to teach. 
JHN.7.15	The people were amazed and said, “This man has never studied in school. How did he learn so much?”
JHN.7.16	Jesus answered, 
JHN.7.20	The people answered, “A demon has come into you. We are not trying to kill you.”
JHN.7.21	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.7.25	Then some of the people who lived in Jerusalem said, “This is the man they are trying to kill. 
JHN.7.26	But he is teaching where everyone can see and hear him, and no one is trying to stop him. Maybe the leaders have decided he really is the Christ. 
JHN.7.27	But we know where this man is from. Yet when the real Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”
JHN.7.28	Jesus, teaching in the Temple, cried out, 
JHN.7.30	When Jesus said this, they tried to seize him. But no one was able to touch him, because it was not yet the right time. 
JHN.7.31	But many of the people believed in Jesus. They said, “When the Christ comes, will he do more miracles than this man has done?”
JHN.7.32	The Pharisees heard the crowd whispering these things about Jesus. So the leading priests and the Pharisees sent some Temple guards to arrest him. 
JHN.7.33	Jesus said, 
JHN.7.35	Some people said to each other, “Where will this man go so we cannot find him? Will he go to the Greek cities where our people live and teach the Greek people there? 
JHN.7.36	What did he mean when he said, 
JHN.7.37	On the last and most important day of the feast Jesus stood up and said in a loud voice, 
JHN.7.39	Jesus was talking about the Holy Spirit. The Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus had not yet been raised to glory. But later, those who believed in Jesus would receive the Spirit.
JHN.7.40	When the people heard Jesus’ words, some of them said, “This man really is the Prophet.”
JHN.7.41	Others said, “He is the Christ.”
JHN.7.41	Still others said, “The Christ will not come from Galilee. 
JHN.7.42	The Scripture says that the Christ will come from David’s family and from Bethlehem, the town where David lived.” 
JHN.7.43	So the people did not agree with each other about Jesus. 
JHN.7.44	Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one was able to touch him.
JHN.7.45	The Temple guards went back to the leading priests and the Pharisees, who asked, “Why didn’t you bring Jesus?”
JHN.7.46	The guards answered, “The words he says are greater than the words of any other person who has ever spoken!”
JHN.7.47	The Pharisees answered, “So Jesus has fooled you also! 
JHN.7.48	Have any of the leaders or the Pharisees believed in him? No! 
JHN.7.49	But these people, who know nothing about the law, are under God’s curse.”
JHN.7.50	Nicodemus, who had gone to see Jesus before, was in that group. He said, 
JHN.7.51	“Our law does not judge a person without hearing him and knowing what he has done.”
JHN.7.52	They answered, “Are you from Galilee, too? Study the Scriptures, and you will learn that no prophet comes from Galilee.”
JHN.7.52	_____________________________
JHN.7.52	Some of the earliest surviving Greek copies do not contain 7:53—8:11.
JHN.7.52	[
JHN.7.53	And everyone left and went home.
JHN.8.1	Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. 
JHN.8.2	But early in the morning he went back to the Temple, and all the people came to him, and he sat and taught them. 
JHN.8.3	The teachers of the law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. They forced her to stand before the people. 
JHN.8.4	They said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught having sexual relations with a man who is not her husband. 
JHN.8.5	The law of Moses commands that we stone to death every woman who does this. What do you say we should do?” 
JHN.8.6	They were asking this to trick Jesus so that they could have some charge against him.
JHN.8.6	But Jesus bent over and started writing on the ground with his finger. 
JHN.8.7	When they continued to ask Jesus their question, he raised up and said, 
JHN.8.8	Then Jesus bent over again and wrote on the ground.
JHN.8.9	Those who heard Jesus began to leave one by one, first the older men and then the others. Jesus was left there alone with the woman standing before him. 
JHN.8.10	Jesus raised up again and asked her, 
JHN.8.11	She answered, “No one, sir.”
JHN.8.11	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.8.11	_____________________________
JHN.8.12	Later, Jesus talked to the people again, saying, 
JHN.8.13	The Pharisees said to Jesus, “When you talk about yourself, you are the only one to say these things are true. We cannot accept what you say.”
JHN.8.14	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.19	They asked, “Where is your father?”
JHN.8.19	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.20	Jesus said these things while he was teaching in the Temple, near where the money is kept. But no one arrested him, because the right time for him had not yet come.
JHN.8.21	Again, Jesus said to the people, 
JHN.8.22	So the Jews asked, “Will he kill himself? Is that why he said, 
JHN.8.23	Jesus said, 
JHN.8.25	They asked, “Then who are you?”
JHN.8.25	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.27	The people did not understand that he was talking to them about the Father. 
JHN.8.28	So Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.30	While Jesus was saying these things, many people believed in him.
JHN.8.31	So Jesus said to the Jews who believed in him, 
JHN.8.33	They answered, “We are Abraham’s children, and we have never been anyone’s slaves. So why do you say we will be free?”
JHN.8.34	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.39	They answered, “Our father is Abraham.”
JHN.8.39	Jesus said, 
JHN.8.41	But they said, “We are not like children who never knew who their father was. God is our Father; he is the only Father we have.”
JHN.8.42	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.8.48	They answered, “We say you are a Samaritan and have a demon in you. Are we not right?”
JHN.8.49	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.52	They said to Jesus, “Now we know that you have a demon in you! Even Abraham and the prophets died. But you say, 
JHN.8.53	Do you think you are greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died, too. Who do you think you are?”
JHN.8.54	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.57	They said to him, “You have never seen Abraham! You are not even fifty years old.”
JHN.8.58	Jesus answered, 
JHN.8.59	When Jesus said this, the people picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus hid himself, and then he left the Temple.
JHN.9.1	As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been born blind. 
JHN.9.2	His followers asked him, “Teacher, whose sin caused this man to be born blind—his own sin or his parents’ sin?”
JHN.9.3	Jesus answered, 
JHN.9.6	After Jesus said this, he spit on the ground and made some mud with it and put the mud on the man’s eyes. 
JHN.9.7	Then he told the man, 
JHN.9.8	The neighbors and some people who had earlier seen this man begging said, “Isn’t this the same man who used to sit and beg?”
JHN.9.9	Some said, “He is the one,” but others said, “No, he only looks like him.”
JHN.9.9	The man himself said, “I am the man.”
JHN.9.10	They asked, “How did you get your sight?”
JHN.9.11	He answered, “The man named Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes. Then he told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and then I could see.”
JHN.9.12	They asked him, “Where is this man?”
JHN.9.12	“I don’t know,” he answered.
JHN.9.13	Then the people took to the Pharisees the man who had been blind. 
JHN.9.14	The day Jesus had made mud and healed his eyes was a Sabbath day. 
JHN.9.15	So now the Pharisees asked the man, “How did you get your sight?”
JHN.9.15	He answered, “He put mud on my eyes, I washed, and now I see.”
JHN.9.16	So some of the Pharisees were saying, “This man does not keep the Sabbath day, so he is not from God.”
JHN.9.16	But others said, “A man who is a sinner can’t do miracles like these.” So they could not agree with each other.
JHN.9.17	They asked the man again, “What do you say about him since it was your eyes he opened?”
JHN.9.17	The man answered, “He is a prophet.”
JHN.9.18	These leaders did not believe that he had been blind and could now see again. So they sent for the man’s parents 
JHN.9.19	and asked them, “Is this your son who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?”
JHN.9.20	His parents answered, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind. 
JHN.9.21	But we don’t know how he can now see. We don’t know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself.” 
JHN.9.22	His parents said this because they were afraid of the elders, who had already decided that anyone who said Jesus was the Christ would be avoided. 
JHN.9.23	That is why his parents said, “He is old enough. Ask him.”
JHN.9.24	So for the second time, they called the man who had been blind. They said, “You should give God the glory by telling the truth. We know that this man is a sinner.”
JHN.9.25	He answered, “I don’t know if he is a sinner. One thing I do know: I was blind, and now I see.”
JHN.9.26	They asked, “What did he do to you? How did he make you see again?”
JHN.9.27	He answered, “I already told you, and you didn’t listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his followers, too?”
JHN.9.28	Then they insulted him and said, “You are his follower, but we are followers of Moses. 
JHN.9.29	We know that God spoke to Moses, but we don’t even know where this man comes from.”
JHN.9.30	The man answered, “This is a very strange thing. You don’t know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes. 
JHN.9.31	We all know that God does not listen to sinners, but he listens to anyone who worships and obeys him. 
JHN.9.32	Nobody has ever heard of anyone giving sight to a man born blind. 
JHN.9.33	If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.”
JHN.9.34	They answered, “You were born full of sin! Are you trying to teach us?” And they threw him out.
JHN.9.35	When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, Jesus found him and said, 
JHN.9.36	He asked, “Who is the Son of Man, sir, so that I can believe in him?”
JHN.9.37	Jesus said to him, 
JHN.9.38	He said, “Lord, I believe!” Then the man worshiped Jesus.
JHN.9.39	Jesus said, 
JHN.9.40	Some of the Pharisees who were nearby heard Jesus say this and asked, “Are you saying we are blind, too?”
JHN.9.41	Jesus said, 
JHN.10.1	Jesus said, 
JHN.10.6	Jesus told the people this story, but they did not understand what it meant.
JHN.10.7	So Jesus said again, 
JHN.10.19	Again the leaders did not agree with each other because of these words of Jesus. 
JHN.10.20	Many of them said, “A demon has come into him and made him crazy. Why listen to him?”
JHN.10.21	But others said, “A man who is crazy with a demon does not say things like this. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?”
JHN.10.22	The time came for the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, 
JHN.10.23	and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon’s Porch. 
JHN.10.24	Some people gathered around him and said, “How long will you make us wonder about you? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.”
JHN.10.25	Jesus answered, 
JHN.10.31	Again some of the people picked up stones to kill Jesus. 
JHN.10.32	But he said to them, 
JHN.10.33	They answered, “We are not killing you because of any good work you did, but because you speak against God. You are only a human, but you say you are the same as God!”
JHN.10.34	Jesus answered, 
JHN.10.39	They tried to take Jesus again, but he escaped from them.
JHN.10.40	Then he went back across the Jordan River to the place where John had first baptized. Jesus stayed there, 
JHN.10.41	and many people came to him and said, “John never did a miracle, but everything John said about this man is true.” 
JHN.10.42	And in that place many believed in Jesus.
JHN.11.1	A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in the town of Bethany, where Mary and her sister Martha lived. 
JHN.11.2	Mary was the woman who later put perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair. Mary’s brother was Lazarus, the man who was now sick. 
JHN.11.3	So Mary and Martha sent someone to tell Jesus, “Lord, the one you love is sick.”
JHN.11.4	When Jesus heard this, he said, 
JHN.11.5	Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus. 
JHN.11.6	But when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he stayed where he was for two more days. 
JHN.11.7	Then Jesus said to his followers, 
JHN.11.8	The followers said, “But Teacher, some people there tried to stone you to death only a short time ago. Now you want to go back there?”
JHN.11.9	Jesus answered, 
JHN.11.11	After Jesus said this, he added, 
JHN.11.12	The followers said, “But Lord, if he is only asleep, he will be all right.”
JHN.11.13	Jesus meant that Lazarus was dead, but his followers thought he meant Lazarus was really sleeping. 
JHN.11.14	So then Jesus said plainly, 
JHN.11.16	Then Thomas (the one called Didymus) said to the other followers, “Let us also go so that we can die with him.”
JHN.11.17	When Jesus arrived, he learned that Lazarus had already been dead and in the tomb for four days. 
JHN.11.18	Bethany was about two miles from Jerusalem. 
JHN.11.19	Many of the Jews had come there to comfort Martha and Mary about their brother.
JHN.11.20	When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary stayed home. 
JHN.11.21	Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. 
JHN.11.22	But I know that even now God will give you anything you ask.”
JHN.11.23	Jesus said, 
JHN.11.24	Martha answered, “I know that he will rise and live again in the resurrection on the last day.”
JHN.11.25	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.27	Martha answered, “Yes, Lord. I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, the One coming to the world.”
JHN.11.28	After Martha said this, she went back and talked to her sister Mary alone. Martha said, “The Teacher is here and he is asking for you.” 
JHN.11.29	When Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to Jesus. 
JHN.11.30	Jesus had not yet come into the town but was still at the place where Martha had met him. 
JHN.11.31	The Jews were with Mary in the house, comforting her. When they saw her stand and leave quickly, they followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to cry there.
JHN.11.32	But Mary went to the place where Jesus was. When she saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.”
JHN.11.33	When Jesus saw Mary crying and the Jews who came with her also crying, he was upset and was deeply troubled. 
JHN.11.34	He asked, 
JHN.11.34	“Come and see, Lord,” they said.
JHN.11.35	Jesus cried.
JHN.11.36	So the Jews said, “See how much he loved him.”
JHN.11.37	But some of them said, “If Jesus opened the eyes of the blind man, why couldn’t he keep Lazarus from dying?”
JHN.11.38	Again feeling very upset, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave with a large stone covering the entrance. 
JHN.11.39	Jesus said, 
JHN.11.39	Martha, the sister of the dead man, said, “But, Lord, it has been four days since he died. There will be a bad smell.”
JHN.11.40	Then Jesus said to her, 
JHN.11.41	So they moved the stone away from the entrance. Then Jesus looked up and said, 
JHN.11.43	After Jesus said this, he cried out in a loud voice, 
JHN.11.44	The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with pieces of cloth, and a cloth around his face.
JHN.11.44	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.11.45	Many of the people, who had come to visit Mary and saw what Jesus did, believed in him. 
JHN.11.46	But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. 
JHN.11.47	Then the leading priests and Pharisees called a meeting of the council. They asked, “What should we do? This man is doing many miracles. 
JHN.11.48	If we let him continue doing these things, everyone will believe in him. Then the Romans will come and take away our Temple and our nation.”
JHN.11.49	One of the men there was Caiaphas, the high priest that year. He said, “You people know nothing! 
JHN.11.50	You don’t realize that it is better for one man to die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed.”
JHN.11.51	Caiaphas did not think of this himself. As high priest that year, he was really prophesying that Jesus would die for their nation 
JHN.11.52	and for God’s scattered children to bring them all together and make them one.
JHN.11.53	That day they started planning to kill Jesus. 
JHN.11.54	So Jesus no longer traveled openly among the people. He left there and went to a place near the desert, to a town called Ephraim and stayed there with his followers.
JHN.11.55	It was almost time for the Passover Feast. Many from the country went up to Jerusalem before the Passover to do the special things to make themselves pure. 
JHN.11.56	The people looked for Jesus and stood in the Temple asking each other, “Is he coming to the Feast? What do you think?” 
JHN.11.57	But the leading priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where Jesus was, he must tell them. Then they could arrest him.
JHN.12.1	Six days before the Passover Feast, Jesus went to Bethany, where Lazarus lived. (Lazarus is the man Jesus raised from the dead.) 
JHN.12.2	There they had a dinner for Jesus. Martha served the food, and Lazarus was one of the people eating with Jesus. 
JHN.12.3	Mary brought in a pint of very expensive perfume made from pure nard. She poured the perfume on Jesus’ feet, and then she wiped his feet with her hair. And the sweet smell from the perfume filled the whole house.
JHN.12.4	Judas Iscariot, one of Jesus’ followers who would later turn against him, was there. Judas said, 
JHN.12.5	“This perfume was worth an entire year’s wages. Why wasn’t it sold and the money given to the poor?” 
JHN.12.6	But Judas did not really care about the poor; he said this because he was a thief. He was the one who kept the money box, and he often stole from it.
JHN.12.7	Jesus answered, 
JHN.12.9	A large crowd of people heard that Jesus was in Bethany. So they went there to see not only Jesus but Lazarus, whom Jesus raised from the dead. 
JHN.12.10	So the leading priests made plans to kill Lazarus, too. 
JHN.12.11	Because of Lazarus many of the Jews were leaving them and believing in Jesus.
JHN.12.12	The next day a great crowd who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast heard that Jesus was coming there. 
JHN.12.13	So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet Jesus, shouting,
JHN.12.13	“Praise God!
JHN.12.13	God bless the One who comes in the name of the Lord!
JHN.12.13	God bless the King of Israel!”
JHN.12.14	Jesus found a colt and sat on it. This was as the Scripture says,
JHN.12.15	“Don’t be afraid, people of Jerusalem!
JHN.12.15	Your king is coming,
JHN.12.15	sitting on the colt of a donkey.” 
JHN.12.16	The followers of Jesus did not understand this at first. But after Jesus was raised to glory, they remembered that this had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.
JHN.12.17	There had been many people with Jesus when he raised Lazarus from the dead and told him to come out of the tomb. Now they were telling others about what Jesus did. 
JHN.12.18	Many people went out to meet Jesus, because they had heard about this miracle. 
JHN.12.19	So the Pharisees said to each other, “You can see that nothing is going right for us. Look! The whole world is following him.”
JHN.12.20	There were some Greek people, too, who came to Jerusalem to worship at the Passover Feast. 
JHN.12.21	They went to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.” 
JHN.12.22	Philip told Andrew, and then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.
JHN.12.23	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.12.28	Then a voice came from heaven, “I have brought glory to it, and I will do it again.”
JHN.12.29	The crowd standing there, who heard the voice, said it was thunder.
JHN.12.29	But others said, “An angel has spoken to him.”
JHN.12.30	Jesus said, 
JHN.12.33	Jesus said this to show how he would die.
JHN.12.34	The crowd said, “We have heard from the law that the Christ will live forever. So why do you say, 
JHN.12.35	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.12.36	 When Jesus had said this, he left and hid himself from them.
JHN.12.37	Though Jesus had done many miracles in front of the people, they still did not believe in him. 
JHN.12.38	This was to bring about what Isaiah the prophet had said:
JHN.12.38	“Lord, who believed what we told them?
JHN.12.38	Who saw the Lord’s power in this?” 
JHN.12.39	This is why the people could not believe: Isaiah also had said,
JHN.12.40	“He has blinded their eyes,
JHN.12.40	and he has closed their minds.
JHN.12.40	Otherwise they would see with their eyes
JHN.12.40	and understand in their minds
JHN.12.40	and come back to me and be healed.”
JHN.12.41	Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus’ glory and spoke about him.
JHN.12.42	But many believed in Jesus, even many of the leaders. But because of the Pharisees, they did not say they believed in him for fear they would be put out of the synagogue. 
JHN.12.43	They loved praise from people more than praise from God.
JHN.12.44	Then Jesus cried out, 
JHN.13.1	It was almost time for the Passover Feast. Jesus knew that it was time for him to leave this world and go back to the Father. He had always loved those who were his own in the world, and he loved them all the way to the end.
JHN.13.2	Jesus and his followers were at the evening meal. The devil had already persuaded Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, to turn against Jesus. 
JHN.13.3	Jesus knew that the Father had given him power over everything and that he had come from God and was going back to God. 
JHN.13.4	So during the meal Jesus stood up and took off his outer clothing. Taking a towel, he wrapped it around his waist. 
JHN.13.5	Then he poured water into a bowl and began to wash the followers’ feet, drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him.
JHN.13.6	Jesus came to Simon Peter, who said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?”
JHN.13.7	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.8	Peter said, “No, you will never wash my feet.”
JHN.13.8	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.9	Simon Peter answered, “Lord, then wash not only my feet, but wash my hands and my head, too!”
JHN.13.10	Jesus said, 
JHN.13.11	Jesus knew who would turn against him, and that is why he said, 
JHN.13.12	When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and sat down again. He asked, 
JHN.13.21	After Jesus said this, he was very troubled. He said openly, 
JHN.13.22	The followers all looked at each other, because they did not know whom Jesus was talking about. 
JHN.13.23	One of the followers sitting next to Jesus was the follower Jesus loved. 
JHN.13.24	Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus whom he was talking about.
JHN.13.25	That follower leaned closer to Jesus and asked, “Lord, who is it?”
JHN.13.26	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.27	As soon as Judas took the bread, Satan entered him. Jesus said to him, 
JHN.13.28	No one at the table understood why Jesus said this to Judas. 
JHN.13.29	Since he was the one who kept the money box, some of the followers thought Jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast or to give something to the poor.
JHN.13.30	Judas took the bread Jesus gave him and immediately went out. It was night.
JHN.13.31	When Judas was gone, Jesus said, 
JHN.13.33	Jesus said, 
JHN.13.36	Simon Peter asked Jesus, “Lord, where are you going?”
JHN.13.36	Jesus answered, 
JHN.13.37	Peter asked, “Lord, why can’t I follow you now? I am ready to die for you!”
JHN.13.38	Jesus answered, 
JHN.14.1	Jesus said, 
JHN.14.5	Thomas said to Jesus, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going. So how can we know the way?”
JHN.14.6	Jesus answered, 
JHN.14.8	Philip said to him, “Lord, show us the Father. That is all we need.”
JHN.14.9	Jesus answered, 
JHN.14.22	Then Judas (not Judas Iscariot) said, “But, Lord, why do you plan to show yourself to us and not to the rest of the world?”
JHN.14.23	Jesus answered, 
JHN.16.17	Some of the followers said to each other, “What does Jesus mean when he says, 
JHN.16.18	They also asked, “What does he mean by 
JHN.16.19	Jesus saw that the followers wanted to ask him about this, so he said to them, 
JHN.16.29	Then the followers of Jesus said, “You are speaking clearly to us now and are not using stories that are hard to understand. 
JHN.16.30	We can see now that you know all things. You can answer a person’s question even before it is asked. This makes us believe you came from God.”
JHN.16.31	Jesus answered, 
JHN.17.1	After Jesus said these things, he looked toward heaven and prayed, 
JHN.18.1	When Jesus finished praying, he went with his followers across the Kidron Valley. On the other side there was a garden, and Jesus and his followers went into it.
JHN.18.2	Judas knew where this place was, because Jesus met there often with his followers. Judas was the one who turned against Jesus. 
JHN.18.3	So Judas came there with a group of soldiers and some guards from the leading priests and the Pharisees. They were carrying torches, lanterns, and weapons.
JHN.18.4	Knowing everything that would happen to him, Jesus went out and asked, 
JHN.18.5	They answered, “Jesus from Nazareth.”
JHN.18.5	 Jesus said. (Judas, the one who turned against Jesus, was standing there with them.) 
JHN.18.6	When Jesus said, 
JHN.18.7	Jesus asked them again, 
JHN.18.7	They said, “Jesus of Nazareth.”
JHN.18.8	 Jesus said. 
JHN.18.9	This happened so that the words Jesus said before would come true: 
JHN.18.10	Simon Peter, who had a sword, pulled it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear. (The servant’s name was Malchus.) 
JHN.18.11	Jesus said to Peter, 
JHN.18.12	Then the soldiers with their commander and the guards arrested Jesus. They tied him 
JHN.18.13	and led him first to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. 
JHN.18.14	Caiaphas was the one who told the Jews that it would be better if one man died for all the people.
JHN.18.15	Simon Peter and another one of Jesus’ followers went along after Jesus. This follower knew the high priest, so he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard. 
JHN.18.16	But Peter waited outside near the door. The follower who knew the high priest came back outside, spoke to the girl at the door, and brought Peter inside. 
JHN.18.17	The girl at the door said to Peter, “Aren’t you also one of that man’s followers?”
JHN.18.17	Peter answered, “No, I am not!”
JHN.18.18	It was cold, so the servants and guards had built a fire and were standing around it, warming themselves. Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.
JHN.18.19	The high priest asked Jesus questions about his followers and his teaching. 
JHN.18.20	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.22	When Jesus said this, one of the guards standing there hit him. The guard said, “Is that the way you answer the high priest?”
JHN.18.23	Jesus answered him, 
JHN.18.24	Then Annas sent Jesus, who was still tied, to Caiaphas the high priest.
JHN.18.25	As Simon Peter was standing and warming himself, they said to him, “Aren’t you one of that man’s followers?”
JHN.18.25	Peter said it was not true; he said, “No, I am not.”
JHN.18.26	One of the servants of the high priest was there. This servant was a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off. The servant said, “Didn’t I see you with him in the garden?”
JHN.18.27	Again Peter said it wasn’t true. At once a rooster crowed.
JHN.18.28	Early in the morning they led Jesus from Caiaphas’s house to the Roman governor’s palace. They would not go inside the palace, because they did not want to make themselves unclean; they wanted to eat the Passover meal. 
JHN.18.29	So Pilate went outside to them and asked, “What charges do you bring against this man?”
JHN.18.30	They answered, “If he were not a criminal, we wouldn’t have brought him to you.”
JHN.18.31	Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.”
JHN.18.31	“But we are not allowed to put anyone to death,” the Jews answered. 
JHN.18.32	(This happened so that what Jesus said about how he would die would come true.)
JHN.18.33	Then Pilate went back inside the palace and called Jesus to him and asked, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
JHN.18.34	Jesus said, 
JHN.18.35	Pilate answered, “I am not one of you. It was your own people and their leading priests who handed you over to me. What have you done wrong?”
JHN.18.36	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.37	Pilate said, “So you are a king!”
JHN.18.37	Jesus answered, 
JHN.18.38	Pilate said, “What is truth?” After he said this, he went out to the crowd again and said to them, “I find nothing against this man. 
JHN.18.39	But it is your custom that I free one prisoner to you at Passover time. Do you want me to free the ‘king of the Jews’?”
JHN.18.40	They shouted back, “No, not him! Let Barabbas go free!” (Barabbas was a robber.)
JHN.19.1	Then Pilate ordered that Jesus be taken away and whipped. 
JHN.19.2	The soldiers made a crown from some thorny branches and put it on Jesus’ head and put a purple robe around him. 
JHN.19.3	Then they came to him many times and said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and hit him in the face.
JHN.19.4	Again Pilate came out and said to them, “Look, I am bringing Jesus out to you. I want you to know that I find nothing against him.” 
JHN.19.5	So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, “Here is the man!”
JHN.19.6	When the leading priests and the guards saw Jesus, they shouted, “Crucify him! Crucify him!”
JHN.19.6	But Pilate answered, “Crucify him yourselves, because I find nothing against him.”
JHN.19.7	The leaders answered, “We have a law that says he should die, because he said he is the Son of God.”
JHN.19.8	When Pilate heard this, he was even more afraid. 
JHN.19.9	He went back inside the palace and asked Jesus, “Where do you come from?” But Jesus did not answer him. 
JHN.19.10	Pilate said, “You refuse to speak to me? Don’t you know I have power to set you free and power to have you crucified?”
JHN.19.11	Jesus answered, 
JHN.19.12	After this, Pilate tried to let Jesus go. But some in the crowd cried out, “Anyone who makes himself king is against Caesar. If you let this man go, you are no friend of Caesar.”
JHN.19.13	When Pilate heard what they were saying, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judge’s seat at the place called The Stone Pavement. (In the Hebrew language the name is Gabbatha.) 
JHN.19.14	It was about noon on Preparation Day of Passover week. Pilate said to the crowd, “Here is your king!”
JHN.19.15	They shouted, “Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!”
JHN.19.15	Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to crucify your king?”
JHN.19.15	The leading priests answered, “The only king we have is Caesar.”
JHN.19.16	So Pilate handed Jesus over to them to be crucified.
JHN.19.16	The soldiers took charge of Jesus. 
JHN.19.17	Carrying his own cross, Jesus went out to a place called The Place of the Skull, which in the Hebrew language is called Golgotha. 
JHN.19.18	There they crucified Jesus. They also crucified two other men, one on each side, with Jesus in the middle. 
JHN.19.19	Pilate wrote a sign and put it on the cross. It read: 
JHN.19.20	The sign was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. Many of the people read the sign, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. 
JHN.19.21	The leading priests said to Pilate, “Don’t write, ‘The King of the Jews.’ But write, ‘This man said, “I am the King of the Jews.” ’ ”
JHN.19.22	Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”
JHN.19.23	After the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, with each soldier getting one part. They also took his long shirt, which was all one piece of cloth, woven from top to bottom. 
JHN.19.24	So the soldiers said to each other, “We should not tear this into parts. Let’s throw lots to see who will get it.” This happened so that this Scripture would come true:
JHN.19.24	“They divided my clothes among them,
JHN.19.24	and they threw lots for my clothing.”
JHN.19.24	So the soldiers did this.
JHN.19.25	Standing near his cross were Jesus’ mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 
JHN.19.26	When Jesus saw his mother and the follower he loved standing nearby, he said to his mother, 
JHN.19.27	Then he said to the follower, 
JHN.19.28	After this, Jesus knew that everything had been done. So that the Scripture would come true, he said, 
JHN.19.29	There was a jar full of vinegar there, so the soldiers soaked a sponge in it, put the sponge on a branch of a hyssop plant, and lifted it to Jesus’ mouth. 
JHN.19.30	When Jesus tasted the vinegar, he said, 
JHN.19.31	This day was Preparation Day, and the next day was a special Sabbath day. Since the religious leaders did not want the bodies to stay on the cross on the Sabbath day, they asked Pilate to order that the legs of the men be broken and the bodies be taken away. 
JHN.19.32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man on the cross beside Jesus. Then they broke the legs of the man on the other cross beside Jesus. 
JHN.19.33	But when the soldiers came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 
JHN.19.34	But one of the soldiers stuck his spear into Jesus’ side, and at once blood and water came out. 
JHN.19.35	(The one who saw this happen is the one who told us this, and whatever he says is true. And he knows that he tells the truth, and he tells it so that you might believe.) 
JHN.19.36	These things happened to make the Scripture come true: “Not one of his bones will be broken.” 
JHN.19.37	And another Scripture says, “They will look at the one they stabbed.”
JHN.19.38	Later, Joseph from Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take the body of Jesus. (Joseph was a secret follower of Jesus, because he was afraid of some of the leaders.) Pilate gave his permission, so Joseph came and took Jesus’ body away. 
JHN.19.39	Nicodemus, who earlier had come to Jesus at night, went with Joseph. He brought about seventy-five pounds of myrrh and aloes. 
JHN.19.40	These two men took Jesus’ body and wrapped it with the spices in pieces of linen cloth, which is how they bury the dead. 
JHN.19.41	In the place where Jesus was crucified, there was a garden. In the garden was a new tomb that had never been used before. 
JHN.19.42	The men laid Jesus in that tomb because it was nearby, and they were preparing to start their Sabbath day.
JHN.20.1	Early on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb while it was still dark. When she saw that the large stone had been moved away from the tomb, 
JHN.20.2	she ran to Simon Peter and the follower whom Jesus loved. Mary said, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him.”
JHN.20.3	So Peter and the other follower started for the tomb. 
JHN.20.4	They were both running, but the other follower ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first. 
JHN.20.5	He bent down and looked in and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, but he did not go in. 
JHN.20.6	Then following him, Simon Peter arrived and went into the tomb and saw the strips of linen lying there. 
JHN.20.7	He also saw the cloth that had been around Jesus’ head, which was folded up and laid in a different place from the strips of linen. 
JHN.20.8	Then the other follower, who had reached the tomb first, also went in. He saw and believed. 
JHN.20.9	(They did not yet understand from the Scriptures that Jesus must rise from the dead.)
JHN.20.10	Then the followers went back home. 
JHN.20.11	But Mary stood outside the tomb, crying. As she was crying, she bent down and looked inside the tomb. 
JHN.20.12	She saw two angels dressed in white, sitting where Jesus’ body had been, one at the head and one at the feet.
JHN.20.13	They asked her, “Woman, why are you crying?”
JHN.20.13	She answered, “They have taken away my Lord, and I don’t know where they have put him.” 
JHN.20.14	When Mary said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know it was Jesus.
JHN.20.15	Jesus asked her, 
JHN.20.15	Thinking he was the gardener, she said to him, “Did you take him away, sir? Tell me where you put him, and I will get him.”
JHN.20.16	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.16	Mary turned toward Jesus and said in the Hebrew language, “Rabboni.” (This means “Teacher.”)
JHN.20.17	Jesus said to her, 
JHN.20.18	Mary Magdalene went and said to the followers, “I saw the Lord!” And she told them what Jesus had said to her.
JHN.20.19	When it was evening on the first day of the week, Jesus’ followers were together. The doors were locked, because they were afraid of the elders. Then Jesus came and stood right in the middle of them and said, 
JHN.20.20	After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. His followers were thrilled when they saw the Lord.
JHN.20.21	Then Jesus said again, 
JHN.20.22	After he said this, he breathed on them and said, 
JHN.20.24	Thomas (called Didymus), who was one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. 
JHN.20.25	The other followers kept telling Thomas, “We saw the Lord.”
JHN.20.25	But Thomas said, “I will not believe it until I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side.”
JHN.20.26	A week later the followers were in the house again, and Thomas was with them. The doors were locked, but Jesus came in and stood right in the middle of them. He said, 
JHN.20.27	Then he said to Thomas, 
JHN.20.28	Thomas said to him, “My Lord and my God!”
JHN.20.29	Then Jesus told him, 
JHN.20.30	Jesus did many other miracles in the presence of his followers that are not written in this book. 
JHN.20.31	But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. Then, by believing, you may have life through his name.
JHN.21.1	Later, Jesus showed himself to his followers again—this time at Lake Galilee. This is how he showed himself: 
JHN.21.2	Some of the followers were together: Simon Peter, Thomas (called Didymus), Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the two sons of Zebedee, and two other followers. 
JHN.21.3	Simon Peter said, “I am going out to fish.”
JHN.21.3	The others said, “We will go with you.” So they went out and got into the boat. They fished that night but caught nothing.
JHN.21.4	Early the next morning Jesus stood on the shore, but the followers did not know it was Jesus. 
JHN.21.5	Then he said to them, 
JHN.21.5	They answered, “No.”
JHN.21.6	He said, 
JHN.21.7	The follower whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Peter heard him say this, he wrapped his coat around himself. (Peter had taken his clothes off.) Then he jumped into the water. 
JHN.21.8	The other followers went to shore in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were not very far from shore, only about a hundred yards. 
JHN.21.9	When the followers stepped out of the boat and onto the shore, they saw a fire of hot coals. There were fish on the fire, and there was bread.
JHN.21.10	Then Jesus said, 
JHN.21.11	Simon Peter went into the boat and pulled the net to the shore. It was full of big fish, one hundred fifty-three in all, but even though there were so many, the net did not tear. 
JHN.21.12	Jesus said to them, 
JHN.21.13	Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, along with the fish.
JHN.21.14	This was now the third time Jesus showed himself to his followers after he was raised from the dead.
JHN.21.15	When they finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 
JHN.21.15	He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”
JHN.21.15	Jesus said, 
JHN.21.16	Again Jesus said, 
JHN.21.16	He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”
JHN.21.16	Jesus said, 
JHN.21.17	A third time he said, 
JHN.21.17	Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, 
JHN.21.17	He said to him, 
JHN.21.19	(Jesus said this to show how Peter would die to give glory to God.) Then Jesus said to Peter, 
JHN.21.20	Peter turned and saw that the follower Jesus loved was walking behind them. (This was the follower who had leaned against Jesus at the supper and had said, “Lord, who will turn against you?”) 
JHN.21.21	When Peter saw him behind them, he asked Jesus, “Lord, what about him?”
JHN.21.22	Jesus answered, 
JHN.21.23	So a story spread among the followers that this one would not die. But Jesus did not say he would not die. He only said, 
JHN.21.24	That follower is the one who is telling these things and who has now written them down. We know that what he says is true.
JHN.21.25	There are many other things Jesus did. If every one of them were written down, I suppose the whole world would not be big enough for all the books that would be written.
ACT.1.1	To Theophilus.
ACT.1.1	The first book I wrote was about everything Jesus began to do and teach 
ACT.1.2	until the day he was taken up into heaven. Before this, with the help of the Holy Spirit, Jesus told the apostles he had chosen what they should do. 
ACT.1.3	After his death, he showed himself to them and proved in many ways that he was alive. The apostles saw Jesus during the forty days after he was raised from the dead, and he spoke to them about the kingdom of God. 
ACT.1.4	Once when he was eating with them, he told them not to leave Jerusalem. He said, 
ACT.1.6	When the apostles were all together, they asked Jesus, “Lord, are you now going to give the kingdom back to Israel?”
ACT.1.7	Jesus said to them, 
ACT.1.9	After he said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud hid him from their sight. 
ACT.1.10	As he was going, they were looking into the sky. Suddenly, two men wearing white clothes stood beside them. 
ACT.1.11	They said, “Men of Galilee, why are you standing here looking into the sky? Jesus, whom you saw taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you saw him go.”
ACT.1.12	Then they went back to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives. (This mountain is about half a mile from Jerusalem.) 
ACT.1.13	When they entered the city, they went to the upstairs room where they were staying. Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Simon (known as the Zealot), and Judas son of James were there. 
ACT.1.14	They all continued praying together with some women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and Jesus’ brothers.
ACT.1.15	During this time there was a meeting of the believers (about one hundred twenty of them). Peter stood up and said, 
ACT.1.16+ACT.1.17	“Brothers and sisters, in the Scriptures the Holy Spirit said through David something that must happen involving Judas. He was one of our own group and served together with us. He led those who arrested Jesus.” 
ACT.1.18	(Judas bought a field with the money he got for his evil act. But he fell to his death, his body burst open, and all his intestines poured out. 
ACT.1.19	Everyone in Jerusalem learned about this so they named this place Akeldama. In their language Akeldama means “Field of Blood.”) 
ACT.1.20	“In the Book of Psalms,” Peter said, “this is written:
ACT.1.20	‘May his place be empty;
ACT.1.20	leave no one to live in it.’
ACT.1.20	And it is also written:
ACT.1.20	‘Let another man replace him as leader.’
ACT.1.21+ACT.1.22	“So now a man must become a witness with us of Jesus’ being raised from the dead. He must be one of the men who were part of our group during all the time the Lord Jesus was among us—from the time John was baptizing people until the day Jesus was taken up from us to heaven.”
ACT.1.23	They put the names of two men before the group. One was Joseph Barsabbas, who was also called Justus. The other was Matthias. 
ACT.1.24+ACT.1.25	The apostles prayed, “Lord, you know the thoughts of everyone. Show us which one of these two you have chosen to do this work. Show us who should be an apostle in place of Judas, who turned away and went where he belongs.” 
ACT.1.26	Then they used lots to choose between them, and the lots showed that Matthias was the one. So he became an apostle with the other eleven.
ACT.2.1	When the day of Pentecost came, they were all together in one place. 
ACT.2.2	Suddenly a noise like a strong, blowing wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting. 
ACT.2.3	They saw something like flames of fire that were separated and stood over each person there. 
ACT.2.4	They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak different languages by the power the Holy Spirit was giving them.
ACT.2.5	There were some religious Jews staying in Jerusalem who were from every country in the world. 
ACT.2.6	When they heard this noise, a crowd came together. They were all surprised, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. 
ACT.2.7	They were completely amazed at this. They said, “Look! Aren’t all these people that we hear speaking from Galilee? 
ACT.2.8	Then how is it possible that we each hear them in our own languages? We are from different places: 
ACT.2.9	Parthia, Media, Elam, Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia, 
ACT.2.10	Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the areas of Libya near Cyrene, Rome 
ACT.2.11	(both Jews and those who had become Jews), Crete, and Arabia. But we hear them telling in our own languages about the great things God has done!” 
ACT.2.12	They were all amazed and confused, asking each other, “What does this mean?”
ACT.2.13	But others were making fun of them, saying, “They have had too much wine.”
ACT.2.14	But Peter stood up with the eleven apostles, and in a loud voice he spoke to the crowd: “My fellow Jews, and all of you who are in Jerusalem, listen to me. Pay attention to what I have to say. 
ACT.2.15	These people are not drunk, as you think; it is only nine o’clock in the morning! 
ACT.2.16	But Joel the prophet wrote about what is happening here today:
ACT.2.17	‘God says: In the last days
ACT.2.17	I will pour out my Spirit on all kinds of people.
ACT.2.17	Your sons and daughters will prophesy.
ACT.2.17	Your young men will see visions,
ACT.2.17	and your old men will dream dreams.
ACT.2.18	At that time I will pour out my Spirit
ACT.2.18	also on my male slaves and female slaves,
ACT.2.18	and they will prophesy.
ACT.2.19	I will show miracles
ACT.2.19	in the sky and on the earth:
ACT.2.19	blood, fire, and thick smoke.
ACT.2.20	The sun will become dark,
ACT.2.20	the moon red as blood,
ACT.2.20	before the overwhelming and glorious day of the Lord will come.
ACT.2.21	Then anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved.’ 
ACT.2.22	“People of Israel, listen to these words: Jesus from Nazareth was a very special man. God clearly showed this to you by the miracles, wonders, and signs he did through Jesus. You all know this, because it happened right here among you. 
ACT.2.23	Jesus was given to you, and with the help of those who don’t know the law, you put him to death by nailing him to a cross. But this was God’s plan which he had made long ago; he knew all this would happen. 
ACT.2.24	God raised Jesus from the dead and set him free from the pain of death, because death could not hold him. 
ACT.2.25	For David said this about him:
ACT.2.25	‘I keep the Lord before me always.
ACT.2.25	Because he is close by my side,
ACT.2.25	I will not be hurt.
ACT.2.26	So I am glad, and I rejoice.
ACT.2.26	Even my body has hope,
ACT.2.27	because you will not leave me in the grave.
ACT.2.27	You will not let your Holy One rot.
ACT.2.28	You will teach me how to live a holy life.
ACT.2.28	Being with you will fill me with joy.’
ACT.2.29	“Brothers and sisters, I can tell you truly that David, our ancestor, died and was buried. His grave is still here with us today. 
ACT.2.30	He was a prophet and knew God had promised him that he would make a person from David’s family a king just as he was. 
ACT.2.31	Knowing this before it happened, David talked about the Christ rising from the dead. He said:
ACT.2.31	‘He was not left in the grave.
ACT.2.31	His body did not rot.’
ACT.2.32	So Jesus is the One whom God raised from the dead. And we are all witnesses to this. 
ACT.2.33	Jesus was lifted up to heaven and is now at God’s right side. The Father has given the Holy Spirit to Jesus as he promised. So Jesus has poured out that Spirit, and this is what you now see and hear. 
ACT.2.34	David was not the one who was lifted up to heaven, but he said:
ACT.2.34	‘The Lord said to my Lord,
ACT.2.34	“Sit by me at my right side,
ACT.2.35	until I put your enemies under your control.” ’
ACT.2.36	“So, all the people of Israel should know this truly: God has made Jesus —the man you nailed to the cross—both Lord and Christ.”
ACT.2.37	When the people heard this, they felt guilty and asked Peter and the other apostles, “What shall we do?”
ACT.2.38	Peter said to them, “Change your hearts and lives and be baptized, each one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.2.39	This promise is for you, for your children, and for all who are far away. It is for everyone the Lord our God calls to himself.”
ACT.2.40	Peter warned them with many other words. He begged them, “Save yourselves from the evil of today’s people!” 
ACT.2.41	Then those people who accepted what Peter said were baptized. About three thousand people were added to the number of believers that day. 
ACT.2.42	They spent their time learning the apostles’ teaching, sharing, breaking bread, and praying together.
ACT.2.43	The apostles were doing many miracles and signs, and everyone felt great respect for God. 
ACT.2.44	All the believers were together and shared everything. 
ACT.2.45	They would sell their land and the things they owned and then divide the money and give it to anyone who needed it. 
ACT.2.46	The believers met together in the Temple every day. They ate together in their homes, happy to share their food with joyful hearts. 
ACT.2.47	They praised God and were liked by all the people. Every day the Lord added those who were being saved to the group of believers.
ACT.3.1	One day Peter and John went to the Temple at three o’clock, the time set each day for the afternoon prayer service. 
ACT.3.2	There, at the Temple gate called Beautiful Gate, was a man who had been crippled all his life. Every day he was carried to this gate to beg for money from the people going into the Temple. 
ACT.3.3	The man saw Peter and John going into the Temple and asked them for money. 
ACT.3.4	Peter and John looked straight at him and said, “Look at us!” 
ACT.3.5	The man looked at them, thinking they were going to give him some money. 
ACT.3.6	But Peter said, “I don’t have any silver or gold, but I do have something else I can give you. By the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, stand up and walk!” 
ACT.3.7	Then Peter took the man’s right hand and lifted him up. Immediately the man’s feet and ankles became strong. 
ACT.3.8	He jumped up, stood on his feet, and began to walk. He went into the Temple with them, walking and jumping and praising God. 
ACT.3.9+ACT.3.10	All the people recognized him as the crippled man who always sat by the Beautiful Gate begging for money. Now they saw this same man walking and praising God, and they were amazed. They wondered how this could happen.
ACT.3.11	While the man was holding on to Peter and John, all the people were amazed and ran to them at Solomon’s Porch. 
ACT.3.12	When Peter saw this, he said to them, “People of Israel, why are you surprised? You are looking at us as if it were our own power or goodness that made this man walk. 
ACT.3.13	The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our ancestors, gave glory to Jesus, his servant. But you handed him over to be killed. Pilate decided to let him go free, but you told Pilate you did not want Jesus. 
ACT.3.14	You did not want the One who is holy and good but asked Pilate to give you a murderer instead. 
ACT.3.15	And so you killed the One who gives life, but God raised him from the dead. We are witnesses to this. 
ACT.3.16	It was faith in Jesus that made this crippled man well. You can see this man, and you know him. He was made completely well because of trust in Jesus, and you all saw it happen!
ACT.3.17	“Brothers and sisters, I know you did those things to Jesus because neither you nor your leaders understood what you were doing. 
ACT.3.18	God said through the prophets that his Christ would suffer and die. And now God has made these things come true in this way. 
ACT.3.19	So you must change your hearts and lives! Come back to God, and he will forgive your sins. Then the Lord will send the time of rest. 
ACT.3.20	And he will send Jesus, the One he chose to be the Christ. 
ACT.3.21	But Jesus must stay in heaven until the time comes when all things will be made right again. God told about this time long ago when he spoke through his holy prophets. 
ACT.3.22	Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will give you a prophet like me, who is one of your own people. You must listen to everything he tells you. 
ACT.3.23	Anyone who does not listen to that prophet will die, cut off from God’s people.’ 
ACT.3.24	Samuel, and all the other prophets who spoke for God after Samuel, told about this time now. 
ACT.3.25	You are descendants of the prophets. You have received the agreement God made with your ancestors. He said to your father Abraham, ‘Through your descendants all the nations on the earth will be blessed.’ 
ACT.3.26	God has raised up his servant Jesus and sent him to you first to bless you by turning each of you away from doing evil.”
ACT.4.1	While Peter and John were speaking to the people, priests, the captain of the soldiers that guarded the Temple, and Sadducees came up to them. 
ACT.4.2	They were upset because the two apostles were teaching the people and were preaching that people will rise from the dead through the power of Jesus. 
ACT.4.3	The older leaders grabbed Peter and John and put them in jail. Since it was already night, they kept them in jail until the next day. 
ACT.4.4	But many of those who had heard Peter and John preach believed the things they said. There were now about five thousand in the group of believers.
ACT.4.5	The next day the rulers, the elders, and the teachers of the law met in Jerusalem. 
ACT.4.6	Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander were there, as well as everyone from the high priest’s family. 
ACT.4.7	They made Peter and John stand before them and then asked them, “By what power or authority did you do this?”
ACT.4.8	Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers of the people and you elders, 
ACT.4.9	are you questioning us about a good thing that was done to a crippled man? Are you asking us who made him well? 
ACT.4.10	We want all of you and all the people to know that this man was made well by the power of Jesus Christ from Nazareth. You crucified him, but God raised him from the dead. This man was crippled, but he is now well and able to stand here before you because of the power of Jesus. 
ACT.4.11	Jesus is
ACT.4.11	‘the stone that you builders rejected,
ACT.4.11	which has become the cornerstone.’
ACT.4.12	Jesus is the only One who can save people. No one else in the world is able to save us.”
ACT.4.13	The leaders saw that Peter and John were not afraid to speak, and they understood that these men had no special training or education. So they were amazed. Then they realized that Peter and John had been with Jesus. 
ACT.4.14	Because they saw the healed man standing there beside the two apostles, they could say nothing against them. 
ACT.4.15	After the leaders ordered them to leave the meeting, they began to talk to each other. 
ACT.4.16	They said, “What shall we do with these men? Everyone in Jerusalem knows they have done a great miracle, and we cannot say it is not true. 
ACT.4.17	But to keep it from spreading among the people, we must warn them not to talk to people anymore using that name.”
ACT.4.18	So they called Peter and John in again and told them not to speak or to teach at all in the name of Jesus. 
ACT.4.19	But Peter and John answered them, “You decide what God would want. Should we obey you or God? 
ACT.4.20	We cannot keep quiet. We must speak about what we have seen and heard.” 
ACT.4.21	The leaders warned the apostles again and let them go free. They could not find a way to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had been done. 
ACT.4.22	The man who received the miracle of healing was more than forty years old.
ACT.4.23	After Peter and John left the meeting of leaders, they went to their own group and told them everything the leading priests and the elders had said to them. 
ACT.4.24	When the believers heard this, they prayed to God together, “Lord, you are the One who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything in them. 
ACT.4.25	By the Holy Spirit, through our father David your servant, you said:
ACT.4.25	‘Why are the nations so angry?
ACT.4.25	Why are the people making useless plans?
ACT.4.26	The kings of the earth prepare to fight,
ACT.4.26	and their leaders make plans together
ACT.4.26	against the Lord
ACT.4.26	and his Christ.’
ACT.4.27	These things really happened when Herod, Pontius Pilate, and some Jews and non-Jews all came together against Jesus here in Jerusalem. Jesus is your holy servant, the One you made to be the Christ. 
ACT.4.28	These people made your plan happen because of your power and your will. 
ACT.4.29	And now, Lord, listen to their threats. Lord, help us, your servants, to speak your word without fear. 
ACT.4.30	Show us your power to heal. Give proofs and make miracles happen by the power of Jesus, your holy servant.”
ACT.4.31	After they had prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken. They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke God’s word without fear.
ACT.4.32	The group of believers were united in their hearts and spirit. All those in the group acted as though their private property belonged to everyone in the group. In fact, they shared everything. 
ACT.4.33	With great power the apostles were telling people that the Lord Jesus was truly raised from the dead. And God blessed all the believers very much. 
ACT.4.34	There were no needy people among them. From time to time those who owned fields or houses sold them, brought the money, 
ACT.4.35	and gave it to the apostles. Then the money was given to anyone who needed it.
ACT.4.36	One of the believers was named Joseph, a Levite born in Cyprus. The apostles called him Barnabas (which means “one who encourages”). 
ACT.4.37	Joseph owned a field, sold it, brought the money, and gave it to the apostles.
ACT.5.1	But a man named Ananias and his wife Sapphira sold some land. 
ACT.5.2	He kept back part of the money for himself; his wife knew about this and agreed to it. But he brought the rest of the money and gave it to the apostles. 
ACT.5.3	Peter said, “Ananias, why did you let Satan rule your thoughts to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep for yourself part of the money you received for the land? 
ACT.5.4	Before you sold the land, it belonged to you. And even after you sold it, you could have used the money any way you wanted. Why did you think of doing this? You lied to God, not to us!” 
ACT.5.5+ACT.5.6	When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died. Some young men came in, wrapped up his body, carried it out, and buried it. And everyone who heard about this was filled with fear.
ACT.5.7	About three hours later his wife came in, but she did not know what had happened. 
ACT.5.8	Peter said to her, “Tell me, was the money you got for your field this much?”
ACT.5.8	Sapphira answered, “Yes, that was the price.”
ACT.5.9	Peter said to her, “Why did you and your husband agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.” 
ACT.5.10	At that moment Sapphira fell down by his feet and died. When the young men came in and saw that she was dead, they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 
ACT.5.11	The whole church and all the others who heard about these things were filled with fear.
ACT.5.12	The apostles did many signs and miracles among the people. And they would all meet together on Solomon’s Porch. 
ACT.5.13	None of the others dared to join them, but all the people respected them. 
ACT.5.14	More and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to the group of believers. 
ACT.5.15	The people placed their sick on beds and mats in the streets, hoping that when Peter passed by at least his shadow might fall on them. 
ACT.5.16	Crowds came from all the towns around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those who were bothered by evil spirits, and all of them were healed.
ACT.5.17	The high priest and all his friends (a group called the Sadducees) became very jealous. 
ACT.5.18	They took the apostles and put them in jail. 
ACT.5.19	But during the night, an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the jail and led the apostles outside. The angel said, 
ACT.5.20	“Go stand in the Temple and tell the people everything about this new life.” 
ACT.5.21	When the apostles heard this, they obeyed and went into the Temple early in the morning and continued teaching.
ACT.5.21	When the high priest and his friends arrived, they called a meeting of the leaders and all the important elders. They sent some men to the jail to bring the apostles to them. 
ACT.5.22	But, upon arriving, the officers could not find the apostles. So they went back and reported to the leaders. 
ACT.5.23	They said, “The jail was closed and locked, and the guards were standing at the doors. But when we opened the doors, the jail was empty!” 
ACT.5.24	Hearing this, the captain of the Temple guards and the leading priests were confused and wondered what was happening.
ACT.5.25	Then someone came and told them, “Listen! The men you put in jail are standing in the Temple teaching the people.” 
ACT.5.26	Then the captain and his men went out and brought the apostles back. But the soldiers did not use force, because they were afraid the people would stone them to death.
ACT.5.27	The soldiers brought the apostles to the meeting and made them stand before the leaders. The high priest questioned them, 
ACT.5.28	saying, “We gave you strict orders not to continue teaching in that name. But look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are trying to make us responsible for this man’s death.”
ACT.5.29	Peter and the other apostles answered, “We must obey God, not human authority! 
ACT.5.30	You killed Jesus by hanging him on a cross. But God, the God of our ancestors, raised Jesus up from the dead! 
ACT.5.31	Jesus is the One whom God raised to be on his right side, as Leader and Savior. Through him, all people could change their hearts and lives and have their sins forgiven. 
ACT.5.32	We saw all these things happen. The Holy Spirit, whom God has given to all who obey him, also proves these things are true.”
ACT.5.33	When the leaders heard this, they became angry and wanted to kill them. 
ACT.5.34	But a Pharisee named Gamaliel stood up in the meeting. He was a teacher of the law, and all the people respected him. He ordered the apostles to leave the meeting for a little while. 
ACT.5.35	Then he said, “People of Israel, be careful what you are planning to do to these men. 
ACT.5.36	Remember when Theudas appeared? He said he was a great man, and about four hundred men joined him. But he was killed, and all his followers were scattered; they were able to do nothing. 
ACT.5.37	Later, a man named Judas came from Galilee at the time of the registration. He also led a group of followers and was killed, and all his followers were scattered. 
ACT.5.38	And so now I tell you: Stay away from these men, and leave them alone. If their plan comes from human authority, it will fail. 
ACT.5.39	But if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them. You might even be fighting against God himself!”
ACT.5.39	The leaders agreed with what Gamaliel said. 
ACT.5.40	They called the apostles in, beat them, and told them not to speak in the name of Jesus again. Then they let them go free. 
ACT.5.41	The apostles left the meeting full of joy because they were given the honor of suffering disgrace for Jesus. 
ACT.5.42	Every day in the Temple and in people’s homes they continued teaching the people and telling the Good News—that Jesus is the Christ.
ACT.6.1	The number of followers was growing. But during this same time, the Greek-speaking followers had an argument with the other followers. The Greek-speaking widows were not getting their share of the food that was given out every day. 
ACT.6.2	The twelve apostles called the whole group of followers together and said, “It is not right for us to stop our work of teaching God’s word in order to serve tables. 
ACT.6.3	So, brothers and sisters, choose seven of your own men who are good, full of the Spirit and full of wisdom. We will put them in charge of this work. 
ACT.6.4	Then we can continue to pray and to teach the word of God.”
ACT.6.5	The whole group liked the idea, so they chose these seven men: Stephen (a man with great faith and full of the Holy Spirit), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas (a man from Antioch who had become a follower of the Jewish religion). 
ACT.6.6	Then they put these men before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.
ACT.6.7	The word of God was continuing to spread. The group of followers in Jerusalem increased, and a great number of the Jewish priests believed and obeyed.
ACT.6.8	Stephen was richly blessed by God who gave him the power to do great miracles and signs among the people. 
ACT.6.9	But some people were against him. They belonged to the synagogue of Free Men (as it was called), which included people from Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and Asia. They all came and argued with Stephen.
ACT.6.10	But the Spirit was helping him to speak with wisdom, and his words were so strong that they could not argue with him. 
ACT.6.11	So they secretly urged some men to say, “We heard Stephen speak against Moses and against God.”
ACT.6.12	This upset the people, the elders, and the teachers of the law. They came and grabbed Stephen and brought him to a meeting of the leaders. 
ACT.6.13	They brought in some people to tell lies about Stephen, saying, “This man is always speaking against this holy place and the law of Moses. 
ACT.6.14	We heard him say that Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and that Jesus will change the customs Moses gave us.” 
ACT.6.15	All the people in the meeting were watching Stephen closely and saw that his face looked like the face of an angel.
ACT.7.1	The high priest said to Stephen, “Are these things true?”
ACT.7.2	Stephen answered, “Brothers and fathers, listen to me. Our glorious God appeared to Abraham, our ancestor, in Mesopotamia before he lived in Haran. 
ACT.7.3	God said to Abraham, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and go to the land I will show you.’ 
ACT.7.4	So Abraham left the country of Chaldea and went to live in Haran. After Abraham’s father died, God sent him to this place where you now live. 
ACT.7.5	God did not give Abraham any of this land, not even a foot of it. But God promised that he would give this land to him and his descendants, even before Abraham had a child. 
ACT.7.6	This is what God said to him: ‘Your descendants will be strangers in a land they don’t own. The people there will make them slaves and will mistreat them for four hundred years. 
ACT.7.7	But I will punish the nation where they are slaves. Then your descendants will leave that land and will worship me in this place.’ 
ACT.7.8	God made an agreement with Abraham, the sign of which was circumcision. And so when Abraham had his son Isaac, Abraham circumcised him when he was eight days old. Isaac also circumcised his son Jacob, and Jacob did the same for his sons, the twelve ancestors of our people.
ACT.7.9	“Jacob’s sons became jealous of Joseph and sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God was with him 
ACT.7.10	and saved him from all his troubles. The king of Egypt liked Joseph and respected him because of the wisdom God gave him. The king made him governor of Egypt and put him in charge of all the people in his palace.
ACT.7.11	“Then all the land of Egypt and Canaan became so dry that nothing would grow, and the people suffered very much. Jacob’s sons, our ancestors, could not find anything to eat. 
ACT.7.12	But when Jacob heard there was grain in Egypt, he sent his sons there. This was their first trip to Egypt. 
ACT.7.13	When they went there a second time, Joseph told his brothers who he was, and the king learned about Joseph’s family. 
ACT.7.14	Then Joseph sent messengers to invite Jacob, his father, to come to Egypt along with all his relatives (seventy-five persons altogether). 
ACT.7.15	So Jacob went down to Egypt, where he and his sons died. 
ACT.7.16	Later their bodies were moved to Shechem and put in a grave there. (It was the same grave Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.)
ACT.7.17	“The promise God made to Abraham was soon to come true, and the number of people in Egypt grew large. 
ACT.7.18	Then a new king, who did not know who Joseph was, began to rule Egypt. 
ACT.7.19	This king tricked our people and was cruel to our ancestors, forcing them to leave their babies outside to die. 
ACT.7.20	At this time Moses was born, and he was very beautiful. For three months Moses was cared for in his father’s house. 
ACT.7.21	When they put Moses outside, the king’s daughter adopted him and raised him as if he were her own son. 
ACT.7.22	The Egyptians taught Moses everything they knew, and he was a powerful man in what he said and did.
ACT.7.23	“When Moses was about forty years old, he thought it would be good to visit his own people, the people of Israel. 
ACT.7.24	Moses saw an Egyptian mistreating one of his people, so he defended the Israelite and punished the Egyptian by killing him. 
ACT.7.25	Moses thought his own people would understand that God was using him to save them, but they did not. 
ACT.7.26	The next day when Moses saw two men of Israel fighting, he tried to make peace between them. He said, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why are you hurting each other?’ 
ACT.7.27	The man who was hurting the other pushed Moses away and said, ‘Who made you our ruler and judge? 
ACT.7.28	Are you going to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?’ 
ACT.7.29	When Moses heard him say this, he left Egypt and went to live in the land of Midian where he was a stranger. While Moses lived in Midian, he had two sons.
ACT.7.30	“Forty years later an angel appeared to Moses in the flames of a burning bush as he was in the desert near Mount Sinai. 
ACT.7.31	When Moses saw this, he was amazed and went near to look closer. Moses heard the Lord’s voice say, 
ACT.7.32	‘I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses began to shake with fear and was afraid to look. 
ACT.7.33	The Lord said to him, ‘Take off your sandals, because you are standing on holy ground. 
ACT.7.34	I have seen the troubles my people have suffered in Egypt. I have heard their cries and have come down to save them. And now, Moses, I am sending you back to Egypt.’
ACT.7.35	“This Moses was the same man the two men of Israel rejected, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge?’ Moses is the same man God sent to be a ruler and savior, with the help of the angel that Moses saw in the burning bush. 
ACT.7.36	So Moses led the people out of Egypt. He worked miracles and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and then in the desert for forty years. 
ACT.7.37	This is the same Moses that said to the people of Israel, ‘God will give you a prophet like me, who is one of your own people.’ 
ACT.7.38	This is the Moses who was with the gathering of the Israelites in the desert. He was with the angel that spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and he was with our ancestors. He received commands from God that give life, and he gave those commands to us.
ACT.7.39	“But our ancestors did not want to obey Moses. They rejected him and wanted to go back to Egypt. 
ACT.7.40	They said to Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will lead us. Moses led us out of Egypt, but we don’t know what has happened to him.’ 
ACT.7.41	So the people made an idol that looked like a calf. Then they brought sacrifices to it and were proud of what they had made with their own hands. 
ACT.7.42	But God turned against them and did not try to stop them from worshiping the sun, moon, and stars. This is what is written in the book of the prophets: God says,
ACT.7.42	‘People of Israel, you did not bring me sacrifices and offerings
ACT.7.42	while you traveled in the desert for forty years.
ACT.7.43	You have carried with you
ACT.7.43	the tent to worship Molech
ACT.7.43	and the idols of the star god Rephan that you made to worship.
ACT.7.43	So I will send you away beyond Babylon.’
ACT.7.44	“The Holy Tent where God spoke to our ancestors was with them in the desert. God told Moses how to make this Tent, and he made it like the plan God showed him. 
ACT.7.45	Later, Joshua led our ancestors to capture the lands of the other nations. Our people went in, and God forced the other people out. When our people went into this new land, they took with them this same Tent they had received from their ancestors. They kept it until the time of David, 
ACT.7.46	who pleased God and asked God to let him build a house for him, the God of Jacob. 
ACT.7.47	But Solomon was the one who built the Temple.
ACT.7.48	“But the Most High does not live in houses that people build with their hands. As the prophet says:
ACT.7.49	‘Heaven is my throne,
ACT.7.49	and the earth is my footstool.
ACT.7.49	So do you think you can build a house for me? says the Lord.
ACT.7.49	Do I need a place to rest?
ACT.7.50	Remember, my hand made all these things!’ ” 
ACT.7.51	Stephen continued speaking: “You stubborn people! You have not given your hearts to God, nor will you listen to him! You are always against what the Holy Spirit is trying to tell you, just as your ancestors were. 
ACT.7.52	Your ancestors tried to hurt every prophet who ever lived. Those prophets said long ago that the One who is good would come, but your ancestors killed them. And now you have turned against and killed the One who is good. 
ACT.7.53	You received the law of Moses, which God gave you through his angels, but you haven’t obeyed it.”
ACT.7.54	When the leaders heard this, they became furious. They were so mad they were grinding their teeth at Stephen. 
ACT.7.55	But Stephen was full of the Holy Spirit. He looked up to heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at God’s right side. 
ACT.7.56	He said, “Look! I see heaven open and the Son of Man standing at God’s right side.”
ACT.7.57	Then they shouted loudly and covered their ears and all ran at Stephen. 
ACT.7.58	They took him out of the city and began to throw stones at him to kill him. And those who told lies against Stephen left their coats with a young man named Saul. 
ACT.7.59	While they were throwing stones, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” 
ACT.7.60	He fell on his knees and cried in a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them.” After Stephen said this, he died.
ACT.8.1	Saul agreed that the killing of Stephen was good.
ACT.8.1	On that day the church of Jerusalem began to be persecuted, and all the believers, except the apostles, were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
ACT.8.2	And some religious people buried Stephen and cried loudly for him. 
ACT.8.3	Saul was also trying to destroy the church, going from house to house, dragging out men and women and putting them in jail. 
ACT.8.4	And wherever they were scattered, they told people the Good News.
ACT.8.5	Philip went to the city of Samaria and preached about the Christ. 
ACT.8.6	When the people there heard Philip and saw the miracles he was doing, they all listened carefully to what he said. 
ACT.8.7	Many of these people had evil spirits in them, but Philip made the evil spirits leave. The spirits made a loud noise when they came out. Philip also healed many weak and crippled people there. 
ACT.8.8	So the people in that city were very happy.
ACT.8.9	But there was a man named Simon in that city. Before Philip came there, Simon had practiced magic and amazed all the people of Samaria. He bragged and called himself a great man. 
ACT.8.10	All the people—the least important and the most important—paid attention to Simon, saying, “This man has the power of God, called ‘the Great Power’!” 
ACT.8.11	Simon had amazed them with his magic so long that the people became his followers. 
ACT.8.12	But when Philip told them the Good News about the kingdom of God and the power of Jesus Christ, men and women believed Philip and were baptized. 
ACT.8.13	Simon himself believed, and after he was baptized, he stayed very close to Philip. When he saw the miracles and the powerful things Philip did, Simon was amazed.
ACT.8.14	When the apostles who were still in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. 
ACT.8.15	When Peter and John arrived, they prayed that the Samaritan believers might receive the Holy Spirit. 
ACT.8.16	These people had been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, but the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them. 
ACT.8.17	Then, when the two apostles began laying their hands on the people, they received the Holy Spirit.
ACT.8.18	Simon saw that the Spirit was given to people when the apostles laid their hands on them. So he offered the apostles money, 
ACT.8.19	saying, “Give me also this power so that anyone on whom I lay my hands will receive the Holy Spirit.”
ACT.8.20	Peter said to him, “You and your money should both be destroyed, because you thought you could buy God’s gift with money. 
ACT.8.21	You cannot share with us in this work since your heart is not right before God. 
ACT.8.22	Change your heart! Turn away from this evil thing you have done, and pray to the Lord. Maybe he will forgive you for thinking this. 
ACT.8.23	I see that you are full of bitter jealousy and ruled by sin.”
ACT.8.24	Simon answered, “Both of you pray for me to the Lord so the things you have said will not happen to me.”
ACT.8.25	After Peter and John told the people what they had seen Jesus do and after they had spoken the message of the Lord, they went back to Jerusalem. On the way, they went through many Samaritan towns and preached the Good News to the people.
ACT.8.26	An angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get ready and go south to the road that leads down to Gaza from Jerusalem—the desert road.” 
ACT.8.27	So Philip got ready and went. On the road he saw a man from Ethiopia, a eunuch. He was an important officer in the service of Candace, the queen of the Ethiopians; he was responsible for taking care of all her money. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship. 
ACT.8.28	Now, as he was on his way home, he was sitting in his chariot reading from the Book of Isaiah, the prophet. 
ACT.8.29	The Spirit said to Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay near it.”
ACT.8.30	So when Philip ran toward the chariot, he heard the man reading from Isaiah the prophet. Philip asked, “Do you understand what you are reading?”
ACT.8.31	He answered, “How can I understand unless someone explains it to me?” Then he invited Philip to climb in and sit with him. 
ACT.8.32	The portion of Scripture he was reading was this:
ACT.8.32	“He was like a sheep being led to be killed.
ACT.8.32	He was quiet, as a lamb is quiet while its wool is being cut;
ACT.8.32	he never opened his mouth.
ACT.8.33	He was shamed and was treated unfairly.
ACT.8.33	He died without children to continue his family.
ACT.8.33	His life on earth has ended.”
ACT.8.34	The officer said to Philip, “Please tell me, who is the prophet talking about —himself or someone else?” 
ACT.8.35	Philip began to speak, and starting with this same Scripture, he told the man the Good News about Jesus.
ACT.8.36	While they were traveling down the road, they came to some water. The officer said, “Look, here is water. What is stopping me from being baptized?” [
ACT.8.37	Philip answered, “If you believe with all your heart, you can.” The officer said, “I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.”]   
ACT.8.38	Then the officer commanded the chariot to stop. Both Philip and the officer went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. 
ACT.8.39	When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away; the officer never saw him again. And the officer continued on his way home, full of joy. 
ACT.8.40	But Philip appeared in a city called Azotus and preached the Good News in all the towns on the way from Azotus to Caesarea.
ACT.9.1	In Jerusalem Saul was still threatening the followers of the Lord by saying he would kill them. So he went to the high priest 
ACT.9.2	and asked him to write letters to the synagogues in the city of Damascus. Then if Saul found any followers of Christ’s Way, men or women, he would arrest them and bring them back to Jerusalem.
ACT.9.3	So Saul headed toward Damascus. As he came near the city, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around him. 
ACT.9.4	Saul fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, 
ACT.9.5	Saul said, “Who are you, Lord?”
ACT.9.5	The voice answered, 
ACT.9.7	The people traveling with Saul stood there but said nothing. They heard the voice, but they saw no one. 
ACT.9.8	Saul got up from the ground and opened his eyes, but he could not see. So those with Saul took his hand and led him into Damascus. 
ACT.9.9	For three days Saul could not see and did not eat or drink.
ACT.9.10	There was a follower of Jesus in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord spoke to Ananias in a vision, 
ACT.9.10	Ananias answered, “Here I am, Lord.”
ACT.9.11	The Lord said to him, 
ACT.9.13	But Ananias answered, “Lord, many people have told me about this man and the terrible things he did to your holy people in Jerusalem. 
ACT.9.14	Now he has come here to Damascus, and the leading priests have given him the power to arrest everyone who worships you.”
ACT.9.15	But the Lord said to Ananias, 
ACT.9.17	So Ananias went to the house of Judas. He laid his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus sent me. He is the one you saw on the road on your way here. He sent me so that you can see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” 
ACT.9.18	Immediately, something that looked like fish scales fell from Saul’s eyes, and he was able to see again! Then Saul got up and was baptized. 
ACT.9.19	After he ate some food, his strength returned.
ACT.9.19	Saul stayed with the followers of Jesus in Damascus for a few days. 
ACT.9.20	Soon he began to preach about Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “Jesus is the Son of God.”
ACT.9.21	All the people who heard him were amazed. They said, “This is the man who was in Jerusalem trying to destroy those who trust in this name! He came here to arrest the followers of Jesus and take them back to the leading priests.”
ACT.9.22	But Saul grew more powerful. His proofs that Jesus is the Christ were so strong that his own people in Damascus could not argue with him.
ACT.9.23	After many days, they made plans to kill Saul. 
ACT.9.24	They were watching the city gates day and night, but Saul learned about their plan. 
ACT.9.25	One night some followers of Saul helped him leave the city by lowering him in a basket through an opening in the city wall.
ACT.9.26	When Saul went to Jerusalem, he tried to join the group of followers, but they were all afraid of him. They did not believe he was really a follower. 
ACT.9.27	But Barnabas accepted Saul and took him to the apostles. Barnabas explained to them that Saul had seen the Lord on the road and the Lord had spoken to Saul. Then he told them how boldly Saul had preached in the name of Jesus in Damascus.
ACT.9.28	And so Saul stayed with the followers, going everywhere in Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. 
ACT.9.29	He would often talk and argue with the Jewish people who spoke Greek, but they were trying to kill him. 
ACT.9.30	When the followers learned about this, they took Saul to Caesarea and from there sent him to Tarsus.
ACT.9.31	The church everywhere in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had a time of peace and became stronger. Respecting the Lord by the way they lived, and being encouraged by the Holy Spirit, the group of believers continued to grow.
ACT.9.32	As Peter was traveling through all the area, he visited God’s people who lived in Lydda. 
ACT.9.33	There he met a man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed and had not been able to leave his bed for the past eight years. 
ACT.9.34	Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you. Stand up and make your bed.” Aeneas stood up immediately. 
ACT.9.35	All the people living in Lydda and on the Plain of Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.
ACT.9.36	In the city of Joppa there was a follower named Tabitha (whose Greek name was Dorcas). She was always doing good deeds and kind acts. 
ACT.9.37	While Peter was in Lydda, Tabitha became sick and died. Her body was washed and put in a room upstairs. 
ACT.9.38	Since Lydda is near Joppa and the followers in Joppa heard that Peter was in Lydda, they sent two messengers to Peter. They begged him, “Hurry, please come to us!” 
ACT.9.39	So Peter got ready and went with them. When he arrived, they took him to the upstairs room where all the widows stood around Peter, crying. They showed him the shirts and coats Tabitha had made when she was still alive. 
ACT.9.40	Peter sent everyone out of the room and kneeled and prayed. Then he turned to the body and said, “Tabitha, stand up.” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. 
ACT.9.41	He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then he called the saints and the widows into the room and showed them that Tabitha was alive. 
ACT.9.42	People everywhere in Joppa learned about this, and many believed in the Lord. 
ACT.9.43	Peter stayed in Joppa for many days with a man named Simon who was a tanner.
ACT.10.1	At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, an officer in the Italian group of the Roman army. 
ACT.10.2	Cornelius was a religious man. He and all the other people who lived in his house worshiped the true God. He gave much of his money to the poor and prayed to God often. 
ACT.10.3	One afternoon about three o’clock, Cornelius clearly saw a vision. An angel of God came to him and said, “Cornelius!”
ACT.10.4	Cornelius stared at the angel. He became afraid and said, “What do you want, Lord?”
ACT.10.4	The angel said, “God has heard your prayers. He has seen that you give to the poor, and he remembers you. 
ACT.10.5	Send some men now to Joppa to bring back a man named Simon who is also called Peter. 
ACT.10.6	He is staying with a man, also named Simon, who is a tanner and has a house beside the sea.” 
ACT.10.7	When the angel who spoke to Cornelius left, Cornelius called two of his servants and a soldier, a religious man who worked for him. 
ACT.10.8	Cornelius explained everything to them and sent them to Joppa.
ACT.10.9	About noon the next day as they came near Joppa, Peter was going up to the roof to pray. 
ACT.10.10	He was hungry and wanted to eat, but while the food was being prepared, he had a vision. 
ACT.10.11	He saw heaven opened and something coming down that looked like a big sheet being lowered to earth by its four corners. 
ACT.10.12	In it were all kinds of animals, reptiles, and birds. 
ACT.10.13	Then a voice said to Peter, “Get up, Peter; kill and eat.”
ACT.10.14	But Peter said, “No, Lord! I have never eaten food that is unholy or unclean.”
ACT.10.15	But the voice said to him again, “God has made these things clean, so don’t call them unholy!” 
ACT.10.16	This happened three times, and at once the sheet was taken back to heaven.
ACT.10.17	While Peter was wondering what this vision meant, the men Cornelius sent had found Simon’s house and were standing at the gate. 
ACT.10.18	They asked, “Is Simon Peter staying here?”
ACT.10.19	While Peter was still thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Listen, three men are looking for you. 
ACT.10.20	Get up and go downstairs. Go with them without doubting, because I have sent them to you.”
ACT.10.21	So Peter went down to the men and said, “I am the one you are looking for. Why did you come here?”
ACT.10.22	They said, “A holy angel spoke to Cornelius, an army officer and a good man; he worships God. All the people respect him. The angel told Cornelius to ask you to come to his house so that he can hear what you have to say.” 
ACT.10.23	So Peter asked the men to come in and spend the night.
ACT.10.23	The next day Peter got ready and went with them, and some of the followers from Joppa joined him. 
ACT.10.24	On the following day they came to Caesarea. Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends. 
ACT.10.25	When Peter entered, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him. 
ACT.10.26	But Peter helped him up, saying, “Stand up. I too am only a human.” 
ACT.10.27	As he talked with Cornelius, Peter went inside where he saw many people gathered. 
ACT.10.28	He said, “You people understand that it is against our law for Jewish people to associate with or visit anyone who is not Jewish. But God has shown me that I should not call any person ‘unholy’ or ‘unclean.’ 
ACT.10.29	That is why I did not argue when I was asked to come here. Now, please tell me why you sent for me.”
ACT.10.30	Cornelius said, “Four days ago, I was praying in my house at this same time—three o’clock in the afternoon. Suddenly, there was a man standing before me wearing shining clothes. 
ACT.10.31	He said, ‘Cornelius, God has heard your prayer and has seen that you give to the poor and remembers you. 
ACT.10.32	So send some men to Joppa and ask Simon Peter to come. Peter is staying in the house of a man, also named Simon, who is a tanner and has a house beside the sea.’ 
ACT.10.33	So I sent for you immediately, and it was very good of you to come. Now we are all here before God to hear everything the Lord has commanded you to tell us.”
ACT.10.34	Peter began to speak: “I really understand now that to God every person is the same. 
ACT.10.35	In every country God accepts anyone who worships him and does what is right. 
ACT.10.36	You know the message that God has sent to the people of Israel is the Good News that peace has come through Jesus Christ. Jesus is the Lord of all people! 
ACT.10.37	You know what has happened all over Judea, beginning in Galilee after John preached to the people about baptism. 
ACT.10.38	You know about Jesus from Nazareth, that God gave him the Holy Spirit and power. You know how Jesus went everywhere doing good and healing those who were ruled by the devil, because God was with him. 
ACT.10.39	We saw what Jesus did in Judea and in Jerusalem, but the Jews in Jerusalem killed him by hanging him on a cross. 
ACT.10.40	Yet, on the third day, God raised Jesus to life and caused him to be seen, 
ACT.10.41	not by all the people, but only by the witnesses God had already chosen. And we are those witnesses who ate and drank with him after he was raised from the dead. 
ACT.10.42	He told us to preach to the people and to tell them that he is the one whom God chose to be the judge of the living and the dead. 
ACT.10.43	All the prophets say it is true that all who believe in Jesus will be forgiven of their sins through Jesus’ name.”
ACT.10.44	While Peter was still saying this, the Holy Spirit came down on all those who were listening. 
ACT.10.45	The Jewish believers who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been given even to the nations. 
ACT.10.46	These believers heard them speaking in different languages and praising God. Then Peter said, 
ACT.10.47	“Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we did!” 
ACT.10.48	So Peter ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days.
ACT.11.1	The apostles and the believers in Judea heard that some who were not Jewish had accepted God’s teaching too. 
ACT.11.2	But when Peter came to Jerusalem, some people argued with him. 
ACT.11.3	They said, “You went into the homes of people who are not circumcised and ate with them!”
ACT.11.4	So Peter explained the whole story to them. 
ACT.11.5	He said, “I was in the city of Joppa, and while I was praying, I had a vision. I saw something that looked like a big sheet being lowered from heaven by its four corners. It came very close to me. 
ACT.11.6	I looked inside it and saw animals, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds. 
ACT.11.7	I heard a voice say to me, ‘Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.’ 
ACT.11.8	But I said, ‘No, Lord! I have never eaten anything that is unholy or unclean.’ 
ACT.11.9	But the voice from heaven spoke again, ‘God has made these things clean, so don’t call them unholy.’ 
ACT.11.10	This happened three times. Then the whole thing was taken back to heaven. 
ACT.11.11	Right then three men who were sent to me from Caesarea came to the house where I was staying. 
ACT.11.12	The Spirit told me to go with them without doubting. These six believers here also went with me, and we entered the house of Cornelius. 
ACT.11.13	He told us about the angel he saw standing in his house. The angel said to him, ‘Send some men to Joppa and invite Simon Peter to come. 
ACT.11.14	By the words he will say to you, you and all your family will be saved.’ 
ACT.11.15	When I began my speech, the Holy Spirit came on them just as he came on us at the beginning. 
ACT.11.16	Then I remembered the words of the Lord. He said, 
ACT.11.17	Since God gave them the same gift he gave us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, how could I stop the work of God?”
ACT.11.18	When the believers heard this, they stopped arguing. They praised God and said, “So God is allowing even other nations to turn to him and live.”
ACT.11.19	Many of the believers were scattered when they were persecuted after Stephen was killed. Some of them went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch telling the message to others, but only to Jews. 
ACT.11.20	Some of these believers were people from Cyprus and Cyrene. When they came to Antioch, they spoke also to Greeks, telling them the Good News about the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.11.21	The Lord was helping the believers, and a large group of people believed and turned to the Lord.
ACT.11.22	The church in Jerusalem heard about all of this, so they sent Barnabas to Antioch. 
ACT.11.23+ACT.11.24	Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and full of faith. When he reached Antioch and saw how God had blessed the people, he was glad. He encouraged all the believers in Antioch always to obey the Lord with all their hearts, and many people became followers of the Lord.
ACT.11.25	Then Barnabas went to the city of Tarsus to look for Saul, 
ACT.11.26	and when he found Saul, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year Saul and Barnabas met with the church and taught many people there. In Antioch the followers were called Christians for the first time.
ACT.11.27	About that time some prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch. 
ACT.11.28	One of them, named Agabus, stood up and spoke with the help of the Holy Spirit. He said, “A very hard time is coming to the whole world. There will be no food to eat.” (This happened when Claudius ruled.) 
ACT.11.29	The followers all decided to help the believers who lived in Judea, as much as each one could. 
ACT.11.30	They gathered the money and gave it to Barnabas and Saul, who brought it to the elders in Judea.
ACT.12.1	During that same time King Herod began to mistreat some who belonged to the church. 
ACT.12.2	He ordered James, the brother of John, to be killed by the sword. 
ACT.12.3	Herod saw that some of the people liked this, so he decided to arrest Peter, too. (This happened during the time of the Feast of Unleavened Bread.)
ACT.12.4	After Herod arrested Peter, he put him in jail and handed him over to be guarded by sixteen soldiers. Herod planned to bring Peter before the people for trial after the Passover Feast. 
ACT.12.5	So Peter was kept in jail, but the church prayed earnestly to God for him.
ACT.12.6	The night before Herod was to bring him to trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains. Other soldiers were guarding the door of the jail. 
ACT.12.7	Suddenly, an angel of the Lord stood there, and a light shined in the cell. The angel struck Peter on the side and woke him up. “Hurry! Get up!” the angel said. And the chains fell off Peter’s hands. 
ACT.12.8	Then the angel told him, “Get dressed and put on your sandals.” And Peter did. Then the angel said, “Put on your coat and follow me.” 
ACT.12.9	So Peter followed him out, but he did not know if what the angel was doing was real; he thought he might be seeing a vision. 
ACT.12.10	They went past the first and second guards and came to the iron gate that separated them from the city. The gate opened by itself for them, and they went through it. When they had walked down one street, the angel suddenly left him.
ACT.12.11	Then Peter realized what had happened. He thought, “Now I know that the Lord really sent his angel to me. He rescued me from Herod and from all the things the people thought would happen.”
ACT.12.12	When he considered this, he went to the home of Mary, the mother of John Mark. Many people were gathered there, praying. 
ACT.12.13	Peter knocked on the outside door, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer it. 
ACT.12.14	When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so happy she forgot to open the door. Instead, she ran inside and told the group, “Peter is at the door!”
ACT.12.15	They said to her, “You are crazy!” But she kept on saying it was true, so they said, “It must be Peter’s angel.”
ACT.12.16	Peter continued to knock, and when they opened the door, they saw him and were amazed. 
ACT.12.17	Peter made a sign with his hand to tell them to be quiet. He explained how the Lord led him out of the jail, and he said, “Tell James and the other believers what happened.” Then he left to go to another place.
ACT.12.18	The next day the soldiers were very upset and wondered what had happened to Peter. 
ACT.12.19	Herod looked everywhere for him but could not find him. So he questioned the guards and ordered that they be killed.
ACT.12.19	Later Herod moved from Judea and went to the city of Caesarea, where he stayed. 
ACT.12.20	Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, but the people of those cities all came in a group to him. After convincing Blastus, the king’s personal servant, to be on their side, they asked Herod for peace, because their country got its food from his country.
ACT.12.21	On a chosen day Herod put on his royal robes, sat on his throne, and made a speech to the people. 
ACT.12.22	They shouted, “This is the voice of a god, not a human!” 
ACT.12.23	Because Herod did not give the glory to God, an angel of the Lord immediately caused him to become sick, and he was eaten by worms and died.
ACT.12.24	God’s message continued to spread and reach people.
ACT.12.25	After Barnabas and Saul finished their task in Jerusalem, they returned to Antioch, taking John Mark with them.
ACT.13.1	In the church at Antioch there were these prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon (also called Niger), Lucius (from the city of Cyrene), Manaen (who had grown up with Herod, the ruler), and Saul. 
ACT.13.2	They were all worshiping the Lord and fasting for a certain time. During this time the Holy Spirit said to them, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul to do a special work for which I have chosen them.”
ACT.13.3	So after they fasted and prayed, they laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul and sent them out.
ACT.13.4	Barnabas and Saul, sent out by the Holy Spirit, went to the city of Seleucia. From there they sailed to the island of Cyprus. 
ACT.13.5	When they came to Salamis, they preached the Good News of God in the synagogues. John Mark was with them to help.
ACT.13.6	They went across the whole island to Paphos where they met a magician named Bar-Jesus. He was a false prophet 
ACT.13.7	who always stayed close to Sergius Paulus, the governor and a smart man. He asked Barnabas and Saul to come to him, because he wanted to hear the message of God. 
ACT.13.8	But Elymas, the magician, was against them. (Elymas is the name for Bar-Jesus in the Greek language.) He tried to stop the governor from believing in Jesus. 
ACT.13.9	But Saul, who was also called Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit. He looked straight at Elymas 
ACT.13.10	and said, “You son of the devil! You are an enemy of everything that is right! You are full of evil tricks and lies, always trying to change the Lord’s truths into lies. 
ACT.13.11	Now the Lord will touch you, and you will be blind. For a time you will not be able to see anything—not even the light from the sun.”
ACT.13.11	Then everything became dark for Elymas, and he walked around, trying to find someone to lead him by the hand. 
ACT.13.12	When the governor saw this, he believed because he was amazed at the teaching about the Lord.
ACT.13.13	Paul and those with him sailed from Paphos and came to Perga, in Pamphylia. There John Mark left them to return to Jerusalem. 
ACT.13.14	They continued their trip from Perga and went to Antioch, a city in Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. 
ACT.13.15	After the law of Moses and the writings of the prophets were read, the leaders of the synagogue sent a message to Paul and Barnabas: “Brothers, if you have any message that will encourage the people, please speak.”
ACT.13.16	Paul stood up, raised his hand, and said, “You Israelites and you who worship God, please listen! 
ACT.13.17	The God of the Israelites chose our ancestors. He made the people great during the time they lived in Egypt, and he brought them out of that country with great power. 
ACT.13.18	And he was patient with them for forty years in the desert. 
ACT.13.19	God destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan and gave the land to his people. 
ACT.13.20	All this happened in about four hundred fifty years.
ACT.13.20	“After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. 
ACT.13.21	Then the people asked for a king, so God gave them Saul son of Kish. Saul was from the tribe of Benjamin and was king for forty years. 
ACT.13.22	After God took him away, God made David their king. God said about him: ‘I have found in David son of Jesse the kind of man I want. He will do all I want him to do.’ 
ACT.13.23	So God has brought Jesus, one of David’s descendants, to Israel to be its Savior, as he promised. 
ACT.13.24	Before Jesus came, John preached to all the people of Israel about a baptism of changed hearts and lives. 
ACT.13.25	When he was finishing his work, he said, ‘Who do you think I am? I am not the Christ. He is coming later, and I am not worthy to untie his sandals.’
ACT.13.26	“Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and others who worship God, listen! The news about this salvation has been sent to us. 
ACT.13.27	Those who live in Jerusalem and their leaders did not realize that Jesus was the Savior. They did not understand the words that the prophets wrote, which are read every Sabbath day. But they made them come true when they said Jesus was guilty. 
ACT.13.28	They could not find any real reason for Jesus to be put to death, but they asked Pilate to have him killed. 
ACT.13.29	When they had done to him all that the Scriptures had said, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. 
ACT.13.30	But God raised him up from the dead! 
ACT.13.31	After this, for many days, those who had gone with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem saw him. They are now his witnesses to the people. 
ACT.13.32	We tell you the Good News about the promise God made to our ancestors. 
ACT.13.33	God has made this promise come true for us, his children, by raising Jesus from the dead. We read about this also in Psalm 2:
ACT.13.33	‘You are my Son.
ACT.13.33	Today I have become your Father.’
ACT.13.34	God raised Jesus from the dead, and he will never go back to the grave and become dust. So God said:
ACT.13.34	‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings
ACT.13.34	that I promised to David.’
ACT.13.35	But in another place God says:
ACT.13.35	‘You will not let your Holy One rot.’
ACT.13.36	David did God’s will during his lifetime. Then he died and was buried beside his ancestors, and his body did rot in the grave. 
ACT.13.37	But the One God raised from the dead did not rot in the grave. 
ACT.13.38+ACT.13.39	Brothers, understand what we are telling you: You can have forgiveness of your sins through Jesus. The law of Moses could not free you from your sins. But through Jesus everyone who believes is free from all sins. 
ACT.13.40	Be careful! Don’t let what the prophets said happen to you:
ACT.13.41	‘Listen, you people who doubt!
ACT.13.41	You can wonder, and then die.
ACT.13.41	I will do something in your lifetime
ACT.13.41	that you won’t believe even when you are told about it!’ ”
ACT.13.42	While Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people asked them to tell them more about these things on the next Sabbath. 
ACT.13.43	When the meeting was over, many people with those who had changed to worship God followed Paul and Barnabas from that place. Paul and Barnabas were persuading them to continue trusting in God’s grace.
ACT.13.44	On the next Sabbath day, almost everyone in the city came to hear the word of the Lord. 
ACT.13.45	Seeing the crowd, the Jewish people became very jealous and said insulting things and argued against what Paul said. 
ACT.13.46	But Paul and Barnabas spoke very boldly, saying, “We must speak the message of God to you first. But you refuse to listen. You are judging yourselves not worthy of having eternal life! So we will now go to the people of other nations. 
ACT.13.47	This is what the Lord told us to do, saying:
ACT.13.47	‘I have made you a light for the nations;
ACT.13.47	you will show people all over the world the way to be saved.’ ”
ACT.13.48	When those who were not Jewish heard Paul say this, they were happy and gave honor to the message of the Lord. And the people who were chosen to have life forever believed the message.
ACT.13.49	So the message of the Lord was spreading through the whole country. 
ACT.13.50	But the Jewish people stirred up some of the important religious women and the leaders of the city. They started trouble against Paul and Barnabas and forced them out of their area. 
ACT.13.51	So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet and went to Iconium. 
ACT.13.52	But the followers were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.
ACT.14.1	In Iconium, Paul and Barnabas went as usual to the synagogue. They spoke so well that a great many Jews and Greeks believed. 
ACT.14.2	But some people who did not believe excited the others and turned them against the believers. 
ACT.14.3	Paul and Barnabas stayed in Iconium a long time and spoke bravely for the Lord. He showed that their message about his grace was true by giving them the power to work miracles and signs. 
ACT.14.4	But the city was divided. Some of the people agreed with the Jews, and others believed the apostles.
ACT.14.5	Some who were not Jews, some Jews, and some of their rulers wanted to mistreat Paul and Barnabas and to stone them to death. 
ACT.14.6	When Paul and Barnabas learned about this, they ran away to Lystra and Derbe, cities in Lycaonia, and to the areas around those cities. 
ACT.14.7	They announced the Good News there, too.
ACT.14.8	In Lystra there sat a man who had been born crippled; he had never walked. 
ACT.14.9	As this man was listening to Paul speak, Paul looked straight at him and saw that he believed God could heal him. 
ACT.14.10	So he cried out, “Stand up on your feet!” The man jumped up and began walking around. 
ACT.14.11	When the crowds saw what Paul did, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have become like humans and have come down to us!” 
ACT.14.12	Then the people began to call Barnabas “Zeus” and Paul “Hermes,” because he was the main speaker. 
ACT.14.13	The priest in the temple of Zeus, which was near the city, brought some bulls and flowers to the city gates. He and the people wanted to offer a sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas. 
ACT.14.14	But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard about it, they tore their clothes. They ran in among the people, shouting, 
ACT.14.15	“Friends, why are you doing these things? We are only human beings like you. We are bringing you the Good News and are telling you to turn away from these worthless things and turn to the living God. He is the One who made the sky, the earth, the sea, and everything in them. 
ACT.14.16	In the past, God let all the nations do what they wanted. 
ACT.14.17	Yet he proved he is real by showing kindness, by giving you rain from heaven and crops at the right times, by giving you food and filling your hearts with joy.” 
ACT.14.18	Even with these words, they were barely able to keep the crowd from offering sacrifices to them.
ACT.14.19	Then some evil people came from Antioch and Iconium and persuaded the people to turn against Paul. So they threw stones at him and dragged him out of town, thinking they had killed him. 
ACT.14.20	But the followers gathered around him, and he got up and went back into the town. The next day he and Barnabas left and went to the city of Derbe.
ACT.14.21	Paul and Barnabas told the Good News in Derbe, and many became followers. Paul and Barnabas returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch, 
ACT.14.22	making the followers of Jesus stronger and helping them stay in the faith. They said, “We must suffer many things to enter God’s kingdom.” 
ACT.14.23	They chose elders for each church, by praying and fasting for a certain time. These elders had trusted the Lord, so Paul and Barnabas put them in the Lord’s care.
ACT.14.24	Then they went through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. 
ACT.14.25	When they had preached the message in Perga, they went down to Attalia. 
ACT.14.26	And from there they sailed away to Antioch where the believers had put them into God’s care and had sent them out to do this work. Now they had finished.
ACT.14.27	When they arrived in Antioch, Paul and Barnabas gathered the church together. They told the church all about what God had done with them and how God had made it possible for those who were not Jewish to believe. 
ACT.14.28	And they stayed there a long time with the followers.
ACT.15.1	Then some people came to Antioch from Judea and began teaching the non-Jewish believers: “You cannot be saved if you are not circumcised as Moses taught us.” 
ACT.15.2	Paul and Barnabas were against this teaching and argued with them about it. So the church decided to send Paul, Barnabas, and some others to Jerusalem where they could talk more about this with the apostles and elders.
ACT.15.3	The church helped them leave on the trip, and they went through the countries of Phoenicia and Samaria, telling all about how the other nations had turned to God. This made all the believers very happy. 
ACT.15.4	When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the apostles, the elders, and the church. Paul, Barnabas, and the others told about everything God had done with them. 
ACT.15.5	But some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee group came forward and said, “The non-Jewish believers must be circumcised. They must be told to obey the law of Moses.”
ACT.15.6	The apostles and the elders gathered to consider this problem. 
ACT.15.7	After a long debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God chose me from among you to preach the Good News to the nations. They heard the Good News from me, and they believed. 
ACT.15.8	God, who knows the thoughts of everyone, accepted them. He showed this to us by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us. 
ACT.15.9	To God, those people are not different from us. When they believed, he made their hearts pure. 
ACT.15.10	So now why are you testing God by putting a heavy load around the necks of the non-Jewish believers? It is a load that neither we nor our ancestors were able to carry. 
ACT.15.11	But we believe that we and they too will be saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus.”
ACT.15.12	Then the whole group became quiet. They listened to Paul and Barnabas tell about all the miracles and signs that God did through them among the people. 
ACT.15.13	After they finished speaking, James said, “Brothers, listen to me. 
ACT.15.14	Simon has told us how God showed his love for those people. For the first time he is accepting from among them a people to be his own. 
ACT.15.15	The words of the prophets agree with this too:
ACT.15.16	‘After these things I will return.
ACT.15.16	The kingdom of David is like a fallen tent.
ACT.15.16	But I will rebuild its ruins,
ACT.15.16	and I will set it up.
ACT.15.17	Then those people who are left alive may ask the Lord for help,
ACT.15.17	and the other nations that belong to me,
ACT.15.17	says the Lord,
ACT.15.17	who will make it happen.
ACT.15.18	And these things have been known for a long time.’
ACT.15.19	“So I think we should not bother the other people who are turning to God. 
ACT.15.20	Instead, we should write a letter to them telling them these things: Stay away from food that has been offered to idols (which makes it unclean), any kind of sexual sin, eating animals that have been strangled, and blood. 
ACT.15.21	They should do these things, because for a long time in every city the law of Moses has been taught. And it is still read in the synagogue every Sabbath day.”
ACT.15.22	The apostles, the elders, and the whole church decided to send some of their men with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch. They chose Judas Barsabbas and Silas, who were respected by the believers. 
ACT.15.23	They sent the following letter with them:
ACT.15.23	From the apostles and elders, your brothers.
ACT.15.23	To all the non-Jewish believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia:
ACT.15.23	Greetings!
ACT.15.24	We have heard that some of our group have come to you and said things that trouble and upset you. But we did not tell them to do this. 
ACT.15.25	We have all agreed to choose some messengers and send them to you with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul— 
ACT.15.26	people who have given their lives to serve our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ACT.15.27	So we are sending Judas and Silas, who will tell you the same things. 
ACT.15.28	It has pleased the Holy Spirit that you should not have a heavy load to carry, and we agree. You need to do only these things: 
ACT.15.29	Stay away from any food that has been offered to idols, eating any animals that have been strangled, and blood, and any kind of sexual sin. If you stay away from these things, you will do well.
ACT.15.29	Good-bye.
ACT.15.30	So they left Jerusalem and went to Antioch where they gathered the church and gave them the letter. 
ACT.15.31	When they read it, they were very happy because of the encouraging message. 
ACT.15.32	Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, said many things to encourage the believers and make them stronger. 
ACT.15.33	After some time Judas and Silas were sent off in peace by the believers, and they went back to those who had sent them [, 
ACT.15.34	but Silas decided to remain there].
ACT.15.35	But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch and, along with many others, preached the Good News and taught the people the message of the Lord.
ACT.15.36	After some time, Paul said to Barnabas, “We should go back to all those towns where we preached the message of the Lord. Let’s visit the believers and see how they are doing.”
ACT.15.37	Barnabas wanted to take John Mark with them, 
ACT.15.38	but he had left them at Pamphylia; he did not continue with them in the work. So Paul did not think it was a good idea to take him. 
ACT.15.39	Paul and Barnabas had such a serious argument about this that they separated and went different ways. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus, 
ACT.15.40	but Paul chose Silas and left. The believers in Antioch put Paul into the Lord’s care, 
ACT.15.41	and he went through Syria and Cilicia, giving strength to the churches.
ACT.16.1	Paul came to Derbe and Lystra, where a follower named Timothy lived. Timothy’s mother was Jewish and a believer, but his father was a Greek.
ACT.16.2	The believers in Lystra and Iconium respected Timothy and said good things about him. 
ACT.16.3	Paul wanted Timothy to travel with him, but all the people living in that area knew that Timothy’s father was Greek. So Paul circumcised Timothy to please his mother’s people. 
ACT.16.4	Paul and those with him traveled from town to town and gave the decisions made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the people to obey. 
ACT.16.5	So the churches became stronger in the faith and grew larger every day.
ACT.16.6	Paul and those with him went through the areas of Phrygia and Galatia since the Holy Spirit did not let them preach the Good News in Asia. 
ACT.16.7	When they came near the country of Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them. 
ACT.16.8	So they passed by Mysia and went to Troas. 
ACT.16.9	That night Paul saw in a vision a man from Macedonia. The man stood and begged, “Come over to Macedonia and help us.” 
ACT.16.10	After Paul had seen the vision, we immediately prepared to leave for Macedonia, understanding that God had called us to tell the Good News to those people.
ACT.16.11	We left Troas and sailed straight to the island of Samothrace. The next day we sailed to Neapolis. 
ACT.16.12	Then we went by land to Philippi, a Roman colony and the leading city in that part of Macedonia. We stayed there for several days.
ACT.16.13	On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the river where we thought we would find a special place for prayer. Some women had gathered there, so we sat down and talked with them. 
ACT.16.14	One of the listeners was a woman named Lydia from the city of Thyatira whose job was selling purple cloth. She worshiped God, and he opened her mind to pay attention to what Paul was saying. 
ACT.16.15	She and all the people in her house were baptized. Then she invited us to her home, saying, “If you think I am truly a believer in the Lord, then come stay in my house.” And she persuaded us to stay with her.
ACT.16.16	Once, while we were going to the place for prayer, a servant girl met us. She had a special spirit in her, and she earned a lot of money for her owners by telling fortunes. 
ACT.16.17	This girl followed Paul and us, shouting, “These men are servants of the Most High God. They are telling you how you can be saved.”
ACT.16.18	She kept this up for many days. This bothered Paul, so he turned and said to the spirit, “By the power of Jesus Christ, I command you to come out of her!” Immediately, the spirit came out.
ACT.16.19	When the owners of the servant girl saw this, they knew that now they could not use her to make money. So they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the city rulers in the marketplace. 
ACT.16.20	They brought Paul and Silas to the Roman rulers and said, “These men are Jews and are making trouble in our city. 
ACT.16.21	They are teaching things that are not right for us as Romans to do.”
ACT.16.22	The crowd joined the attack against them. The Roman officers tore the clothes of Paul and Silas and had them beaten with rods. 
ACT.16.23	Then Paul and Silas were thrown into jail, and the jailer was ordered to guard them carefully. 
ACT.16.24	When he heard this order, he put them far inside the jail and pinned their feet down between large blocks of wood.
ACT.16.25	About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing songs to God as the other prisoners listened. 
ACT.16.26	Suddenly, there was a strong earthquake that shook the foundation of the jail. Then all the doors of the jail broke open, and all the prisoners were freed from their chains. 
ACT.16.27	The jailer woke up and saw that the jail doors were open. Thinking that the prisoners had already escaped, he got his sword and was about to kill himself. 
ACT.16.28	But Paul shouted, “Don’t hurt yourself! We are all here.”
ACT.16.29	The jailer told someone to bring a light. Then he ran inside and, shaking with fear, fell down before Paul and Silas. 
ACT.16.30	He brought them outside and said, “Men, what must I do to be saved?”
ACT.16.31	They said to him, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved—you and all the people in your house.” 
ACT.16.32	So Paul and Silas told the message of the Lord to the jailer and all the people in his house. 
ACT.16.33	At that hour of the night the jailer took Paul and Silas and washed their wounds. Then he and all his people were baptized immediately. 
ACT.16.34	After this the jailer took Paul and Silas home and gave them food. He and his family were very happy because they now believed in God.
ACT.16.35	The next morning, the Roman officers sent the police to tell the jailer, “Let these men go free.”
ACT.16.36	The jailer said to Paul, “The officers have sent an order to let you go free. You can leave now. Go in peace.”
ACT.16.37	But Paul said to the police, “They beat us in public without a trial, even though we are Roman citizens. And they threw us in jail. Now they want to make us go away quietly. No! Let them come themselves and bring us out.”
ACT.16.38	The police told the Roman officers what Paul said. When the officers heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens, they were afraid. 
ACT.16.39	So they came and told Paul and Silas they were sorry and took them out of jail and asked them to leave the city. 
ACT.16.40	So when they came out of the jail, they went to Lydia’s house where they saw some of the believers and encouraged them. Then they left.
ACT.17.1	Paul and Silas traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue. 
ACT.17.2	Paul went into the synagogue as he always did, and on each Sabbath day for three weeks, he talked with his fellow Jews about the Scriptures. 
ACT.17.3	He explained and proved that the Christ must die and then rise from the dead. He said, “This Jesus I am telling you about is the Christ.” 
ACT.17.4	Some of them were convinced and joined Paul and Silas, along with many of the Greeks who worshiped God and many of the important women.
ACT.17.5	But some others became jealous. So they got some evil men from the marketplace, formed a mob, and started a riot. They ran to Jason’s house, looking for Paul and Silas, wanting to bring them out to the people. 
ACT.17.6	But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some other believers to the leaders of the city. The people were yelling, “These people have made trouble everywhere in the world, and now they have come here too! 
ACT.17.7	Jason is keeping them in his house. All of them do things against the laws of Caesar, saying there is another king, called Jesus.”
ACT.17.8	When the people and the leaders of the city heard these things, they became very upset. 
ACT.17.9	They made Jason and the others put up a sum of money. Then they let the believers go free.
ACT.17.10	That same night the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea where they went to the synagogue. 
ACT.17.11	These people were more willing to listen than the people in Thessalonica. The Bereans were eager to hear what Paul and Silas said and studied the Scriptures every day to find out if these things were true. 
ACT.17.12	So, many of them believed, as well as many important Greek women and men. 
ACT.17.13	But the people in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God in Berea, too. So they came there, upsetting the people and making trouble. 
ACT.17.14	The believers quickly sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed in Berea. 
ACT.17.15	The people leading Paul went with him to Athens. Then they carried a message from Paul back to Silas and Timothy for them to come to him as soon as they could.
ACT.17.16	While Paul was waiting for Silas and Timothy in Athens, he was troubled because he saw that the city was full of idols. 
ACT.17.17	In the synagogue, he talked with the Jews and the Greeks who worshiped God. He also talked every day with people in the marketplace.
ACT.17.18	Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers argued with him, saying, “This man doesn’t know what he is talking about. What is he trying to say?” Others said, “He seems to be telling us about some other gods,” because Paul was telling them about Jesus and his rising from the dead. 
ACT.17.19	They got Paul and took him to a meeting of the Areopagus, where they said, “Please explain to us this new idea you have been teaching. 
ACT.17.20	The things you are saying are new to us, and we want to know what this teaching means.” 
ACT.17.21	(All the people of Athens and those from other countries who lived there always used their time to talk about the newest ideas.)
ACT.17.22	Then Paul stood before the meeting of the Areopagus and said, “People of Athens, I can see you are very religious in all things. 
ACT.17.23	As I was going through your city, I saw the objects you worship. I found an altar that had these words written on it: 
ACT.17.24	The God who made the whole world and everything in it is the Lord of the land and the sky. He does not live in temples built by human hands. 
ACT.17.25	This God is the One who gives life, breath, and everything else to people. He does not need any help from them; he has everything he needs. 
ACT.17.26	God began by making one person, and from him came all the different people who live everywhere in the world. God decided exactly when and where they must live. 
ACT.17.27	God wanted them to look for him and perhaps search all around for him and find him, though he is not far from any of us: 
ACT.17.28	‘By his power we live and move and exist.’ Some of your own poets have said: ‘For we are his children.’ 
ACT.17.29	Since we are God’s children, you must not think that God is like something that people imagine or make from gold, silver, or rock. 
ACT.17.30	In the past, people did not understand God, and he ignored this. But now, God tells all people in the world to change their hearts and lives. 
ACT.17.31	God has set a day that he will judge all the world with fairness, by the man he chose long ago. And God has proved this to everyone by raising that man from the dead!”
ACT.17.32	When the people heard about Jesus being raised from the dead, some of them laughed. But others said, “We will hear more about this from you later.” 
ACT.17.33	So Paul went away from them. 
ACT.17.34	But some of the people believed Paul and joined him. Among those who believed was Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and some others.
ACT.18.1	Later Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. 
ACT.18.2	Here he met a Jew named Aquila who had been born in the country of Pontus. But Aquila and his wife, Priscilla, had recently moved to Corinth from Italy, because Claudius commanded that all Jews must leave Rome. Paul went to visit Aquila and Priscilla. 
ACT.18.3	Because they were tentmakers, just as he was, he stayed with them and worked with them. 
ACT.18.4	Every Sabbath day he talked with the Jews and Greeks in the synagogue, trying to persuade them to believe in Jesus.
ACT.18.5	Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia and joined Paul in Corinth. After this, Paul spent all his time telling people the Good News, showing them that Jesus is the Christ. 
ACT.18.6	But they would not accept Paul’s teaching and said some evil things. So he shook off the dust from his clothes and said to them, “If you are not saved, it will be your own fault! I have done all I can do! After this, I will go to other nations.” 
ACT.18.7	Paul left the synagogue and moved into the home of Titius Justus, next to the synagogue. This man worshiped God. 
ACT.18.8	Crispus was the leader of that synagogue, and he and all the people living in his house believed in the Lord. Many others in Corinth also listened to Paul and believed and were baptized.
ACT.18.9	During the night, the Lord told Paul in a vision: 
ACT.18.11	Paul stayed there for a year and a half, teaching God’s word to the people.
ACT.18.12	When Gallio was the governor of the country of Southern Greece, some people came together against Paul and took him to the court. 
ACT.18.13	They said, “This man is teaching people to worship God in a way that is against our law.”
ACT.18.14	Paul was about to say something, but Gallio spoke, saying, “I would listen to you if you were complaining about a crime or some wrong. 
ACT.18.15	But the things you are saying are only questions about words and names—arguments about your own law. So you must solve this problem yourselves. I don’t want to be a judge of these things.” 
ACT.18.16	And Gallio made them leave the court.
ACT.18.17	Then they all grabbed Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and beat him there before the court. But this did not bother Gallio.
ACT.18.18	Paul stayed with the believers for many more days. Then he left and sailed for Syria, with Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchrea Paul cut off his hair, because he had made a promise to God. 
ACT.18.19	Then they went to Ephesus, where Paul left Priscilla and Aquila. While Paul was there, he went into the synagogue and talked with the people. 
ACT.18.20	When they asked him to stay with them longer, he refused. 
ACT.18.21	But as he left, he said, “I will come back to you again if God wants me to.” And so he sailed away from Ephesus.
ACT.18.22	When Paul landed at Caesarea, he went and gave greetings to the church in Jerusalem. After that, Paul went to Antioch. 
ACT.18.23	He stayed there for a while and then left and went through the regions of Galatia and Phrygia. He traveled from town to town in these regions, giving strength to all the followers.
ACT.18.24	A Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was born in the city of Alexandria and was a good speaker who knew the Scriptures well. 
ACT.18.25	He had been taught about the way of the Lord and was always very excited when he spoke and taught the truth about Jesus. But the only baptism Apollos knew about was the baptism that John taught. 
ACT.18.26	Apollos began to speak very boldly in the synagogue, and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him to their home and helped him better understand the way of God. 
ACT.18.27	Now Apollos wanted to go to the country of Southern Greece. So the believers helped him and wrote a letter to the followers there, asking them to accept him. These followers had believed in Jesus because of God’s grace, and when Apollos arrived, he helped them very much. 
ACT.18.28	He argued very strongly with the Jews before all the people, clearly proving with the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.
ACT.19.1	While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul was visiting some places on the way to Ephesus. There he found some followers 
ACT.19.2	and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”
ACT.19.2	They said, “We have never even heard of a Holy Spirit.”
ACT.19.3	So he asked, “What kind of baptism did you have?”
ACT.19.3	They said, “It was the baptism that John taught.”
ACT.19.4	Paul said, “John’s baptism was a baptism of changed hearts and lives. He told people to believe in the one who would come after him, and that one is Jesus.”
ACT.19.5	When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.6	Then Paul laid his hands on them, and the Holy Spirit came upon them. They began speaking different languages and prophesying. 
ACT.19.7	There were about twelve people in this group.
ACT.19.8	Paul went into the synagogue and spoke out boldly for three months. He talked with the people and persuaded them to accept the things he said about the kingdom of God. 
ACT.19.9	But some of them became stubborn. They refused to believe and said evil things about the Way of Jesus before all the people. So Paul left them, and taking the followers with him, he went to the school of a man named Tyrannus. There Paul talked with people every day 
ACT.19.10	for two years. Because of his work, every Jew and Greek in Asia heard the word of the Lord.
ACT.19.11	God used Paul to do some very special miracles. 
ACT.19.12	Some people took handkerchiefs and clothes that Paul had used and put them on the sick. When they did this, the sick were healed and evil spirits left them.
ACT.19.13	But some people also were traveling around and making evil spirits go out of people. They tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus to force the evil spirits out. They would say, “By the same Jesus that Paul talks about, I order you to come out!” 
ACT.19.14	Seven sons of Sceva, a leading priest, were doing this.
ACT.19.15	But one time an evil spirit said to them, “I know Jesus, and I know about Paul, but who are you?”
ACT.19.16	Then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them. Because he was so much stronger than all of them, they ran away from the house naked and hurt. 
ACT.19.17	All the people in Ephesus—Jews and Greeks—learned about this and were filled with fear and gave great honor to the Lord Jesus. 
ACT.19.18	Many of the believers began to confess openly and tell all the evil things they had done. 
ACT.19.19	Some of them who had used magic brought their magic books and burned them before everyone. Those books were worth about fifty thousand silver coins.
ACT.19.20	So in a powerful way the word of the Lord kept spreading and growing.
ACT.19.21	After these things, Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, planning to go through the countries of Macedonia and Southern Greece and then on to Jerusalem. He said, “After I have been to Jerusalem, I must also visit Rome.” 
ACT.19.22	Paul sent Timothy and Erastus, two of his helpers, ahead to Macedonia, but he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
ACT.19.23	And during that time, there was some serious trouble in Ephesus about the Way of Jesus. 
ACT.19.24	A man named Demetrius, who worked with silver, made little silver models that looked like the temple of the goddess Artemis. Those who did this work made much money. 
ACT.19.25	Demetrius had a meeting with them and some others who did the same kind of work. He told them, “Men, you know that we make a lot of money from our business. 
ACT.19.26	But look at what this man Paul is doing. He has convinced and turned away many people in Ephesus and in almost all of Asia! He says the gods made by human hands are not real. 
ACT.19.27	There is a danger that our business will lose its good name, but there is also another danger: People will begin to think that the temple of the great goddess Artemis is not important. Her greatness will be destroyed, and Artemis is the goddess that everyone in Asia and the whole world worships.”
ACT.19.28	When the others heard this, they became very angry and shouted, “Artemis, the goddess of Ephesus, is great!” 
ACT.19.29	The whole city became confused. The people grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, who were from Macedonia and were traveling with Paul, and ran to the theater. 
ACT.19.30	Paul wanted to go in and talk to the crowd, but the followers did not let him. 
ACT.19.31	Also, some leaders of Asia who were friends of Paul sent him a message, begging him not to go into the theater. 
ACT.19.32	Some people were shouting one thing, and some were shouting another. The meeting was completely confused; most of them did not know why they had come together. 
ACT.19.33	They put a man named Alexander in front of the people, and some of them told him what to do. Alexander waved his hand so he could explain things to the people. 
ACT.19.34	But when they saw that Alexander was a Jew, they all shouted the same thing for two hours: “Great is Artemis of Ephesus!”
ACT.19.35	Then the city clerk made the crowd be quiet. He said, “People of Ephesus, everyone knows that Ephesus is the city that keeps the temple of the great goddess Artemis and her holy stone that fell from heaven. 
ACT.19.36	Since no one can say this is not true, you should be quiet. Stop and think before you do anything. 
ACT.19.37	You brought these men here, but they have not said anything evil against our goddess or stolen anything from her temple. 
ACT.19.38	If Demetrius and those who work with him have a charge against anyone they should go to the courts and judges where they can argue with each other. 
ACT.19.39	If there is something else you want to talk about, it can be decided at the regular town meeting of the people. 
ACT.19.40	I say this because some people might see this trouble today and say that we are rioting. We could not explain this, because there is no real reason for this meeting.” 
ACT.19.41	After the city clerk said these things, he told the people to go home.
ACT.20.1	When the trouble stopped, Paul sent for the followers to come to him. After he encouraged them and then told them good-bye, he left and went to the country of Macedonia. 
ACT.20.2	He said many things to strengthen the followers in the different places on his way through Macedonia. Then he went to Greece, 
ACT.20.3	where he stayed for three months. He was ready to sail for Syria, but some evil people were planning something against him. So Paul decided to go back through Macedonia to Syria. 
ACT.20.4	The men who went with him were Sopater son of Pyrrhus, from the city of Berea; Aristarchus and Secundus, from the city of Thessalonica; Gaius, from Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus, two men from Asia. 
ACT.20.5	These men went on ahead and waited for us at Troas. 
ACT.20.6	We sailed from Philippi after the Feast of Unleavened Bread. Five days later we met them in Troas, where we stayed for seven days.
ACT.20.7	On the first day of the week, we all met together to break bread, and Paul spoke to the group. Because he was planning to leave the next day, he kept on talking until midnight. 
ACT.20.8	We were all together in a room upstairs, and there were many lamps in the room. 
ACT.20.9	A young man named Eutychus was sitting in the window. As Paul continued talking, Eutychus was falling into a deep sleep. Finally, he went sound asleep and fell to the ground from the third floor. When they picked him up, he was dead. 
ACT.20.10	Paul went down to Eutychus, knelt down, and put his arms around him. He said, “Don’t worry. He is alive now.” 
ACT.20.11	Then Paul went upstairs again, broke bread, and ate. He spoke to them a long time, until it was early morning, and then he left. 
ACT.20.12	They took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted.
ACT.20.13	We went on ahead of Paul and sailed for the city of Assos, where he wanted to join us on the ship. Paul planned it this way because he wanted to go to Assos by land. 
ACT.20.14	When he met us there, we took him aboard and went to Mitylene. 
ACT.20.15	We sailed from Mitylene and the next day came to a place near Kios. The following day we sailed to Samos, and the next day we reached Miletus. 
ACT.20.16	Paul had already decided not to stop at Ephesus, because he did not want to stay too long in Asia. He was hurrying to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, if that were possible.
ACT.20.17	Now from Miletus Paul sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church. 
ACT.20.18	When they came to him, he said, “You know about my life from the first day I came to Asia. You know the way I lived all the time I was with you. 
ACT.20.19	The evil people made plans against me, which troubled me very much. But you know I always served the Lord unselfishly, and I often cried. 
ACT.20.20	You know I preached to you and did not hold back anything that would help you. You know that I taught you in public and in your homes. 
ACT.20.21	I warned both Jews and Greeks to change their lives and turn to God and believe in our Lord Jesus. 
ACT.20.22	But now I must obey the Holy Spirit and go to Jerusalem. I don’t know what will happen to me there. 
ACT.20.23	I know only that in every city the Holy Spirit tells me that troubles and even jail wait for me. 
ACT.20.24	I don’t care about my own life. The most important thing is that I complete my mission, the work that the Lord Jesus gave me—to tell people the Good News about God’s grace.
ACT.20.25	“And now, I know that none of you among whom I was preaching the kingdom of God will ever see me again. 
ACT.20.26	So today I tell you that if any of you should be lost, I am not responsible, 
ACT.20.27	because I have told you everything God wants you to know. 
ACT.20.28	Be careful for yourselves and for all the people the Holy Spirit has given to you to oversee. You must be like shepherds to the church of God, which he bought with the death of his own son. 
ACT.20.29	I know that after I leave, some people will come like wild wolves and try to destroy the flock. 
ACT.20.30	Also, some from your own group will rise up and twist the truth and will lead away followers after them. 
ACT.20.31	So be careful! Always remember that for three years, day and night, I never stopped warning each of you, and I often cried over you.
ACT.20.32	“Now I am putting you in the care of God and the message about his grace. It is able to give you strength, and it will give you the blessings God has for all his holy people. 
ACT.20.33	When I was with you, I never wanted anyone’s money or fine clothes. 
ACT.20.34	You know I always worked to take care of my own needs and the needs of those who were with me. 
ACT.20.35	I showed you in all things that you should work as I did and help the weak. I taught you to remember the words Jesus said: 
ACT.20.36	When Paul had said this, he knelt down with all of them and prayed. 
ACT.20.37+ACT.20.38	And they all cried because Paul had said they would never see him again. They put their arms around him and kissed him. Then they went with him to the ship.
ACT.21.1	After we all said good-bye to them, we sailed straight to the island of Cos. The next day we reached Rhodes, and from there we went to Patara. 
ACT.21.2	There we found a ship going to Phoenicia, so we went aboard and sailed away. 
ACT.21.3	We sailed near the island of Cyprus, seeing it to the north, but we sailed on to Syria. We stopped at Tyre because the ship needed to unload its cargo there. 
ACT.21.4	We found some followers in Tyre and stayed with them for seven days. Through the Holy Spirit they warned Paul not to go to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.5	When we finished our visit, we left and continued our trip. All the followers, even the women and children, came outside the city with us. After we all knelt on the beach and prayed, 
ACT.21.6	we said good-bye and got on the ship, and the followers went back home.
ACT.21.7	We continued our trip from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais, where we greeted the believers and stayed with them for a day. 
ACT.21.8	The next day we left Ptolemais and went to the city of Caesarea. There we went into the home of Philip the preacher, one of the seven helpers, and stayed with him. 
ACT.21.9	He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophesying. 
ACT.21.10	After we had been there for some time, a prophet named Agabus arrived from Judea. 
ACT.21.11	He came to us and borrowed Paul’s belt and used it to tie his own hands and feet. He said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘This is how evil people in Jerusalem will tie up the man who wears this belt. Then they will give him to the older leaders.’ ”
ACT.21.12	When we all heard this, we and the people there begged Paul not to go to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.13	But he said, “Why are you crying and making me so sad? I am not only ready to be tied up in Jerusalem, I am ready to die for the Lord Jesus!”
ACT.21.14	We could not persuade him to stay away from Jerusalem. So we stopped begging him and said, “We pray that what the Lord wants will be done.”
ACT.21.15	After this, we got ready and started on our way to Jerusalem. 
ACT.21.16	Some of the followers from Caesarea went with us and took us to the home of Mnason, where we would stay. He was from Cyprus and was one of the first followers.
ACT.21.17	In Jerusalem the believers were glad to see us. 
ACT.21.18	The next day Paul went with us to visit James, and all the elders were there. 
ACT.21.19	Paul greeted them and told them everything God had done among the other nations through him. 
ACT.21.20	When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to Paul, “Brother, you can see that many thousands of our people have become believers. And they think it is very important to obey the law of Moses. 
ACT.21.21	They have heard about your teaching, that you tell our people who live among the nations to leave the law of Moses. They have heard that you tell them not to circumcise their children and not to obey customs. 
ACT.21.22	What should we do? They will learn that you have come. 
ACT.21.23	So we will tell you what to do: Four of our men have made a promise to God. 
ACT.21.24	Take these men with you and share in their cleansing ceremony. Pay their expenses so they can shave their heads. Then it will prove to everyone that what they have heard about you is not true and that you follow the law of Moses in your own life. 
ACT.21.25	We have already sent a letter to the non-Jewish believers. The letter said: ‘Do not eat food that has been offered to idols, or blood, or animals that have been strangled. Do not take part in sexual sin.’ ”
ACT.21.26	The next day Paul took the four men and shared in the cleansing ceremony with them. Then he went to the Temple and announced the time when the days of the cleansing ceremony would be finished. On the last day an offering would be given for each of the men.
ACT.21.27	When the seven days were almost over, some of his people from Asia saw Paul at the Temple. They caused all the people to be upset and grabbed Paul. 
ACT.21.28	They shouted, “People of Israel, help us! This is the man who goes everywhere teaching against the law of Moses, against our people, and against this Temple. Now he has brought some Greeks into the Temple and has made this holy place unclean!” 
ACT.21.29	(They said this because they had seen Trophimus, a man from Ephesus, with Paul in Jerusalem. They thought that Paul had brought him into the Temple.)
ACT.21.30	All the people in Jerusalem became upset. Together they ran, took Paul, and dragged him out of the Temple. The Temple doors were closed immediately. 
ACT.21.31	While they were trying to kill Paul, the commander of the Roman army in Jerusalem learned that there was trouble in the whole city. 
ACT.21.32	Immediately he took some officers and soldiers and ran to the place where the crowd was gathered. When the people saw them, they stopped beating Paul. 
ACT.21.33	The commander went to Paul and arrested him. He told his soldiers to tie Paul with two chains. Then he asked who he was and what he had done wrong. 
ACT.21.34	Some in the crowd were yelling one thing, and some were yelling another. Because of all this confusion and shouting, the commander could not learn what had happened. So he ordered the soldiers to take Paul to the army building. 
ACT.21.35	When Paul came to the steps, the soldiers had to carry him because the people were ready to hurt him. 
ACT.21.36	The whole mob was following them, shouting, “Kill him!”
ACT.21.37	As the soldiers were about to take Paul into the army building, he spoke to the commander, “May I say something to you?”
ACT.21.37	The commander said, “Do you speak Greek? 
ACT.21.38	I thought you were the Egyptian who started some trouble against the government not long ago and led four thousand killers out to the desert.”
ACT.21.39	Paul said, “No, I am a Jew from Tarsus in the country of Cilicia. I am a citizen of that important city. Please, let me speak to the people.”
ACT.21.40	The commander gave permission, so Paul stood on the steps and waved his hand to quiet the people. When there was silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language.
ACT.22.1	Paul said, “Brothers and fathers, listen to my defense to you.” 
ACT.22.2	When they heard him speaking the Hebrew language, they became very quiet. Paul said, 
ACT.22.3	“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in the country of Cilicia, but I grew up in this city. I was a student of Gamaliel, who carefully taught me everything about the law of our ancestors. I was very serious about serving God, just as are all of you here today. 
ACT.22.4	I persecuted the people who followed the Way of Jesus, and some of them were even killed. I arrested men and women and put them in jail. 
ACT.22.5	The high priest and the whole council of elders can tell you this is true. They gave me letters to the brothers in Damascus. So I was going there to arrest these people and bring them back to Jerusalem to be punished.
ACT.22.6	“About noon when I came near Damascus, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed all around me. 
ACT.22.7	I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying, 
ACT.22.8	I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The voice said, 
ACT.22.9	Those who were with me did not understand the voice, but they saw the light. 
ACT.22.10	I said, ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ The Lord answered, 
ACT.22.11	I could not see, because the bright light had made me blind. So my companions led me into Damascus.
ACT.22.12	“There a man named Ananias came to me. He was a religious man; he obeyed the law of Moses, and all the Jews who lived there respected him. 
ACT.22.13	He stood by me and said, ‘Brother Saul, see again!’ Immediately I was able to see him. 
ACT.22.14	He said, ‘The God of our ancestors chose you long ago to know his plan, to see the Righteous One, and to hear words from him. 
ACT.22.15	You will be his witness to all people, telling them about what you have seen and heard. 
ACT.22.16	Now, why wait any longer? Get up, be baptized, and wash your sins away, trusting in him to save you.’
ACT.22.17	“Later, when I returned to Jerusalem, I was praying in the Temple, and I saw a vision. 
ACT.22.18	I saw the Lord saying to me, 
ACT.22.19	But I said, ‘Lord, they know that in every synagogue I put the believers in jail and beat them. 
ACT.22.20	They also know I was there when Stephen, your witness, was killed. I stood there agreeing and holding the coats of those who were killing him!’ 
ACT.22.21	But the Lord said to me, 
ACT.22.22	The crowd listened to Paul until he said this. Then they began shouting, “Get rid of him! He doesn’t deserve to live!” 
ACT.22.23	They shouted, threw off their coats, and threw dust into the air.
ACT.22.24	Then the commander ordered the soldiers to take Paul into the army building and beat him. He wanted to make Paul tell why the people were shouting against him like this. 
ACT.22.25	But as the soldiers were tying him up, preparing to beat him, Paul said to an officer nearby, “Do you have the right to beat a Roman citizen who has not been proven guilty?”
ACT.22.26	When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and reported it. The officer said, “Do you know what you are doing? This man is a Roman citizen.”
ACT.22.27	The commander came to Paul and said, “Tell me, are you really a Roman citizen?”
ACT.22.27	He answered, “Yes.”
ACT.22.28	The commander said, “I paid a lot of money to become a Roman citizen.”
ACT.22.28	But Paul said, “I was born a citizen.”
ACT.22.29	The men who were preparing to question Paul moved away from him immediately. The commander was frightened because he had already tied Paul, and Paul was a Roman citizen.
ACT.22.30	The next day the commander decided to learn why the Jews were accusing Paul. So he ordered the leading priests and the council to meet. The commander took Paul’s chains off. Then he brought Paul out and stood him before their meeting.
ACT.23.1	Paul looked at the council and said, “Brothers, I have lived my life without guilt feelings before God up to this day.” 
ACT.23.2	Ananias, the high priest, heard this and told the men who were standing near Paul to hit him on the mouth. 
ACT.23.3	Paul said to Ananias, “God will hit you, too! You are like a wall that has been painted white. You sit there and judge me, using the law of Moses, but you are telling them to hit me, and that is against the law.”
ACT.23.4	The men standing near Paul said to him, “You cannot insult God’s high priest like that!”
ACT.23.5	Paul said, “Brothers, I did not know this man was the high priest. It is written in the Scriptures, ‘You must not curse a leader of your people.’ ”
ACT.23.6	Some of the men in the meeting were Sadducees, and others were Pharisees. Knowing this, Paul shouted to them, “My brothers, I am a Pharisee, and my father was a Pharisee. I am on trial here because I believe that people will rise from the dead.”
ACT.23.7	When Paul said this, there was an argument between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the group was divided. 
ACT.23.8	(The Sadducees do not believe in angels or spirits or that people will rise from the dead. But the Pharisees believe in them all.) 
ACT.23.9	So there was a great uproar. Some of the teachers of the law, who were Pharisees, stood up and argued, “We find nothing wrong with this man. Maybe an angel or a spirit did speak to him.”
ACT.23.10	The argument was beginning to turn into such a fight that the commander was afraid some evil people would tear Paul to pieces. So he told the soldiers to go down and take Paul away and put him in the army building.
ACT.23.11	The next night the Lord came and stood by Paul. He said, 
ACT.23.12	In the morning some evil people made a plan to kill Paul, and they took an oath not to eat or drink anything until they had killed him. 
ACT.23.13	There were more than forty men who made this plan. 
ACT.23.14	They went to the leading priests and the elders and said, “We have taken an oath not to eat or drink until we have killed Paul. 
ACT.23.15	So this is what we want you to do: Send a message to the commander to bring Paul out to you as though you want to ask him more questions. We will be waiting to kill him while he is on the way here.”
ACT.23.16	But Paul’s nephew heard about this plan and went to the army building and told Paul. 
ACT.23.17	Then Paul called one of the officers and said, “Take this young man to the commander. He has a message for him.”
ACT.23.18	So the officer brought Paul’s nephew to the commander and said, “The prisoner, Paul, asked me to bring this young man to you. He wants to tell you something.”
ACT.23.19	The commander took the young man’s hand and led him to a place where they could be alone. He asked, “What do you want to tell me?”
ACT.23.20	The young man said, “The Jews have decided to ask you to bring Paul down to their council meeting tomorrow. They want you to think they are going to ask him more questions. 
ACT.23.21	But don’t believe them! More than forty men are hiding and waiting to kill Paul. They have all taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. Now they are waiting for you to agree.”
ACT.23.22	The commander sent the young man away, ordering him, “Don’t tell anyone that you have told me about their plan.”
ACT.23.23	Then the commander called two officers and said, “I need some men to go to Caesarea. Get two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred men with spears ready to leave at nine o’clock tonight. 
ACT.23.24	Get some horses for Paul to ride so he can be taken to Governor Felix safely.” 
ACT.23.25	And he wrote a letter that said:
ACT.23.26	From Claudius Lysias.
ACT.23.26	To the Most Excellent Governor Felix:
ACT.23.26	Greetings.
ACT.23.27	Some of the Jews had taken this man and planned to kill him. But I learned that he is a Roman citizen, so I went with my soldiers and saved him. 
ACT.23.28	I wanted to know why they were accusing him, so I brought him before their council meeting. 
ACT.23.29	I learned that these people said Paul did some things that were wrong by their own laws, but no charge was worthy of jail or death. 
ACT.23.30	When I was told that some of them were planning to kill Paul, I sent him to you at once. I also told them to tell you what they have against him.
ACT.23.31	So the soldiers did what they were told and took Paul and brought him to the city of Antipatris that night. 
ACT.23.32	The next day the horsemen went with Paul to Caesarea, but the other soldiers went back to the army building in Jerusalem. 
ACT.23.33	When the horsemen came to Caesarea and gave the letter to the governor, they turned Paul over to him. 
ACT.23.34	The governor read the letter and asked Paul, “What area are you from?” When he learned that Paul was from Cilicia, 
ACT.23.35	he said, “I will hear your case when those who are against you come here, too.” Then the governor gave orders for Paul to be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.
ACT.24.1	Five days later Ananias, the high priest, went to the city of Caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named Tertullus. They had come to make charges against Paul before the governor. 
ACT.24.2	Paul was called into the meeting, and Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “Most Excellent Felix! Our people enjoy much peace because of you, and many wrong things in our country are being made right through your wise help. 
ACT.24.3	We accept these things always and in every place, and we are thankful for them. 
ACT.24.4	But not wanting to take any more of your time, I beg you to be kind and listen to our few words. 
ACT.24.5	We have found this man to be a troublemaker, stirring up his people everywhere in the world. He is a leader of the Nazarene group. 
ACT.24.6	Also, he was trying to make the Temple unclean, but we stopped him. [And we wanted to judge him by our own law. 
ACT.24.7	 But the officer Lysias came and used much force to take him from us. 
ACT.24.8	And Lysias commanded those who wanted to accuse Paul to come to you.] By asking him questions yourself, you can decide if all these things are true.” 
ACT.24.9	The others agreed and said that all of this was true.
ACT.24.10	When the governor made a sign for Paul to speak, Paul said, “Governor Felix, I know you have been a judge over this nation for a long time. So I am happy to defend myself before you. 
ACT.24.11	You can learn for yourself that I went to worship in Jerusalem only twelve days ago. 
ACT.24.12	Those who are accusing me did not find me arguing with anyone in the Temple or stirring up the people in the synagogues or in the city. 
ACT.24.13	They cannot prove the things they are saying against me now. 
ACT.24.14	But I will tell you this: I worship the God of our ancestors as a follower of the Way of Jesus. The others say that the Way of Jesus is not the right way. But I believe everything that is taught in the law of Moses and that is written in the books of the Prophets. 
ACT.24.15	I have the same hope in God that they have—the hope that all people, good and bad, will surely be raised from the dead. 
ACT.24.16	This is why I always try to do what I believe is right before God and people.
ACT.24.17	“After being away from Jerusalem for several years, I went back to bring money to my people and to offer sacrifices. 
ACT.24.18	I was doing this when they found me in the Temple. I had finished the cleansing ceremony and had not made any trouble; no people were gathering around me. 
ACT.24.19	But there were some people from Asia who should be here, standing before you. If I have really done anything wrong, they are the ones who should accuse me. 
ACT.24.20	Or ask these people here if they found any wrong in me when I stood before the council in Jerusalem. 
ACT.24.21	But I did shout one thing when I stood before them: ‘You are judging me today because I believe that people will rise from the dead!’ ”
ACT.24.22	Felix already understood much about the Way of Jesus. He stopped the trial and said, “When commander Lysias comes here, I will decide your case.” 
ACT.24.23	Felix told the officer to keep Paul guarded but to give him some freedom and to let his friends bring what he needed.
ACT.24.24	After some days Felix came with his wife, Drusilla, who was Jewish, and asked for Paul to be brought to him. He listened to Paul talk about believing in Christ Jesus. 
ACT.24.25	But Felix became afraid when Paul spoke about living right, self-control, and the time when God will judge the world. He said, “Go away now. When I have more time, I will call for you.” 
ACT.24.26	At the same time Felix hoped that Paul would give him some money, so he often sent for Paul and talked with him.
ACT.24.27	But after two years, Felix was replaced by Porcius Festus as governor. But Felix had left Paul in prison to please the Jews.
ACT.25.1	Three days after Festus became governor, he went from Caesarea to Jerusalem. 
ACT.25.2	There the leading priests and the important leaders made charges against Paul before Festus. 
ACT.25.3	They asked Festus to do them a favor. They wanted him to send Paul back to Jerusalem, because they had a plan to kill him on the way. 
ACT.25.4	But Festus answered that Paul would be kept in Caesarea and that he himself was returning there soon. 
ACT.25.5	He said, “Some of your leaders should go with me. They can accuse the man there in Caesarea, if he has really done something wrong.”
ACT.25.6	Festus stayed in Jerusalem another eight or ten days and then went back to Caesarea. The next day he told the soldiers to bring Paul before him. Festus was seated on the judge’s seat 
ACT.25.7	when Paul came into the room. The people who had come from Jerusalem stood around him, making serious charges against him, which they could not prove. 
ACT.25.8	This is what Paul said to defend himself: “I have done nothing wrong against the law, against the Temple, or against Caesar.”
ACT.25.9	But Festus wanted to please the people. So he asked Paul, “Do you want to go to Jerusalem for me to judge you there on these charges?”
ACT.25.10	Paul said, “I am standing at Caesar’s judgment seat now, where I should be judged. I have done nothing wrong to them; you know this is true. 
ACT.25.11	If I have done something wrong and the law says I must die, I do not ask to be saved from death. But if these charges are not true, then no one can give me to them. I want Caesar to hear my case!”
ACT.25.12	Festus talked about this with his advisers. Then he said, “You have asked to see Caesar, so you will go to Caesar!”
ACT.25.13	A few days later King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to visit Festus. 
ACT.25.14	They stayed there for some time, and Festus told the king about Paul’s case. Festus said, “There is a man that Felix left in prison. 
ACT.25.15	When I went to Jerusalem, the leading priests and the elders there made charges against him, asking me to sentence him to death. 
ACT.25.16	But I answered, ‘When a man is accused of a crime, Romans do not hand him over until he has been allowed to face his accusers and defend himself against their charges.’ 
ACT.25.17	So when these people came here to Caesarea for the trial, I did not waste time. The next day I sat on the judge’s seat and commanded that the man be brought in. 
ACT.25.18	They stood up and accused him, but not of any serious crime as I thought they would. 
ACT.25.19	The things they said were about their own religion and about a man named Jesus who died. But Paul said that he is still alive. 
ACT.25.20	Not knowing how to find out about these questions, I asked Paul, ‘Do you want to go to Jerusalem and be judged there?’ 
ACT.25.21	But he asked to be kept in Caesarea. He wants a decision from the emperor. So I ordered that he be held until I could send him to Caesar.”
ACT.25.22	Agrippa said to Festus, “I would also like to hear this man myself.”
ACT.25.22	Festus said, “Tomorrow you will hear him.”
ACT.25.23	The next day Agrippa and Bernice appeared with great show, acting like very important people. They went into the judgment room with the army leaders and the important men of Caesarea. Then Festus ordered the soldiers to bring Paul in. 
ACT.25.24	Festus said, “King Agrippa and all who are gathered here with us, you see this man. All the people, here and in Jerusalem, have complained to me about him, shouting that he should not live any longer. 
ACT.25.25	When I judged him, I found no reason to order his death. But since he asked to be judged by Caesar, I decided to send him. 
ACT.25.26	But I have nothing definite to write the emperor about him. So I have brought him before all of you—especially you, King Agrippa. I hope you can question him and give me something to write. 
ACT.25.27	I think it is foolish to send a prisoner to Caesar without telling what charges are against him.”
ACT.26.1	Agrippa said to Paul, “You may now speak to defend yourself.”
ACT.26.1	Then Paul raised his hand and began to speak. 
ACT.26.2	He said, “King Agrippa, I am very blessed to stand before you and will answer all the charges the evil people make against me. 
ACT.26.3	You know so much about all the customs and the things they argue about, so please listen to me patiently.
ACT.26.4	“All my people know about my whole life, how I lived from the beginning in my own country and later in Jerusalem. 
ACT.26.5	They have known me for a long time. If they want to, they can tell you that I was a good Pharisee. And the Pharisees obey the laws of my tradition more carefully than any other group. 
ACT.26.6	Now I am on trial because I hope for the promise that God made to our ancestors. 
ACT.26.7	This is the promise that the twelve tribes of our people hope to receive as they serve God day and night. My king, they have accused me because I hope for this same promise! 
ACT.26.8	Why do any of you people think it is impossible for God to raise people from the dead?
ACT.26.9	“I, too, thought I ought to do many things against Jesus from Nazareth. 
ACT.26.10	And that is what I did in Jerusalem. The leading priests gave me the power to put many of God’s people in jail, and when they were being killed, I agreed it was a good thing. 
ACT.26.11	In every synagogue, I often punished them and tried to make them speak against Jesus. I was so angry against them I even went to other cities to find them and punish them.
ACT.26.12	“One time the leading priests gave me permission and the power to go to Damascus. 
ACT.26.13	On the way there, at noon, I saw a light from heaven. It was brighter than the sun and flashed all around me and those who were traveling with me. 
ACT.26.14	We all fell to the ground. Then I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew language, saying, 
ACT.26.15	I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The Lord said, 
ACT.26.19	“King Agrippa, after I had this vision from heaven, I obeyed it. 
ACT.26.20	I began telling people that they should change their hearts and lives and turn to God and do things to show they really had changed. I told this first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem, and in every part of Judea, and also to the other people. 
ACT.26.21	This is why the Jews took me and were trying to kill me in the Temple. 
ACT.26.22	But God has helped me, and so I stand here today, telling all people, small and great, what I have seen. But I am saying only what Moses and the prophets said would happen— 
ACT.26.23	that the Christ would die, and as the first to rise from the dead, he would bring light to all people.”
ACT.26.24	While Paul was saying these things to defend himself, Festus said loudly, “Paul, you are out of your mind! Too much study has driven you crazy!”
ACT.26.25	Paul said, “Most excellent Festus, I am not crazy. My words are true and sensible. 
ACT.26.26	King Agrippa knows about these things, and I can speak freely to him. I know he has heard about all of these things, because they did not happen off in a corner. 
ACT.26.27	King Agrippa, do you believe what the prophets wrote? I know you believe.”
ACT.26.28	King Agrippa said to Paul, “Do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian in such a short time?”
ACT.26.29	Paul said, “Whether it is a short or a long time, I pray to God that not only you but every person listening to me today would be saved and be like me—except for these chains I have.”
ACT.26.30	Then King Agrippa, Governor Festus, Bernice, and all the people sitting with them stood up 
ACT.26.31	and left the room. Talking to each other, they said, “There is no reason why this man should die or be put in jail.” 
ACT.26.32	And Agrippa said to Festus, “We could let this man go free, but he has asked Caesar to hear his case.”
ACT.27.1	It was decided that we would sail for Italy. An officer named Julius, who served in the emperor’s army, guarded Paul and some other prisoners. 
ACT.27.2	We got on a ship that was from the city of Adramyttium and was about to sail to different ports in Asia. Aristarchus, a man from the city of Thessalonica in Macedonia, went with us. 
ACT.27.3	The next day we came to Sidon. Julius was very good to Paul and gave him freedom to go visit his friends, who took care of his needs. 
ACT.27.4	We left Sidon and sailed close to the island of Cyprus, because the wind was blowing against us. 
ACT.27.5	We went across the sea by Cilicia and Pamphylia and landed at the city of Myra, in Lycia. 
ACT.27.6	There the officer found a ship from Alexandria that was going to Italy, so he put us on it.
ACT.27.7	We sailed slowly for many days. We had a hard time reaching Cnidus because the wind was blowing against us, and we could not go any farther. So we sailed by the south side of the island of Crete near Salmone. 
ACT.27.8	Sailing past it was hard. Then we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
ACT.27.9	We had lost much time, and it was now dangerous to sail, because it was already after the Day of Cleansing. So Paul warned them, 
ACT.27.10	“Men, I can see there will be a lot of trouble on this trip. The ship, the cargo, and even our lives may be lost.” 
ACT.27.11	But the captain and the owner of the ship did not agree with Paul, and the officer believed what the captain and owner of the ship said. 
ACT.27.12	Since that harbor was not a good place for the ship to stay for the winter, most of the men decided that the ship should leave. They hoped we could go to Phoenix and stay there for the winter. Phoenix, a city on the island of Crete, had a harbor which faced southwest and northwest.
ACT.27.13	When a good wind began to blow from the south, the men on the ship thought, “This is the wind we wanted, and now we have it.” So they pulled up the anchor, and we sailed very close to the island of Crete. 
ACT.27.14	But then a very strong wind named the “northeaster” came from the island. 
ACT.27.15	The ship was caught in it and could not sail against it. So we stopped trying and let the wind carry us. 
ACT.27.16	When we went below a small island named Cauda, we were barely able to bring in the lifeboat. 
ACT.27.17	After the men took the lifeboat in, they tied ropes around the ship to hold it together. The men were afraid that the ship would hit the sandbanks of Syrtis, so they lowered the sail and let the wind carry the ship. 
ACT.27.18	The next day the storm was blowing us so hard that the men threw out some of the cargo. 
ACT.27.19	A day later with their own hands they threw out the ship’s equipment. 
ACT.27.20	When we could not see the sun or the stars for many days, and the storm was very bad, we lost all hope of being saved.
ACT.27.21	After the men had gone without food for a long time, Paul stood up before them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me. You should not have sailed from Crete. Then you would not have all this trouble and loss. 
ACT.27.22	But now I tell you to cheer up because none of you will die. Only the ship will be lost. 
ACT.27.23	Last night an angel came to me from the God I belong to and worship. 
ACT.27.24	The angel said, ‘Paul, do not be afraid. You must stand before Caesar. And God has promised you that he will save the lives of everyone sailing with you.’ 
ACT.27.25	So men, have courage. I trust in God that everything will happen as his angel told me. 
ACT.27.26	But we will crash on an island.”
ACT.27.27	On the fourteenth night we were still being carried around in the Adriatic Sea. About midnight the sailors thought we were close to land, 
ACT.27.28	so they lowered a rope with a weight on the end of it into the water. They found that the water was one hundred twenty feet deep. They went a little farther and lowered the rope again. It was ninety feet deep. 
ACT.27.29	The sailors were afraid that we would hit the rocks, so they threw four anchors into the water and prayed for daylight to come. 
ACT.27.30	Some of the sailors wanted to leave the ship, and they lowered the lifeboat, pretending they were throwing more anchors from the front of the ship. 
ACT.27.31	But Paul told the officer and the other soldiers, “If these men do not stay in the ship, your lives cannot be saved.” 
ACT.27.32	So the soldiers cut the ropes and let the lifeboat fall into the water.
ACT.27.33	Just before dawn Paul began persuading all the people to eat something. He said, “For the past fourteen days you have been waiting and watching and not eating. 
ACT.27.34	Now I beg you to eat something. You need it to stay alive. None of you will lose even one hair off your heads.” 
ACT.27.35	After he said this, Paul took some bread and thanked God for it before all of them. He broke off a piece and began eating. 
ACT.27.36	They all felt better and started eating, too. 
ACT.27.37	There were two hundred seventy-six people on the ship. 
ACT.27.38	When they had eaten all they wanted, they began making the ship lighter by throwing the grain into the sea.
ACT.27.39	When daylight came, the sailors saw land. They did not know what land it was, but they saw a bay with a beach and wanted to sail the ship to the beach if they could. 
ACT.27.40	So they cut the ropes to the anchors and left the anchors in the sea. At the same time, they untied the ropes that were holding the rudders. Then they raised the front sail into the wind and sailed toward the beach. 
ACT.27.41	But the ship hit a sandbank. The front of the ship stuck there and could not move, but the back of the ship began to break up from the big waves.
ACT.27.42	The soldiers decided to kill the prisoners so none of them could swim away and escape. 
ACT.27.43	But Julius, the officer, wanted to let Paul live and did not allow the soldiers to kill the prisoners. Instead he ordered everyone who could swim to jump into the water first and swim to land. 
ACT.27.44	The rest were to follow using wooden boards or pieces of the ship. And this is how all the people made it safely to land.
ACT.28.1	When we were safe on land, we learned that the island was called Malta. 
ACT.28.2	The people who lived there were very good to us. Because it was raining and very cold, they made a fire and welcomed all of us. 
ACT.28.3	Paul gathered a pile of sticks and was putting them on the fire when a poisonous snake came out because of the heat and bit him on the hand. 
ACT.28.4	The people living on the island saw the snake hanging from Paul’s hand and said to each other, “This man must be a murderer! He did not die in the sea, but Justice does not want him to live.” 
ACT.28.5	But Paul shook the snake off into the fire and was not hurt. 
ACT.28.6	The people thought that Paul would swell up or fall down dead. They waited and watched him for a long time, but nothing bad happened to him. So they changed their minds and said, “He is a god!”
ACT.28.7	There were some fields around there owned by Publius, an important man on the island. He welcomed us into his home and was very good to us for three days. 
ACT.28.8	Publius’ father was sick with a fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, prayed, and put his hands on the man and healed him. 
ACT.28.9	After this, all the other sick people on the island came to Paul, and he healed them, too. 
ACT.28.10+ACT.28.11	The people on the island gave us many honors. When we were ready to leave, three months later, they gave us the things we needed.
ACT.28.10+ACT.28.11	We got on a ship from Alexandria that had stayed on the island during the winter. On the front of the ship was the sign of the twin gods. 
ACT.28.12	We stopped at Syracuse for three days. 
ACT.28.13	From there we sailed to Rhegium. The next day a wind began to blow from the south, and a day later we came to Puteoli. 
ACT.28.14	We found some believers there who asked us to stay with them for a week. Finally, we came to Rome. 
ACT.28.15	The believers in Rome heard that we were there and came out as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Inns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he was encouraged and thanked God.
ACT.28.16	When we arrived at Rome, Paul was allowed to live alone, with the soldier who guarded him.
ACT.28.17	Three days later Paul sent for the leaders there. When they came together, he said, “Brothers, I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors. But I was arrested in Jerusalem and given to the Romans. 
ACT.28.18	After they asked me many questions, they could find no reason why I should be killed. They wanted to let me go free, 
ACT.28.19	but the evil people there argued against that. So I had to ask to come to Rome to have my trial before Caesar. But I have no charge to bring against my own people. 
ACT.28.20	That is why I wanted to see you and talk with you. I am bound with this chain because I believe in the hope of Israel.”
ACT.28.21	They answered Paul, “We have received no letters from Judea about you. None of our Jewish brothers who have come from there brought news or told us anything bad about you. 
ACT.28.22	But we want to hear your ideas, because we know that people everywhere are speaking against this religious group.”
ACT.28.23	Paul and the people chose a day for a meeting and on that day many more of the Jews met with Paul at the place he was staying. He spoke to them all day long. Using the law of Moses and the prophets’ writings, he explained the kingdom of God, and he tried to persuade them to believe these things about Jesus. 
ACT.28.24	Some believed what Paul said, but others did not. 
ACT.28.25	So they argued and began leaving after Paul said one more thing to them: “The Holy Spirit spoke the truth to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
ACT.28.26	‘Go to this people and say:
ACT.28.26	You will listen and listen, but you will not understand.
ACT.28.26	You will look and look, but you will not learn,
ACT.28.27	because these people have become stubborn.
ACT.28.27	They don’t hear with their ears,
ACT.28.27	and they have closed their eyes.
ACT.28.27	Otherwise, they might really understand
ACT.28.27	what they see with their eyes
ACT.28.27	and hear with their ears.
ACT.28.27	They might really understand in their minds
ACT.28.27	and come back to me and be healed.’
ACT.28.28	“I want you to know that God has also sent his salvation to all nations, and they will listen!” [
ACT.28.29	After Paul said this, the Jews left. They were arguing very much with each other.] 
ACT.28.30	Paul stayed two full years in his own rented house and welcomed all people who came to visit him. 
ACT.28.31	He boldly preached about the kingdom of God and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ, and no one stopped him.
ROM.1.1	From Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus. God called me to be an apostle and chose me to tell the Good News.
ROM.1.2	God promised this Good News long ago through his prophets, as it is written in the Holy Scriptures. 
ROM.1.3+ROM.1.4	The Good News is about God’s Son, Jesus Christ our Lord. As a man, he was born from the family of David. But through the Spirit of holiness he was declared to be God’s Son with great power by rising from the dead. 
ROM.1.5	Through Christ, God gave me the special work of an apostle, which was to lead people of all nations to believe and obey. I do this work for him. 
ROM.1.6	And you who are in Rome are also called to belong to Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.7	To all of you in Rome whom God loves and has called to be his holy people:
ROM.1.7	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
ROM.1.8	First I want to say that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because people everywhere in the world are talking about your faith. 
ROM.1.9	God, whom I serve with my whole heart by telling the Good News about his Son, knows that I always mention you 
ROM.1.10	every time I pray. I pray that I will be allowed to come to you, and this will happen if God wants it. 
ROM.1.11	I want very much to see you, to give you some spiritual gift to make you strong. 
ROM.1.12	I mean that I want us to help each other with the faith we have. Your faith will help me, and my faith will help you. 
ROM.1.13	Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that I planned many times to come to you, but this has not been possible. I wanted to come so that I could help you grow spiritually as I have helped the other non-Jewish people.
ROM.1.14	I have a duty to all people—Greeks and those who are not Greeks, the wise and the foolish. 
ROM.1.15	That is why I want so much to preach the Good News to you in Rome.
ROM.1.16	I am not ashamed of the Good News, because it is the power God uses to save everyone who believes—to save the Jews first, and then to save non-Jews. 
ROM.1.17	The Good News shows how God makes people right with himself—that it begins and ends with faith. As the Scripture says, “But those who are right with God will live by faith.”
ROM.1.18	God’s anger is shown from heaven against all the evil and wrong things people do. By their own evil lives they hide the truth. 
ROM.1.19	God shows his anger because some knowledge of him has been made clear to them. Yes, God has shown himself to them. 
ROM.1.20	There are things about him that people cannot see—his eternal power and all the things that make him God. But since the beginning of the world those things have been easy to understand by what God has made. So people have no excuse for the bad things they do. 
ROM.1.21	They knew God, but they did not give glory to God or thank him. Their thinking became useless. Their foolish minds were filled with darkness. 
ROM.1.22	They said they were wise, but they became fools. 
ROM.1.23	They traded the glory of God who lives forever for the worship of idols made to look like earthly people, birds, animals, and snakes.
ROM.1.24	Because they did these things, God left them and let them go their sinful way, wanting only to do evil. As a result, they became full of sexual sin, using their bodies wrongly with each other. 
ROM.1.25	They traded the truth of God for a lie. They worshiped and served what had been created instead of the God who created those things, who should be praised forever. Amen.
ROM.1.26	Because people did those things, God left them and let them do the shameful things they wanted to do. Women stopped having natural sex and started having sex with other women. 
ROM.1.27	In the same way, men stopped having natural sex and began wanting each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and in their bodies they received the punishment for those wrongs.
ROM.1.28	People did not think it was important to have a true knowledge of God. So God left them and allowed them to have their own worthless thinking and to do things they should not do. 
ROM.1.29	They are filled with every kind of sin, evil, selfishness, and hatred. They are full of jealousy, murder, fighting, lying, and thinking the worst about each other. They gossip 
ROM.1.30	and say evil things about each other. They hate God. They are rude and conceited and brag about themselves. They invent ways of doing evil. They do not obey their parents. 
ROM.1.31	They are foolish, they do not keep their promises, and they show no kindness or mercy to others. 
ROM.1.32	They know God’s law says that those who live like this should die. But they themselves not only continue to do these evil things, they applaud others who do them.
ROM.2.1	If you think you can judge others, you are wrong. When you judge them, you are really judging yourself guilty, because you do the same things they do. 
ROM.2.2	God judges those who do wrong things, and we know that his judging is right. 
ROM.2.3	You judge those who do wrong, but you do wrong yourselves. Do you think you will be able to escape the judgment of God? 
ROM.2.4	He has been very kind and patient, waiting for you to change, but you think nothing of his kindness. Perhaps you do not understand that God is kind to you so you will change your hearts and lives. 
ROM.2.5	But you are stubborn and refuse to change, so you are making your own punishment even greater on the day he shows his anger. On that day everyone will see God’s right judgments. 
ROM.2.6	God will reward or punish every person for what that person has done. 
ROM.2.7	Some people, by always continuing to do good, live for God’s glory, for honor, and for life that has no end. God will give them life forever. 
ROM.2.8	But other people are selfish. They refuse to follow truth and, instead, follow evil. God will give them his punishment and anger. 
ROM.2.9	He will give trouble and suffering to everyone who does evil—to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews. 
ROM.2.10	But he will give glory, honor, and peace to everyone who does good—to the Jews first and also to those who are not Jews. 
ROM.2.11	For God judges all people in the same way.
ROM.2.12	People who do not have the law and who are sinners will be lost, although they do not have the law. And, in the same way, those who have the law and are sinners will be judged by the law. 
ROM.2.13	Hearing the law does not make people right with God. It is those who obey the law who will be right with him. 
ROM.2.14	(Those who are not Jews do not have the law, but when they freely do what the law commands, they are the law for themselves. This is true even though they do not have the law. 
ROM.2.15	They show that in their hearts they know what is right and wrong, just as the law commands. And they show this by their consciences. Sometimes their thoughts tell them they did wrong, and sometimes their thoughts tell them they did right.) 
ROM.2.16	All these things will happen on the day when God, through Christ Jesus, will judge people’s secret thoughts. The Good News that I preach says this.
ROM.2.17	What about you? You call yourself a Jew. You trust in the law of Moses and brag that you are close to God. 
ROM.2.18	You know what he wants you to do and what is important, because you have learned the law. 
ROM.2.19	You think you are a guide for the blind and a light for those who are in darkness. 
ROM.2.20	You think you can show foolish people what is right and teach those who know nothing. You have the law; so you think you know everything and have all truth. 
ROM.2.21	You teach others, so why don’t you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but you steal. 
ROM.2.22	You say that others must not take part in adultery, but you are guilty of that sin. You hate idols, but you steal from temples. 
ROM.2.23	You brag about having God’s law, but you bring shame to God by breaking his law, 
ROM.2.24	just as the Scriptures say: “Those who are not Jews speak against God’s name because of you.”
ROM.2.25	If you follow the law, your circumcision has meaning. But if you break the law, it is as if you were never circumcised. 
ROM.2.26	People who are not Jews are not circumcised, but if they do what the law says, it is as if they were circumcised. 
ROM.2.27	You Jews have the written law and circumcision, but you break the law. So those who are not circumcised in their bodies, but still obey the law, will show that you are guilty. 
ROM.2.28	They can do this because a person is not a true Jew if he is only a Jew in his physical body; true circumcision is not only on the outside of the body. 
ROM.2.29	A person is a Jew only if he is a Jew inside; true circumcision is done in the heart by the Spirit, not by the written law. Such a person gets praise from God rather than from people.
ROM.3.1	So, do Jews have anything that other people do not have? Is there anything special about being circumcised? 
ROM.3.2	Yes, of course, there is in every way. The most important thing is this: God trusted the Jews with his teachings. 
ROM.3.3	If some Jews were not faithful to him, will that stop God from doing what he promised? 
ROM.3.4	No! God will continue to be true even when every person is false. As the Scriptures say:
ROM.3.4	“So you will be shown to be right when you speak,
ROM.3.4	and you will win your case.”
ROM.3.5	When we do wrong, that shows more clearly that God is right. So can we say that God is wrong to punish us? (I am talking as people might talk.) 
ROM.3.6	No! If God could not punish us, he could not judge the world.
ROM.3.7	A person might say, “When I lie, it really gives him glory, because my lie shows God’s truth. So why am I judged a sinner?” 
ROM.3.8	It would be the same to say, “We should do evil so that good will come.” Some people find fault with us and say we teach this, but they are wrong and deserve the punishment they will receive.
ROM.3.9	So are we Jews better than others? No! We have already said that Jews and those who are not Jews are all guilty of sin. 
ROM.3.10	As the Scriptures say:
ROM.3.10	“There is no one who always does what is right,
ROM.3.10	not even one.
ROM.3.11	There is no one who understands.
ROM.3.11	There is no one who looks to God for help.
ROM.3.12	All have turned away.
ROM.3.12	Together, everyone has become useless.
ROM.3.12	There is no one who does anything good;
ROM.3.12	there is not even one.”
ROM.3.13	“Their throats are like open graves;
ROM.3.13	they use their tongues for telling lies.”
ROM.3.13	“Their words are like snake poison.”
ROM.3.14	“Their mouths are full of cursing and hate.” 
ROM.3.15	“They are always ready to kill people.
ROM.3.16	Everywhere they go they cause ruin and misery.
ROM.3.17	They don’t know how to live in peace.”
ROM.3.18	“They have no fear of God.”
ROM.3.19	We know that the law’s commands are for those who have the law. This stops all excuses and brings the whole world under God’s judgment, 
ROM.3.20	because no one can be made right with God by following the law. The law only shows us our sin.
ROM.3.21	But God has a way to make people right with him without the law, and he has now shown us that way which the law and the prophets told us about. 
ROM.3.22	God makes people right with himself through their faith in Jesus Christ. This is true for all who believe in Christ, because all people are the same: 
ROM.3.23	Everyone has sinned and fallen short of God’s glorious standard, 
ROM.3.24	and all need to be made right with God by his grace, which is a free gift. They need to be made free from sin through Jesus Christ. 
ROM.3.25	God sent him to die in our place to take away our sins. We receive forgiveness through faith in the blood of Jesus’ death. This showed that God always does what is right and fair, as in the past when he was patient and did not punish people for their sins. 
ROM.3.26	And God gave Jesus to show today that he does what is right. God did this so he could judge rightly and so he could make right any person who has faith in Jesus.
ROM.3.27	So do we have a reason to brag about ourselves? No! And why not? It is the way of faith that stops all bragging, not the way of trying to obey the law. 
ROM.3.28	A person is made right with God through faith, not through obeying the law. 
ROM.3.29	Is God only the God of the Jews? Is he not also the God of those who are not Jews? 
ROM.3.30	Of course he is, because there is only one God. He will make Jews right with him by their faith, and he will also make those who are not Jews right with him through their faith. 
ROM.3.31	So do we destroy the law by following the way of faith? No! Faith causes us to be what the law truly wants.
ROM.4.1	So what can we say that Abraham, the father of our people, learned about faith? 
ROM.4.2	If Abraham was made right by the things he did, he had a reason to brag. But this is not God’s view, 
ROM.4.3	because the Scripture says, “Abraham believed God, and God accepted Abraham’s faith, and that faith made him right with God.”
ROM.4.4	When people work, their pay is not given as a gift, but as something earned. 
ROM.4.5	But people cannot do any work that will make them right with God. So they must trust in him, who makes even evil people right in his sight. Then God accepts their faith, and that makes them right with him. 
ROM.4.6	David said the same thing. He said that people are truly blessed when God, without paying attention to their deeds, makes people right with himself.
ROM.4.7	“Blessed are they
ROM.4.7	whose sins are forgiven,
ROM.4.7	whose wrongs are pardoned.
ROM.4.8	Blessed is the person
ROM.4.8	whom the Lord does not consider guilty.”
ROM.4.9	Is this blessing only for those who are circumcised or also for those who are not circumcised? We have already said that God accepted Abraham’s faith and that faith made him right with God. 
ROM.4.10	So how did this happen? Did God accept Abraham before or after he was circumcised? It was before his circumcision. 
ROM.4.11	Abraham was circumcised to show that he was right with God through faith before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the father of all those who believe but are not circumcised; he is the father of all believers who are accepted as being right with God. 
ROM.4.12	And Abraham is also the father of those who have been circumcised and who live following the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
ROM.4.13	Abraham and his descendants received the promise that they would get the whole world. He did not receive that promise through the law, but through being right with God by his faith. 
ROM.4.14	If people could receive what God promised by following the law, then faith is worthless. And God’s promise to Abraham is worthless, 
ROM.4.15	because the law can only bring God’s anger. But if there is no law, there is nothing to disobey.
ROM.4.16	So people receive God’s promise by having faith. This happens so the promise can be a free gift. Then all of Abraham’s children can have that promise. It is not only for those who live under the law of Moses but for anyone who lives with faith like that of Abraham, who is the father of us all. 
ROM.4.17	As it is written in the Scriptures: “I am making you a father of many nations.” This is true before God, the God Abraham believed, the God who gives life to the dead and who creates something out of nothing.
ROM.4.18	There was no hope that Abraham would have children. But Abraham believed God and continued hoping, and so he became the father of many nations. As God told him, “Your descendants also will be too many to count.” 
ROM.4.19	Abraham was almost a hundred years old, much past the age for having children, and Sarah could not have children. Abraham thought about all this, but his faith in God did not become weak. 
ROM.4.20	He never doubted that God would keep his promise, and he never stopped believing. He grew stronger in his faith and gave praise to God. 
ROM.4.21	Abraham felt sure that God was able to do what he had promised. 
ROM.4.22	So, “God accepted Abraham’s faith, and that faith made him right with God.” 
ROM.4.23	Those words (“God accepted Abraham’s faith”) were written not only for Abraham 
ROM.4.24	but also for us. God will accept us also because we believe in the One who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. 
ROM.4.25	Jesus was given to die for our sins, and he was raised from the dead to make us right with God.
ROM.5.1	Since we have been made right with God by our faith, we have peace with God. This happened through our Lord Jesus Christ, 
ROM.5.2	who through our faith has brought us into that blessing of God’s grace that we now enjoy. And we are happy because of the hope we have of sharing God’s glory. 
ROM.5.3	We also have joy with our troubles, because we know that these troubles produce patience. 
ROM.5.4	And patience produces character, and character produces hope. 
ROM.5.5	And this hope will never disappoint us, because God has poured out his love to fill our hearts. He gave us his love through the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to us.
ROM.5.6	When we were unable to help ourselves, at the right time, Christ died for us, although we were living against God. 
ROM.5.7	Very few people will die to save the life of someone else. Although perhaps for a good person someone might possibly die. 
ROM.5.8	But God shows his great love for us in this way: Christ died for us while we were still sinners.
ROM.5.9	So through Christ we will surely be saved from God’s anger, because we have been made right with God by the blood of Christ’s death. 
ROM.5.10	While we were God’s enemies, he made us his friends through the death of his Son. Surely, now that we are his friends, he will save us through his Son’s life. 
ROM.5.11	And not only that, but now we are also very happy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we are now God’s friends again.
ROM.5.12	Sin came into the world because of what one man did, and with sin came death. This is why everyone must die—because everyone sinned. 
ROM.5.13	Sin was in the world before the law of Moses, but sin is not counted against us as breaking a command when there is no law. 
ROM.5.14	But from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, everyone had to die, even those who had not sinned by breaking a command, as Adam had.
ROM.5.14	Adam was like the One who was coming in the future. 
ROM.5.15	But God’s free gift is not like Adam’s sin. Many people died because of the sin of that one man. But the grace from God was much greater; many people received God’s gift of life by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ. 
ROM.5.16	After Adam sinned once, he was judged guilty. But the gift of God is different. God’s free gift came after many sins, and it makes people right with God. 
ROM.5.17	One man sinned, and so death ruled all people because of that one man. But now those people who accept God’s full grace and the great gift of being made right with him will surely have true life and rule through the one man, Jesus Christ.
ROM.5.18	So as one sin of Adam brought the punishment of death to all people, one good act that Christ did makes all people right with God. And that brings true life for all. 
ROM.5.19	One man disobeyed God, and many became sinners. In the same way, one man obeyed God, and many will be made right. 
ROM.5.20	The law came to make sin worse. But when sin grew worse, God’s grace increased. 
ROM.5.21	Sin once used death to rule us, but God gave people more of his grace so that grace could rule by making people right with him. And this brings life forever through Jesus Christ our Lord.
ROM.6.1	So do you think we should continue sinning so that God will give us even more grace? 
ROM.6.2	No! We died to our old sinful lives, so how can we continue living with sin? 
ROM.6.3	Did you forget that all of us became part of Christ when we were baptized? We shared his death in our baptism. 
ROM.6.4	When we were baptized, we were buried with Christ and shared his death. So, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the wonderful power of the Father, we also can live a new life.
ROM.6.5	Christ died, and we have been joined with him by dying too. So we will also be joined with him by rising from the dead as he did. 
ROM.6.6	We know that our old life died with Christ on the cross so that our sinful selves would have no power over us and we would not be slaves to sin. 
ROM.6.7	Anyone who has died is made free from sin’s control.
ROM.6.8	If we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him. 
ROM.6.9	Christ was raised from the dead, and we know that he cannot die again. Death has no power over him now. 
ROM.6.10	Yes, when Christ died, he died to defeat the power of sin one time—enough for all time. He now has a new life, and his new life is with God. 
ROM.6.11	In the same way, you should see yourselves as being dead to the power of sin and alive with God through Christ Jesus.
ROM.6.12	So, do not let sin control your life here on earth so that you do what your sinful self wants to do. 
ROM.6.13	Do not offer the parts of your body to serve sin, as things to be used in doing evil. Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have died and now live. Offer the parts of your body to God to be used in doing good. 
ROM.6.14	Sin will not be your master, because you are not under law but under God’s grace.
ROM.6.15	So what should we do? Should we sin because we are under grace and not under law? No! 
ROM.6.16	Surely you know that when you give yourselves like slaves to obey someone, then you are really slaves of that person. The person you obey is your master. You can follow sin, which brings spiritual death, or you can obey God, which makes you right with him. 
ROM.6.17	In the past you were slaves to sin—sin controlled you. But thank God, you fully obeyed the things that you were taught. 
ROM.6.18	You were made free from sin, and now you are slaves to goodness. 
ROM.6.19	I use this example because this is hard for you to understand. In the past you offered the parts of your body to be slaves to sin and evil; you lived only for evil. In the same way now you must give yourselves to be slaves of goodness. Then you will live only for God.
ROM.6.20	In the past you were slaves to sin, and goodness did not control you. 
ROM.6.21	You did evil things, and now you are ashamed of them. Those things only bring death. 
ROM.6.22	But now you are free from sin and have become slaves of God. This brings you a life that is only for God, and this gives you life forever. 
ROM.6.23	The payment for sin is death. But God gives us the free gift of life forever in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.7.1	Brothers and sisters, all of you understand the law of Moses. So surely you know that the law rules over people only while they are alive. 
ROM.7.2	For example, a woman must stay married to her husband as long as he is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law of marriage. 
ROM.7.3	But if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, the law says she is guilty of adultery. But if her husband dies, she is free from the law of marriage. Then if she marries another man, she is not guilty of adultery.
ROM.7.4	In the same way, my brothers and sisters, your old selves died, and you became free from the law through the body of Christ. This happened so that you might belong to someone else—the One who was raised from the dead—and so that we might be used in service to God. 
ROM.7.5	In the past, we were ruled by our sinful selves. The law made us want to do sinful things that controlled our bodies, so the things we did were bringing us death. 
ROM.7.6	In the past, the law held us like prisoners, but our old selves died, and we were made free from the law. So now we serve God in a new way with the Spirit, and not in the old way with written rules.
ROM.7.7	You might think I am saying that sin and the law are the same thing. That is not true. But the law was the only way I could learn what sin meant. I would never have known what it means to want to take something belonging to someone else if the law had not said, “You must not want to take your neighbor’s things.” 
ROM.7.8	And sin found a way to use that command and cause me to want all kinds of things I should not want. But without the law, sin has no power. 
ROM.7.9	I was alive before I knew the law. But when the law’s command came to me, then sin began to live, 
ROM.7.10	and I died. The command was meant to bring life, but for me it brought death. 
ROM.7.11	Sin found a way to fool me by using the command to make me die.
ROM.7.12	So the law is holy, and the command is holy and right and good. 
ROM.7.13	Does this mean that something that is good brought death to me? No! Sin used something that is good to bring death to me. This happened so that I could see what sin is really like; the command was used to show that sin is very evil.
ROM.7.14	We know that the law is spiritual, but I am not spiritual since sin rules me as if I were its slave. 
ROM.7.15	I do not understand the things I do. I do not do what I want to do, and I do the things I hate. 
ROM.7.16	And if I do not want to do the hated things I do, that means I agree that the law is good. 
ROM.7.17	But I am not really the one who is doing these hated things; it is sin living in me that does them. 
ROM.7.18	Yes, I know that nothing good lives in me—I mean nothing good lives in the part of me that is earthly and sinful. I want to do the things that are good, but I do not do them. 
ROM.7.19	I do not do the good things I want to do, but I do the bad things I do not want to do. 
ROM.7.20	So if I do things I do not want to do, then I am not the one doing them. It is sin living in me that does those things.
ROM.7.21	So I have learned this rule: When I want to do good, evil is there with me. 
ROM.7.22	In my mind, I am happy with God’s law. 
ROM.7.23	But I see another law working in my body, which makes war against the law that my mind accepts. That other law working in my body is the law of sin, and it makes me its prisoner. 
ROM.7.24	What a miserable man I am! Who will save me from this body that brings me death? 
ROM.7.25	I thank God for saving me through Jesus Christ our Lord!
ROM.7.25	So in my mind I am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful self I am a slave to the law of sin.
ROM.8.1	So now, those who are in Christ Jesus are not judged guilty. 
ROM.8.2	Through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit that brings life made you free from the law that brings sin and death. 
ROM.8.3	The law was without power, because the law was made weak by our sinful selves. But God did what the law could not do. He sent his own Son to earth with the same human life that others use for sin. By sending his Son to be an offering for sin, God used a human life to destroy sin. 
ROM.8.4	He did this so that we could be the kind of people the law correctly wants us to be. Now we do not live following our sinful selves, but we live following the Spirit.
ROM.8.5	Those who live following their sinful selves think only about things that their sinful selves want. But those who live following the Spirit are thinking about the things the Spirit wants them to do. 
ROM.8.6	If people’s thinking is controlled by the sinful self, there is death. But if their thinking is controlled by the Spirit, there is life and peace. 
ROM.8.7	When people’s thinking is controlled by the sinful self, they are against God, because they refuse to obey God’s law and really are not even able to obey God’s law. 
ROM.8.8	Those people who are ruled by their sinful selves cannot please God.
ROM.8.9	But you are not ruled by your sinful selves. You are ruled by the Spirit, if that Spirit of God really lives in you. But the person who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to Christ. 
ROM.8.10	Your body will always be dead because of sin. But if Christ is in you, then the Spirit gives you life, because Christ made you right with God. 
ROM.8.11	God raised Jesus from the dead, and if God’s Spirit is living in you, he will also give life to your bodies that die. God is the One who raised Christ from the dead, and he will give life through his Spirit that lives in you.
ROM.8.12	So, my brothers and sisters, we must not be ruled by our sinful selves or live the way our sinful selves want. 
ROM.8.13	If you use your lives to do the wrong things your sinful selves want, you will die spiritually. But if you use the Spirit’s help to stop doing the wrong things you do with your body, you will have true life.
ROM.8.14	The true children of God are those who let God’s Spirit lead them. 
ROM.8.15	The Spirit we received does not make us slaves again to fear; it makes us children of God. With that Spirit we cry out, “Father.” 
ROM.8.16	And the Spirit himself joins with our spirits to say we are God’s children. 
ROM.8.17	If we are God’s children, we will receive blessings from God together with Christ. But we must suffer as Christ suffered so that we will have glory as Christ has glory.
ROM.8.18	The sufferings we have now are nothing compared to the great glory that will be shown to us. 
ROM.8.19	Everything God made is waiting with excitement for God to show his children’s glory completely. 
ROM.8.20	Everything God made was changed to become useless, not by its own wish but because God wanted it and because all along there was this hope: 
ROM.8.21	that everything God made would be set free from ruin to have the freedom and glory that belong to God’s children.
ROM.8.22	We know that everything God made has been waiting until now in pain, like a woman ready to give birth. 
ROM.8.23	Not only the world, but we also have been waiting with pain inside us. We have the Spirit as the first part of God’s promise. So we are waiting for God to finish making us his own children, which means our bodies will be made free. 
ROM.8.24	We were saved, and we have this hope. If we see what we are waiting for, that is not really hope. People do not hope for something they already have. 
ROM.8.25	But we are hoping for something we do not have yet, and we are waiting for it patiently.
ROM.8.26	Also, the Spirit helps us with our weakness. We do not know how to pray as we should. But the Spirit himself speaks to God for us, even begs God for us with deep feelings that words cannot explain. 
ROM.8.27	God can see what is in people’s hearts. And he knows what is in the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit speaks to God for his people in the way God wants.
ROM.8.28	We know that in everything God works for the good of those who love him. They are the people he called, because that was his plan. 
ROM.8.29	God knew them before he made the world, and he chose them to be like his Son so that Jesus would be the firstborn of many brothers and sisters. 
ROM.8.30	God planned for them to be like his Son; and those he planned to be like his Son, he also called; and those he called, he also made right with him; and those he made right, he also glorified.
ROM.8.31	So what should we say about this? If God is for us, no one can defeat us. 
ROM.8.32	He did not spare his own Son but gave him for us all. So with Jesus, God will surely give us all things. 
ROM.8.33	Who can accuse the people God has chosen? No one, because God is the One who makes them right. 
ROM.8.34	Who can say God’s people are guilty? No one, because Christ Jesus died, but he was also raised from the dead, and now he is on God’s right side, appealing to God for us. 
ROM.8.35	Can anything separate us from the love Christ has for us? Can troubles or problems or sufferings or hunger or nakedness or danger or violent death? 
ROM.8.36	As it is written in the Scriptures:
ROM.8.36	“For you we are in danger of death all the time.
ROM.8.36	People think we are worth no more than sheep to be killed.”
ROM.8.37	But in all these things we are completely victorious through God who showed his love for us. 
ROM.8.38	Yes, I am sure that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor ruling spirits, nothing now, nothing in the future, no powers, 
ROM.8.39	nothing above us, nothing below us, nor anything else in the whole world will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
ROM.9.1	I am in Christ, and I am telling you the truth; I do not lie. My conscience is ruled by the Holy Spirit, and it tells me I am not lying. 
ROM.9.2	I have great sorrow and always feel much sadness. 
ROM.9.3	I wish I could help my Jewish brothers and sisters, my people. I would even wish that I were cursed and cut off from Christ if that would help them. 
ROM.9.4	They are the people of Israel, God’s chosen children. They have seen the glory of God, and they have the agreements that God made between himself and his people. God gave them the law of Moses and the right way of worship and his promises. 
ROM.9.5	They are the descendants of our great ancestors, and they are the earthly family into which Christ was born, who is God over all. Praise him forever! Amen.
ROM.9.6	It is not that God failed to keep his promise to them. But only some of the people of Israel are truly God’s people, 
ROM.9.7	and only some of Abraham’s descendants are true children of Abraham. But God said to Abraham: “The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac.” 
ROM.9.8	This means that not all of Abraham’s descendants are God’s true children. Abraham’s true children are those who become God’s children because of the promise God made to Abraham. 
ROM.9.9	God’s promise to Abraham was this: “At the right time I will return, and Sarah will have a son.” 
ROM.9.10	And that is not all. Rebekah’s sons had the same father, our father Isaac. 
ROM.9.11+ROM.9.12	But before the two boys were born, God told Rebekah, “The older will serve the younger.” This was before the boys had done anything good or bad. God said this so that the one chosen would be chosen because of God’s own plan. He was chosen because he was the one God wanted to call, not because of anything he did. 
ROM.9.13	As the Scripture says, “I loved Jacob, but I hated Esau.”
ROM.9.14	So what should we say about this? Is God unfair? In no way. 
ROM.9.15	God said to Moses, “I will show kindness to anyone to whom I want to show kindness, and I will show mercy to anyone to whom I want to show mercy.” 
ROM.9.16	So God will choose the one to whom he decides to show mercy; his choice does not depend on what people want or try to do. 
ROM.9.17	The Scripture says to the king of Egypt: “I made you king for this reason: to show my power in you so that my name will be talked about in all the earth.” 
ROM.9.18	So God shows mercy where he wants to show mercy, and he makes stubborn the people he wants to make stubborn.
ROM.9.19	So one of you will ask me: “Then why does God blame us for our sins? Who can fight his will?” 
ROM.9.20	You are only human, and human beings have no right to question God. An object should not ask the person who made it, “Why did you make me like this?” 
ROM.9.21	The potter can make anything he wants to make. He can use the same clay to make one thing for special use and another thing for daily use.
ROM.9.22	It is the same way with God. He wanted to show his anger and to let people see his power. But he patiently stayed with those people he was angry with—people who were made ready to be destroyed. 
ROM.9.23	He waited with patience so that he could make known his rich glory to the people who receive his mercy. He has prepared these people to have his glory, 
ROM.9.24	and we are those people whom God called. He called us not from the Jews only but also from those who are not Jews. 
ROM.9.25	As the Scripture says in Hosea:
ROM.9.25	“I will say, ‘You are my people’
ROM.9.25	to those I had called ‘not my people.’
ROM.9.25	And I will show my love
ROM.9.25	to those people I did not love.” 
ROM.9.26	“They were called,
ROM.9.26	‘You are not my people,’
ROM.9.26	but later they will be called
ROM.9.26	‘children of the living God.’ ”
ROM.9.27	And Isaiah cries out about Israel:
ROM.9.27	“The people of Israel are many,
ROM.9.27	like the grains of sand by the sea.
ROM.9.27	But only a few of them will be saved,
ROM.9.28	because the Lord will quickly and completely punish the people on the earth.”
ROM.9.29	It is as Isaiah said:
ROM.9.29	“The Lord All-Powerful
ROM.9.29	allowed a few of our descendants to live.
ROM.9.29	Otherwise we would have been completely destroyed
ROM.9.29	like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.”
ROM.9.30	So what does all this mean? Those who are not Jews were not trying to make themselves right with God, but they were made right with God because of their faith. 
ROM.9.31	The people of Israel tried to follow a law to make themselves right with God. But they did not succeed, 
ROM.9.32	because they tried to make themselves right by the things they did instead of trusting in God to make them right. They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble. 
ROM.9.33	As it is written in the Scripture:
ROM.9.33	“I will put in Jerusalem a stone that causes people to stumble,
ROM.9.33	a rock that makes them fall.
ROM.9.33	Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed.”
ROM.10.1	Brothers and sisters, the thing I want most is for all the Jews to be saved. That is my prayer to God. 
ROM.10.2	I can say this about them: They really try to follow God, but they do not know the right way. 
ROM.10.3	Because they did not know the way that God makes people right with him, they tried to make themselves right in their own way. So they did not accept God’s way of making people right. 
ROM.10.4	Christ ended the law so that everyone who believes in him may be right with God.
ROM.10.5	Moses writes about being made right by following the law. He says, “A person who obeys these things will live because of them.” 
ROM.10.6	But this is what the Scripture says about being made right through faith: “Don’t say to yourself, ‘Who will go up into heaven?’ ” (That means, “Who will go up to heaven and bring Christ down to earth?”) 
ROM.10.7	“And do not say, ‘Who will go down into the world below?’ ” (That means, “Who will go down and bring Christ up from the dead?”) 
ROM.10.8	This is what the Scripture says: “The word is near you; it is in your mouth and in your heart.” That is the teaching of faith that we are telling. 
ROM.10.9	If you declare with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and if you believe in your heart that God raised Jesus from the dead, you will be saved. 
ROM.10.10	We believe with our hearts, and so we are made right with God. And we declare with our mouths that we believe, and so we are saved. 
ROM.10.11	As the Scripture says, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be disappointed.” 
ROM.10.12	That Scripture says “anyone” because there is no difference between those who are Jews and those who are not. The same Lord is the Lord of all and gives many blessings to all who trust in him, 
ROM.10.13	as the Scripture says, “Anyone who calls on the Lord will be saved.”
ROM.10.14	But before people can ask the Lord for help, they must believe in him; and before they can believe in him, they must hear about him; and for them to hear about the Lord, someone must tell them; 
ROM.10.15	and before someone can go and tell them, that person must be sent. It is written, “How beautiful is the person who comes to bring good news.” 
ROM.10.16	But not all the Jews accepted the good news. Isaiah said, “Lord, who believed what we told them?” 
ROM.10.17	So faith comes from hearing the Good News, and people hear the Good News when someone tells them about Christ.
ROM.10.18	But I ask: Didn’t people hear the Good News? Yes, they heard—as the Scripture says:
ROM.10.18	“Their message went out through all the world;
ROM.10.18	their words go everywhere on earth.”
ROM.10.19	Again I ask: Didn’t the people of Israel understand? Yes, they did understand. First, Moses says:
ROM.10.19	“I will use those who are not a nation to make you jealous.
ROM.10.19	I will use a nation that does not understand to make you angry.”
ROM.10.20	Then Isaiah is bold enough to say:
ROM.10.20	“I was found by those who were not asking me for help.
ROM.10.20	I made myself known to people who were not looking for me.”
ROM.10.21	But about Israel God says,
ROM.10.21	“All day long I stood ready to accept
ROM.10.21	people who disobey and are stubborn.”
ROM.11.1	So I ask: Did God throw out his people? No! I myself am an Israelite from the family of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. 
ROM.11.2	God chose the Israelites to be his people before they were born, and he has not thrown his people out. Surely you know what the Scripture says about Elijah, how he prayed to God against the people of Israel. 
ROM.11.3	“Lord,” he said, “they have killed your prophets, and they have destroyed your altars. I am the only prophet left, and now they are trying to kill me, too.” 
ROM.11.4	But what answer did God give Elijah? He said, “But I have left seven thousand people in Israel who have never bowed down before Baal.” 
ROM.11.5	It is the same now. There are a few people that God has chosen by his grace. 
ROM.11.6	And if he chose them by grace, it is not for the things they have done. If they could be made God’s people by what they did, God’s gift of grace would not really be a gift.
ROM.11.7	So this is what has happened: Although the Israelites tried to be right with God, they did not succeed, but the ones God chose did become right with him. The others were made stubborn and refused to listen to God. 
ROM.11.8	As it is written in the Scriptures:
ROM.11.8	“God gave the people a dull mind so they could not understand.”
ROM.11.8	“He closed their eyes so they could not see
ROM.11.8	and their ears so they could not hear.
ROM.11.8	This continues until today.”
ROM.11.9	And David says:
ROM.11.9	“Let their own feasts trap them and cause their ruin;
ROM.11.9	let their feasts cause them to stumble and be paid back.
ROM.11.10	Let their eyes be closed so they cannot see
ROM.11.10	and their backs be forever weak from troubles.”
ROM.11.11	So I ask: When the Jews fell, did that fall destroy them? No! But their failure brought salvation to those who are not Jews, in order to make the Jews jealous. 
ROM.11.12	The Jews’ failure brought rich blessings for the world, and the Jews’ loss brought rich blessings for the non-Jewish people. So surely the world will receive much richer blessings when enough Jews become the kind of people God wants.
ROM.11.13	Now I am speaking to you who are not Jews. I am an apostle to those who are not Jews, and since I have that work, I will make the most of it. 
ROM.11.14	I hope I can make my own people jealous and, in that way, help some of them to be saved. 
ROM.11.15	When God turned away from the Jews, he became friends with other people in the world. So when God accepts the Jews, surely that will bring them life after death.
ROM.11.16	If the first piece of bread is offered to God, then the whole loaf is made holy. If the roots of a tree are holy, then the tree’s branches are holy too.
ROM.11.17	It is as if some of the branches from an olive tree have been broken off. You non-Jewish people are like the branch of a wild olive tree that has been joined to that first tree. You now share the strength and life of the first tree, the Jews. 
ROM.11.18	So do not brag about those branches that were broken off. If you brag, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you. 
ROM.11.19	You will say, “Branches were broken off so that I could be joined to their tree.” 
ROM.11.20	That is true. But those branches were broken off because they did not believe, and you continue to be part of the tree only because you believe. Do not be proud, but be afraid. 
ROM.11.21	If God did not let the natural branches of that tree stay, then he will not let you stay if you don’t believe.
ROM.11.22	So you see that God is kind and also very strict. He punishes those who stop following him. But God is kind to you, if you continue following in his kindness. If you do not, you will be cut off from the tree. 
ROM.11.23	And if the Jews will believe in God again, he will accept them back. God is able to put them back where they were. 
ROM.11.24	It is not natural for a wild branch to be part of a good tree. And you who are not Jews are like a branch cut from a wild olive tree and joined to a good olive tree. But since those Jews are like a branch that grew from the good tree, surely they can be joined to their own tree again.
ROM.11.25	I want you to understand this secret, brothers and sisters, so you will understand that you do not know everything: Part of Israel has been made stubborn, but that will change when many who are not Jews have come to God. 
ROM.11.26	And that is how all Israel will be saved. It is written in the Scriptures:
ROM.11.26	“The Savior will come from Jerusalem;
ROM.11.26	he will take away all evil from the family of Jacob.
ROM.11.27	And I will make this agreement with those people
ROM.11.27	when I take away their sins.”
ROM.11.28	The Jews refuse to accept the Good News, so they are God’s enemies. This has happened to help you who are not Jews. But the Jews are still God’s chosen people, and he loves them very much because of the promises he made to their ancestors. 
ROM.11.29	God never changes his mind about the people he calls and the things he gives them. 
ROM.11.30	At one time you refused to obey God. But now you have received mercy, because those people refused to obey. 
ROM.11.31	And now the Jews refuse to obey, because God showed mercy to you. But this happened so that they also can receive mercy from him. 
ROM.11.32	God has given all people over to their stubborn ways so that he can show mercy to all.
ROM.11.33	Yes, God’s riches are very great, and his wisdom and knowledge have no end! No one can explain the things God decides or understand his ways. 
ROM.11.34	As the Scripture says,
ROM.11.34	“Who has known the mind of the Lord,
ROM.11.34	or who has been able to give him advice?”
ROM.11.35	“No one has ever given God anything
ROM.11.35	that he must pay back.”
ROM.11.36	Yes, God made all things, and everything continues through him and for him. To him be the glory forever! Amen.
ROM.12.1	So brothers and sisters, since God has shown us great mercy, I beg you to offer your lives as a living sacrifice to him. Your offering must be only for God and pleasing to him, which is the spiritual way for you to worship. 
ROM.12.2	Do not be shaped by this world; instead be changed within by a new way of thinking. Then you will be able to decide what God wants for you; you will know what is good and pleasing to him and what is perfect. 
ROM.12.3	Because God has given me a special gift, I have something to say to everyone among you. Do not think you are better than you are. You must decide what you really are by the amount of faith God has given you. 
ROM.12.4	Each one of us has a body with many parts, and these parts all have different uses. 
ROM.12.5	In the same way, we are many, but in Christ we are all one body. Each one is a part of that body, and each part belongs to all the other parts. 
ROM.12.6	We all have different gifts, each of which came because of the grace God gave us. The person who has the gift of prophecy should use that gift in agreement with the faith. 
ROM.12.7	Anyone who has the gift of serving should serve. Anyone who has the gift of teaching should teach. 
ROM.12.8	Whoever has the gift of encouraging others should encourage. Whoever has the gift of giving to others should give freely. Anyone who has the gift of being a leader should try hard when he leads. Whoever has the gift of showing mercy to others should do so with joy.
ROM.12.9	Your love must be real. Hate what is evil, and hold on to what is good. 
ROM.12.10	Love each other like brothers and sisters. Give each other more honor than you want for yourselves. 
ROM.12.11	Do not be lazy but work hard, serving the Lord with all your heart. 
ROM.12.12	Be joyful because you have hope. Be patient when trouble comes, and pray at all times. 
ROM.12.13	Share with God’s people who need help. Bring strangers in need into your homes.
ROM.12.14	Wish good for those who harm you; wish them well and do not curse them. 
ROM.12.15	Be happy with those who are happy, and be sad with those who are sad. 
ROM.12.16	Live in peace with each other. Do not be proud, but make friends with those who seem unimportant. Do not think how smart you are.
ROM.12.17	If someone does wrong to you, do not pay him back by doing wrong to him. Try to do what everyone thinks is right. 
ROM.12.18	Do your best to live in peace with everyone. 
ROM.12.19	My friends, do not try to punish others when they wrong you, but wait for God to punish them with his anger. It is written: “I will punish those who do wrong; I will repay them,” says the Lord. 
ROM.12.20	But you should do this:
ROM.12.20	“If your enemy is hungry, feed him;
ROM.12.20	if he is thirsty, give him a drink.
ROM.12.20	Doing this will be like pouring burning coals on his head.”
ROM.12.21	Do not let evil defeat you, but defeat evil by doing good.
ROM.13.1	All of you must yield to the government rulers. No one rules unless God has given him the power to rule, and no one rules now without that power from God. 
ROM.13.2	So those who are against the government are really against what God has commanded. And they will bring punishment on themselves. 
ROM.13.3	Those who do right do not have to fear the rulers; only those who do wrong fear them. Do you want to be unafraid of the rulers? Then do what is right, and they will praise you. 
ROM.13.4	The ruler is God’s servant to help you. But if you do wrong, then be afraid. He has the power to punish; he is God’s servant to punish those who do wrong. 
ROM.13.5	So you must yield to the government, not only because you might be punished, but because you know it is right.
ROM.13.6	This is also why you pay taxes. Rulers are working for God and give their time to their work. 
ROM.13.7	Pay everyone, then, what you owe. If you owe any kind of tax, pay it. Show respect and honor to them all.
ROM.13.8	Do not owe people anything, except always owe love to each other, because the person who loves others has obeyed all the law. 
ROM.13.9	The law says, “You must not be guilty of adultery. You must not murder anyone. You must not steal. You must not want to take your neighbor’s things.” All these commands and all others are really only one rule: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” 
ROM.13.10	Love never hurts a neighbor, so loving is obeying all the law.
ROM.13.11	Do this because we live in an important time. It is now time for you to wake up from your sleep, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. 
ROM.13.12	The “night” is almost finished, and the “day” is almost here. So we should stop doing things that belong to darkness and take up the weapons used for fighting in the light. 
ROM.13.13	Let us live in a right way, like people who belong to the day. We should not have wild parties or get drunk. There should be no sexual sins of any kind, no fighting or jealousy. 
ROM.13.14	But clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ and forget about satisfying your sinful self.
ROM.14.1	Accept into your group someone who is weak in faith, and do not argue about opinions. 
ROM.14.2	One person believes it is right to eat all kinds of food. But another, who is weak, believes it is right to eat only vegetables. 
ROM.14.3	The one who knows that it is right to eat any kind of food must not reject the one who eats only vegetables. And the person who eats only vegetables must not think that the one who eats all foods is wrong, because God has accepted that person. 
ROM.14.4	You cannot judge another person’s servant. The master decides if the servant is doing well or not. And the Lord’s servant will do well because the Lord helps him do well.
ROM.14.5	Some think that one day is more important than another, and others think that every day is the same. Let all be sure in their own mind. 
ROM.14.6	Those who think one day is more important than other days are doing that for the Lord. And those who eat all kinds of food are doing that for the Lord, and they give thanks to God. Others who refuse to eat some foods do that for the Lord, and they give thanks to God. 
ROM.14.7	We do not live or die for ourselves. 
ROM.14.8	If we live, we are living for the Lord, and if we die, we are dying for the Lord. So living or dying, we belong to the Lord.
ROM.14.9	The reason Christ died and rose from the dead to live again was so he would be Lord over both the dead and the living. 
ROM.14.10	So why do you judge your brothers or sisters in Christ? And why do you think you are better than they are? We will all stand before God to be judged, 
ROM.14.11	because it is written in the Scriptures:
ROM.14.11	“ ‘As surely as I live,’ says the Lord,
ROM.14.11	‘Everyone will bow before me;
ROM.14.11	everyone will say that I am God.’ ”
ROM.14.12	So each of us will have to answer to God.
ROM.14.13	For that reason we should stop judging each other. We must make up our minds not to do anything that will make another Christian sin. 
ROM.14.14	I am in the Lord Jesus, and I know that there is no food that is wrong to eat. But if a person believes something is wrong, that thing is wrong for him. 
ROM.14.15	If you hurt your brother’s or sister’s faith because of something you eat, you are not really following the way of love. Do not destroy someone’s faith by eating food he thinks is wrong, because Christ died for him. 
ROM.14.16	Do not allow what you think is good to become what others say is evil. 
ROM.14.17	In the kingdom of God, eating and drinking are not important. The important things are living right with God, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. 
ROM.14.18	Anyone who serves Christ by living this way is pleasing God and will be accepted by other people.
ROM.14.19	So let us try to do what makes peace and helps one another. 
ROM.14.20	Do not let the eating of food destroy the work of God. All foods are all right to eat, but it is wrong to eat food that causes someone else to sin. 
ROM.14.21	It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that will cause your brother or sister to sin.
ROM.14.22	Your beliefs about these things should be kept secret between you and God. People are happy if they can do what they think is right without feeling guilty. 
ROM.14.23	But those who eat something without being sure it is right are wrong because they did not believe it was right. Anything that is done without believing it is right is a sin.
ROM.15.1	We who are strong in faith should help the weak with their weaknesses, and not please only ourselves. 
ROM.15.2	Let each of us please our neighbors for their good, to help them be stronger in faith. 
ROM.15.3	Even Christ did not live to please himself. It was as the Scriptures said: “When people insult you, it hurts me.” 
ROM.15.4	Everything that was written in the past was written to teach us. The Scriptures give us patience and encouragement so that we can have hope. 
ROM.15.5	May the patience and encouragement that come from God allow you to live in harmony with each other the way Christ Jesus wants. 
ROM.15.6	Then you will all be joined together, and you will give glory to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
ROM.15.7	Christ accepted you, so you should accept each other, which will bring glory to God. 
ROM.15.8	I tell you that Christ became a servant of the Jews to show that God’s promises to the Jewish ancestors are true. 
ROM.15.9	And he also did this so that those who are not Jews could give glory to God for the mercy he gives to them. It is written in the Scriptures:
ROM.15.9	“So I will praise you among the non-Jewish people.
ROM.15.9	I will sing praises to your name.”
ROM.15.10	The Scripture also says,
ROM.15.10	“Be happy, you who are not Jews, together with his people.”
ROM.15.11	Again the Scripture says,
ROM.15.11	“All you who are not Jews, praise the Lord.
ROM.15.11	All you people, sing praises to him.”
ROM.15.12	And Isaiah says,
ROM.15.12	“A new king will come from the family of Jesse.
ROM.15.12	He will come to rule over the non-Jewish people,
ROM.15.12	and they will have hope because of him.”
ROM.15.13	I pray that the God who gives hope will fill you with much joy and peace while you trust in him. Then your hope will overflow by the power of the Holy Spirit.
ROM.15.14	My brothers and sisters, I am sure that you are full of goodness. I know that you have all the knowledge you need and that you are able to teach each other. 
ROM.15.15	But I have written to you very openly about some things I wanted you to remember. I did this because God gave me this special gift: 
ROM.15.16	to be a minister of Christ Jesus to those who are not Jews. I served God by teaching his Good News, so that the non-Jewish people could be an offering that God would accept—an offering made holy by the Holy Spirit.
ROM.15.17	So I am proud of what I have done for God in Christ Jesus. 
ROM.15.18	I will not talk about anything except what Christ has done through me in leading those who are not Jews to obey God. They have obeyed God because of what I have said and done, 
ROM.15.19	because of the power of miracles and the great things they saw, and because of the power of the Holy Spirit. I preached the Good News from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum, and so I have finished that part of my work. 
ROM.15.20	I always want to preach the Good News in places where people have never heard of Christ, because I do not want to build on the work someone else has already started. 
ROM.15.21	But it is written in the Scriptures:
ROM.15.21	“Those who were not told about him will see,
ROM.15.21	and those who have not heard about him will understand.”
ROM.15.22	This is the reason I was stopped many times from coming to you. 
ROM.15.23	Now I have finished my work here. Since for many years I have wanted to come to you, 
ROM.15.24	I hope to visit you on my way to Spain. After I enjoy being with you for a while, I hope you can help me on my trip. 
ROM.15.25	Now I am going to Jerusalem to help God’s people. 
ROM.15.26	The believers in Macedonia and Southern Greece were happy to give their money to help the poor among God’s people at Jerusalem. 
ROM.15.27	They were happy to do this, and really they owe it to them. These who are not Jews have shared in the Jews’ spiritual blessings, so they should use their material possessions to help the Jews. 
ROM.15.28	After I am sure the poor in Jerusalem get the money that has been given for them, I will leave for Spain and stop and visit you. 
ROM.15.29	I know that when I come to you I will bring Christ’s full blessing.
ROM.15.30	Brothers and sisters, I beg you to help me in my work by praying to God for me. Do this because of our Lord Jesus and the love that the Holy Spirit gives us. 
ROM.15.31	Pray that I will be saved from the nonbelievers in Judea and that this help I bring to Jerusalem will please God’s people there. 
ROM.15.32	Then, if God wants me to, I will come to you with joy, and together you and I will have a time of rest. 
ROM.15.33	The God who gives peace be with you all. Amen.
ROM.16.1	I recommend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a helper in the church in Cenchrea. 
ROM.16.2	I ask you to accept her in the Lord in the way God’s people should. Help her with anything she needs, because she has helped me and many other people also.
ROM.16.3	Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, who work together with me in Christ Jesus 
ROM.16.4	and who risked their own lives to save my life. I am thankful to them, and all the non-Jewish churches are thankful as well. 
ROM.16.5	Also, greet for me the church that meets at their house.
ROM.16.5	Greetings to my dear friend Epenetus, who was the first person in Asia to follow Christ. 
ROM.16.6	Greetings to Mary, who worked very hard for you. 
ROM.16.7	Greetings to Andronicus and Junia, my relatives, who were in prison with me. They are very important apostles. They were believers in Christ before I was. 
ROM.16.8	Greetings to Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord. 
ROM.16.9	Greetings to Urbanus, a worker together with me for Christ. And greetings to my dear friend Stachys. 
ROM.16.10	Greetings to Apelles, who was tested and proved that he truly loves Christ. Greetings to all those who are in the family of Aristobulus. 
ROM.16.11	Greetings to Herodion, my fellow citizen. Greetings to all those in the family of Narcissus who belong to the Lord. 
ROM.16.12	Greetings to Tryphena and Tryphosa, women who work very hard for the Lord. Greetings to my dear friend Persis, who also has worked very hard for the Lord. 
ROM.16.13	Greetings to Rufus, who is a special person in the Lord, and to his mother, who has been like a mother to me also. 
ROM.16.14	Greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and all the brothers and sisters who are with them. 
ROM.16.15	Greetings to Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and to all God’s people with them. 
ROM.16.16	Greet each other with a holy kiss. All of Christ’s churches send greetings to you.
ROM.16.17	Brothers and sisters, I ask you to look out for those who cause people to be against each other and who upset other people’s faith. They are against the true teaching you learned, so stay away from them. 
ROM.16.18	Such people are not serving our Lord Christ but are only doing what pleases themselves. They use fancy talk and fine words to fool the minds of those who do not know about evil. 
ROM.16.19	All the believers have heard that you obey, so I am very happy because of you. But I want you to be wise in what is good and innocent in what is evil.
ROM.16.20	The God who brings peace will soon defeat Satan and give you power over him.
ROM.16.20	The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you.
ROM.16.21	Timothy, a worker together with me, sends greetings, as well as Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my relatives.
ROM.16.22	I am Tertius, and I am writing this letter from Paul. I send greetings to you in the Lord.
ROM.16.23	Gaius is letting me and the whole church here use his home. He also sends greetings to you, as do Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus. [
ROM.16.24	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. Amen.]
ROM.16.25	Glory to God who can make you strong in faith by the Good News that I tell people and by the message about Jesus Christ. The message about Christ is the secret that was hidden for long ages past but is now made known. 
ROM.16.26	It has been made clear through the writings of the prophets. And by the command of the eternal God it is made known to all nations that they might believe and obey.
ROM.16.27	To the only wise God be glory forever through Jesus Christ! Amen. 
1CO.1.1	From Paul. God called me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus because that is what God wanted. Also from Sosthenes, our brother in Christ.
1CO.1.2	To the church of God in Corinth, to you who have been made holy in Christ Jesus. You were called to be God’s holy people with all people everywhere who pray in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ—their Lord and ours:
1CO.1.3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.1.4	I always thank my God for you because of the grace God has given you in Christ Jesus. 
1CO.1.5	I thank God because in Christ you have been made rich in every way, in all your speaking and in all your knowledge. 
1CO.1.6	Just as our witness about Christ has been guaranteed to you, 
1CO.1.7	so you have every gift from God while you wait for our Lord Jesus Christ to come again. 
1CO.1.8	Jesus will keep you strong until the end so that there will be no wrong in you on the day our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. 
1CO.1.9	God, who has called you into fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord, is faithful.
1CO.1.10	I beg you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that all of you agree with each other and not be split into groups. I beg that you be completely joined together by having the same kind of thinking and the same purpose. 
1CO.1.11	My brothers and sisters, some people from Chloe’s family have told me quite plainly that there are quarrels among you. 
1CO.1.12	This is what I mean: One of you says, “I follow Paul”; another says, “I follow Apollos”; another says, “I follow Peter”; and another says, “I follow Christ.” 
1CO.1.13	Christ has been divided up into different groups! Did Paul die on the cross for you? No! Were you baptized in the name of Paul? No! 
1CO.1.14	I thank God I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius 
1CO.1.15	so that now no one can say you were baptized in my name. 
1CO.1.16	(I also baptized the family of Stephanas, but I do not remember that I baptized anyone else.) 
1CO.1.17	Christ did not send me to baptize people but to preach the Good News. And he sent me to preach the Good News without using words of human wisdom so that the cross of Christ would not lose its power.
1CO.1.18	The teaching about the cross is foolishness to those who are being lost, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. 
1CO.1.19	It is written in the Scriptures:
1CO.1.19	“I will cause the wise to lose their wisdom;
1CO.1.19	I will make the wise unable to understand.”
1CO.1.20	Where is the wise person? Where is the educated person? Where is the skilled talker of this world? God has made the wisdom of the world foolish. 
1CO.1.21	In the wisdom of God the world did not know God through its own wisdom. So God chose to use the message that sounds foolish to save those who believe. 
1CO.1.22	The Jews ask for miracles, and the Greeks want wisdom. 
1CO.1.23	But we preach a crucified Christ. This causes the Jews to stumble and is foolishness to non-Jews. 
1CO.1.24	But Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God to those people God has called—Jews and Greeks. 
1CO.1.25	Even the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.
1CO.1.26	Brothers and sisters, look at what you were when God called you. Not many of you were wise in the way the world judges wisdom. Not many of you had great influence. Not many of you came from important families. 
1CO.1.27	But God chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise, and he chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong. 
1CO.1.28	He chose what the world thinks is unimportant and what the world looks down on and thinks is nothing in order to destroy what the world thinks is important. 
1CO.1.29	God did this so that no one can brag in his presence. 
1CO.1.30	Because of God you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God. In Christ we are put right with God, and have been made holy, and have been set free from sin. 
1CO.1.31	So, as the Scripture says, “If people want to brag, they should brag only about the Lord.”
1CO.2.1	Dear brothers and sisters, when I came to you, I did not come preaching God’s secret with fancy words or a show of human wisdom. 
1CO.2.2	I decided that while I was with you I would forget about everything except Jesus Christ and his death on the cross. 
1CO.2.3	So when I came to you, I was weak and fearful and trembling. 
1CO.2.4	My teaching and preaching were not with words of human wisdom that persuade people but with proof of the power that the Spirit gives. 
1CO.2.5	This was so that your faith would be in God’s power and not in human wisdom.
1CO.2.6	However, I speak a wisdom to those who are mature. But this wisdom is not from this world or from the rulers of this world, who are losing their power. 
1CO.2.7	I speak God’s secret wisdom, which he has kept hidden. Before the world began, God planned this wisdom for our glory. 
1CO.2.8	None of the rulers of this world understood it. If they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 
1CO.2.9	But as it is written in the Scriptures:
1CO.2.9	“No one has ever seen this,
1CO.2.9	and no one has ever heard about it.
1CO.2.9	No one has ever imagined
1CO.2.9	what God has prepared for those who love him.”
1CO.2.10	But God has shown us these things through the Spirit.
1CO.2.10	The Spirit searches out all things, even the deep secrets of God. 
1CO.2.11	Who knows the thoughts that another person has? Only a person’s spirit that lives within him knows his thoughts. It is the same with God. No one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 
1CO.2.12	Now we did not receive the spirit of the world, but we received the Spirit that is from God so that we can know all that God has given us. 
1CO.2.13	And we speak about these things, not with words taught us by human wisdom but with words taught us by the Spirit. And so we explain spiritual truths to spiritual people. 
1CO.2.14	A person who does not have the Spirit does not accept the truths that come from the Spirit of God. That person thinks they are foolish and cannot understand them, because they can only be judged to be true by the Spirit. 
1CO.2.15	The spiritual person is able to judge all things, but no one can judge him. The Scripture says:
1CO.2.16	“Who has known the mind of the Lord?
1CO.2.16	Who has been able to teach him?”
1CO.2.16	But we have the mind of Christ.
1CO.3.1	Brothers and sisters, in the past I could not talk to you as I talk to spiritual people. I had to talk to you as I would to people without the Spirit—babies in Christ. 
1CO.3.2	The teaching I gave you was like milk, not solid food, because you were not able to take solid food. And even now you are not ready. 
1CO.3.3	You are still not spiritual, because there is jealousy and quarreling among you, and this shows that you are not spiritual. You are acting like people of the world. 
1CO.3.4	One of you says, “I belong to Paul,” and another says, “I belong to Apollos.” When you say things like this, you are acting like people of the world.
1CO.3.5	Is Apollos important? No! Is Paul important? No! We are only servants of God who helped you believe. Each one of us did the work God gave us to do. 
1CO.3.6	I planted the seed, and Apollos watered it. But God is the One who made it grow. 
1CO.3.7	So the one who plants is not important, and the one who waters is not important. Only God, who makes things grow, is important. 
1CO.3.8	The one who plants and the one who waters have the same purpose, and each will be rewarded for his own work. 
1CO.3.9	We are God’s workers, working together; you are like God’s farm, God’s house.
1CO.3.10	Using the gift God gave me, I laid the foundation of that house like an expert builder. Others are building on that foundation, but all people should be careful how they build on it. 
1CO.3.11	The foundation that has already been laid is Jesus Christ, and no one can lay down any other foundation. 
1CO.3.12	But if people build on that foundation, using gold, silver, jewels, wood, grass, or straw, 
1CO.3.13	their work will be clearly seen, because the Day of Judgment will make it visible. That Day will appear with fire, and the fire will test everyone’s work to show what sort of work it was. 
1CO.3.14	If the building that has been put on the foundation still stands, the builder will get a reward. 
1CO.3.15	But if the building is burned up, the builder will suffer loss. The builder will be saved, but it will be as one who escaped from a fire.
1CO.3.16	Don’t you know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you? 
1CO.3.17	If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy that person, because God’s temple is holy and you are that temple.
1CO.3.18	Do not fool yourselves. If you think you are wise in this world, you should become a fool so that you can become truly wise, 
1CO.3.19	because the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. It is written in the Scriptures, “He catches those who are wise in their own clever traps.” 
1CO.3.20	It is also written in the Scriptures, “The Lord knows what wise people think. He knows their thoughts are just a puff of wind.” 
1CO.3.21	So you should not brag about human leaders. All things belong to you: 
1CO.3.22	Paul, Apollos, and Peter; the world, life, death, the present, and the future—all these belong to you. 
1CO.3.23	And you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
1CO.4.1	People should think of us as servants of Christ, the ones God has trusted with his secrets. 
1CO.4.2	Now in this way those who are trusted with something valuable must show they are worthy of that trust. 
1CO.4.3	As for myself, I do not care if I am judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself. 
1CO.4.4	I know of no wrong I have done, but this does not make me right before the Lord. The Lord is the One who judges me. 
1CO.4.5	So do not judge before the right time; wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light things that are now hidden in darkness, and will make known the secret purposes of people’s hearts. Then God will praise each one of them.
1CO.4.6	Brothers and sisters, I have used Apollos and myself as examples so you could learn through us the meaning of the saying, “Follow only what is written in the Scriptures.” Then you will not be more proud of one person than another. 
1CO.4.7	Who says you are better than others? What do you have that was not given to you? And if it was given to you, why do you brag as if you did not receive it as a gift?
1CO.4.8	You think you already have everything you need. You think you are rich. You think you have become kings without us. I wish you really were kings so we could be kings together with you. 
1CO.4.9	But it seems to me that God has put us apostles in last place, like those sentenced to die. We are like a show for the whole world to see—angels and people. 
1CO.4.10	We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are very wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You receive honor, but we are shamed. 
1CO.4.11	Even to this very hour we do not have enough to eat or drink or to wear. We are often beaten, and we have no homes in which to live. 
1CO.4.12	We work hard with our own hands for our food. When people curse us, we bless them. When they hurt us, we put up with it. 
1CO.4.13	When they tell evil lies about us, we speak nice words about them. Even today, we are treated as though we were the garbage of the world—the filth of the earth.
1CO.4.14	I am not trying to make you feel ashamed. I am writing this to give you a warning as my own dear children. 
1CO.4.15	For though you may have ten thousand teachers in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Through the Good News I became your father in Christ Jesus, 
1CO.4.16	so I beg you, please follow my example. 
1CO.4.17	That is why I am sending to you Timothy, my son in the Lord. I love Timothy, and he is faithful. He will help you remember my way of life in Christ Jesus, just as I teach it in all the churches everywhere.
1CO.4.18	Some of you have become proud, thinking that I will not come to you again. 
1CO.4.19	But I will come to you very soon if the Lord wishes. Then I will know what the proud ones do, not what they say, 
1CO.4.20	because the kingdom of God is present not in talk but in power. 
1CO.4.21	Which do you want: that I come to you with punishment or with love and gentleness?
1CO.5.1	It is actually being said that there is sexual sin among you. And it is a kind that does not happen even among people who do not know God. A man there has his father’s wife. 
1CO.5.2	And you are proud! You should have been filled with sadness so that the man who did this should be put out of your group. 
1CO.5.3	I am not there with you in person, but I am with you in spirit. And I have already judged the man who did that sin as if I were really there. 
1CO.5.4	When you meet together in the name of our Lord Jesus, and I meet with you in spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus, 
1CO.5.5	then hand this man over to Satan. So his sinful self will be destroyed, and his spirit will be saved on the day of the Lord.
1CO.5.6	Your bragging is not good. You know the saying, “Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise.” 
1CO.5.7	Take out all the old yeast so that you will be a new batch of dough without yeast, which you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. 
1CO.5.8	So let us celebrate this feast, but not with the bread that has the old yeast—the yeast of sin and wickedness. Let us celebrate this feast with the bread that has no yeast—the bread of goodness and truth.
1CO.5.9	I wrote you in my earlier letter not to associate with those who sin sexually. 
1CO.5.10	But I did not mean you should not associate with those of this world who sin sexually, or with the greedy, or robbers, or those who worship idols. To get away from them you would have to leave this world. 
1CO.5.11	I am writing to tell you that you must not associate with those who call themselves believers in Christ but who sin sexually, or are greedy, or worship idols, or abuse others with words, or get drunk, or cheat people. Do not even eat with people like that.
1CO.5.12+1CO.5.13	It is not my business to judge those who are not part of the church. God will judge them. But you must judge the people who are part of the church. The Scripture says, “You must get rid of the evil person among you.”
1CO.6.1	When you have something against another Christian, how can you bring yourself to go before judges who are not right with God? Why do you not let God’s people decide who is right? 
1CO.6.2	Surely you know that God’s people will judge the world. So if you are to judge the world, are you not able to judge small cases as well? 
1CO.6.3	You know that in the future we will judge angels, so surely we can judge the ordinary things of this life. 
1CO.6.4	If you have ordinary cases that must be judged, are you going to appoint people as judges who mean nothing to the church? 
1CO.6.5	I say this to shame you. Surely there is someone among you wise enough to judge a complaint between believers. 
1CO.6.6	But now one believer goes to court against another believer—and you do this in front of unbelievers!
1CO.6.7	The fact that you have lawsuits against each other shows that you are already defeated. Why not let yourselves be wronged? Why not let yourselves be cheated? 
1CO.6.8	But you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and you do this to other believers!
1CO.6.9+1CO.6.10	Surely you know that the people who do wrong will not inherit God’s kingdom. Do not be fooled. Those who sin sexually, worship idols, take part in adultery, those who are male prostitutes, or men who have sexual relations with other men, those who steal, are greedy, get drunk, lie about others, or rob—these people will not inherit God’s kingdom. 
1CO.6.11	In the past, some of you were like that, but you were washed clean. You were made holy, and you were made right with God in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.
1CO.6.12	“I am allowed to do all things,” but not all things are good for me to do. “I am allowed to do all things,” but I will not let anything make me its slave. 
1CO.6.13	“Food is for the stomach, and the stomach for food,” but God will destroy them both. The body is not for sexual sin but for the Lord, and the Lord is for the body. 
1CO.6.14	By his power God has raised the Lord from the dead and will also raise us from the dead. 
1CO.6.15	Surely you know that your bodies are parts of Christ himself. So I must never take the parts of Christ and join them to a prostitute! 
1CO.6.16	It is written in the Scriptures, “The two will become one body.” So you should know that anyone who joins with a prostitute becomes one body with the prostitute. 
1CO.6.17	But the one who joins with the Lord is one spirit with the Lord.
1CO.6.18	So run away from sexual sin. Every other sin people do is outside their bodies, but those who sin sexually sin against their own bodies. 
1CO.6.19	You should know that your body is a temple for the Holy Spirit who is in you. You have received the Holy Spirit from God. So you do not belong to yourselves, 
1CO.6.20	because you were bought by God for a price. So honor God with your bodies.
1CO.7.1	Now I will discuss the things you wrote me about. It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman. 
1CO.7.2	But because sexual sin is a danger, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband. 
1CO.7.3	The husband should give his wife all that he owes her as his wife. And the wife should give her husband all that she owes him as her husband. 
1CO.7.4	The wife does not have full rights over her own body; her husband shares them. And the husband does not have full rights over his own body; his wife shares them. 
1CO.7.5	Do not refuse to give your bodies to each other, unless you both agree to stay away from sexual relations for a time so you can give your time to prayer. Then come together again so Satan cannot tempt you because of a lack of self-control. 
1CO.7.6	I say this to give you permission to stay away from sexual relations for a time. It is not a command to do so. 
1CO.7.7	I wish that everyone were like me, but each person has his own gift from God. One has one gift, another has another gift.
1CO.7.8	Now for those who are not married and for the widows I say this: It is good for them to stay unmarried as I am. 
1CO.7.9	But if they cannot control themselves, they should marry. It is better to marry than to burn with sexual desire.
1CO.7.10	Now I give this command for the married people. (The command is not from me; it is from the Lord.) A wife should not leave her husband. 
1CO.7.11	But if she does leave, she must not marry again, or she should make up with her husband. Also the husband should not divorce his wife.
1CO.7.12	For all the others I say this (I am saying this, not the Lord): If a Christian man has a wife who is not a believer, and she is happy to live with him, he must not divorce her. 
1CO.7.13	And if a Christian woman has a husband who is not a believer, and he is happy to live with her, she must not divorce him. 
1CO.7.14	The husband who is not a believer is made holy through his believing wife. And the wife who is not a believer is made holy through her believing husband. If this were not true, your children would not be clean, but now your children are holy.
1CO.7.15	But if those who are not believers decide to leave, let them leave. When this happens, the Christian man or woman is free. But God called us to live in peace. 
1CO.7.16	Wife, you don’t know; maybe you will save your husband. And husband, you don’t know; maybe you will save your wife.
1CO.7.17	But in any case each one of you should continue to live the way God has given you to live—the way you were when God called you. This is a rule I make in all the churches. 
1CO.7.18	If a man was already circumcised when he was called, he should not undo his circumcision. If a man was without circumcision when he was called, he should not be circumcised. 
1CO.7.19	It is not important if a man is circumcised or not. The important thing is obeying God’s commands. 
1CO.7.20	Each one of you should stay the way you were when God called you. 
1CO.7.21	If you were a slave when God called you, do not let that bother you. But if you can be free, then make good use of your freedom. 
1CO.7.22	Those who were slaves when the Lord called them are free persons who belong to the Lord. In the same way, those who were free when they were called are now Christ’s slaves. 
1CO.7.23	You all were bought at a great price, so do not become slaves of people. 
1CO.7.24	Brothers and sisters, each of you should stay as you were when you were called, and stay there with God.
1CO.7.25	Now I write about people who are not married. I have no command from the Lord about this; I give my opinion. But I can be trusted, because the Lord has shown me mercy. 
1CO.7.26	The present time is a time of trouble, so I think it is good for you to stay the way you are. 
1CO.7.27	If you have a wife, do not try to become free from her. If you are not married, do not try to find a wife. 
1CO.7.28	But if you decide to marry, you have not sinned. And if a girl who has never married decides to marry, she has not sinned. But those who marry will have trouble in this life, and I want you to be free from trouble.
1CO.7.29	Brothers and sisters, this is what I mean: We do not have much time left. So starting now, those who have wives should live as if they had no wives. 
1CO.7.30	Those who are crying should live as if they were not crying. Those who are happy should live as if they were not happy. Those who buy things should live as if they own nothing. 
1CO.7.31	Those who use the things of the world should live as if they were not using them, because this world in its present form will soon be gone.
1CO.7.32	I want you to be free from worry. A man who is not married is busy with the Lord’s work, trying to please the Lord. 
1CO.7.33	But a man who is married is busy with things of the world, trying to please his wife. 
1CO.7.34	He must think about two things—pleasing his wife and pleasing the Lord. A woman who is not married or a girl who has never married is busy with the Lord’s work. She wants to be holy in body and spirit. But a married woman is busy with things of the world, as to how she can please her husband. 
1CO.7.35	I am saying this to help you, not to limit you. But I want you to live in the right way, to give yourselves fully to the Lord without concern for other things.
1CO.7.36	If a man thinks he is not doing the right thing with the girl he is engaged to, if she is almost past the best age to marry and he feels he should marry her, he should do what he wants. They should get married. It is no sin. 
1CO.7.37	But if a man is sure in his mind that there is no need for marriage, and has his own desires under control, and has decided not to marry the one to whom he is engaged, he is doing the right thing. 
1CO.7.38	So the man who marries his girl does right, but the man who does not marry will do better.
1CO.7.39	A woman must stay with her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry any man she wants, but she must marry another believer. 
1CO.7.40	The woman is happier if she does not marry again. This is my opinion, but I believe I also have God’s Spirit.
1CO.8.1	Now I will write about meat that is sacrificed to idols. We know that “we all have knowledge.” Knowledge puffs you up with pride, but love builds up. 
1CO.8.2	If you think you know something, you do not yet know anything as you should. 
1CO.8.3	But if any person loves God, that person is known by God.
1CO.8.4	So this is what I say about eating meat sacrificed to idols: We know that an idol is really nothing in the world, and we know there is only one God. 
1CO.8.5	Even though there are things called gods, in heaven or on earth (and there are many “gods” and “lords”), 
1CO.8.6	for us there is only one God—our Father. All things came from him, and we live for him. And there is only one Lord—Jesus Christ. All things were made through him, and we also were made through him.
1CO.8.7	But not all people know this. Some people are still so used to idols that when they eat meat, they still think of it as being sacrificed to an idol. Because their conscience is weak, when they eat it, they feel guilty. 
1CO.8.8	But food will not bring us closer to God. Refusing to eat does not make us less pleasing to God, and eating does not make us better in God’s sight.
1CO.8.9	But be careful that your freedom does not cause those who are weak in faith to fall into sin. 
1CO.8.10	Suppose one of you who has knowledge eats in an idol’s temple. Someone who is weak in faith might see you eating there and be encouraged to eat meat sacrificed to idols while thinking it is wrong to do so. 
1CO.8.11	This weak believer for whom Christ died is ruined because of your “knowledge.” 
1CO.8.12	When you sin against your brothers and sisters in Christ like this and cause them to do what they feel is wrong, you are also sinning against Christ. 
1CO.8.13	So if the food I eat causes them to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again so that I will not cause any of them to sin.
1CO.9.1	I am a free man. I am an apostle. I have seen Jesus our Lord. You people are all an example of my work in the Lord. 
1CO.9.2	If others do not accept me as an apostle, surely you do, because you are proof that I am an apostle in the Lord.
1CO.9.3	This is the answer I give people who want to judge me: 
1CO.9.4	Do we not have the right to eat and drink? 
1CO.9.5	Do we not have the right to bring a believing wife with us when we travel as do the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Peter? 
1CO.9.6	Are Barnabas and I the only ones who must work to earn our living? 
1CO.9.7	No soldier ever serves in the army and pays his own salary. No one ever plants a vineyard without eating some of the grapes. No person takes care of a flock without drinking some of the milk.
1CO.9.8	I do not say this by human authority; God’s law also says the same thing. 
1CO.9.9	It is written in the law of Moses: “When an ox is working in the grain, do not cover its mouth to keep it from eating.” When God said this, was he thinking only about oxen? No. 
1CO.9.10	He was really talking about us. Yes, that Scripture was written for us, because it goes on to say: “The one who plows and the one who works in the grain should hope to get some of the grain for their work.” 
1CO.9.11	Since we planted spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we should harvest material things? 
1CO.9.12	If others have the right to get something from you, surely we have this right, too. But we do not use it. No, we put up with everything ourselves so that we will not keep anyone from believing the Good News of Christ. 
1CO.9.13	Surely you know that those who work at the Temple get their food from the Temple, and those who serve at the altar get part of what is offered at the altar. 
1CO.9.14	In the same way, the Lord has commanded that those who tell the Good News should get their living from this work.
1CO.9.15	But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing this now to get anything from you. I would rather die than to have my reason for bragging taken away. 
1CO.9.16	Telling the Good News does not give me any reason for bragging. Telling the Good News is my duty—something I must do. And how terrible it will be for me if I do not tell the Good News. 
1CO.9.17	If I preach because it is my own choice, I have a reward. But if I preach and it is not my choice to do so, I am only doing the duty that was given to me. 
1CO.9.18	So what reward do I get? This is my reward: that when I tell the Good News I can offer it freely. I do not use my full rights in my work of preaching the Good News.
1CO.9.19	I am free and belong to no one. But I make myself a slave to all people to win as many as I can. 
1CO.9.20	To the Jews I became like a Jew to win the Jews. I myself am not ruled by the law. But to those who are ruled by the law I became like a person who is ruled by the law. I did this to win those who are ruled by the law. 
1CO.9.21	To those who are without the law I became like a person who is without the law. I did this to win those people who are without the law. (But really, I am not without God’s law—I am ruled by Christ’s law.) 
1CO.9.22	To those who are weak, I became weak so I could win the weak. I have become all things to all people so I could save some of them in any way possible. 
1CO.9.23	I do all this because of the Good News and so I can share in its blessings.
1CO.9.24	You know that in a race all the runners run, but only one gets the prize. So run to win! 
1CO.9.25	All those who compete in the games use self-control so they can win a crown. That crown is an earthly thing that lasts only a short time, but our crown will never be destroyed. 
1CO.9.26	So I do not run without a goal. I fight like a boxer who is hitting something—not just the air. 
1CO.9.27	I treat my body hard and make it my slave so that I myself will not be disqualified after I have preached to others.
1CO.10.1	Brothers and sisters, I want you to know what happened to our ancestors who followed Moses. They were all under the cloud and all went through the sea. 
1CO.10.2	They were all baptized as followers of Moses in the cloud and in the sea. 
1CO.10.3	They all ate the same spiritual food, 
1CO.10.4	and all drank the same spiritual drink. They drank from that spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ. 
1CO.10.5	But God was not pleased with most of them, so they died in the desert.
1CO.10.6	And these things happened as examples for us, to stop us from wanting evil things as those people did. 
1CO.10.7	Do not worship idols, as some of them did. Just as it is written in the Scriptures: “They sat down to eat and drink, and then they got up and sinned sexually.” 
1CO.10.8	We must not take part in sexual sins, as some of them did. In one day twenty-three thousand of them died because of their sins. 
1CO.10.9	We must not test Christ as some of them did; they were killed by snakes. 
1CO.10.10	Do not complain as some of them did; they were killed by the angel that destroys.
1CO.10.11	The things that happened to those people are examples. They were written down to teach us, because we live in a time when all these things of the past have reached their goal. 
1CO.10.12	If you think you are strong, you should be careful not to fall. 
1CO.10.13	The only temptation that has come to you is that which everyone has. But you can trust God, who will not permit you to be tempted more than you can stand. But when you are tempted, he will also give you a way to escape so that you will be able to stand it.
1CO.10.14	So, my dear friends, run away from the worship of idols. 
1CO.10.15	I am speaking to you as to reasonable people; judge for yourselves what I say. 
1CO.10.16	We give thanks for the cup of blessing, which is a sharing in the blood of Christ. And the bread that we break is a sharing in the body of Christ. 
1CO.10.17	Because there is one loaf of bread, we who are many are one body, because we all share that one loaf.
1CO.10.18	Think about the Israelites: Do not those who eat the sacrifices share in the altar? 
1CO.10.19	I do not mean that the food sacrificed to an idol is important. I do not mean that an idol is anything at all. 
1CO.10.20	But I say that what is sacrificed to idols is offered to demons, not to God. And I do not want you to share anything with demons. 
1CO.10.21	You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons also. You cannot share in the Lord’s table and the table of demons. 
1CO.10.22	Are we trying to make the Lord jealous? We are not stronger than he is, are we?
1CO.10.23	“We are allowed to do all things,” but not all things are good for us to do. “We are allowed to do all things,” but not all things help others grow stronger. 
1CO.10.24	Do not look out only for yourselves. Look out for the good of others also.
1CO.10.25	Eat any meat that is sold in the meat market. Do not ask questions about it. 
1CO.10.26	You may eat it, “because the earth belongs to the Lord, and everything in it.”
1CO.10.27	Those who are not believers may invite you to eat with them. If you want to go, eat anything that is put before you. Do not ask questions about it. 
1CO.10.28	But if anyone says to you, “That food was offered to idols,” do not eat it. Do not eat it because of that person who told you and because eating it might be thought to be wrong. 
1CO.10.29	I don’t mean you think it is wrong, but the other person might. But why, you ask, should my freedom be judged by someone else’s conscience? 
1CO.10.30	If I eat the meal with thankfulness, why am I criticized because of something for which I thank God?
1CO.10.31	The answer is, if you eat or drink, or if you do anything, do it all for the glory of God. 
1CO.10.32	Never do anything that might hurt others—Jews, Greeks, or God’s church— 
1CO.10.33	just as I, also, try to please everybody in every way. I am not trying to do what is good for me but what is good for most people so they can be saved.
1CO.11.1	Follow my example, as I follow the example of Christ.
1CO.11.2	I praise you because you remember me in everything, and you follow closely the teachings just as I gave them to you. 
1CO.11.3	But I want you to understand this: The head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is the man, and the head of Christ is God. 
1CO.11.4	Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered brings shame to his head. 
1CO.11.5	But every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered brings shame to her head. She is the same as a woman who has her head shaved. 
1CO.11.6	If a woman does not cover her head, she should have her hair cut off. But since it is shameful for a woman to cut off her hair or to shave her head, she should cover her head. 
1CO.11.7	But a man should not cover his head, because he is the likeness and glory of God. But woman is man’s glory. 
1CO.11.8	Man did not come from woman, but woman came from man. 
1CO.11.9	And man was not made for woman, but woman was made for man. 
1CO.11.10	So that is why a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
1CO.11.11	But in the Lord women are not independent of men, and men are not independent of women. 
1CO.11.12	This is true because woman came from man, but also man is born from woman. But everything comes from God. 
1CO.11.13	Decide this for yourselves: Is it right for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? 
1CO.11.14	Even nature itself teaches you that wearing long hair is shameful for a man. 
1CO.11.15	But long hair is a woman’s glory. Long hair is given to her as a covering. 
1CO.11.16	Some people may still want to argue about this, but I would add that neither we nor the churches of God have any other practice.
1CO.11.17	In the things I tell you now I do not praise you, because when you come together you do more harm than good. 
1CO.11.18	First, I hear that when you meet together as a church you are divided, and I believe some of this. 
1CO.11.19	(It is necessary to have differences among you so that it may be clear which of you really have God’s approval.) 
1CO.11.20	When you come together, you are not really eating the Lord’s Supper. 
1CO.11.21	This is because when you eat, each person eats without waiting for the others. Some people do not get enough to eat, while others have too much to drink. 
1CO.11.22	You can eat and drink in your own homes! You seem to think God’s church is not important, and you embarrass those who are poor. What should I tell you? Should I praise you? I do not praise you for doing this.
1CO.11.23	The teaching I gave you is the same teaching I received from the Lord: On the night when the Lord Jesus was handed over to be killed, he took bread 
1CO.11.24	and gave thanks for it. Then he broke the bread and said, 
1CO.11.25	In the same way, after they ate, Jesus took the cup. He said, 
1CO.11.26	Every time you eat this bread and drink this cup you are telling others about the Lord’s death until he comes.
1CO.11.27	So a person who eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in a way that is not worthy of it will be guilty of sinning against the body and the blood of the Lord. 
1CO.11.28	Look into your own hearts before you eat the bread and drink the cup, 
1CO.11.29	because all who eat the bread and drink the cup without recognizing the body eat and drink judgment against themselves. 
1CO.11.30	That is why many in your group are sick and weak, and some of you have died. 
1CO.11.31	But if we judged ourselves in the right way, God would not judge us. 
1CO.11.32	But when the Lord judges us, he disciplines us so that we will not be destroyed along with the world.
1CO.11.33	So my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for each other. 
1CO.11.34	Anyone who is too hungry should eat at home so that in meeting together you will not bring God’s judgment on yourselves. I will tell you what to do about the other things when I come.
1CO.12.1	Now, brothers and sisters, I want you to understand about spiritual gifts. 
1CO.12.2	You know the way you lived before you were believers. You let yourselves be influenced and led away to worship idols—things that could not speak. 
1CO.12.3	So I want you to understand that no one who is speaking with the help of God’s Spirit says, “Jesus be cursed.” And no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” without the help of the Holy Spirit.
1CO.12.4	There are different kinds of gifts, but they are all from the same Spirit. 
1CO.12.5	There are different ways to serve but the same Lord to serve. 
1CO.12.6	And there are different ways that God works through people but the same God. God works in all of us in everything we do. 
1CO.12.7	Something from the Spirit can be seen in each person, for the common good. 
1CO.12.8	The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak with wisdom, and the same Spirit gives another the ability to speak with knowledge. 
1CO.12.9	The same Spirit gives faith to one person. And, to another, that one Spirit gives gifts of healing. 
1CO.12.10	The Spirit gives to another person the power to do miracles, to another the ability to prophesy. And he gives to another the ability to know the difference between good and evil spirits. The Spirit gives one person the ability to speak in different kinds of languages and to another the ability to interpret those languages. 
1CO.12.11	One Spirit, the same Spirit, does all these things, and the Spirit decides what to give each person.
1CO.12.12	A person’s body is one thing, but it has many parts. Though there are many parts to a body, all those parts make only one body. Christ is like that also. 
1CO.12.13	Some of us are Jews, and some are Greeks. Some of us are slaves, and some are free. But we were all baptized into one body through one Spirit. And we were all made to share in the one Spirit.
1CO.12.14	The human body has many parts. 
1CO.12.15	The foot might say, “Because I am not a hand, I am not part of the body.” But saying this would not stop the foot from being a part of the body. 
1CO.12.16	The ear might say, “Because I am not an eye, I am not part of the body.” But saying this would not stop the ear from being a part of the body. 
1CO.12.17	If the whole body were an eye, it would not be able to hear. If the whole body were an ear, it would not be able to smell. 
1CO.12.18+1CO.12.19	If each part of the body were the same part, there would be no body. But truly God put all the parts, each one of them, in the body as he wanted them. 
1CO.12.20	So then there are many parts, but only one body.
1CO.12.21	The eye cannot say to the hand, “I don’t need you!” And the head cannot say to the foot, “I don’t need you!” 
1CO.12.22	No! Those parts of the body that seem to be the weaker are really necessary. 
1CO.12.23	And the parts of the body we think are less deserving are the parts to which we give the most honor. We give special respect to the parts we want to hide. 
1CO.12.24	The more respectable parts of our body need no special care. But God put the body together and gave more honor to the parts that need it 
1CO.12.25	so our body would not be divided. God wanted the different parts to care the same for each other. 
1CO.12.26	If one part of the body suffers, all the other parts suffer with it. Or if one part of our body is honored, all the other parts share its honor.
1CO.12.27	Together you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of that body. 
1CO.12.28	In the church God has given a place first to apostles, second to prophets, and third to teachers. Then God has given a place to those who do miracles, those who have gifts of healing, those who can help others, those who are able to govern, and those who can speak in different languages. 
1CO.12.29	Not all are apostles. Not all are prophets. Not all are teachers. Not all do miracles. 
1CO.12.30	Not all have gifts of healing. Not all speak in different languages. Not all interpret those languages. 
1CO.12.31	But you should truly want to have the greater gifts.
1CO.12.31	And now I will show you the best way of all.
1CO.13.1	I may speak in different languages of people or even angels. But if I do not have love, I am only a noisy bell or a crashing cymbal. 
1CO.13.2	I may have the gift of prophecy. I may understand all the secret things of God and have all knowledge, and I may have faith so great I can move mountains. But even with all these things, if I do not have love, then I am nothing. 
1CO.13.3	I may give away everything I have, and I may even give my body as an offering to be burned. But I gain nothing if I do not have love.
1CO.13.4	Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous, it does not brag, and it is not proud. 
1CO.13.5	Love is not rude, is not selfish, and does not get upset with others. Love does not count up wrongs that have been done. 
1CO.13.6	Love takes no pleasure in evil but rejoices over the truth. 
1CO.13.7	Love patiently accepts all things. It always trusts, always hopes, and always endures.
1CO.13.8	Love never ends. There are gifts of prophecy, but they will be ended. There are gifts of speaking in different languages, but those gifts will stop. There is the gift of knowledge, but it will come to an end. 
1CO.13.9	The reason is that our knowledge and our ability to prophesy are not perfect. 
1CO.13.10	But when perfection comes, the things that are not perfect will end. 
1CO.13.11	When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I stopped those childish ways. 
1CO.13.12	It is the same with us. Now we see a dim reflection, as if we were looking into a mirror, but then we shall see clearly. Now I know only a part, but then I will know fully, as God has known me. 
1CO.13.13	So these three things continue forever: faith, hope, and love. And the greatest of these is love.
1CO.14.1	You should seek after love, and you should truly want to have the spiritual gifts, especially the gift of prophecy. 
1CO.14.2	I will explain why. Those who have the gift of speaking in different languages are not speaking to people; they are speaking to God. No one understands them; they are speaking secret things through the Spirit. 
1CO.14.3	But those who prophesy are speaking to people to give them strength, encouragement, and comfort. 
1CO.14.4	The ones who speak in different languages are helping only themselves, but those who prophesy are helping the whole church. 
1CO.14.5	I wish all of you had the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages, but more, I wish you would prophesy. Those who prophesy are greater than those who can only speak in different languages—unless someone is there who can explain what is said so that the whole church can be helped.
1CO.14.6	Brothers and sisters, will it help you if I come to you speaking in different languages? No! It will help you only if I bring you a new truth or some new knowledge, or prophecy, or teaching. 
1CO.14.7	It is the same as with lifeless things that make sounds—like a flute or a harp. If they do not make clear musical notes, you will not know what is being played. 
1CO.14.8	And in a war, if the trumpet does not give a clear sound, who will prepare for battle? 
1CO.14.9	It is the same with you. Unless you speak clearly with your tongue, no one can understand what you are saying. You will be talking into the air! 
1CO.14.10	It may be true that there are all kinds of sounds in the world, and none is without meaning. 
1CO.14.11	But unless I understand the meaning of what someone says to me, we will be like foreigners to each other. 
1CO.14.12	It is the same with you. Since you want spiritual gifts very much, seek most of all to have the gifts that help the church grow stronger.
1CO.14.13	The one who has the gift of speaking in a different language should pray for the gift to interpret what is spoken. 
1CO.14.14	If I pray in a different language, my spirit is praying, but my mind does nothing. 
1CO.14.15	So what should I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing with my spirit, but I will also sing with my mind. 
1CO.14.16	If you praise God with your spirit, those persons there without understanding cannot say amen to your prayer of thanks, because they do not know what you are saying. 
1CO.14.17	You may be thanking God in a good way, but the other person is not helped.
1CO.14.18	I thank God that I speak in different kinds of languages more than all of you. 
1CO.14.19	But in the church meetings I would rather speak five words I understand in order to teach others than thousands of words in a different language.
1CO.14.20	Brothers and sisters, do not think like children. In evil things be like babies, but in your thinking you should be like adults. 
1CO.14.21	It is written in the Scriptures:
1CO.14.21	“With people who use strange words and foreign languages
1CO.14.21	I will speak to these people.
1CO.14.21	But even then they will not listen to me,”
1CO.14.21	says the Lord.
1CO.14.22	So the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages is a sign for those who do not believe, not for those who do believe. And prophecy is for people who believe, not for those who do not believe. 
1CO.14.23	Suppose the whole church meets together and everyone speaks in different languages. If some people come in who do not understand or do not believe, they will say you are crazy. 
1CO.14.24	But suppose everyone is prophesying and some people come in who do not believe or do not understand. If everyone is prophesying, their sin will be shown to them, and they will be judged by all that they hear. 
1CO.14.25	The secret things in their hearts will be made known. So they will bow down and worship God saying, “Truly, God is with you.”
1CO.14.26	So, brothers and sisters, what should you do? When you meet together, one person has a song, and another has a teaching. Another has a new truth from God. Another speaks in a different language, and another person interprets that language. The purpose of all these things should be to help the church grow strong. 
1CO.14.27	When you meet together, if anyone speaks in a different language, it should be only two, or not more than three, who speak. They should speak one after the other, and someone should interpret. 
1CO.14.28	But if there is no interpreter, then those who speak in a different language should be quiet in the church meeting. They should speak only to themselves and to God.
1CO.14.29	Only two or three prophets should speak, and the others should judge what they say. 
1CO.14.30	If a message from God comes to another person who is sitting, the first speaker should stop. 
1CO.14.31	You can all prophesy one after the other. In this way all the people can be taught and encouraged. 
1CO.14.32	The spirits of prophets are under the control of the prophets themselves. 
1CO.14.33	God is not a God of confusion but a God of peace.
1CO.14.33	As is true in all the churches of God’s people, 
1CO.14.34	women should keep quiet in the church meetings. They are not allowed to speak, but they must yield to this rule as the law says. 
1CO.14.35	If they want to learn something, they should ask their own husbands at home. It is shameful for a woman to speak in the church meeting. 
1CO.14.36	Did God’s teaching come from you? Or are you the only ones to whom it has come?
1CO.14.37	Those who think they are prophets or spiritual persons should understand that what I am writing to you is the Lord’s command. 
1CO.14.38	Those who ignore this will be ignored by God.
1CO.14.39	So my brothers and sisters, you should truly want to prophesy. But do not stop people from using the gift of speaking in different kinds of languages. 
1CO.14.40	But let everything be done in a right and orderly way.
1CO.15.1	Now, brothers and sisters, I want you to remember the Good News I brought to you. You received this Good News and continue strong in it. 
1CO.15.2	And you are being saved by it if you continue believing what I told you. If you do not, then you believed for nothing.
1CO.15.3	I passed on to you what I received, of which this was most important: that Christ died for our sins, as the Scriptures say; 
1CO.15.4	that he was buried and was raised to life on the third day as the Scriptures say; 
1CO.15.5	and that he was seen by Peter and then by the twelve apostles. 
1CO.15.6	After that, Jesus was seen by more than five hundred of the believers at the same time. Most of them are still living today, but some have died. 
1CO.15.7	Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles. 
1CO.15.8	Last of all he was seen by me—as by a person not born at the normal time. 
1CO.15.9	All the other apostles are greater than I am. I am not even good enough to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. 
1CO.15.10	But God’s grace has made me what I am, and his grace to me was not wasted. I worked harder than all the other apostles. (But it was not I really; it was God’s grace that was with me.) 
1CO.15.11	So if I preached to you or the other apostles preached to you, we all preach the same thing, and this is what you believed.
1CO.15.12	Now since we preached that Christ was raised from the dead, why do some of you say that people will not be raised from the dead? 
1CO.15.13	If no one is ever raised from the dead, then Christ has not been raised. 
1CO.15.14	And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is worth nothing, and your faith is worth nothing. 
1CO.15.15	And also, we are guilty of lying about God, because we testified of him that he raised Christ from the dead. But if people are not raised from the dead, then God never raised Christ. 
1CO.15.16	If the dead are not raised, Christ has not been raised either. 
1CO.15.17	And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith has nothing to it; you are still guilty of your sins. 
1CO.15.18	And those in Christ who have already died are lost. 
1CO.15.19	If our hope in Christ is for this life only, we should be pitied more than anyone else in the world.
1CO.15.20	But Christ has truly been raised from the dead—the first one and proof that those who sleep in death will also be raised. 
1CO.15.21	Death has come because of what one man did, but the rising from death also comes because of one man. 
1CO.15.22	In Adam all of us die. In the same way, in Christ all of us will be made alive again. 
1CO.15.23	But everyone will be raised to life in the right order. Christ was first to be raised. When Christ comes again, those who belong to him will be raised to life, 
1CO.15.24	and then the end will come. At that time Christ will destroy all rulers, authorities, and powers, and he will hand over the kingdom to God the Father. 
1CO.15.25	Christ must rule until he puts all enemies under his control. 
1CO.15.26	The last enemy to be destroyed will be death. 
1CO.15.27	The Scripture says that God put all things under his control. When it says “all things” are under him, it is clear this does not include God himself. God is the One who put everything under his control. 
1CO.15.28	After everything has been put under the Son, then he will put himself under God, who had put all things under him. Then God will be the complete ruler over everything.
1CO.15.29	If the dead are never raised, what will people do who are being baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people being baptized for them?
1CO.15.30	And what about us? Why do we put ourselves in danger every hour? 
1CO.15.31	I die every day. That is true, brothers and sisters, just as it is true that I brag about you in Christ Jesus our Lord. 
1CO.15.32	If I fought wild animals in Ephesus only with human hopes, I have gained nothing. If the dead are not raised, “Let us eat and drink, because tomorrow we will die.”
1CO.15.33	Do not be fooled: “Bad friends will ruin good habits.” 
1CO.15.34	Come back to your right way of thinking and stop sinning. Some of you do not know God—I say this to shame you.
1CO.15.35	But someone may ask, “How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have?” 
1CO.15.36	Foolish person! When you sow a seed, it must die in the ground before it can live and grow. 
1CO.15.37	And when you sow it, it does not have the same “body” it will have later. What you sow is only a bare seed, maybe wheat or something else. 
1CO.15.38	But God gives it a body that he has planned for it, and God gives each kind of seed its own body. 
1CO.15.39	All things made of flesh are not the same: People have one kind of flesh, animals have another, birds have another, and fish have another. 
1CO.15.40	Also there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. But the beauty of the heavenly bodies is one kind, and the beauty of the earthly bodies is another. 
1CO.15.41	The sun has one kind of beauty, the moon has another beauty, and the stars have another. And each star is different in its beauty.
1CO.15.42	It is the same with the dead who are raised to life. The body that is “planted” will ruin and decay, but it is raised to a life that cannot be destroyed. 
1CO.15.43	When the body is “planted,” it is without honor, but it is raised in glory. When the body is “planted,” it is weak, but when it is raised, it is powerful. 
1CO.15.44	The body that is “planted” is a physical body. When it is raised, it is a spiritual body.
1CO.15.44	There is a physical body, and there is also a spiritual body. 
1CO.15.45	It is written in the Scriptures: “The first man, Adam, became a living person.” But the last Adam became a spirit that gives life. 
1CO.15.46	The spiritual did not come first, but the physical and then the spiritual. 
1CO.15.47	The first man came from the dust of the earth. The second man came from heaven. 
1CO.15.48	People who belong to the earth are like the first man of earth. But those people who belong to heaven are like the man of heaven. 
1CO.15.49	Just as we were made like the man of earth, so we will also be made like the man of heaven.
1CO.15.50	I tell you this, brothers and sisters: Flesh and blood cannot have a part in the kingdom of God. Something that will ruin cannot have a part in something that never ruins. 
1CO.15.51	But look! I tell you this secret: We will not all sleep in death, but we will all be changed. 
1CO.15.52	It will take only a second—as quickly as an eye blinks—when the last trumpet sounds. The trumpet will sound, and those who have died will be raised to live forever, and we will all be changed. 
1CO.15.53	This body that can be destroyed must clothe itself with something that can never be destroyed. And this body that dies must clothe itself with something that can never die. 
1CO.15.54	So this body that can be destroyed will clothe itself with that which can never be destroyed, and this body that dies will clothe itself with that which can never die. When this happens, this Scripture will be made true:
1CO.15.54	“Death is destroyed forever in victory.”
1CO.15.55	“Death, where is your victory?
1CO.15.55	Death, where is your pain?”
1CO.15.56	Death’s power to hurt is sin, and the power of sin is the law. 
1CO.15.57	But we thank God! He gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
1CO.15.58	So my dear brothers and sisters, stand strong. Do not let anything move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your work in the Lord is never wasted.
1CO.16.1	Now I will write about the collection of money for God’s people. Do the same thing I told the Galatian churches to do: 
1CO.16.2	On the first day of every week, each one of you should put aside money as you have been blessed. Save it up so you will not have to collect money after I come. 
1CO.16.3	When I arrive, I will send whomever you approve to take your gift to Jerusalem. I will send them with letters of introduction, 
1CO.16.4	and if it seems good for me to go also, they will go along with me.
1CO.16.5	I plan to go through Macedonia, so I will come to you after I go through there. 
1CO.16.6	Perhaps I will stay with you for a time or even all winter. Then you can help me on my trip, wherever I go. 
1CO.16.7	I do not want to see you now just in passing. I hope to stay a longer time with you if the Lord allows it. 
1CO.16.8	But I will stay at Ephesus until Pentecost, 
1CO.16.9	because a good opportunity for a great and growing work has been given to me now. And there are many people working against me.
1CO.16.10	If Timothy comes to you, see to it that he has nothing to fear with you, because he is working for the Lord just as I am. 
1CO.16.11	So none of you should treat Timothy as unimportant, but help him on his trip in peace so that he can come back to me. I am expecting him to come with the brothers.
1CO.16.12	Now about our brother Apollos: I strongly encouraged him to visit you with the other brothers. He did not at all want to come now; he will come when he has the opportunity.
1CO.16.13	Be alert. Continue strong in the faith. Have courage, and be strong. 
1CO.16.14	Do everything in love.
1CO.16.15	You know that the family of Stephanas were the first believers in Southern Greece and that they have given themselves to the service of God’s people. I ask you, brothers and sisters, 
1CO.16.16	to follow the leading of people like these and anyone else who works and serves with them.
1CO.16.17	I am happy that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have come. You are not here, but they have filled your place. 
1CO.16.18	They have refreshed my spirit and yours. You should recognize the value of people like these.
1CO.16.19	The churches in Asia send greetings to you. Aquila and Priscilla greet you in the Lord, as does the church that meets in their house. 
1CO.16.20	All the brothers and sisters here send greetings. Give each other a holy kiss when you meet.
1CO.16.21	I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand.
1CO.16.22	If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be separated from God—lost forever!
1CO.16.22	Come, O Lord!
1CO.16.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
1CO.16.24	My love be with all of you in Christ Jesus.
2CO.1.1	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. I am an apostle because that is what God wanted. Also from Timothy our brother in Christ.
2CO.1.1	To the church of God in Corinth, and to all of God’s people everywhere in Southern Greece:
2CO.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2CO.1.3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is the Father who is full of mercy and all comfort. 
2CO.1.4	He comforts us every time we have trouble, so when others have trouble, we can comfort them with the same comfort God gives us. 
2CO.1.5	We share in the many sufferings of Christ. In the same way, much comfort comes to us through Christ. 
2CO.1.6	If we have troubles, it is for your comfort and salvation, and if we have comfort, you also have comfort. This helps you to accept patiently the same sufferings we have. 
2CO.1.7	Our hope for you is strong, knowing that you share in our sufferings and also in the comfort we receive.
2CO.1.8	Brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the trouble we suffered in Asia. We had great burdens there that were beyond our own strength. We even gave up hope of living. 
2CO.1.9	Truly, in our own hearts we believed we would die. But this happened so we would not trust in ourselves but in God, who raises people from the dead. 
2CO.1.10	God saved us from these great dangers of death, and he will continue to save us. We have put our hope in him, and he will save us again. 
2CO.1.11	And you can help us with your prayers. Then many people will give thanks for us—that God blessed us because of their many prayers.
2CO.1.12	This is what we are proud of, and I can say it with a clear conscience: In everything we have done in the world, and especially with you, we have had an honest and sincere heart from God. We did this by God’s grace, not by the kind of wisdom the world has. 
2CO.1.13+2CO.1.14	We write to you only what you can read and understand. And I hope that as you have understood some things about us, you may come to know everything about us. Then you can be proud of us, as we will be proud of you on the day our Lord Jesus Christ comes again.
2CO.1.15	I was so sure of all this that I made plans to visit you first so you could be blessed twice. 
2CO.1.16	I planned to visit you on my way to Macedonia and again on my way back. I wanted to get help from you for my trip to Judea. 
2CO.1.17	Do you think that I made these plans without really meaning it? Or maybe you think I make plans as the world does, so that I say yes, yes and at the same time no, no.
2CO.1.18	But since you can believe God, you can believe that what we tell you is never both yes and no. 
2CO.1.19	The Son of God, Jesus Christ, that Silas and Timothy and I preached to you, was not yes and no. In Christ it has always been yes. 
2CO.1.20	The yes to all of God’s promises is in Christ, and through Christ we say yes to the glory of God. 
2CO.1.21	Remember, God is the One who makes you and us strong in Christ. God made us his chosen people. 
2CO.1.22	He put his mark on us to show that we are his, and he put his Spirit in our hearts to be a guarantee for all he has promised.
2CO.1.23	I tell you this, and I ask God to be my witness that this is true: The reason I did not come back to Corinth was to keep you from being punished or hurt. 
2CO.1.24	We are not trying to control your faith. You are strong in faith. But we are workers with you for your own joy.
2CO.2.1	So I decided that my next visit to you would not be another one to make you sad. 
2CO.2.2	If I make you sad, who will make me glad? Only you can make me glad—particularly the person whom I made sad. 
2CO.2.3	I wrote you a letter for this reason: that when I came to you I would not be made sad by the people who should make me happy. I felt sure of all of you, that you would share my joy. 
2CO.2.4	When I wrote to you before, I was very troubled and unhappy in my heart, and I wrote with many tears. I did not write to make you sad, but to let you know how much I love you.
2CO.2.5	Someone there among you has caused sadness, not to me, but to all of you. I mean he caused sadness to all in some way. (I do not want to make it sound worse than it really is.) 
2CO.2.6	The punishment that most of you gave him is enough for him. 
2CO.2.7	But now you should forgive him and comfort him to keep him from having too much sadness and giving up completely. 
2CO.2.8	So I beg you to show that you love him. 
2CO.2.9	I wrote you to test you and to see if you obey in everything. 
2CO.2.10	If you forgive someone, I also forgive him. And what I have forgiven—if I had anything to forgive—I forgave it for you, as if Christ were with me. 
2CO.2.11	I did this so that Satan would not win anything from us, because we know very well what Satan’s plans are.
2CO.2.12	When I came to Troas to preach the Good News of Christ, the Lord gave me a good opportunity there. 
2CO.2.13	But I had no peace, because I did not find my brother Titus. So I said good-bye to them at Troas and went to Macedonia.
2CO.2.14	But thanks be to God, who always leads us as captives in Christ’s victory parade. God uses us to spread his knowledge everywhere like a sweet-smelling perfume. 
2CO.2.15	Our offering to God is this: We are the sweet smell of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are being lost. 
2CO.2.16	To those who are lost, we are the smell of death that brings death, but to those who are being saved, we are the smell of life that brings life. So who is able to do this work? 
2CO.2.17	We do not sell the word of God for a profit as many other people do. But in Christ we speak the truth before God, as messengers of God.
2CO.3.1	Are we starting to brag about ourselves again? Do we need letters of introduction to you or from you, like some other people? 
2CO.3.2	You yourselves are our letter, written on our hearts, known and read by everyone. 
2CO.3.3	You show that you are a letter from Christ sent through us. This letter is not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God. It is not written on stone tablets but on human hearts.
2CO.3.4	We can say this, because through Christ we feel certain before God. 
2CO.3.5	We are not saying that we can do this work ourselves. It is God who makes us able to do all that we do. 
2CO.3.6	He made us able to be servants of a new agreement from himself to his people. This new agreement is not a written law, but it is of the Spirit. The written law brings death, but the Spirit gives life.
2CO.3.7	The law that brought death was written in words on stone. It came with God’s glory, which made Moses’ face so bright that the Israelites could not continue to look at it. But that glory later disappeared. 
2CO.3.8	So surely the new way that brings the Spirit has even more glory. 
2CO.3.9	If the law that judged people guilty of sin had glory, surely the new way that makes people right with God has much greater glory. 
2CO.3.10	That old law had glory, but it really loses its glory when it is compared to the much greater glory of this new way. 
2CO.3.11	If that law which disappeared came with glory, then this new way which continues forever has much greater glory.
2CO.3.12	We have this hope, so we are very bold. 
2CO.3.13	We are not like Moses, who put a covering over his face so the Israelites would not see it. The glory was disappearing, and Moses did not want them to see it end. 
2CO.3.14	But their minds were closed, and even today that same covering hides the meaning when they read the old agreement. That covering is taken away only through Christ. 
2CO.3.15	Even today, when they read the law of Moses, there is a covering over their minds. 
2CO.3.16	But when a person changes and follows the Lord, that covering is taken away. 
2CO.3.17	The Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 
2CO.3.18	Our faces, then, are not covered. We all show the Lord’s glory, and we are being changed to be like him. This change in us brings ever greater glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit.
2CO.4.1	God, with his mercy, gave us this work to do, so we don’t give up. 
2CO.4.2	But we have turned away from secret and shameful ways. We use no trickery, and we do not change the teaching of God. We teach the truth plainly, showing everyone who we are. Then they can know in their hearts what kind of people we are in God’s sight. 
2CO.4.3	If the Good News that we preach is hidden, it is hidden only to those who are lost. 
2CO.4.4	The devil who rules this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe. They cannot see the light of the Good News—the Good News about the glory of Christ, who is exactly like God. 
2CO.4.5	We do not preach about ourselves, but we preach that Jesus Christ is Lord and that we are your servants for Jesus. 
2CO.4.6	God once said, “Let the light shine out of the darkness!” This is the same God who made his light shine in our hearts by letting us know the glory of God that is in the face of Christ.
2CO.4.7	We have this treasure from God, but we are like clay jars that hold the treasure. This shows that the great power is from God, not from us. 
2CO.4.8	We have troubles all around us, but we are not defeated. We do not know what to do, but we do not give up the hope of living. 
2CO.4.9	We are persecuted, but God does not leave us. We are hurt sometimes, but we are not destroyed. 
2CO.4.10	We carry the death of Jesus in our own bodies so that the life of Jesus can also be seen in our bodies. 
2CO.4.11	We are alive, but for Jesus we are always in danger of death so that the life of Jesus can be seen in our bodies that die. 
2CO.4.12	So death is working in us, but life is working in you.
2CO.4.13	It is written in the Scriptures, “I believed, so I spoke.” Our faith is like this, too. We believe, and so we speak. 
2CO.4.14	God raised the Lord Jesus from the dead, and we know that God will also raise us with Jesus. God will bring us together with you, and we will stand before him. 
2CO.4.15	All these things are for you. And so the grace of God that is being given to more and more people will bring increasing thanks to God for his glory.
2CO.4.16	So we do not give up. Our physical body is becoming older and weaker, but our spirit inside us is made new every day. 
2CO.4.17	We have small troubles for a while now, but they are helping us gain an eternal glory that is much greater than the troubles. 
2CO.4.18	We set our eyes not on what we see but on what we cannot see. What we see will last only a short time, but what we cannot see will last forever.
2CO.5.1	We know that our body—the tent we live in here on earth—will be destroyed. But when that happens, God will have a house for us. It will not be a house made by human hands; instead, it will be a home in heaven that will last forever. 
2CO.5.2	But now we groan in this tent. We want God to give us our heavenly home, 
2CO.5.3	because it will clothe us so we will not be naked. 
2CO.5.4	While we live in this body, we have burdens, and we groan. We do not want to be naked, but we want to be clothed with our heavenly home. Then this body that dies will be fully covered with life. 
2CO.5.5	This is what God made us for, and he has given us the Spirit to be a guarantee for this new life.
2CO.5.6	So we always have courage. We know that while we live in this body, we are away from the Lord. 
2CO.5.7	We live by what we believe, not by what we can see. 
2CO.5.8	So I say that we have courage. We really want to be away from this body and be at home with the Lord. 
2CO.5.9	Our only goal is to please God whether we live here or there, 
2CO.5.10	because we must all stand before Christ to be judged. Each of us will receive what we should get—good or bad—for the things we did in the earthly body.
2CO.5.11	Since we know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to help people accept the truth about us. God knows what we really are, and I hope that in your hearts you know, too. 
2CO.5.12	We are not trying to prove ourselves to you again, but we are telling you about ourselves so you will be proud of us. Then you will have an answer for those who are proud about things that can be seen rather than what is in the heart. 
2CO.5.13	If we are out of our minds, it is for God. If we have our right minds, it is for you. 
2CO.5.14	The love of Christ controls us, because we know that One died for all, so all have died. 
2CO.5.15	Christ died for all so that those who live would not continue to live for themselves. He died for them and was raised from the dead so that they would live for him.
2CO.5.16	From this time on we do not think of anyone as the world does. In the past we thought of Christ as the world thinks, but we no longer think of him in that way. 
2CO.5.17	If anyone belongs to Christ, there is a new creation. The old things have gone; everything is made new! 
2CO.5.18	All this is from God. Through Christ, God made peace between us and himself, and God gave us the work of telling everyone about the peace we can have with him. 
2CO.5.19	God was in Christ, making peace between the world and himself. In Christ, God did not hold the world guilty of its sins. And he gave us this message of peace. 
2CO.5.20	So we have been sent to speak for Christ. It is as if God is calling to you through us. We speak for Christ when we beg you to be at peace with God. 
2CO.5.21	Christ had no sin, but God made him become sin so that in Christ we could become right with God.
2CO.6.1	We are workers together with God, so we beg you: Do not let the grace that you received from God be for nothing. 
2CO.6.2	God says,
2CO.6.2	“At the right time I heard your prayers.
2CO.6.2	On the day of salvation I helped you.”
2CO.6.2	I tell you that the “right time” is now, and the “day of salvation” is now.
2CO.6.3	We do not want anyone to find fault with our work, so nothing we do will be a problem for anyone. 
2CO.6.4	But in every way we show we are servants of God: in accepting many hard things, in troubles, in difficulties, and in great problems. 
2CO.6.5	We are beaten and thrown into prison. We meet those who become upset with us and start riots. We work hard, and sometimes we get no sleep or food. 
2CO.6.6	We show we are servants of God by our pure lives, our understanding, patience, and kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by true love, 
2CO.6.7	by speaking the truth, and by God’s power. We use our right living to defend ourselves against everything. 
2CO.6.8	Some people honor us, but others blame us. Some people say evil things about us, but others say good things. Some people say we are liars, but we speak the truth. 
2CO.6.9	We are not known, but we are well known. We seem to be dying, but we continue to live. We are punished, but we are not killed. 
2CO.6.10	We have much sadness, but we are always rejoicing. We are poor, but we are making many people rich in faith. We have nothing, but really we have everything.
2CO.6.11	We have spoken freely to you in Corinth and have opened our hearts to you. 
2CO.6.12	Our feelings of love for you have not stopped, but you have stopped your feelings of love for us. 
2CO.6.13	I speak to you as if you were my children. Do to us as we have done—open your hearts to us.
2CO.6.14	You are not the same as those who do not believe. So do not join yourselves to them. Good and bad do not belong together. Light and darkness cannot share together. 
2CO.6.15	How can Christ and Belial, the devil, have any agreement? What can a believer have together with a nonbeliever? 
2CO.6.16	The temple of God cannot have any agreement with idols, and we are the temple of the living God. As God said: “I will live with them and walk with them. And I will be their God, and they will be my people.”
2CO.6.17	“Leave those people,
2CO.6.17	and be separate, says the Lord.
2CO.6.17	Touch nothing that is unclean,
2CO.6.17	and I will accept you.”
2CO.6.18	“I will be your father,
2CO.6.18	and you will be my sons and daughters,
2CO.6.18	says the Lord Almighty.” 
2CO.7.1	Dear friends, we have these promises from God, so we should make ourselves pure—free from anything that makes body or soul unclean. We should try to become holy in the way we live, because we respect God.
2CO.7.2	Open your hearts to us. We have not done wrong to anyone, we have not ruined the faith of anyone, and we have not cheated anyone. 
2CO.7.3	I do not say this to blame you. I told you before that we love you so much we would live or die with you. 
2CO.7.4	I feel very sure of you and am very proud of you. You give me much comfort, and in all of our troubles I have great joy.
2CO.7.5	When we came into Macedonia, we had no rest. We found trouble all around us. We had fighting on the outside and fear on the inside. 
2CO.7.6	But God, who comforts those who are troubled, comforted us when Titus came. 
2CO.7.7	We were comforted, not only by his coming but also by the comfort you gave him. Titus told us about your wish to see me and that you are very sorry for what you did. He also told me about your great care for me, and when I heard this, I was much happier.
2CO.7.8	Even if my letter made you sad, I am not sorry I wrote it. At first I was sorry, because it made you sad, but you were sad only for a short time. 
2CO.7.9	Now I am happy, not because you were made sad, but because your sorrow made you change your lives. You became sad in the way God wanted you to, so you were not hurt by us in any way. 
2CO.7.10	The kind of sorrow God wants makes people change their hearts and lives. This leads to salvation, and you cannot be sorry for that. But the kind of sorrow the world has brings death. 
2CO.7.11	See what this sorrow—the sorrow God wanted you to have—has done to you: It has made you very serious. It made you want to restore yourselves. It made you angry and afraid. It made you want to see me. It made you care. It made you want to do the right thing. In every way you have regained your innocence. 
2CO.7.12	I wrote that letter, not because of the one who did the wrong or because of the person who was hurt. I wrote the letter so you could see, before God, the great care you have for us. 
2CO.7.13	That is why we were comforted.
2CO.7.13	Not only were we very comforted, we were even happier to see that Titus was so happy. All of you made him feel much better. 
2CO.7.14	I bragged to Titus about you, and you showed that I was right. Everything we said to you was true, and you have proved that what we bragged about to Titus is true. 
2CO.7.15	And his love for you is stronger when he remembers that you were all ready to obey. You welcomed him with respect and fear. 
2CO.7.16	I am very happy that I can trust you fully.
2CO.8.1	And now, brothers and sisters, we want you to know about the grace God gave the churches in Macedonia. 
2CO.8.2	They have been tested by great troubles, and they are very poor. But they gave much because of their great joy. 
2CO.8.3	I can tell you that they gave as much as they were able and even more than they could afford. No one told them to do it. 
2CO.8.4	But they begged and pleaded with us to let them share in this service for God’s people. 
2CO.8.5	And they gave in a way we did not expect: They first gave themselves to the Lord and to us. This is what God wants. 
2CO.8.6	So we asked Titus to help you finish this special work of grace since he is the one who started it. 
2CO.8.7	You are rich in everything—in faith, in speaking, in knowledge, in truly wanting to help, and in the love you learned from us. In the same way, be strong also in the grace of giving.
2CO.8.8	I am not commanding you to give. But I want to see if your love is true by comparing you with others that really want to help. 
2CO.8.9	You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. You know that Christ was rich, but for you he became poor so that by his becoming poor you might become rich.
2CO.8.10	This is what I think you should do: Last year you were the first to want to give, and you were the first who gave. 
2CO.8.11	So now finish the work you started. Then your “doing” will be equal to your “wanting to do.” Give from what you have. 
2CO.8.12	If you want to give, your gift will be accepted. It will be judged by what you have, not by what you do not have. 
2CO.8.13	We do not want you to have troubles while other people are at ease, but we want everything to be equal. 
2CO.8.14	At this time you have plenty. What you have can help others who are in need. Then later, when they have plenty, they can help you when you are in need, and all will be equal. 
2CO.8.15	As it is written in the Scriptures, “The person who gathered more did not have too much, nor did the person who gathered less have too little.”
2CO.8.16	I thank God because he gave Titus the same love for you that I have. 
2CO.8.17	Titus accepted what we asked him to do. He wanted very much to go to you, and this was his own idea. 
2CO.8.18	We are sending with him the brother who is praised by all the churches because of his service in preaching the Good News. 
2CO.8.19	Also, this brother was chosen by the churches to go with us when we deliver this gift of money. We are doing this service to bring glory to the Lord and to show that we really want to help.
2CO.8.20	We are being careful so that no one will criticize us for the way we are handling this large gift. 
2CO.8.21	We are trying hard to do what the Lord accepts as right and also what people think is right.
2CO.8.22	Also, we are sending with them our brother, who is always ready to help. He has proved this to us in many ways, and he wants to help even more now, because he has much faith in you.
2CO.8.23	Now about Titus—he is my partner who is working with me to help you. And about the other brothers—they are sent from the churches, and they bring glory to Christ. 
2CO.8.24	So show these men the proof of your love and the reason we are proud of you. Then all the churches can see it.
2CO.9.1	I really do not need to write you about this help for God’s people. 
2CO.9.2	I know you want to help. I have been bragging about this to the people in Macedonia, telling them that you in Southern Greece have been ready to give since last year. And your desire to give has made most of them ready to give also. 
2CO.9.3	But I am sending the brothers to you so that our bragging about you in this will not be empty words. I want you to be ready, as I said you would be. 
2CO.9.4	If any of the people from Macedonia come with me and find that you are not ready, we will be ashamed that we were so sure of you. (And you will be ashamed, too!) 
2CO.9.5	So I thought I should ask these brothers to go to you before we do. They will finish getting in order the generous gift you promised so it will be ready when we come. And it will be a generous gift—not one that you did not want to give.
2CO.9.6	Remember this: The person who plants a little will have a small harvest, but the person who plants a lot will have a big harvest. 
2CO.9.7	Each of you should give as you have decided in your heart to give. You should not be sad when you give, and you should not give because you feel forced to give. God loves the person who gives happily. 
2CO.9.8	And God can give you more blessings than you need. Then you will always have plenty of everything—enough to give to every good work. 
2CO.9.9	It is written in the Scriptures:
2CO.9.9	“He gives freely to the poor.
2CO.9.9	The things he does are right and will continue forever.”
2CO.9.10	God is the One who gives seed to the farmer and bread for food. He will give you all the seed you need and make it grow so there will be a great harvest from your goodness. 
2CO.9.11	He will make you rich in every way so that you can always give freely. And your giving through us will cause many to give thanks to God. 
2CO.9.12	This service you do not only helps the needs of God’s people, it also brings many more thanks to God. 
2CO.9.13	It is a proof of your faith. Many people will praise God because you obey the Good News of Christ—the gospel you say you believe—and because you freely share with them and with all others. 
2CO.9.14	And when they pray, they will wish they could be with you because of the great grace that God has given you. 
2CO.9.15	Thanks be to God for his gift that is too wonderful for words.
2CO.10.1	I, Paul, am begging you with the gentleness and the kindness of Christ. Some people say that I am easy on you when I am with you and bold when I am away. 
2CO.10.2	They think we live in a worldly way, and I plan to be very bold with them when I come. I beg you that when I come I will not need to use that same boldness with you. 
2CO.10.3	We do live in the world, but we do not fight in the same way the world fights. 
2CO.10.4	We fight with weapons that are different from those the world uses. Our weapons have power from God that can destroy the enemy’s strong places. We destroy people’s arguments 
2CO.10.5	and every proud thing that raises itself against the knowledge of God. We capture every thought and make it give up and obey Christ. 
2CO.10.6	We are ready to punish anyone there who does not obey, but first we want you to obey fully.
2CO.10.7	You must look at the facts before you. If you feel sure that you belong to Christ, you must remember that we belong to Christ just as you do. 
2CO.10.8	It is true that we brag freely about the authority the Lord gave us. But this authority is to build you up, not to tear you down. So I will not be ashamed. 
2CO.10.9	I do not want you to think I am trying to scare you with my letters. 
2CO.10.10	Some people say, “Paul’s letters are powerful and sound important, but when he is with us, he is weak. And his speaking is nothing.” 
2CO.10.11	They should know this: We are not there with you now, so we say these things in letters. But when we are there with you, we will show the same authority that we show in our letters.
2CO.10.12	We do not dare to compare ourselves with those who think they are very important. They use themselves to measure themselves, and they judge themselves by what they themselves are. This shows that they know nothing. 
2CO.10.13	But we will not brag about things outside the work that was given us to do. We will limit our bragging to the work that God gave us, and this includes our work with you. 
2CO.10.14	We are not bragging too much, as we would be if we had not already come to you. But we have come to you with the Good News of Christ. 
2CO.10.15	We limit our bragging to the work that is ours, not what others have done. We hope that as your faith continues to grow, you will help our work to grow much larger. 
2CO.10.16	We want to tell the Good News in the areas beyond your city. We do not want to brag about work that has already been done in another person’s area. 
2CO.10.17	But, “If people want to brag, they should brag only about the Lord.” 
2CO.10.18	It is not those who say they are good who are accepted but those the Lord thinks are good.
2CO.11.1	I wish you would be patient with me even when I am a little foolish, but you are already doing that. 
2CO.11.2	I am jealous over you with a jealousy that comes from God. I promised to give you to Christ, as your only husband. I want to give you as his pure bride. 
2CO.11.3	But I am afraid that your minds will be led away from your true and pure following of Christ just as Eve was tricked by the snake with his evil ways. 
2CO.11.4	You are very patient with anyone who comes to you and preaches a different Jesus from the one we preached. You are very willing to accept a spirit or gospel that is different from the Spirit and Good News you received from us.
2CO.11.5	I do not think that those “great apostles” are any better than I am. 
2CO.11.6	I may not be a trained speaker, but I do have knowledge. We have shown this to you clearly in every way.
2CO.11.7	I preached God’s Good News to you without pay. I made myself unimportant to make you important. Do you think that was wrong? 
2CO.11.8	I accepted pay from other churches, taking their money so I could serve you. 
2CO.11.9	If I needed something when I was with you, I did not trouble any of you. The brothers who came from Macedonia gave me all that I needed. I did not allow myself to depend on you in any way, and I will never depend on you. 
2CO.11.10	No one in Southern Greece will stop me from bragging about that. I say this with the truth of Christ in me. 
2CO.11.11	And why do I not depend on you? Do you think it is because I do not love you? God knows that I love you.
2CO.11.12	And I will continue doing what I am doing now, because I want to stop those people from having a reason to brag. They would like to say that the work they brag about is the same as ours. 
2CO.11.13	Such men are not true apostles but are workers who lie. They change themselves to look like apostles of Christ. 
2CO.11.14	This does not surprise us. Even Satan changes himself to look like an angel of light. 
2CO.11.15	So it does not surprise us if Satan’s servants also make themselves look like servants who work for what is right. But in the end they will be punished for what they do.
2CO.11.16	I tell you again: No one should think I am a fool. But if you think so, accept me as you would accept a fool. Then I can brag a little, too. 
2CO.11.17	When I brag because I feel sure of myself, I am not talking as the Lord would talk but as a fool. 
2CO.11.18	Many people are bragging about their lives in the world. So I will brag too. 
2CO.11.19	You are wise, so you will gladly be patient with fools! 
2CO.11.20	You are even patient with those who order you around, or use you, or trick you, or think they are better than you, or hit you in the face. 
2CO.11.21	It is shameful to me to say this, but we were too “weak” to do those things to you!
2CO.11.21	But if anyone else is brave enough to brag, then I also will be brave and brag. (I am talking as a fool.) 
2CO.11.22	Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they from Abraham’s family? So am I. 
2CO.11.23	Are they serving Christ? I am serving him more. (I am crazy to talk like this.) I have worked much harder than they. I have been in prison more often. I have been hurt more in beatings. I have been near death many times. 
2CO.11.24	Five times the Jews have given me their punishment of thirty-nine lashes with a whip. 
2CO.11.25	Three different times I was beaten with rods. One time I was almost stoned to death. Three times I was in ships that wrecked, and one of those times I spent a night and a day in the sea. 
2CO.11.26	I have gone on many travels and have been in danger from rivers, thieves, my own people, the Jews, and those who are not Jews. I have been in danger in cities, in places where no one lives, and on the sea. And I have been in danger with false Christians. 
2CO.11.27	I have done hard and tiring work, and many times I did not sleep. I have been hungry and thirsty, and many times I have been without food. I have been cold and without clothes. 
2CO.11.28	Besides all this, there is on me every day the load of my concern for all the churches. 
2CO.11.29	I feel weak every time someone is weak, and I feel upset every time someone is led into sin.
2CO.11.30	If I must brag, I will brag about the things that show I am weak. 
2CO.11.31	God knows I am not lying. He is the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, and he is to be praised forever. 
2CO.11.32	When I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas wanted to arrest me, so he put guards around the city. 
2CO.11.33	But my friends lowered me in a basket through a hole in the city wall. So I escaped from the governor.
2CO.12.1	I must continue to brag. It will do no good, but I will talk now about visions and revelations from the Lord. 
2CO.12.2	I know a man in Christ who was taken up to the third heaven fourteen years ago. I do not know whether the man was in his body or out of his body, but God knows. 
2CO.12.3+2CO.12.4	And I know that this man was taken up to paradise. I don’t know if he was in his body or away from his body, but God knows. He heard things he is not able to explain, things that no human is allowed to tell. 
2CO.12.5	I will brag about a man like that, but I will not brag about myself, except about my weaknesses. 
2CO.12.6	But if I wanted to brag about myself, I would not be a fool, because I would be telling the truth. But I will not brag about myself. I do not want people to think more of me than what they see me do or hear me say.
2CO.12.7	So that I would not become too proud of the wonderful things that were shown to me, a painful physical problem was given to me. This problem was a messenger from Satan, sent to beat me and keep me from being too proud. 
2CO.12.8	I begged the Lord three times to take this problem away from me. 
2CO.12.9	But he said to me, 
2CO.12.10	For this reason I am happy when I have weaknesses, insults, hard times, sufferings, and all kinds of troubles for Christ. Because when I am weak, then I am truly strong.
2CO.12.11	I have been talking like a fool, but you made me do it. You are the ones who should say good things about me. I am worth nothing, but those “great apostles” are not worth any more than I am!
2CO.12.12	When I was with you, I patiently did the things that prove I am an apostle—signs, wonders, and miracles. 
2CO.12.13	So you received everything that the other churches have received. Only one thing was different: I was not a burden to you. Forgive me for this!
2CO.12.14	I am now ready to visit you the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. I want nothing from you, except you. Children should not have to save up to give to their parents. Parents should save to give to their children. 
2CO.12.15	So I am happy to give everything I have for you, even myself. If I love you more, will you love me less?
2CO.12.16	It is clear I was not a burden to you, but you think I was tricky and lied to catch you. 
2CO.12.17	Did I cheat you by using any of the messengers I sent to you? No, you know I did not. 
2CO.12.18	I asked Titus to go to you, and I sent our brother with him. Titus did not cheat you, did he? No, you know that Titus and I did the same thing and with the same spirit.
2CO.12.19	Do you think we have been defending ourselves to you all this time? We have been speaking in Christ and before God. You are our dear friends, and everything we do is to make you stronger. 
2CO.12.20	I am afraid that when I come, you will not be what I want you to be, and I will not be what you want me to be. I am afraid that among you there may be arguing, jealousy, anger, selfish fighting, evil talk, gossip, pride, and confusion. 
2CO.12.21	I am afraid that when I come to you again, my God will make me ashamed before you. I may be saddened by many of those who have sinned because they have not changed their hearts or turned from their sexual sins and the shameful things they have done.
2CO.13.1	I will come to you for the third time. “Every case must be proved by two or three witnesses.” 
2CO.13.2	When I was with you the second time, I gave a warning to those who had sinned. Now I am away from you, and I give a warning to all the others. When I come to you again, I will not be easy with them. 
2CO.13.3	You want proof that Christ is speaking through me. My proof is that he is not weak among you, but he is powerful. 
2CO.13.4	It is true that he was weak when he was killed on the cross, but he lives now by God’s power. It is true that we are weak in Christ, but for you we will be alive in Christ by God’s power.
2CO.13.5	Look closely at yourselves. Test yourselves to see if you are living in the faith. You know that Jesus Christ is in you—unless you fail the test. 
2CO.13.6	But I hope you will see that we ourselves have not failed the test. 
2CO.13.7	We pray to God that you will not do anything wrong. It is not important to see that we have passed the test, but it is important that you do what is right, even if it seems we have failed. 
2CO.13.8	We cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth. 
2CO.13.9	We are happy to be weak, if you are strong, and we pray that you will become complete. 
2CO.13.10	I am writing this while I am away from you so that when I come I will not have to be harsh in my use of authority. The Lord gave me this authority to build you up, not to tear you down.
2CO.13.11	Now, brothers and sisters, I say good-bye. Live in harmony. Do what I have asked you to do. Agree with each other, and live in peace. Then the God of love and peace will be with you.
2CO.13.12	Greet each other with a holy kiss. 
2CO.13.13	All of God’s holy people send greetings to you.
2CO.13.14	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.
GAL.1.1	From Paul, an apostle. I was not chosen to be an apostle by human beings, nor was I sent from human beings. I was made an apostle through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Jesus from the dead. 
GAL.1.2	This letter is also from all those of God’s family who are with me.
GAL.1.2	To the churches in Galatia:
GAL.1.3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
GAL.1.4	Jesus gave himself for our sins to free us from this evil world we live in, as God the Father planned. 
GAL.1.5	The glory belongs to God forever and ever. Amen.
GAL.1.6	God, by his grace through Christ, called you to become his people. So I am amazed that you are turning away so quickly and believing something different than the Good News. 
GAL.1.7	Really, there is no other Good News. But some people are confusing you; they want to change the Good News of Christ. 
GAL.1.8	We preached to you the Good News. So if we ourselves, or even an angel from heaven, should preach to you something different, we should be judged guilty! 
GAL.1.9	I said this before, and now I say it again: You have already accepted the Good News. If anyone is preaching something different to you, let that person be judged guilty!
GAL.1.10	Do you think I am trying to make people accept me? No, God is the One I am trying to please. Am I trying to please people? If I still wanted to please people, I would not be a servant of Christ.
GAL.1.11	Brothers and sisters, I want you to know that the Good News I preached to you was not made up by human beings. 
GAL.1.12	I did not get it from humans, nor did anyone teach it to me, but Jesus Christ showed it to me.
GAL.1.13	You have heard about my past life in the Jewish religion. I attacked the church of God and tried to destroy it. 
GAL.1.14	I was becoming a leader in the Jewish religion, doing better than most other Jews of my age. I tried harder than anyone else to follow the teachings handed down by our ancestors.
GAL.1.15	But God had special plans for me and set me apart for his work even before I was born. He called me through his grace 
GAL.1.16	and showed his son to me so that I might tell the Good News about him to those who are not Jewish. When God called me, I did not get advice or help from any person. 
GAL.1.17	I did not go to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before I was. But, without waiting, I went away to Arabia and later went back to Damascus.
GAL.1.18	After three years I went to Jerusalem to meet Peter and stayed with him for fifteen days. 
GAL.1.19	I met no other apostles, except James, the brother of the Lord. 
GAL.1.20	God knows that these things I write are not lies. 
GAL.1.21	Later, I went to the areas of Syria and Cilicia.
GAL.1.22	In Judea the churches in Christ had never met me. 
GAL.1.23	They had only heard it said, “This man who was attacking us is now preaching the same faith that he once tried to destroy.” 
GAL.1.24	And these believers praised God because of me.
GAL.2.1	After fourteen years I went to Jerusalem again, this time with Barnabas. I also took Titus with me. 
GAL.2.2	I went because God showed me I should go. I met with the believers there, and in private I told their leaders the Good News that I preach to the non-Jewish people. I did not want my past work and the work I am now doing to be wasted. 
GAL.2.3	Titus was with me, but he was not forced to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek. 
GAL.2.4	We talked about this problem because some false believers had come into our group secretly. They came in like spies to overturn the freedom we have in Christ Jesus. They wanted to make us slaves. 
GAL.2.5	But we did not give in to those false believers for a minute. We wanted the truth of the Good News to continue for you.
GAL.2.6	Those leaders who seemed to be important did not change the Good News that I preach. (It doesn’t matter to me if they were “important” or not. To God everyone is the same.) 
GAL.2.7	But these leaders saw that I had been given the work of telling the Good News to those who are not Jewish, just as Peter had the work of telling the Jews. 
GAL.2.8	God gave Peter the power to work as an apostle for the Jewish people. But he also gave me the power to work as an apostle for those who are not Jews. 
GAL.2.9	James, Peter, and John, who seemed to be the leaders, understood that God had given me this special grace, so they accepted Barnabas and me. They agreed that they would go to the Jewish people and that we should go to those who are not Jewish. 
GAL.2.10	The only thing they asked us was to remember to help the poor—something I really wanted to do.
GAL.2.11	When Peter came to Antioch, I challenged him to his face, because he was wrong. 
GAL.2.12	Peter ate with the non-Jewish people until some Jewish people sent from James came to Antioch. When they arrived, Peter stopped eating with those who weren’t Jewish, and he separated himself from them. He was afraid of the Jews. 
GAL.2.13	So Peter was a hypocrite, as were the other Jewish believers who joined with him. Even Barnabas was influenced by what these Jewish believers did. 
GAL.2.14	When I saw they were not following the truth of the Good News, I spoke to Peter in front of them all. I said, “Peter, you are a Jew, but you are not living like a Jew. You are living like those who are not Jewish. So why do you now try to force those who are not Jewish to live like Jews?”
GAL.2.15	We were not born as non-Jewish “sinners,” but as Jews. 
GAL.2.16	Yet we know that a person is made right with God not by following the law, but by trusting in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus, that we might be made right with God because we trusted in Christ. It is not because we followed the law, because no one can be made right with God by following the law.
GAL.2.17	We Jews came to Christ, trying to be made right with God, and it became clear that we are sinners, too. Does this mean that Christ encourages sin? No! 
GAL.2.18	But I would really be wrong to begin teaching again those things that I gave up. 
GAL.2.19	It was the law that put me to death, and I died to the law so that I can now live for God. 
GAL.2.20	I was put to death on the cross with Christ, and I do not live anymore—it is Christ who lives in me. I still live in my body, but I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself to save me. 
GAL.2.21	By saying these things I am not going against God’s grace. Just the opposite, if the law could make us right with God, then Christ’s death would be useless.
GAL.3.1	You people in Galatia were told very clearly about the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. But you were foolish; you let someone trick you. 
GAL.3.2	Tell me this one thing: How did you receive the Holy Spirit? Did you receive the Spirit by following the law? No, you received the Spirit because you heard the Good News and believed it. 
GAL.3.3	You began your life in Christ by the Spirit. Now are you trying to make it complete by your own power? That is foolish. 
GAL.3.4	Were all your experiences wasted? I hope not! 
GAL.3.5	Does God give you the Spirit and work miracles among you because you follow the law? No, he does these things because you heard the Good News and believed it.
GAL.3.6	The Scriptures say the same thing about Abraham: “Abraham believed God, and God accepted Abraham’s faith, and that faith made him right with God.” 
GAL.3.7	So you should know that the true children of Abraham are those who have faith. 
GAL.3.8	The Scriptures, telling what would happen in the future, said that God would make the non-Jewish people right through their faith. This Good News was told to Abraham beforehand, as the Scripture says: “All nations will be blessed through you.” 
GAL.3.9	So all who believe as Abraham believed are blessed just as Abraham was. 
GAL.3.10	But those who depend on following the law to make them right are under a curse, because the Scriptures say, “Anyone will be cursed who does not always obey what is written in the Book of the Law.” 
GAL.3.11	Now it is clear that no one can be made right with God by the law, because the Scriptures say, “Those who are right with God will live by faith.” 
GAL.3.12	The law is not based on faith. It says, “A person who obeys these things will live because of them.” 
GAL.3.13	Christ took away the curse the law put on us. He changed places with us and put himself under that curse. It is written in the Scriptures, “Anyone whose body is displayed on a tree is cursed.” 
GAL.3.14	Christ did this so that God’s blessing promised to Abraham might come through Jesus Christ to those who are not Jews. Jesus died so that by our believing we could receive the Spirit that God promised.
GAL.3.15	Brothers and sisters, let us think in human terms: Even an agreement made between two persons is firm. After that agreement is accepted by both people, no one can stop it or add anything to it. 
GAL.3.16	God made promises both to Abraham and to his descendant. God did not say, “and to your descendants.” That would mean many people. But God said, “and to your descendant.” That means only one person; that person is Christ. 
GAL.3.17	This is what I mean: God had an agreement with Abraham and promised to keep it. The law, which came four hundred thirty years later, cannot change that agreement and so destroy God’s promise to Abraham. 
GAL.3.18	If the law could give us Abraham’s blessing, then the promise would not be necessary. But that is not possible, because God freely gave his blessings to Abraham through the promise he had made.
GAL.3.19	So what was the law for? It was given to show that the wrong things people do are against God’s will. And it continued until the special descendant, who had been promised, came. The law was given through angels who used Moses for a mediator to give the law to people. 
GAL.3.20	But a mediator is not needed when there is only one side, and God is only one.
GAL.3.21	Does this mean that the law is against God’s promises? Never! That would be true only if the law could make us right with God. But God did not give a law that can bring life. 
GAL.3.22	Instead, the Scriptures showed that the whole world is bound by sin. This was so the promise would be given through faith to people who believe in Jesus Christ.
GAL.3.23	Before this faith came, we were all held prisoners by the law. We had no freedom until God showed us the way of faith that was coming. 
GAL.3.24	In other words, the law was our guardian leading us to Christ so that we could be made right with God through faith. 
GAL.3.25	Now the way of faith has come, and we no longer live under a guardian.
GAL.3.26+GAL.3.27	You were all baptized into Christ, and so you were all clothed with Christ. This means that you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.28	In Christ, there is no difference between Jew and Greek, slave and free person, male and female. You are all the same in Christ Jesus. 
GAL.3.29	You belong to Christ, so you are Abraham’s descendants. You will inherit all of God’s blessings because of the promise God made to Abraham.
GAL.4.1	I want to tell you this: While those who will inherit their fathers’ property are still children, they are no different from slaves. It does not matter that the children own everything. 
GAL.4.2	While they are children, they must obey those who are chosen to care for them. But when the children reach the age set by their fathers, they are free. 
GAL.4.3	It is the same for us. We were once like children, slaves to the useless rules of this world. 
GAL.4.4	But when the right time came, God sent his Son who was born of a woman and lived under the law. 
GAL.4.5	God did this so he could buy freedom for those who were under the law and so we could become his children.
GAL.4.6	Since you are God’s children, God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, and the Spirit cries out, “Father.” 
GAL.4.7	So now you are not a slave; you are God’s child, and God will give you the blessing he promised, because you are his child.
GAL.4.8	In the past you did not know God. You were slaves to gods that were not real. 
GAL.4.9	But now you know the true God. Really, it is God who knows you. So why do you turn back to those weak and useless rules you followed before? Do you want to be slaves to those things again? 
GAL.4.10	You still follow teachings about special days, months, seasons, and years. 
GAL.4.11	I am afraid for you, that my work for you has been wasted.
GAL.4.12	Brothers and sisters, I became like you, so I beg you to become like me. You were very good to me before. 
GAL.4.13	You remember that it was because of an illness that I came to you the first time, preaching the Good News. 
GAL.4.14	Though my sickness was a trouble for you, you did not hate me or make me leave. But you welcomed me as an angel from God, as if I were Jesus Christ himself! 
GAL.4.15	You were very happy then, but where is that joy now? I am ready to testify that you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me if that were possible. 
GAL.4.16	Now am I your enemy because I tell you the truth?
GAL.4.17	Those people are working hard to persuade you, but this is not good for you. They want to persuade you to turn against us and follow only them. 
GAL.4.18	It is good for people to show interest in you, but only if their purpose is good. This is always true, not just when I am with you. 
GAL.4.19	My little children, again I feel the pain of childbirth for you until you truly become like Christ. 
GAL.4.20	I wish I could be with you now and could change the way I am talking to you, because I do not know what to think about you.
GAL.4.21	Some of you still want to be under the law. Tell me, do you know what the law says? 
GAL.4.22	The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons. The mother of one son was a slave woman, and the mother of the other son was a free woman. 
GAL.4.23	Abraham’s son from the slave woman was born in the normal human way. But the son from the free woman was born because of the promise God made to Abraham.
GAL.4.24	This story teaches something else: The two women are like the two agreements between God and his people. One agreement is the law that God made on Mount Sinai, and the people who are under this agreement are like slaves. The mother named Hagar is like that agreement. 
GAL.4.25	She is like Mount Sinai in Arabia and is a picture of the earthly city of Jerusalem. This city and its people are slaves to the law. 
GAL.4.26	But the heavenly Jerusalem, which is above, is like the free woman. She is our mother. 
GAL.4.27	It is written in the Scriptures:
GAL.4.27	“Be happy, Jerusalem.
GAL.4.27	You are like a woman who never gave birth to children.
GAL.4.27	Start singing and shout for joy.
GAL.4.27	You never felt the pain of giving birth,
GAL.4.27	but you will have more children
GAL.4.27	than the woman who has a husband.”
GAL.4.28	My brothers and sisters, you are God’s children because of his promise, as Isaac was then. 
GAL.4.29	The son who was born in the normal way treated the other son badly. It is the same today. 
GAL.4.30	But what does the Scripture say? “Throw out the slave woman and her son. The son of the slave woman should not inherit anything. The son of the free woman should receive it all.” 
GAL.4.31	So, my brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman, but of the free woman.
GAL.5.1	We have freedom now, because Christ made us free. So stand strong. Do not change and go back into the slavery of the law. 
GAL.5.2	Listen, I Paul tell you that if you go back to the law by being circumcised, Christ does you no good. 
GAL.5.3	Again, I warn every man: If you allow yourselves to be circumcised, you must follow all the law. 
GAL.5.4	If you try to be made right with God through the law, your life with Christ is over—you have left God’s grace. 
GAL.5.5	But we have the true hope that comes from being made right with God, and by the Spirit we wait eagerly for this hope. 
GAL.5.6	When we are in Christ Jesus, it is not important if we are circumcised or not. The important thing is faith—the kind of faith that works through love.
GAL.5.7	You were running a good race. Who stopped you from following the true way? 
GAL.5.8	This change did not come from the One who chose you. 
GAL.5.9	Be careful! “Just a little yeast makes the whole batch of dough rise.” 
GAL.5.10	But I trust in the Lord that you will not believe those different ideas. Whoever is confusing you with such ideas will be punished.
GAL.5.11	My brothers and sisters, I do not teach that a man must be circumcised. If I teach circumcision, why am I still being attacked? If I still taught circumcision, my preaching about the cross would not be a problem. 
GAL.5.12	I wish the people who are bothering you would castrate themselves!
GAL.5.13	My brothers and sisters, God called you to be free, but do not use your freedom as an excuse to do what pleases your sinful self. Serve each other with love. 
GAL.5.14	The whole law is made complete in this one command: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” 
GAL.5.15	If you go on hurting each other and tearing each other apart, be careful, or you will completely destroy each other.
GAL.5.16	So I tell you: Live by following the Spirit. Then you will not do what your sinful selves want. 
GAL.5.17	Our sinful selves want what is against the Spirit, and the Spirit wants what is against our sinful selves. The two are against each other, so you cannot do just what you please. 
GAL.5.18	But if the Spirit is leading you, you are not under the law.
GAL.5.19	The wrong things the sinful self does are clear: being sexually unfaithful, not being pure, taking part in sexual sins, 
GAL.5.20	worshiping gods, doing witchcraft, hating, making trouble, being jealous, being angry, being selfish, making people angry with each other, causing divisions among people, 
GAL.5.21	feeling envy, being drunk, having wild and wasteful parties, and doing other things like these. I warn you now as I warned you before: Those who do these things will not inherit God’s kingdom. 
GAL.5.22	But the Spirit produces the fruit of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
GAL.5.23	gentleness, self-control. There is no law that says these things are wrong. 
GAL.5.24	Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified their own sinful selves. They have given up their old selfish feelings and the evil things they wanted to do. 
GAL.5.25	We get our new life from the Spirit, so we should follow the Spirit. 
GAL.5.26	We must not be proud or make trouble with each other or be jealous of each other.
GAL.6.1	Brothers and sisters, if someone in your group does something wrong, you who are spiritual should go to that person and gently help make him right again. But be careful, because you might be tempted to sin, too. 
GAL.6.2	By helping each other with your troubles, you truly obey the law of Christ. 
GAL.6.3	If anyone thinks he is important when he really is not, he is only fooling himself. 
GAL.6.4	Each person should judge his own actions and not compare himself with others. Then he can be proud for what he himself has done. 
GAL.6.5	Each person must be responsible for himself.
GAL.6.6	Anyone who is learning the teaching of God should share all the good things he has with his teacher.
GAL.6.7	Do not be fooled: You cannot cheat God. People harvest only what they plant. 
GAL.6.8	If they plant to satisfy their sinful selves, their sinful selves will bring them ruin. But if they plant to please the Spirit, they will receive eternal life from the Spirit. 
GAL.6.9	We must not become tired of doing good. We will receive our harvest of eternal life at the right time if we do not give up. 
GAL.6.10	When we have the opportunity to help anyone, we should do it. But we should give special attention to those who are in the family of believers.
GAL.6.11	See what large letters I use to write this myself. 
GAL.6.12	Some people are trying to force you to be circumcised so the Jews will accept them. They are afraid they will be attacked if they follow only the cross of Christ. 
GAL.6.13	Those who are circumcised do not obey the law themselves, but they want you to be circumcised so they can brag about what they forced you to do. 
GAL.6.14	I hope I will never brag about things like that. The cross of our Lord Jesus Christ is my only reason for bragging. Through the cross of Jesus my world was crucified, and I died to the world. 
GAL.6.15	It is not important if a man is circumcised or uncircumcised. The important thing is being the new people God has made. 
GAL.6.16	Peace and mercy to those who follow this rule—and to all of God’s people.
GAL.6.17	So do not give me any more trouble. I have scars on my body that show I belong to Christ Jesus.
GAL.6.18	My brothers and sisters, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. 
EPH.1.1	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. I am an apostle because that is what God wanted.
EPH.1.1	To God’s holy people living in Ephesus, believers in Christ Jesus:
EPH.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.1.3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In Christ, God has given us every spiritual blessing in the heavenly world. 
EPH.1.4	That is, in Christ, he chose us before the world was made so that we would be his holy people—people without blame before him. 
EPH.1.5	Because of his love, God had already decided to make us his own children through Jesus Christ. That was what he wanted and what pleased him, 
EPH.1.6	and it brings praise to God because of his wonderful grace. God gave that grace to us freely, in Christ, the One he loves. 
EPH.1.7	In Christ we are set free by the blood of his death, and so we have forgiveness of sins. How rich is God’s grace, 
EPH.1.8	which he has given to us so fully and freely. God, with full wisdom and understanding, 
EPH.1.9	let us know his secret purpose. This was what God wanted, and he planned to do it through Christ. 
EPH.1.10	His goal was to carry out his plan, when the right time came, that all things in heaven and on earth would be joined together in Christ as the head.
EPH.1.11	In Christ we were chosen to be God’s people, because from the very beginning God had decided this in keeping with his plan. And he is the One who makes everything agree with what he decides and wants. 
EPH.1.12	We are the first people who hoped in Christ, and we were chosen so that we would bring praise to God’s glory. 
EPH.1.13	So it is with you. When you heard the true teaching—the Good News about your salvation—you believed in Christ. And in Christ, God put his special mark of ownership on you by giving you the Holy Spirit that he had promised. 
EPH.1.14	That Holy Spirit is the guarantee that we will receive what God promised for his people until God gives full freedom to those who are his—to bring praise to God’s glory.
EPH.1.15	That is why since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all God’s people, 
EPH.1.16	I have not stopped giving thanks to God for you. I always remember you in my prayers, 
EPH.1.17	asking the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, to give you a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that you will know him better. 
EPH.1.18	I pray also that you will have greater understanding in your heart so you will know the hope to which he has called us and that you will know how rich and glorious are the blessings God has promised his holy people. 
EPH.1.19	And you will know that God’s power is very great for us who believe. That power is the same as the great strength 
EPH.1.20	God used to raise Christ from the dead and put him at his right side in the heavenly world. 
EPH.1.21	God has put Christ over all rulers, authorities, powers, and kings, not only in this world but also in the next. 
EPH.1.22	God put everything under his power and made him the head over everything for the church, 
EPH.1.23	which is Christ’s body. The church is filled with Christ, and Christ fills everything in every way.
EPH.2.1	In the past you were spiritually dead because of your sins and the things you did against God. 
EPH.2.2	Yes, in the past you lived the way the world lives, following the ruler of the evil powers that are above the earth. That same spirit is now working in those who refuse to obey God. 
EPH.2.3	In the past all of us lived like them, trying to please our sinful selves and doing all the things our bodies and minds wanted. We should have suffered God’s anger because we were sinful by nature. We were the same as all other people.
EPH.2.4	But God’s mercy is great, and he loved us very much. 
EPH.2.5	Though we were spiritually dead because of the things we did against God, he gave us new life with Christ. You have been saved by God’s grace. 
EPH.2.6	And he raised us up with Christ and gave us a seat with him in the heavens. He did this for those in Christ Jesus 
EPH.2.7	so that for all future time he could show the very great riches of his grace by being kind to us in Christ Jesus. 
EPH.2.8	I mean that you have been saved by grace through believing. You did not save yourselves; it was a gift from God. 
EPH.2.9	It was not the result of your own efforts, so you cannot brag about it. 
EPH.2.10	God has made us what we are. In Christ Jesus, God made us to do good works, which God planned in advance for us to live our lives doing.
EPH.2.11	You were not born Jewish. You are the people the Jews call “uncircumcised.” Those who call you “uncircumcised” call themselves “circumcised.” (Their circumcision is only something they themselves do on their bodies.) 
EPH.2.12	Remember that in the past you were without Christ. You were not citizens of Israel, and you had no part in the agreements with the promise that God made to his people. You had no hope, and you did not know God. 
EPH.2.13	But now in Christ Jesus, you who were far away from God are brought near through the blood of Christ’s death. 
EPH.2.14	Christ himself is our peace. He made both Jewish people and those who are not Jews one people. They were separated as if there were a wall between them, but Christ broke down that wall of hate by giving his own body. 
EPH.2.15	The Jewish law had many commands and rules, but Christ ended that law. His purpose was to make the two groups of people become one new people in him and in this way make peace. 
EPH.2.16	It was also Christ’s purpose to end the hatred between the two groups, to make them into one body, and to bring them back to God. Christ did all this with his death on the cross. 
EPH.2.17	Christ came and preached peace to you who were far away from God, and to those who were near to God. 
EPH.2.18	Yes, it is through Christ we all have the right to come to the Father in one Spirit.
EPH.2.19	Now you who are not Jewish are not foreigners or strangers any longer, but are citizens together with God’s holy people. You belong to God’s family. 
EPH.2.20	You are like a building that was built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets. Christ Jesus himself is the most important stone in that building, 
EPH.2.21	and that whole building is joined together in Christ. He makes it grow and become a holy temple in the Lord. 
EPH.2.22	And in Christ you, too, are being built together with the Jews into a place where God lives through the Spirit.
EPH.3.1	So I, Paul, am a prisoner of Christ Jesus for you who are not Jews. 
EPH.3.2	Surely you have heard that God gave me this work to tell you about his grace. 
EPH.3.3	He let me know his secret by showing it to me. I have already written a little about this. 
EPH.3.4	If you read what I wrote then, you can see that I truly understand the secret about the Christ. 
EPH.3.5	People who lived in other times were not told that secret. But now, through the Spirit, God has shown that secret to his holy apostles and prophets. 
EPH.3.6	This is that secret: that through the Good News those who are not Jews will share with the Jews in God’s blessing. They belong to the same body, and they share together in the promise that God made in Christ Jesus.
EPH.3.7	By God’s special gift of grace given to me through his power, I became a servant to tell that Good News. 
EPH.3.8	I am the least important of all God’s people, but God gave me this gift—to tell those who are not Jews the Good News about the riches of Christ, which are too great to understand fully. 
EPH.3.9	And God gave me the work of telling all people about the plan for his secret, which has been hidden in him since the beginning of time. He is the One who created everything. 
EPH.3.10	His purpose was that through the church all the rulers and powers in the heavenly world will now know God’s wisdom, which has so many forms. 
EPH.3.11	This agrees with the purpose God had since the beginning of time, and he carried out his plan through Christ Jesus our Lord. 
EPH.3.12	In Christ we can come before God with freedom and without fear. We can do this through faith in Christ. 
EPH.3.13	So I ask you not to become discouraged because of the sufferings I am having for you. My sufferings are for your glory.
EPH.3.14	So I bow in prayer before the Father 
EPH.3.15	from whom every family in heaven and on earth gets its true name. 
EPH.3.16	I ask the Father in his great glory to give you the power to be strong inwardly through his Spirit. 
EPH.3.17	I pray that Christ will live in your hearts by faith and that your life will be strong in love and be built on love. 
EPH.3.18	And I pray that you and all God’s holy people will have the power to understand the greatness of Christ’s love—how wide and how long and how high and how deep that love is. 
EPH.3.19	Christ’s love is greater than anyone can ever know, but I pray that you will be able to know that love. Then you can be filled with the fullness of God.
EPH.3.20	With God’s power working in us, God can do much, much more than anything we can ask or imagine. 
EPH.3.21	To him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus for all time, forever and ever. Amen.
EPH.4.1	I am in prison because I belong to the Lord. Therefore I urge you who have been chosen by God to live up to the life to which God called you. 
EPH.4.2	Always be humble, gentle, and patient, accepting each other in love. 
EPH.4.3	You are joined together with peace through the Spirit, so make every effort to continue together in this way. 
EPH.4.4	There is one body and one Spirit, and God called you to have one hope. 
EPH.4.5	There is one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. 
EPH.4.6	There is one God and Father of everything. He rules everything and is everywhere and is in everything.
EPH.4.7	Christ gave each one of us the special gift of grace, showing how generous he is. 
EPH.4.8	That is why it says in the Scriptures,
EPH.4.8	“When he went up to the heights,
EPH.4.8	he led a parade of captives,
EPH.4.8	and he gave gifts to people.”
EPH.4.9	When it says, “He went up,” what does it mean? It means that he first came down to the earth. 
EPH.4.10	So Jesus came down, and he is the same One who went up above all the heaven. Christ did that to fill everything with his presence. 
EPH.4.11	And Christ gave gifts to people—he made some to be apostles, some to be prophets, some to go and tell the Good News, and some to have the work of caring for and teaching God’s people. 
EPH.4.12	Christ gave those gifts to prepare God’s holy people for the work of serving, to make the body of Christ stronger. 
EPH.4.13	This work must continue until we are all joined together in the same faith and in the same knowledge of the Son of God. We must become like a mature person, growing until we become like Christ and have his perfection.
EPH.4.14	Then we will no longer be babies. We will not be tossed about like a ship that the waves carry one way and then another. We will not be influenced by every new teaching we hear from people who are trying to fool us. They make plans and try any kind of trick to fool people into following the wrong path. 
EPH.4.15	No! Speaking the truth with love, we will grow up in every way into Christ, who is the head. 
EPH.4.16	The whole body depends on Christ, and all the parts of the body are joined and held together. Each part does its own work to make the whole body grow and be strong with love.
EPH.4.17	In the Lord’s name, I tell you this. Do not continue living like those who do not believe. Their thoughts are worth nothing. 
EPH.4.18	They do not understand, and they know nothing, because they refuse to listen. So they cannot have the life that God gives. 
EPH.4.19	They have lost all feeling of shame, and they use their lives for doing evil. They continually want to do all kinds of evil. 
EPH.4.20	But what you learned in Christ was not like this. 
EPH.4.21	I know that you heard about him, and you are in him, so you were taught the truth that is in Jesus. 
EPH.4.22	You were taught to leave your old self—to stop living the evil way you lived before. That old self becomes worse, because people are fooled by the evil things they want to do. 
EPH.4.23	But you were taught to be made new in your hearts, 
EPH.4.24	to become a new person. That new person is made to be like God—made to be truly good and holy.
EPH.4.25	So you must stop telling lies. Tell each other the truth, because we all belong to each other in the same body. 
EPH.4.26	When you are angry, do not sin, and be sure to stop being angry before the end of the day. 
EPH.4.27	Do not give the devil a way to defeat you. 
EPH.4.28	Those who are stealing must stop stealing and start working. They should earn an honest living for themselves. Then they will have something to share with those who are poor.
EPH.4.29	When you talk, do not say harmful things, but say what people need—words that will help others become stronger. Then what you say will do good to those who listen to you. 
EPH.4.30	And do not make the Holy Spirit sad. The Spirit is God’s proof that you belong to him. God gave you the Spirit to show that God will make you free when the final day comes. 
EPH.4.31	Do not be bitter or angry or mad. Never shout angrily or say things to hurt others. Never do anything evil. 
EPH.4.32	Be kind and loving to each other, and forgive each other just as God forgave you in Christ.
EPH.5.1	You are God’s children whom he loves, so try to be like him. 
EPH.5.2	Live a life of love just as Christ loved us and gave himself for us as a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God.
EPH.5.3	But there must be no sexual sin among you, or any kind of evil or greed. Those things are not right for God’s holy people. 
EPH.5.4	Also, there must be no evil talk among you, and you must not speak foolishly or tell evil jokes. These things are not right for you. Instead, you should be giving thanks to God. 
EPH.5.5	You can be sure of this: No one will have a place in the kingdom of Christ and of God who sins sexually, or does evil things, or is greedy. Anyone who is greedy is serving a false god.
EPH.5.6	Do not let anyone fool you by telling you things that are not true, because these things will bring God’s anger on those who do not obey him. 
EPH.5.7	So have nothing to do with them. 
EPH.5.8	In the past you were full of darkness, but now you are full of light in the Lord. So live like children who belong to the light. 
EPH.5.9	Light brings every kind of goodness, right living, and truth. 
EPH.5.10	Try to learn what pleases the Lord. 
EPH.5.11	Have nothing to do with the things done in darkness, which are not worth anything. But show that they are wrong. 
EPH.5.12	It is shameful even to talk about what those people do in secret. 
EPH.5.13	But the light makes all things easy to see, 
EPH.5.14	and everything that is made easy to see can become light. This is why it is said:
EPH.5.14	“Wake up, sleeper!
EPH.5.14	Rise from death,
EPH.5.14	and Christ will shine on you.”
EPH.5.15	So be very careful how you live. Do not live like those who are not wise, but live wisely. 
EPH.5.16	Use every chance you have for doing good, because these are evil times. 
EPH.5.17	So do not be foolish but learn what the Lord wants you to do. 
EPH.5.18	Do not be drunk with wine, which will ruin you, but be filled with the Spirit. 
EPH.5.19	Speak to each other with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord. 
EPH.5.20	Always give thanks to God the Father for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
EPH.5.21	Yield to obey each other as you would to Christ.
EPH.5.22	Wives, yield to your husbands, as you do to the Lord, 
EPH.5.23	because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of the church. And he is the Savior of the body, which is the church. 
EPH.5.24	As the church yields to Christ, so you wives should yield to your husbands in everything.
EPH.5.25	Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it 
EPH.5.26	to make it belong to God. Christ used the word to make the church clean by washing it with water. 
EPH.5.27	He died so that he could give the church to himself like a bride in all her beauty. He died so that the church could be pure and without fault, with no evil or sin or any other wrong thing in it. 
EPH.5.28	In the same way, husbands should love their wives as they love their own bodies. The man who loves his wife loves himself. 
EPH.5.29	No one ever hates his own body, but feeds and takes care of it. And that is what Christ does for the church, 
EPH.5.30	because we are parts of his body. 
EPH.5.31	The Scripture says, “So a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one body.” 
EPH.5.32	That secret is very important—I am talking about Christ and the church. 
EPH.5.33	But each one of you must love his wife as he loves himself, and a wife must respect her husband.
EPH.6.1	Children, obey your parents as the Lord wants, because this is the right thing to do. 
EPH.6.2	The command says, “Honor your father and mother.” This is the first command that has a promise with it— 
EPH.6.3	“Then everything will be well with you, and you will have a long life on the earth.”
EPH.6.4	Fathers, do not make your children angry, but raise them with the training and teaching of the Lord.
EPH.6.5	Slaves, obey your masters here on earth with fear and respect and from a sincere heart, just as you obey Christ. 
EPH.6.6	You must do this not only while they are watching you, to please them. With all your heart you must do what God wants as people who are obeying Christ. 
EPH.6.7	Do your work with enthusiasm. Work as if you were serving the Lord, not as if you were serving only men and women. 
EPH.6.8	Remember that the Lord will give a reward to everyone, slave or free, for doing good.
EPH.6.9	Masters, in the same way, be good to your slaves. Do not threaten them. Remember that the One who is your Master and their Master is in heaven, and he treats everyone alike.
EPH.6.10	Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his great power. 
EPH.6.11	Put on the full armor of God so that you can fight against the devil’s evil tricks. 
EPH.6.12	Our fight is not against people on earth but against the rulers and authorities and the powers of this world’s darkness, against the spiritual powers of evil in the heavenly world. 
EPH.6.13	That is why you need to put on God’s full armor. Then on the day of evil you will be able to stand strong. And when you have finished the whole fight, you will still be standing. 
EPH.6.14	So stand strong, with the belt of truth tied around your waist and the protection of right living on your chest. 
EPH.6.15	On your feet wear the Good News of peace to help you stand strong. 
EPH.6.16	And also use the shield of faith with which you can stop all the burning arrows of the Evil One. 
EPH.6.17	Accept God’s salvation as your helmet, and take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 
EPH.6.18	Pray in the Spirit at all times with all kinds of prayers, asking for everything you need. To do this you must always be ready and never give up. Always pray for all God’s people.
EPH.6.19	Also pray for me that when I speak, God will give me words so that I can tell the secret of the Good News without fear. 
EPH.6.20	I have been sent to preach this Good News, and I am doing that now, here in prison. Pray that when I preach the Good News I will speak without fear, as I should.
EPH.6.21	I am sending to you Tychicus, our brother whom we love and a faithful servant of the Lord’s work. He will tell you everything that is happening with me. Then you will know how I am and what I am doing. 
EPH.6.22	I am sending him to you for this reason—so that you will know how we are, and he can encourage you.
EPH.6.23	Peace and love with faith to you brothers and sisters from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 
EPH.6.24	Grace to all of you who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love that never ends. 
PHP.1.1	From Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus.
PHP.1.1	To all of God’s holy people in Christ Jesus who live in Philippi, including your overseers and deacons:
PHP.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHP.1.3	I thank my God every time I remember you, 
PHP.1.4	always praying with joy for all of you. 
PHP.1.5	I thank God for the help you gave me while I preached the Good News—help you gave from the first day you believed until now. 
PHP.1.6	God began doing a good work in you, and I am sure he will continue it until it is finished when Jesus Christ comes again.
PHP.1.7	And I know that I am right to think like this about all of you, because I have you in my heart. All of you share in God’s grace with me while I am in prison and while I am defending and proving the truth of the Good News. 
PHP.1.8	God knows that I want to see you very much, because I love all of you with the love of Christ Jesus.
PHP.1.9	This is my prayer for you: that your love will grow more and more; that you will have knowledge and understanding with your love; 
PHP.1.10	that you will see the difference between good and bad and will choose the good; that you will be pure and without wrong for the coming of Christ; 
PHP.1.11	that you will be filled with the good things produced in your life by Christ to bring glory and praise to God.
PHP.1.12	I want you brothers and sisters to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the Good News. 
PHP.1.13	All the palace guards and everyone else knows that I am in prison because I am a believer in Christ. 
PHP.1.14	Because I am in prison, most of the believers have become more bold in Christ and are not afraid to speak the word of God.
PHP.1.15	It is true that some preach about Christ because they are jealous and ambitious, but others preach about Christ because they want to help. 
PHP.1.16	They preach because they have love, and they know that God gave me the work of defending the Good News. 
PHP.1.17	But the others preach about Christ for selfish and wrong reasons, wanting to make trouble for me in prison.
PHP.1.18	But it doesn’t matter. The important thing is that in every way, whether for right or wrong reasons, they are preaching about Christ. So I am happy, and I will continue to be happy. 
PHP.1.19	Because you are praying for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is helping me, I know this trouble will bring my freedom. 
PHP.1.20	I expect and hope that I will not fail Christ in anything but that I will have the courage now, as always, to show the greatness of Christ in my life here on earth, whether I live or die. 
PHP.1.21	To me the only important thing about living is Christ, and dying would be profit for me. 
PHP.1.22	If I continue living in my body, I will be able to work for the Lord. I do not know what to choose—living or dying. 
PHP.1.23	It is hard to choose between the two. I want to leave this life and be with Christ, which is much better, 
PHP.1.24	but you need me here in my body. 
PHP.1.25	Since I am sure of this, I know I will stay with you to help you grow and have joy in your faith. 
PHP.1.26	You will be very happy in Christ Jesus when I am with you again.
PHP.1.27	Only one thing concerns me: Be sure that you live in a way that brings honor to the Good News of Christ. Then whether I come and visit you or am away from you, I will hear that you are standing strong with one purpose, that you work together as one for the faith of the Good News, 
PHP.1.28	and that you are not afraid of those who are against you. All of this is proof that your enemies will be destroyed but that you will be saved by God. 
PHP.1.29	God gave you the honor not only of believing in Christ but also of suffering for him, both of which bring glory to Christ. 
PHP.1.30	When I was with you, you saw the struggles I had, and you hear about the struggles I am having now. You yourselves are having the same kind of struggles.
PHP.2.1	Does your life in Christ give you strength? Does his love comfort you? Do we share together in the spirit? Do you have mercy and kindness? 
PHP.2.2	If so, make me very happy by having the same thoughts, sharing the same love, and having one mind and purpose. 
PHP.2.3	When you do things, do not let selfishness or pride be your guide. Instead, be humble and give more honor to others than to yourselves. 
PHP.2.4	Do not be interested only in your own life, but be interested in the lives of others.
PHP.2.5	In your lives you must think and act like Christ Jesus.
PHP.2.6	Christ himself was like God in everything.
PHP.2.6	But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for his own benefit.
PHP.2.7	But he gave up his place with God and made himself nothing.
PHP.2.7	He was born as a man
PHP.2.7	and became like a servant.
PHP.2.8	And when he was living as a man,
PHP.2.8	he humbled himself and was fully obedient to God,
PHP.2.8	even when that caused his death—death on a cross.
PHP.2.9	So God raised him to the highest place.
PHP.2.9	God made his name greater than every other name
PHP.2.10	so that every knee will bow to the name of Jesus—
PHP.2.10	everyone in heaven, on earth, and under the earth.
PHP.2.11	And everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord
PHP.2.11	and bring glory to God the Father.
PHP.2.12	My dear friends, you have always obeyed God when I was with you. It is even more important that you obey now while I am away from you. Keep on working to complete your salvation with fear and trembling, 
PHP.2.13	because God is working in you to help you want to do and be able to do what pleases him.
PHP.2.14	Do everything without complaining or arguing. 
PHP.2.15	Then you will be innocent and without any wrong. You will be God’s children without fault. But you are living with crooked and mean people all around you, among whom you shine like stars in the dark world. 
PHP.2.16	You offer the teaching that gives life. So when Christ comes again, I can be happy because my work was not wasted. I ran the race and won.
PHP.2.17	Your faith makes you offer your lives as a sacrifice in serving God. If I have to offer my own blood with your sacrifice, I will be happy and full of joy with all of you. 
PHP.2.18	You also should be happy and full of joy with me.
PHP.2.19	I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon. I will be happy to learn how you are. 
PHP.2.20	I have no one else like Timothy, who truly cares for you. 
PHP.2.21	Other people are interested only in their own lives, not in the work of Jesus Christ. 
PHP.2.22	You know the kind of person Timothy is. You know he has served with me in telling the Good News, as a son serves his father. 
PHP.2.23	I plan to send him to you quickly when I know what will happen to me. 
PHP.2.24	I am sure that the Lord will help me to come to you soon.
PHP.2.25	Epaphroditus, my brother in Christ, works and serves with me in the army of Christ. When I needed help, you sent him to me. I think now that I must send him back to you, 
PHP.2.26	because he wants very much to see all of you. He is worried because you heard that he was sick. 
PHP.2.27	Yes, he was sick, and nearly died, but God had mercy on him and me too so that I would not have more sadness. 
PHP.2.28	I want very much to send him to you so that when you see him you can be happy, and I can stop worrying about you. 
PHP.2.29	Welcome him in the Lord with much joy. Give honor to people like him, 
PHP.2.30	because he almost died for the work of Christ. He risked his life to give me the help you could not give in your service to me.
PHP.3.1	My brothers and sisters, be full of joy in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again, and it will help you to be more ready. 
PHP.3.2	Watch out for those who do evil, who are like dogs, who demand to cut the body. 
PHP.3.3	We are the ones who are truly circumcised. We worship God through his Spirit, and our pride is in Christ Jesus. We do not put trust in ourselves or anything we can do, 
PHP.3.4	although I might be able to put trust in myself. If anyone thinks he has a reason to trust in himself, he should know that I have greater reason for trusting in myself. 
PHP.3.5	I was circumcised eight days after my birth. I am from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin. I am a Hebrew, and my parents were Hebrews. I had a strict view of the law, which is why I became a Pharisee. 
PHP.3.6	I was so enthusiastic I tried to hurt the church. No one could find fault with the way I obeyed the law of Moses. 
PHP.3.7	Those things were important to me, but now I think they are worth nothing because of Christ. 
PHP.3.8	Not only those things, but I think that all things are worth nothing compared with the greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. Because of him, I have lost all those things, and now I know they are worthless trash. This allows me to have Christ 
PHP.3.9	and to belong to him. Now I am right with God, not because I followed the law, but because I believed in Christ. God uses my faith to make me right with him. 
PHP.3.10	I want to know Christ and the power that raised him from the dead. I want to share in his sufferings and become like him in his death. 
PHP.3.11	Then I have hope that I myself will be raised from the dead.
PHP.3.12	I do not mean that I am already as God wants me to be. I have not yet reached that goal, but I continue trying to reach it and to make it mine. Christ wants me to do that, which is the reason he made me his. 
PHP.3.13	Brothers and sisters, I know that I have not yet reached that goal, but there is one thing I always do. Forgetting the past and straining toward what is ahead, 
PHP.3.14	I keep trying to reach the goal and get the prize for which God called me through Christ to the life above.
PHP.3.15	All of us who are spiritually mature should think this way, too. And if there are things you do not agree with, God will make them clear to you. 
PHP.3.16	But we should continue following the truth we already have.
PHP.3.17	Brothers and sisters, all of you should try to follow my example and to copy those who live the way we showed you. 
PHP.3.18	Many people live like enemies of the cross of Christ. I have often told you about them, and it makes me cry to tell you about them now. 
PHP.3.19	In the end, they will be destroyed. They do whatever their bodies want, they are proud of their shameful acts, and they think only about earthly things. 
PHP.3.20	But our homeland is in heaven, and we are waiting for our Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, to come from heaven. 
PHP.3.21	By his power to rule all things, he will change our humble bodies and make them like his own glorious body.
PHP.4.1	My dear brothers and sisters, I love you and want to see you. You bring me joy and make me proud of you, so stand strong in the Lord as I have told you.
PHP.4.2	I ask Euodia and Syntyche to agree in the Lord. 
PHP.4.3	And I ask you, my faithful friend, to help these women. They served with me in telling the Good News, together with Clement and others who worked with me, whose names are written in the book of life.
PHP.4.4	Be full of joy in the Lord always. I will say again, be full of joy.
PHP.4.5	Let everyone see that you are gentle and kind. The Lord is coming soon. 
PHP.4.6	Do not worry about anything, but pray and ask God for everything you need, always giving thanks. 
PHP.4.7	And God’s peace, which is so great we cannot understand it, will keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.
PHP.4.8	Brothers and sisters, think about the things that are good and worthy of praise. Think about the things that are true and honorable and right and pure and beautiful and respected. 
PHP.4.9	Do what you learned and received from me, what I told you, and what you saw me do. And the God who gives peace will be with you.
PHP.4.10	I am very happy in the Lord that you have shown your care for me again. You continued to care about me, but there was no way for you to show it. 
PHP.4.11	I am not telling you this because I need anything. I have learned to be satisfied with the things I have and with everything that happens. 
PHP.4.12	I know how to live when I am poor, and I know how to live when I have plenty. I have learned the secret of being happy at any time in everything that happens, when I have enough to eat and when I go hungry, when I have more than I need and when I do not have enough. 
PHP.4.13	I can do all things through Christ, because he gives me strength.
PHP.4.14	But it was good that you helped me when I needed it. 
PHP.4.15	You Philippians remember when I first preached the Good News there. When I left Macedonia, you were the only church that gave me help. 
PHP.4.16	Several times you sent me things I needed when I was in Thessalonica. 
PHP.4.17	Really, it is not that I want to receive gifts from you, but I want you to have the good that comes from giving. 
PHP.4.18	And now I have everything, and more. I have all I need, because Epaphroditus brought your gift to me. It is like a sweet-smelling sacrifice offered to God, who accepts that sacrifice and is pleased with it. 
PHP.4.19	My God will use his wonderful riches in Christ Jesus to give you everything you need. 
PHP.4.20	Glory to our God and Father forever and ever! Amen.
PHP.4.21	Greet each of God’s people in Christ Jesus. Those who are with me send greetings to you. 
PHP.4.22	All of God’s people greet you, particularly those from the palace of Caesar.
PHP.4.23	The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. 
COL.1.1	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus. I am an apostle because that is what God wanted. Also from Timothy, our brother.
COL.1.2	To the holy and faithful brothers and sisters in Christ that live in Colossae:
COL.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God our Father.
COL.1.3	In our prayers for you we always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, 
COL.1.4	because we have heard about the faith you have in Christ Jesus and the love you have for all of God’s people. 
COL.1.5	You have this faith and love because of your hope, and what you hope for is kept safe for you in heaven. You learned about this hope when you heard the message about the truth, the Good News 
COL.1.6	that was told to you. Everywhere in the world that Good News is bringing blessings and is growing. This has happened with you, too, since you heard the Good News and understood the truth about the grace of God. 
COL.1.7	You learned about God’s grace from Epaphras, whom we love. He works together with us and is a faithful servant of Christ for us. 
COL.1.8	He also told us about the love you have from the Holy Spirit.
COL.1.9	Because of this, since the day we heard about you, we have continued praying for you, asking God that you will know fully what he wants. We pray that you will also have great wisdom and understanding in spiritual things 
COL.1.10	so that you will live the kind of life that honors and pleases the Lord in every way. You will produce fruit in every good work and grow in the knowledge of God. 
COL.1.11	God will strengthen you with his own great power so that you will not give up when troubles come, but you will be patient. 
COL.1.12	And you will joyfully give thanks to the Father who has made you able to have a share in all that he has prepared for his people in the kingdom of light. 
COL.1.13	God has freed us from the power of darkness, and he brought us into the kingdom of his dear Son. 
COL.1.14	The Son paid for our sins, and in him we have forgiveness.
COL.1.15	No one can see God, but Jesus Christ is exactly like him. He ranks higher than everything that has been made. 
COL.1.16	Through his power all things were made—things in heaven and on earth, things seen and unseen, all powers, authorities, lords, and rulers. All things were made through Christ and for Christ. 
COL.1.17	He was there before anything was made, and all things continue because of him. 
COL.1.18	He is the head of the body, which is the church. Everything comes from him. He is the first one who was raised from the dead. So in all things Jesus has first place. 
COL.1.19	God was pleased for all of himself to live in Christ. 
COL.1.20	And through Christ, God has brought all things back to himself again—things on earth and things in heaven. God made peace through the blood of Christ’s death on the cross.
COL.1.21	At one time you were separated from God. You were his enemies in your minds, and the evil things you did were against God. 
COL.1.22	But now God has made you his friends again. He did this through Christ’s death in the body so that he might bring you into God’s presence as people who are holy, with no wrong, and with nothing of which God can judge you guilty. 
COL.1.23	This will happen if you continue strong and sure in your faith. You must not be moved away from the hope brought to you by the Good News that you heard. That same Good News has been told to everyone in the world, and I, Paul, help in preaching that Good News.
COL.1.24	I am happy in my sufferings for you. There are things that Christ must still suffer through his body, the church. I am accepting, in my body, my part of these things that must be suffered. 
COL.1.25	I became a servant of the church because God gave me a special work to do that helps you, and that work is to tell fully the message of God. 
COL.1.26	This message is the secret that was hidden from everyone since the beginning of time, but now it is made known to God’s holy people. 
COL.1.27	God decided to let his people know this rich and glorious secret which he has for all people. This secret is Christ himself, who is in you. He is our only hope for glory. 
COL.1.28	So we continue to preach Christ to each person, using all wisdom to warn and to teach everyone, in order to bring each one into God’s presence as a mature person in Christ. 
COL.1.29	To do this, I work and struggle, using Christ’s great strength that works so powerfully in me.
COL.2.1	I want you to know how hard I work for you, those in Laodicea, and others who have never seen me. 
COL.2.2	I want them to be strengthened and joined together with love so that they may be rich in their understanding. This leads to their knowing fully God’s secret, that is, Christ himself. 
COL.2.3	In him all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are safely kept.
COL.2.4	I say this so that no one can fool you by arguments that seem good, but are false. 
COL.2.5	Though I am absent from you in my body, my heart is with you, and I am happy to see your good lives and your strong faith in Christ.
COL.2.6	As you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so continue to live in him. 
COL.2.7	Keep your roots deep in him and have your lives built on him. Be strong in the faith, just as you were taught, and always be thankful.
COL.2.8	Be sure that no one leads you away with false and empty teaching that is only human, which comes from the ruling spirits of this world, and not from Christ. 
COL.2.9	All of God lives fully in Christ (even when Christ was on earth), 
COL.2.10	and you have a full and true life in Christ, who is ruler over all rulers and powers.
COL.2.11	Also in Christ you had a different kind of circumcision, a circumcision not done by hands. It was through Christ’s circumcision, that is, his death, that you were made free from the power of your sinful self. 
COL.2.12	When you were baptized, you were buried with Christ, and you were raised up with him through your faith in God’s power that was shown when he raised Christ from the dead. 
COL.2.13	When you were spiritually dead because of your sins and because you were not free from the power of your sinful self, God made you alive with Christ, and he forgave all our sins. 
COL.2.14	He canceled the debt, which listed all the rules we failed to follow. He took away that record with its rules and nailed it to the cross. 
COL.2.15	God stripped the spiritual rulers and powers of their authority. With the cross, he won the victory and showed the world that they were powerless.
COL.2.16	So do not let anyone make rules for you about eating and drinking or about a religious feast, a New Moon Festival, or a Sabbath day. 
COL.2.17	These things were like a shadow of what was to come. But what is true and real has come and is found in Christ. 
COL.2.18	Do not let anyone disqualify you by making you humiliate yourself and worship angels. Such people enter into visions, which fill them with foolish pride because of their human way of thinking. 
COL.2.19	They do not hold tightly to Christ, the head. It is from him that all the parts of the body are cared for and held together. So it grows in the way God wants it to grow.
COL.2.20	Since you died with Christ and were made free from the ruling spirits of the world, why do you act as if you still belong to this world by following rules like these: 
COL.2.21	“Don’t handle this,” “Don’t taste that,” “Don’t even touch that thing”? 
COL.2.22	These rules refer to earthly things that are gone as soon as they are used. They are only human commands and teachings. 
COL.2.23	They seem to be wise, but they are only part of a human religion. They make people pretend not to be proud and make them punish their bodies, but they do not really control the evil desires of the sinful self.
COL.3.1	Since you were raised from the dead with Christ, aim at what is in heaven, where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God. 
COL.3.2	Think only about the things in heaven, not the things on earth. 
COL.3.3	Your old sinful self has died, and your new life is kept with Christ in God. 
COL.3.4	Christ is your life, and when he comes again, you will share in his glory.
COL.3.5	So put all evil things out of your life: sexual sinning, doing evil, letting evil thoughts control you, wanting things that are evil, and greed. This is really serving a false god. 
COL.3.6	These things make God angry. 
COL.3.7	In your past, evil life you also did these things.
COL.3.8	But now also put these things out of your life: anger, bad temper, doing or saying things to hurt others, and using evil words when you talk. 
COL.3.9	Do not lie to each other. You have left your old sinful life and the things you did before. 
COL.3.10	You have begun to live the new life, in which you are being made new and are becoming like the One who made you. This new life brings you the true knowledge of God. 
COL.3.11	In the new life there is no difference between Greeks and Jews, those who are circumcised and those who are not circumcised, or people who are foreigners, or Scythians. There is no difference between slaves and free people. But Christ is in all believers, and Christ is all that is important.
COL.3.12	God has chosen you and made you his holy people. He loves you. So you should always clothe yourselves with mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. 
COL.3.13	Bear with each other, and forgive each other. If someone does wrong to you, forgive that person because the Lord forgave you. 
COL.3.14	Even more than all this, clothe yourself in love. Love is what holds you all together in perfect unity. 
COL.3.15	Let the peace that Christ gives control your thinking, because you were all called together in one body to have peace. Always be thankful. 
COL.3.16	Let the teaching of Christ live in you richly. Use all wisdom to teach and instruct each other by singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God. 
COL.3.17	Everything you do or say should be done to obey Jesus your Lord. And in all you do, give thanks to God the Father through Jesus.
COL.3.18	Wives, yield to the authority of your husbands, because this is the right thing to do in the Lord.
COL.3.19	Husbands, love your wives and be gentle with them.
COL.3.20	Children, obey your parents in all things, because this pleases the Lord.
COL.3.21	Fathers, do not nag your children. If you are too hard to please, they may want to stop trying.
COL.3.22	Slaves, obey your masters in all things. Do not obey just when they are watching you, to gain their favor, but serve them honestly, because you respect the Lord. 
COL.3.23	In all the work you are doing, work the best you can. Work as if you were doing it for the Lord, not for people. 
COL.3.24	Remember that you will receive your reward from the Lord, which he promised to his people. You are serving the Lord Christ. 
COL.3.25	But remember that anyone who does wrong will be punished for that wrong, and the Lord treats everyone the same.
COL.4.1	Masters, give what is good and fair to your slaves. Remember that you have a Master in heaven.
COL.4.2	Continue praying, keeping alert, and always thanking God. 
COL.4.3	Also pray for us that God will give us an opportunity to tell people his message. Pray that we can preach the secret that God has made known about Christ. This is why I am in prison. 
COL.4.4	Pray that I can speak in a way that will make it clear, as I should.
COL.4.5	Be wise in the way you act with people who are not believers, making the most of every opportunity. 
COL.4.6	When you talk, you should always be kind and pleasant so you will be able to answer everyone in the way you should.
COL.4.7	Tychicus is my dear brother in Christ and a faithful minister and servant with me in the Lord. He will tell you all the things that are happening to me. 
COL.4.8	This is why I am sending him: so you may know how we are and he may encourage you. 
COL.4.9	I send him with Onesimus, a faithful and dear brother in Christ, and one of your group. They will tell you all that has happened here.
COL.4.10	Aristarchus, a prisoner with me, and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, greet you. (I have already told you what to do about Mark. If he comes, welcome him.) 
COL.4.11	Jesus, who is called Justus, also greets you. These are the only Jewish believers who work with me for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.
COL.4.12	Epaphras, a servant of Jesus Christ, from your group, also greets you. He always prays for you that you will grow to be spiritually mature and have everything God wants for you. 
COL.4.13	I know he has worked hard for you and the people in Laodicea and in Hierapolis. 
COL.4.14	Demas and our dear friend Luke, the doctor, greet you.
COL.4.15	Greet the brothers and sisters in Laodicea. And greet Nympha and the church that meets in her house. 
COL.4.16	After this letter is read to you, be sure it is also read to the church in Laodicea. And you read the letter that I wrote to Laodicea. 
COL.4.17	Tell Archippus, “Be sure to finish the work the Lord gave you.”
COL.4.18	I, Paul, greet you and write this with my own hand. Remember me in prison. Grace be with you. 
1TH.1.1	From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.
1TH.1.1	To the church in Thessalonica, the church in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
1TH.1.1	Grace and peace to you.
1TH.1.2	We always thank God for all of you and mention you when we pray. 
1TH.1.3	We continually recall before God our Father the things you have done because of your faith and the work you have done because of your love. And we thank him that you continue to be strong because of your hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
1TH.1.4	Brothers and sisters, God loves you, and we know he has chosen you, 
1TH.1.5	because the Good News we brought to you came not only with words, but with power, with the Holy Spirit, and with sure knowledge that it is true. Also you know how we lived when we were with you in order to help you. 
1TH.1.6	And you became like us and like the Lord. You suffered much, but still you accepted the teaching with the joy that comes from the Holy Spirit. 
1TH.1.7	So you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Southern Greece. 
1TH.1.8	And the Lord’s teaching spread from you not only into Macedonia and Southern Greece, but now your faith in God has become known everywhere. So we do not need to say anything about it. 
1TH.1.9	People everywhere are telling about the way you accepted us when we were there with you. They tell how you stopped worshiping idols and began serving the living and true God. 
1TH.1.10	And you wait for God’s Son, whom God raised from the dead, to come from heaven. He is Jesus, who saves us from God’s angry judgment that is sure to come.
1TH.2.1	Brothers and sisters, you know our visit to you was not a failure. 
1TH.2.2	Before we came to you, we suffered in Philippi. People there insulted us, as you know, and many people were against us. But our God helped us to be brave and to tell you his Good News. 
1TH.2.3	Our appeal does not come from lies or wrong reasons, nor were we trying to trick you. 
1TH.2.4	But we speak the Good News because God tested us and trusted us to do it. When we speak, we are not trying to please people, but God, who tests our hearts. 
1TH.2.5	You know that we never tried to influence you by saying nice things about you. We were not trying to get your money; we had no selfishness to hide from you. God knows that this is true. 
1TH.2.6	We were not looking for human praise, from you or anyone else, 
1TH.2.7	even though as apostles of Christ we could have used our authority over you.
1TH.2.7	But we were very gentle with you, like a mother caring for her little children. 
1TH.2.8	Because we loved you, we were happy to share not only God’s Good News with you, but even our own lives. You had become so dear to us! 
1TH.2.9	Brothers and sisters, I know you remember our hard work and difficulties. We worked night and day so we would not burden any of you while we preached God’s Good News to you.
1TH.2.10	When we were with you, we lived in a holy and honest way, without fault. You know this is true, and so does God. 
1TH.2.11	You know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children. 
1TH.2.12	We encouraged you, we urged you, and we insisted that you live good lives for God, who calls you to his glorious kingdom.
1TH.2.13	Also, we always thank God because when you heard his message from us, you accepted it as the word of God, not the words of humans. And it really is God’s message which works in you who believe. 
1TH.2.14	Brothers and sisters, your experiences have been like those of God’s churches in Christ that are in Judea. You suffered from the people of your own country, as they suffered from the Jews 
1TH.2.15	who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and forced us to leave that country. They do not please God and are against all people. 
1TH.2.16	They try to stop us from teaching those who are not Jews so they may be saved. By doing this, they are increasing their sins to the limit. The anger of God has come to them at last.
1TH.2.17	Brothers and sisters, though we were separated from you for a short time, our thoughts were still with you. We wanted very much to see you and tried hard to do so. 
1TH.2.18	We wanted to come to you. I, Paul, tried to come more than once, but Satan stopped us. 
1TH.2.19	You are our hope, our joy, and the crown we will take pride in when our Lord Jesus Christ comes. 
1TH.2.20	Truly you are our glory and our joy.
1TH.3.1	When we could not wait any longer, we decided it was best to stay in Athens alone 
1TH.3.2	and send Timothy to you. Timothy, our brother, works with us for God and helps us tell people the Good News about Christ. We sent him to strengthen and encourage you in your faith 
1TH.3.3	so none of you would be upset by these troubles. You yourselves know that we must face these troubles. 
1TH.3.4	Even when we were with you, we told you we all would have to suffer, and you know it has happened. 
1TH.3.5	Because of this, when I could wait no longer, I sent Timothy to you so I could learn about your faith. I was afraid the devil had tempted you, and perhaps our hard work would have been wasted.
1TH.3.6	But Timothy now has come back to us from you and has brought us good news about your faith and love. He told us that you always remember us in a good way and that you want to see us just as much as we want to see you. 
1TH.3.7	So, brothers and sisters, while we have much trouble and suffering, we are encouraged about you because of your faith. 
1TH.3.8	Our life is really full if you stand strong in the Lord. 
1TH.3.9	We have so much joy before our God because of you. We cannot thank him enough for all the joy we feel. 
1TH.3.10	Night and day we continue praying with all our heart that we can see you again and give you all the things you need to make your faith strong.
1TH.3.11	Now may our God and Father himself and our Lord Jesus prepare the way for us to come to you. 
1TH.3.12	May the Lord make your love grow more and multiply for each other and for all people so that you will love others as we love you. 
1TH.3.13	May your hearts be made strong so that you will be holy and without fault before our God and Father when our Lord Jesus comes with all his holy ones.
1TH.4.1	Brothers and sisters, we taught you how to live in a way that will please God, and you are living that way. Now we ask and encourage you in the Lord Jesus to live that way even more. 
1TH.4.2	You know what we told you to do by the authority of the Lord Jesus. 
1TH.4.3	God wants you to be holy and to stay away from sexual sins. 
1TH.4.4	He wants each of you to learn to control your own body in a way that is holy and honorable. 
1TH.4.5	Don’t use your body for sexual sin like the people who do not know God. 
1TH.4.6	Also, do not wrong or cheat another Christian in this way. The Lord will punish people who do those things as we have already told you and warned you. 
1TH.4.7	God called us to be holy and does not want us to live in sin. 
1TH.4.8	So the person who refuses to obey this teaching is disobeying God, not simply a human teaching. And God is the One who gives us his Holy Spirit.
1TH.4.9	We do not need to write you about having love for your Christian family, because God has already taught you to love each other. 
1TH.4.10	And truly you do love the Christians in all of Macedonia. Brothers and sisters, now we encourage you to love them even more.
1TH.4.11	Do all you can to live a peaceful life. Take care of your own business, and do your own work as we have already told you. 
1TH.4.12	If you do, then people who are not believers will respect you, and you will not have to depend on others for what you need.
1TH.4.13	Brothers and sisters, we want you to know about those Christians who have died so you will not be sad, as others who have no hope. 
1TH.4.14	We believe that Jesus died and that he rose again. So, because of him, God will raise with Jesus those who have died. 
1TH.4.15	What we tell you now is the Lord’s own message. We who are living when the Lord comes again will not go before those who have already died. 
1TH.4.16	The Lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. And those who have died believing in Christ will rise first. 
1TH.4.17	After that, we who are still alive will be gathered up with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And we will be with the Lord forever. 
1TH.4.18	So encourage each other with these words.
1TH.5.1	Now, brothers and sisters, we do not need to write you about times and dates. 
1TH.5.2	You know very well that the day the Lord comes again will be a surprise, like a thief that comes in the night. 
1TH.5.3	While people are saying, “We have peace and we are safe,” they will be destroyed quickly. It is like pains that come quickly to a woman having a baby. Those people will not escape. 
1TH.5.4	But you, brothers and sisters, are not living in darkness, and so that day will not surprise you like a thief. 
1TH.5.5	You are all people who belong to the light and to the day. We do not belong to the night or to darkness. 
1TH.5.6	So we should not be like other people who are sleeping, but we should be alert and have self-control. 
1TH.5.7	Those who sleep, sleep at night. Those who get drunk, get drunk at night. 
1TH.5.8	But we belong to the day, so we should control ourselves. We should wear faith and love to protect us, and the hope of salvation should be our helmet. 
1TH.5.9	God did not choose us to suffer his anger but to have salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. 
1TH.5.10	Jesus died for us so that we can live together with him, whether we are alive or dead when he comes. 
1TH.5.11	So encourage each other and give each other strength, just as you are doing now.
1TH.5.12	Now, brothers and sisters, we ask you to appreciate those who work hard among you, who lead you in the Lord and teach you. 
1TH.5.13	Respect them with a very special love because of the work they do.
1TH.5.13	Live in peace with each other. 
1TH.5.14	We ask you, brothers and sisters, to warn those who do not work. Encourage the people who are afraid. Help those who are weak. Be patient with everyone. 
1TH.5.15	Be sure that no one pays back wrong for wrong, but always try to do what is good for each other and for all people.
1TH.5.16	Always be joyful. 
1TH.5.17	Pray continually, 
1TH.5.18	and give thanks whatever happens. That is what God wants for you in Christ Jesus.
1TH.5.19	Do not hold back the work of the Holy Spirit. 
1TH.5.20	Do not treat prophecy as if it were unimportant. 
1TH.5.21	But test everything. Keep what is good, 
1TH.5.22	and stay away from everything that is evil.
1TH.5.23	Now may God himself, the God of peace, make you pure, belonging only to him. May your whole self—spirit, soul, and body—be kept safe and without fault when our Lord Jesus Christ comes. 
1TH.5.24	You can trust the One who calls you to do that for you.
1TH.5.25	Brothers and sisters, pray for us.
1TH.5.26	Give each other a holy kiss when you meet. 
1TH.5.27	I tell you by the authority of the Lord to read this letter to all the believers.
1TH.5.28	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. 
2TH.1.1	From Paul, Silas, and Timothy.
2TH.1.1	To the church in Thessalonica in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
2TH.1.2	Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.1.3	We must always thank God for you, brothers and sisters. This is only right, because your faith is growing more and more, and the love that every one of you has for each other is increasing. 
2TH.1.4	So we brag about you to the other churches of God. We tell them about the way you continue to be strong and have faith even though you are being treated badly and are suffering many troubles.
2TH.1.5	This is proof that God is right in his judgment. He wants you to be counted worthy of his kingdom for which you are suffering. 
2TH.1.6	God will do what is right. He will give trouble to those who trouble you. 
2TH.1.7	And he will give rest to you who are troubled and to us also when the Lord Jesus appears with burning fire from heaven with his powerful angels. 
2TH.1.8	Then he will punish those who do not know God and who do not obey the Good News about our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.1.9	Those people will be punished with a destruction that continues forever. They will be kept away from the Lord and from his great power. 
2TH.1.10	This will happen on the day when the Lord Jesus comes to receive glory because of his holy people. And all the people who have believed will be amazed at Jesus. You will be in that group, because you believed what we told you.
2TH.1.11	That is why we always pray for you, asking our God to help you live the kind of life he called you to live. We pray that with his power God will help you do the good things you want and perform the works that come from your faith. 
2TH.1.12	We pray all this so that the name of our Lord Jesus Christ will have glory in you, and you will have glory in him. That glory comes from the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
2TH.2.1	Brothers and sisters, we have something to say about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and the time when we will meet together with him. 
2TH.2.2	Do not become easily upset in your thinking or afraid if you hear that the day of the Lord has already come. Someone may have said this in a prophecy or in a message or in a letter as if it came from us. 
2TH.2.3	Do not let anyone fool you in any way. That day of the Lord will not come until the turning away from God happens and the Man of Evil, who is on his way to hell, appears. 
2TH.2.4	He will be against and put himself above any so-called god or anything that people worship. And that Man of Evil will even go into God’s Temple and sit there and say that he is God.
2TH.2.5	I told you when I was with you that all this would happen. Do you not remember? 
2TH.2.6	And now you know what is stopping that Man of Evil so he will appear at the right time. 
2TH.2.7	The secret power of evil is already working in the world, but there is one who is stopping that power. And he will continue to stop it until he is taken out of the way. 
2TH.2.8	Then that Man of Evil will appear, and the Lord Jesus will kill him with the breath that comes from his mouth and will destroy him with the glory of his coming. 
2TH.2.9	The Man of Evil will come by the power of Satan. He will have great power, and he will do many different false miracles, signs, and wonders. 
2TH.2.10	He will use every kind of evil to trick those who are lost. They will die, because they refused to love the truth. (If they loved the truth, they would be saved.) 
2TH.2.11	For this reason God sends them something powerful that leads them away from the truth so they will believe a lie. 
2TH.2.12	So all those will be judged guilty who did not believe the truth, but enjoyed doing evil.
2TH.2.13	Brothers and sisters, whom the Lord loves, God chose you from the beginning to be saved. So we must always thank God for you. You are saved by the Spirit that makes you holy and by your faith in the truth. 
2TH.2.14	God used the Good News that we preached to call you to be saved so you can share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2TH.2.15	So, brothers and sisters, stand strong and continue to believe the teachings we gave you in our speaking and in our letter.
2TH.2.16+2TH.2.17	May our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father encourage you and strengthen you in every good thing you do and say. God loved us, and through his grace he gave us a good hope and encouragement that continues forever.
2TH.3.1	And now, brothers and sisters, pray for us that the Lord’s teaching will continue to spread quickly and that people will give honor to that teaching, just as happened with you. 
2TH.3.2	And pray that we will be protected from stubborn and evil people, because not all people believe.
2TH.3.3	But the Lord is faithful and will give you strength and will protect you from the Evil One. 
2TH.3.4	The Lord makes us feel sure that you are doing and will continue to do the things we told you. 
2TH.3.5	May the Lord lead your hearts into God’s love and Christ’s patience.
2TH.3.6	Brothers and sisters, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ we command you to stay away from any believer who refuses to work and does not follow the teaching we gave you. 
2TH.3.7	You yourselves know that you should live as we live. We were not lazy when we were with you. 
2TH.3.8	And when we ate another person’s food, we always paid for it. We worked very hard night and day so we would not be an expense to any of you. 
2TH.3.9	We had the right to ask you to help us, but we worked to take care of ourselves so we would be an example for you to follow. 
2TH.3.10	When we were with you, we gave you this rule: “Anyone who refuses to work should not eat.”
2TH.3.11	We hear that some people in your group refuse to work. They do nothing but busy themselves in other people’s lives. 
2TH.3.12	We command those people and beg them in the Lord Jesus Christ to work quietly and earn their own food. 
2TH.3.13	But you, brothers and sisters, never become tired of doing good.
2TH.3.14	If some people do not obey what we tell you in this letter, then take note of them. Have nothing to do with them so they will feel ashamed. 
2TH.3.15	But do not treat them as enemies. Warn them as fellow believers.
2TH.3.16	Now may the Lord of peace give you peace at all times and in every way. The Lord be with all of you.
2TH.3.17	I, Paul, end this letter now in my own handwriting. All my letters have this to show they are from me. This is the way I write.
2TH.3.18	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. 
1TI.1.1	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus our hope.
1TI.1.2	To Timothy, a true child to me because you believe:
1TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
1TI.1.3	I asked you to stay longer in Ephesus when I went into Macedonia so you could command some people there to stop teaching false things. 
1TI.1.4	Tell them not to spend their time on stories that are not true and on long lists of names in family histories. These things only bring arguments; they do not help God’s work, which is done in faith. 
1TI.1.5	The purpose of this command is for people to have love, a love that comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a true faith. 
1TI.1.6	Some people have missed these things and turned to useless talk. 
1TI.1.7	They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand either what they are talking about or what they are sure about.
1TI.1.8	But we know that the law is good if someone uses it lawfully. 
1TI.1.9	We also know that the law is not made for good people but for those who are against the law and for those who refuse to follow it. It is for people who are against God and are sinful, who are unholy and ungodly, who kill their fathers and mothers, who murder, 
1TI.1.10	who take part in sexual sins, who have sexual relations with people of the same sex, who sell slaves, who tell lies, who speak falsely, and who do anything against the true teaching of God. 
1TI.1.11	That teaching is part of the Good News of the blessed God that he gave me to tell.
1TI.1.12	I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who gave me strength, because he trusted me and gave me this work of serving him. 
1TI.1.13	In the past I spoke against Christ and persecuted him and did all kinds of things to hurt him. But God showed me mercy, because I did not know what I was doing. I did not believe. 
1TI.1.14	But the grace of our Lord was fully given to me, and with that grace came the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
1TI.1.15	What I say is true, and you should fully accept it: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the worst. 
1TI.1.16	But I was given mercy so that in me, the worst of all sinners, Christ Jesus could show that he has patience without limit. His patience with me made me an example for those who would believe in him and have life forever. 
1TI.1.17	To the King that rules forever, who will never die, who cannot be seen, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
1TI.1.18	Timothy, my child, I am giving you a command that agrees with the prophecies that were given about you in the past. I tell you this so you can follow them and fight the good fight. 
1TI.1.19	Continue to have faith and do what you know is right. Some people have rejected this, and their faith has been shipwrecked. 
1TI.1.20	Hymenaeus and Alexander have done that, and I have given them to Satan so they will learn not to speak against God.
1TI.2.1	First, I tell you to pray for all people, asking God for what they need and being thankful to him. 
1TI.2.2	Pray for rulers and for all who have authority so that we can have quiet and peaceful lives full of worship and respect for God. 
1TI.2.3	This is good, and it pleases God our Savior, 
1TI.2.4	who wants all people to be saved and to know the truth. 
1TI.2.5	There is one God and one mediator so that human beings can reach God. That way is through Christ Jesus, who is himself human. 
1TI.2.6	He gave himself as a payment to free all people. He is proof that came at the right time. 
1TI.2.7	That is why I was chosen to tell the Good News and to be an apostle. (I am telling the truth; I am not lying.) I was chosen to teach those who are not Jews to believe and to know the truth.
1TI.2.8	So, I want the men everywhere to pray, lifting up their hands in a holy manner, without anger and arguments.
1TI.2.9	Also, women should wear proper clothes that show respect and self-control, not using braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes. 
1TI.2.10	Instead, they should do good deeds, which is right for women who say they worship God.
1TI.2.11	Let a woman learn by listening quietly and being ready to cooperate in everything. 
1TI.2.12	But I do not allow a woman to teach or to have authority over a man, but to listen quietly, 
1TI.2.13	because Adam was formed first and then Eve. 
1TI.2.14	And Adam was not tricked, but the woman was tricked and became a sinner. 
1TI.2.15	But she will be saved through having children if she continues in faith, love, and holiness, with self-control.
1TI.3.1	What I say is true: Anyone wanting to become an overseer desires a good work. 
1TI.3.2	An overseer must not give people a reason to criticize him, and he must have only one wife. He must be self-controlled, wise, respected by others, ready to welcome guests, and able to teach. 
1TI.3.3	He must not drink too much wine or like to fight, but rather be gentle and peaceable, not loving money. 
1TI.3.4	He must be a good family leader, having children who cooperate with full respect. 
1TI.3.5	(If someone does not know how to lead the family, how can that person take care of God’s church?) 
1TI.3.6	But an elder must not be a new believer, or he might be too proud of himself and be judged guilty just as the devil was. 
1TI.3.7	An elder must also have the respect of people who are not in the church so he will not be criticized by others and caught in the devil’s trap.
1TI.3.8	In the same way, deacons must be respected by others, not saying things they do not mean. They must not drink too much wine or try to get rich by cheating others. 
1TI.3.9	With a clear conscience they must follow the secret of the faith that God made known to us. 
1TI.3.10	Test them first. Then let them serve as deacons if you find nothing wrong in them. 
1TI.3.11	In the same way, women must be respected by others. They must not speak evil of others. They must be self-controlled and trustworthy in everything. 
1TI.3.12	Deacons must have only one wife and be good leaders of their children and their own families. 
1TI.3.13	Those who serve well as deacons are making an honorable place for themselves, and they will be very bold in their faith in Christ Jesus.
1TI.3.14	Although I hope I can come to you soon, I am writing these things to you now. 
1TI.3.15	Then, even if I am delayed, you will know how to live in the family of God. That family is the church of the living God, the support and foundation of the truth. 
1TI.3.16	Without doubt, the secret of our life of worship is great:
1TI.3.16	He was shown to us in a human body,
1TI.3.16	proved right in spirit,
1TI.3.16	and seen by angels.
1TI.3.16	He was proclaimed to the nations,
1TI.3.16	believed in by the world,
1TI.3.16	and taken up in glory.
1TI.4.1	Now the Holy Spirit clearly says that in the later times some people will stop believing the faith. They will follow spirits that lie and teachings of demons. 
1TI.4.2	Such teachings come from the false words of liars whose consciences are destroyed as if by a hot iron. 
1TI.4.3	They forbid people to marry and tell them not to eat certain foods which God created to be eaten with thanks by people who believe and know the truth. 
1TI.4.4	Everything God made is good, and nothing should be refused if it is accepted with thanks, 
1TI.4.5	because it is made holy by what God has said and by prayer.
1TI.4.6	By telling these things to the brothers and sisters, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus. You will be made strong by the words of the faith and the good teaching which you have been following. 
1TI.4.7	But do not follow foolish stories that disagree with God’s truth, but train yourself to serve God. 
1TI.4.8	Training your body helps you in some ways, but serving God helps you in every way by bringing you blessings in this life and in the future life, too. 
1TI.4.9	What I say is true, and you should fully accept it. 
1TI.4.10	This is why we work and struggle: We hope in the living God who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.
1TI.4.11	Command and teach these things. 
1TI.4.12	Do not let anyone treat you as if you are unimportant because you are young. Instead, be an example to the believers with your words, your actions, your love, your faith, and your pure life. 
1TI.4.13	Until I come, continue to read the Scriptures to the people, strengthen them, and teach them. 
1TI.4.14	Use the gift you have, which was given to you through prophecy when the group of elders laid their hands on you. 
1TI.4.15	Continue to do those things; give your life to doing them so your progress may be seen by everyone. 
1TI.4.16	Be careful in your life and in your teaching. If you continue to live and teach rightly, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.
1TI.5.1	Do not speak angrily to an older man, but plead with him as if he were your father. Treat younger men like brothers, 
1TI.5.2	older women like mothers, and younger women like sisters. Always treat them in a pure way.
1TI.5.3	Take care of widows who are truly widows. 
1TI.5.4	But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to do their duty to their own family and to repay their parents or grandparents. That pleases God. 
1TI.5.5	The true widow, who is all alone, puts her hope in God and continues to pray night and day for God’s help. 
1TI.5.6	But the widow who uses her life to please herself is really dead while she is alive. 
1TI.5.7	Tell the believers to do these things so that no one can criticize them. 
1TI.5.8	Whoever does not care for his own relatives, especially his own family members, has turned against the faith and is worse than someone who does not believe in God.
1TI.5.9	To be on the list of widows, a woman must be at least sixty years old. She must have been faithful to her husband. 
1TI.5.10	She must be known for her good works—works such as raising her children, welcoming strangers, washing the feet of God’s people, helping those in trouble, and giving her life to do all kinds of good deeds.
1TI.5.11	But do not put younger widows on that list. After they give themselves to Christ, they are pulled away from him by their physical desires, and then they want to marry again. 
1TI.5.12	They will be judged for not doing what they first promised to do. 
1TI.5.13	Besides that, they learn to waste their time, going from house to house. And they not only waste their time but also begin to gossip and busy themselves with other people’s lives, saying things they should not say. 
1TI.5.14	So I want the younger widows to marry, have children, and manage their homes. Then no enemy will have any reason to criticize them. 
1TI.5.15	But some have already turned away to follow Satan.
1TI.5.16	If any woman who is a believer has widows in her family, she should care for them herself. The church should not have to care for them. Then it will be able to take care of those who are truly widows.
1TI.5.17	The elders who lead the church well should receive double honor, especially those who work hard by speaking and teaching, 
1TI.5.18	because the Scripture says: “When an ox is working in the grain, do not cover its mouth to keep it from eating,” and 
1TI.5.19	Do not listen to someone who accuses an elder, without two or three witnesses. 
1TI.5.20	Tell those who continue sinning that they are wrong. Do this in front of the whole church so that the others will have a warning.
1TI.5.21	Before God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels, I command you to do these things without showing favor of any kind to anyone.
1TI.5.22	Think carefully before you lay your hands on anyone, and don’t share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
1TI.5.23	Stop drinking only water, but drink a little wine to help your stomach and your frequent sicknesses.
1TI.5.24	The sins of some people are easy to see even before they are judged, but the sins of others are seen only later. 
1TI.5.25	So also good deeds are easy to see, but even those that are not easily seen cannot stay hidden.
1TI.6.1	All who are slaves under a yoke should show full respect to their masters so no one will speak against God’s name and our teaching. 
1TI.6.2	The slaves whose masters are believers should not show their masters any less respect because they are believers. They should serve their masters even better, because they are helping believers they love.
1TI.6.2	You must teach and preach these things.
1TI.6.3	Anyone who has a different teaching does not agree with the true teaching of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that shows the true way to serve God. 
1TI.6.4	This person is full of pride and understands nothing, but is sick with a love for arguing and fighting about words. This brings jealousy, fighting, speaking against others, evil mistrust, 
1TI.6.5	and constant quarrels from those who have evil minds and have lost the truth. They think that serving God is a way to get rich.
1TI.6.6	Serving God does make us very rich, if we are satisfied with what we have. 
1TI.6.7	We brought nothing into the world, so we can take nothing out. 
1TI.6.8	But, if we have food and clothes, we will be satisfied with that. 
1TI.6.9	Those who want to become rich bring temptation to themselves and are caught in a trap. They want many foolish and harmful things that ruin and destroy people. 
1TI.6.10	The love of money causes all kinds of evil. Some people have left the faith, because they wanted to get more money, but they have caused themselves much sorrow.
1TI.6.11	But you, man of God, run away from all those things. Instead, live in the right way, serve God, have faith, love, patience, and gentleness. 
1TI.6.12	Fight the good fight of faith, grabbing hold of the life that continues forever. You were called to have that life when you confessed the good confession before many witnesses. 
1TI.6.13	In the sight of God, who gives life to everything, and of Christ Jesus, I give you a command. Christ Jesus made the good confession when he stood before Pontius Pilate. 
1TI.6.14	Do what you were commanded to do without wrong or blame until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again. 
1TI.6.15	God will make that happen at the right time. He is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords. 
1TI.6.16	He is the only One who never dies. He lives in light so bright no one can go near it. No one has ever seen God, or can see him. May honor and power belong to God forever. Amen.
1TI.6.17	Command those who are rich with things of this world not to be proud. Tell them to hope in God, not in their uncertain riches. God richly gives us everything to enjoy. 
1TI.6.18	Tell the rich people to do good, to be rich in doing good deeds, to be generous and ready to share. 
1TI.6.19	By doing that, they will be saving a treasure for themselves as a strong foundation for the future. Then they will be able to have the life that is true life.
1TI.6.20	Timothy, guard what God has trusted to you. Stay away from foolish, useless talk and from the arguments of what is falsely called “knowledge.” 
1TI.6.21	By saying they have that “knowledge,” some have missed the true faith.
1TI.6.21	Grace be with you. 
2TI.1.1	From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God. God sent me to tell about the promise of life that is in Christ Jesus.
2TI.1.2	To Timothy, a dear child to me:
2TI.1.2	Grace, mercy, and peace to you from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
2TI.1.3	I thank God as I always mention you in my prayers, day and night. I serve him, doing what I know is right as my ancestors did. 
2TI.1.4	Remembering that you cried for me, I want very much to see you so I can be filled with joy. 
2TI.1.5	I remember your true faith. That faith first lived in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice, and I know you now have that same faith. 
2TI.1.6	This is why I remind you to keep using the gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you. Now let it grow, as a small flame grows into a fire. 
2TI.1.7	God did not give us a spirit that makes us afraid but a spirit of power and love and self-control.
2TI.1.8	So do not be ashamed to tell people about our Lord Jesus, and do not be ashamed of me, in prison for the Lord. But suffer with me for the Good News. God, who gives us the strength to do that, 
2TI.1.9	saved us and made us his holy people. That was not because of anything we did ourselves but because of God’s purpose and grace. That grace was given to us through Christ Jesus before time began, 
2TI.1.10	but it is now shown to us by the coming of our Savior Christ Jesus. He destroyed death, and through the Good News he showed us the way to have life that cannot be destroyed. 
2TI.1.11	I was chosen to tell that Good News and to be an apostle and a teacher. 
2TI.1.12	I am suffering now because I tell the Good News, but I am not ashamed, because I know Jesus, the One in whom I have believed. And I am sure he is able to protect what he has trusted me with until that day. 
2TI.1.13	Follow the pattern of true teachings that you heard from me in faith and love, which are in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.1.14	Protect the truth that you were given; protect it with the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us.
2TI.1.15	You know that everyone in Asia has left me, even Phygelus and Hermogenes. 
2TI.1.16	May the Lord show mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, who has often helped me and was not ashamed that I was in prison. 
2TI.1.17	When he came to Rome, he looked eagerly for me until he found me. 
2TI.1.18	May the Lord allow him to find mercy from the Lord on that day. You know how many ways he helped me in Ephesus.
2TI.2.1	You then, Timothy, my child, be strong in the grace we have in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.2	You should teach people whom you can trust the things you and many others have heard me say. Then they will be able to teach others. 
2TI.2.3	Share in the troubles we have like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. 
2TI.2.4	A soldier wants to please the enlisting officer, so no one serving in the army wastes time with everyday matters. 
2TI.2.5	Also an athlete who takes part in a contest must obey all the rules in order to win. 
2TI.2.6	The farmer who works hard should be the first person to get some of the food that was grown. 
2TI.2.7	Think about what I am saying, because the Lord will give you the ability to understand everything.
2TI.2.8	Remember Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead, who is from the family of David. This is the Good News I preach, 
2TI.2.9	and I am suffering because of it to the point of being bound with chains like a criminal. But God’s teaching is not in chains. 
2TI.2.10	So I patiently accept all these troubles so that those whom God has chosen can have the salvation that is in Christ Jesus. With that salvation comes glory that never ends.
2TI.2.11	This teaching is true:
2TI.2.11	If we died with him, we will also live with him.
2TI.2.12	If we accept suffering, we will also rule with him.
2TI.2.12	If we say we don’t know him, he will say he doesn’t know us.
2TI.2.13	If we are not faithful, he will still be faithful,
2TI.2.13	because he must be true to who he is.
2TI.2.14	Continue teaching these things, warning people in God’s presence not to argue about words. It does not help anyone, and it ruins those who listen. 
2TI.2.15	Make every effort to give yourself to God as the kind of person he will approve. Be a worker who is not ashamed and who uses the true teaching in the right way. 
2TI.2.16	Stay away from foolish, useless talk, because that will lead people further away from God. 
2TI.2.17	Their evil teaching will spread like a sickness inside the body. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that. 
2TI.2.18	They have left the true teaching, saying that the rising from the dead has already taken place, and so they are destroying the faith of some people. 
2TI.2.19	But God’s strong foundation continues to stand. These words are written on the seal: “The Lord knows those who belong to him,” and “Everyone who wants to belong to the Lord must stop doing wrong.”
2TI.2.20	In a large house there are not only things made of gold and silver, but also things made of wood and clay. Some things are used for special purposes, and others are made for ordinary jobs. 
2TI.2.21	All who make themselves clean from evil will be used for special purposes. They will be made holy, useful to the Master, ready to do any good work.
2TI.2.22	But run away from the evil desires of youth. Try hard to live right and to have faith, love, and peace, together with those who trust in the Lord from pure hearts. 
2TI.2.23	Stay away from foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they grow into quarrels. 
2TI.2.24	And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, a good teacher, and patient. 
2TI.2.25	The Lord’s servant must gently teach those who disagree. Then maybe God will let them change their minds so they can accept the truth. 
2TI.2.26	And they may wake up and escape from the trap of the devil, who catches them to do what he wants.
2TI.3.1	Remember this! In the last days there will be many troubles, 
2TI.3.2	because people will love themselves, love money, brag, and be proud. They will say evil things against others and will not obey their parents or be thankful or be the kind of people God wants. 
2TI.3.3	They will not love others, will refuse to forgive, will gossip, and will not control themselves. They will be cruel, will hate what is good, 
2TI.3.4	will turn against their friends, and will do foolish things without thinking. They will be conceited, will love pleasure instead of God, 
2TI.3.5	and will act as if they serve God but will not have his power. Stay away from those people. 
2TI.3.6	Some of them go into homes and get control of silly women who are full of sin and are led by many evil desires. 
2TI.3.7	These women are always learning new teachings, but they are never able to understand the truth fully. 
2TI.3.8	Just as Jannes and Jambres were against Moses, these people are against the truth. Their thinking has been ruined, and they have failed in trying to follow the faith. 
2TI.3.9	But they will not be successful in what they do, because as with Jannes and Jambres, everyone will see that they are foolish.
2TI.3.10	But you have followed what I teach, the way I live, my goal, faith, patience, and love. You know I never give up. 
2TI.3.11	You know how I have been hurt and have suffered, as in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. I have suffered, but the Lord saved me from all those troubles. 
2TI.3.12	Everyone who wants to live as God desires, in Christ Jesus, will be persecuted. 
2TI.3.13	But people who are evil and cheat others will go from bad to worse. They will fool others, but they will also be fooling themselves.
2TI.3.14	But you should continue following the teachings you learned. You know they are true, because you trust those who taught you. 
2TI.3.15	Since you were a child you have known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make you wise. And that wisdom leads to salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. 
2TI.3.16	All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful for teaching, for showing people what is wrong in their lives, for correcting faults, and for teaching how to live right. 
2TI.3.17	Using the Scriptures, the person who serves God will be capable, having all that is needed to do every good work.
2TI.4.1	I give you a command in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, the One who will judge the living and the dead, and by his coming and his kingdom: 
2TI.4.2	Preach the Good News. Be ready at all times, and tell people what they need to do. Tell them when they are wrong. Encourage them with great patience and careful teaching, 
2TI.4.3	because the time will come when people will not listen to the true teaching but will find many more teachers who please them by saying the things they want to hear. 
2TI.4.4	They will stop listening to the truth and will begin to follow false stories. 
2TI.4.5	But you should control yourself at all times, accept troubles, do the work of telling the Good News, and complete all the duties of a servant of God.
2TI.4.6	My life is being given as an offering to God, and the time has come for me to leave this life. 
2TI.4.7	I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. 
2TI.4.8	Now, a crown is being held for me—a crown for being right with God. The Lord, the judge who judges rightly, will give the crown to me on that day—not only to me but to all those who have waited with love for him to come again.
2TI.4.9	Do your best to come to me as soon as you can, 
2TI.4.10	because Demas, who loved this world, left me and went to Thessalonica. Crescens went to Galatia, and Titus went to Dalmatia. 
2TI.4.11	Luke is the only one still with me. Get Mark and bring him with you when you come, because he can help me in my work here. 
2TI.4.12	I sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 
2TI.4.13	When I was in Troas, I left my coat there with Carpus. So when you come, bring it to me, along with my books, particularly the ones written on parchment.
2TI.4.14	Alexander the metalworker did many harmful things against me. The Lord will punish him for what he did. 
2TI.4.15	You also should be careful that he does not hurt you, because he fought strongly against our teaching.
2TI.4.16	The first time I defended myself, no one helped me; everyone left me. May they be forgiven. 
2TI.4.17	But the Lord stayed with me and gave me strength so I could fully tell the Good News to all those who are not Jews. So I was saved from the lion’s mouth. 
2TI.4.18	The Lord will save me when anyone tries to hurt me, and he will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom. Glory forever and ever be the Lord’s. Amen.
2TI.4.19	Greet Priscilla and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus. 
2TI.4.20	Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. 
2TI.4.21	Try as hard as you can to come to me before winter.
2TI.4.21	Eubulus sends greetings to you. Also Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters in Christ greet you.
2TI.4.22	The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
TIT.1.1	From Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I was sent to help the faith of God’s chosen people and to help them know the truth that shows people how to serve God. 
TIT.1.2	That faith and that knowledge come from the hope for life forever, which God promised to us before time began. And God cannot lie. 
TIT.1.3	At the right time God let the world know about that life through preaching. He trusted me with that work, and I preached by the command of God our Savior.
TIT.1.4	To Titus, my true child in the faith we share:
TIT.1.4	Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
TIT.1.5	I left you in Crete so you could finish doing the things that still needed to be done and so you could appoint elders in every town, as I directed you. 
TIT.1.6	An elder must not be guilty of doing wrong, must have only one wife, and must have believing children. They must not be known as children who are wild and do not cooperate. 
TIT.1.7	As God’s managers, overseers must not be guilty of doing wrong, being selfish, or becoming angry quickly. They must not drink too much wine, like to fight, or try to get rich by cheating others. 
TIT.1.8	Overseers must be ready to welcome guests, love what is good, be wise, live right, and be holy and self-controlled. 
TIT.1.9	By holding on to the trustworthy word just as we teach it, overseers can help people by using true teaching, and they can show those who are against the true teaching that they are wrong.
TIT.1.10	There are many people who refuse to cooperate, who talk about worthless things and lead others into the wrong way—mainly those who insist on circumcision to be saved. 
TIT.1.11	These people must be stopped, because they are upsetting whole families by teaching things they should not teach, which they do to get rich by cheating people. 
TIT.1.12	Even one of their own prophets said, “Cretans are always liars, evil animals, and lazy people who do nothing but eat.” 
TIT.1.13	The words that prophet said are true. So firmly tell those people they are wrong so they may become strong in the faith, 
TIT.1.14	not accepting Jewish false stories and the commands of people who reject the truth. 
TIT.1.15	To those who are pure, all things are pure, but to those who are full of sin and do not believe, nothing is pure. Both their minds and their consciences have been ruined. 
TIT.1.16	They say they know God, but their actions show they do not accept him. They are hateful people, they refuse to obey, and they are useless for doing anything good.
TIT.2.1	But you must tell everyone what to do to follow the true teaching. 
TIT.2.2	Teach older men to be self-controlled, serious, wise, strong in faith, in love, and in patience.
TIT.2.3	In the same way, teach older women to be holy in their behavior, not speaking against others or enslaved to too much wine, but teaching what is good. 
TIT.2.4	Then they can teach the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 
TIT.2.5	to be wise and pure, to be good workers at home, to be kind, and to yield to their husbands. Then no one will be able to criticize the teaching God gave us.
TIT.2.6	In the same way, encourage young men to be wise. 
TIT.2.7	In every way be an example of doing good deeds. When you teach, do it with honesty and seriousness. 
TIT.2.8	Speak the truth so that you cannot be criticized. Then those who are against you will be ashamed because there is nothing bad to say about us.
TIT.2.9	Slaves should yield to their own masters at all times, trying to please them and not arguing with them. 
TIT.2.10	They should not steal from them but should show their masters they can be fully trusted so that in everything they do they will make the teaching of God our Savior attractive.
TIT.2.11	That is the way we should live, because God’s grace that can save everyone has come. 
TIT.2.12	It teaches us not to live against God nor to do the evil things the world wants to do. Instead, that grace teaches us to live in the present age in a wise and right way and in a way that shows we serve God. 
TIT.2.13	We should live like that while we wait for our great hope and the coming of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. 
TIT.2.14	He gave himself for us so he might pay the price to free us from all evil and to make us pure people who belong only to him—people who are always wanting to do good deeds.
TIT.2.15	Say these things and encourage the people and tell them what is wrong in their lives, with all authority. Do not let anyone treat you as if you were unimportant.
TIT.3.1	Remind the believers to yield to the authority of rulers and government leaders, to obey them, to be ready to do good, 
TIT.3.2	to speak no evil about anyone, to live in peace, and to be gentle and polite to all people.
TIT.3.3	In the past we also were foolish. We did not obey, we were wrong, and we were slaves to many things our bodies wanted and enjoyed. We spent our lives doing evil and being jealous. People hated us, and we hated each other. 
TIT.3.4	But when the kindness and love of God our Savior was shown, 
TIT.3.5	he saved us because of his mercy. It was not because of good deeds we did to be right with him. He saved us through the washing that made us new people through the Holy Spirit. 
TIT.3.6	God poured out richly upon us that Holy Spirit through Jesus Christ our Savior. 
TIT.3.7	Being made right with God by his grace, we could have the hope of receiving the life that never ends.
TIT.3.8	This teaching is true, and I want you to be sure the people understand these things. Then those who believe in God will be careful to use their lives for doing good. These things are good and will help everyone.
TIT.3.9	But stay away from those who have foolish arguments and talk about useless family histories and argue and quarrel about the law. Those things are worth nothing and will not help anyone. 
TIT.3.10	After a first and second warning, avoid someone who causes arguments. 
TIT.3.11	You can know that such people are evil and sinful; their own sins prove them wrong.
TIT.3.12	When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make every effort to come to me at Nicopolis, because I have decided to stay there this winter. 
TIT.3.13	Do all you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey so that they have everything they need. 
TIT.3.14	Our people must learn to use their lives for doing good deeds to provide what is necessary so that their lives will not be useless.
TIT.3.15	All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in the faith.
TIT.3.15	Grace be with you all.
PHM.1.1	From Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and from Timothy, our brother.
PHM.1.1	To Philemon, our dear friend and worker with us; 
PHM.1.2	to Apphia, our sister; to Archippus, a worker with us; and to the church that meets in your home:
PHM.1.3	Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
PHM.1.4	I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers, 
PHM.1.5	because I hear about the love you have for all God’s holy people and the faith you have in the Lord Jesus. 
PHM.1.6	I pray that the faith you share may make you understand every blessing we have in Christ. 
PHM.1.7	I have great joy and comfort, my brother, because the love you have shown to God’s people has refreshed them.
PHM.1.8	So, in Christ, I could be bold and order you to do what is right. 
PHM.1.9	But because I love you, I am pleading with you instead. I, Paul, an old man now and also a prisoner for Christ Jesus, 
PHM.1.10	am pleading with you for my child Onesimus, who became my child while I was in prison. 
PHM.1.11	In the past he was useless to you, but now he has become useful for both you and me.
PHM.1.12	I am sending him back to you, and with him I am sending my own heart. 
PHM.1.13	I wanted to keep him with me so that in your place he might help me while I am in prison for the Good News. 
PHM.1.14	But I did not want to do anything without asking you first so that any good you do for me will be because you want to do it, not because I forced you. 
PHM.1.15	Maybe Onesimus was separated from you for a short time so you could have him back forever— 
PHM.1.16	no longer as a slave, but better than a slave, as a loved brother. I love him very much, but you will love him even more, both as a person and as a believer in the Lord.
PHM.1.17	So if you consider me your partner, welcome Onesimus as you would welcome me. 
PHM.1.18	If he has done anything wrong to you or if he owes you anything, charge that to me. 
PHM.1.19	I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand. I will pay it back, and I will say nothing about what you owe me for your own life. 
PHM.1.20	So, my brother, I ask that you do this for me in the Lord: Refresh my heart in Christ. 
PHM.1.21	I write this letter, knowing that you will do what I ask you and even more.
PHM.1.22	One more thing—prepare a room for me in which to stay, because I hope God will answer your prayers and I will be able to come to you.
PHM.1.23	Epaphras, a prisoner with me for Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you. 
PHM.1.24	And also Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, workers together with me, send greetings.
PHM.1.25	The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. 
HEB.1.1	In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets many times and in many different ways. 
HEB.1.2	But now in these last days God has spoken to us through his Son. God has chosen his Son to own all things, and through him he made the world. 
HEB.1.3	The Son reflects the glory of God and shows exactly what God is like. He holds everything together with his powerful word. When the Son made people clean from their sins, he sat down at the right side of God, the Great One in heaven. 
HEB.1.4	The Son became much greater than the angels, and God gave him a name that is much greater than theirs.
HEB.1.5	This is because God never said to any of the angels,
HEB.1.5	“You are my Son.
HEB.1.5	Today I have become your Father.”
HEB.1.5	Nor did God say of any angel,
HEB.1.5	“I will be his Father,
HEB.1.5	and he will be my Son.”
HEB.1.6	And when God brings his firstborn Son into the world, he says,
HEB.1.6	“Let all God’s angels worship him.”
HEB.1.7	This is what God said about the angels:
HEB.1.7	“God makes his angels become like winds.
HEB.1.7	He makes his servants become like flames of fire.”
HEB.1.8	But God said this about his Son:
HEB.1.8	“God, your throne will last forever and ever.
HEB.1.8	You will rule your kingdom with fairness.
HEB.1.9	You love right and hate evil,
HEB.1.9	so God has chosen you from among your friends;
HEB.1.9	he has set you apart with much joy.”
HEB.1.10	God also says,
HEB.1.10	“Lord, in the beginning you made the earth,
HEB.1.10	and your hands made the skies.
HEB.1.11	They will be destroyed, but you will remain.
HEB.1.11	They will all wear out like clothes.
HEB.1.12	You will fold them like a coat.
HEB.1.12	And, like clothes, you will change them.
HEB.1.12	But you never change,
HEB.1.12	and your life will never end.”
HEB.1.13	And God never said this to an angel:
HEB.1.13	“Sit by me at my right side
HEB.1.13	until I put your enemies under your control.”
HEB.1.14	All the angels are spirits who serve God and are sent to help those who will receive salvation.
HEB.2.1	So we must be more careful to follow what we were taught. Then we will not stray away from the truth. 
HEB.2.2	The teaching God spoke through angels was shown to be true, and anyone who did not follow it or obey it received the punishment that was earned. 
HEB.2.3	So surely we also will be punished if we ignore this great salvation. The Lord himself first told about this salvation, and those who heard him testified it was true. 
HEB.2.4	God also testified to the truth of the message by using wonders, great signs, many kinds of miracles, and by giving people gifts through the Holy Spirit, just as he wanted.
HEB.2.5	God did not choose angels to be the rulers of the new world that was coming, which is what we have been talking about. 
HEB.2.6	It is written in the Scriptures,
HEB.2.6	“Why are people even important to you?
HEB.2.6	Why do you take care of human beings?
HEB.2.7	You made them a little lower than the angels
HEB.2.7	and crowned them with glory and honor.
HEB.2.8	You put all things under their control.”
HEB.2.8	When God put everything under their control, there was nothing left that they did not rule. Still, we do not yet see them ruling over everything. 
HEB.2.9	But we see Jesus, who for a short time was made lower than the angels. And now he is wearing a crown of glory and honor because he suffered and died. And by God’s grace, he died for everyone.
HEB.2.10	God is the One who made all things, and all things are for his glory. He wanted to have many children share his glory, so he made the One who leads people to salvation perfect through suffering.
HEB.2.11	Jesus, who makes people holy, and those who are made holy are from the same family. So he is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters. 
HEB.2.12	He says,
HEB.2.12	“Then, I will tell my brothers and sisters about you;
HEB.2.12	I will praise you in the public meeting.”
HEB.2.13	He also says,
HEB.2.13	“I will trust in God.”
HEB.2.13	And he also says,
HEB.2.13	“I am here, and with me are the children God has given me.”
HEB.2.14	Since these children are people with physical bodies, Jesus himself became like them. He did this so that, by dying, he could destroy the one who has the power of death—the devil—
HEB.2.15	and free those who were like slaves all their lives because of their fear of death. 
HEB.2.16	Clearly, it is not angels that Jesus helps, but the people who are from Abraham. 
HEB.2.17	For this reason Jesus had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every way so he could be their merciful and faithful high priest in service to God. Then Jesus could die in their place to take away their sins. 
HEB.2.18	And now he can help those who are tempted, because he himself suffered and was tempted.
HEB.3.1	So all of you holy brothers and sisters, who were called by God, think about Jesus, who was sent to us and is the high priest of our faith. 
HEB.3.2	Jesus was faithful to God as Moses was in God’s family. 
HEB.3.3	Jesus has more honor than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself. 
HEB.3.4	Every house is built by someone, but the builder of everything is God himself. 
HEB.3.5	Moses was faithful in God’s family as a servant, and he told what God would say in the future. 
HEB.3.6	But Christ is faithful as a Son over God’s house. And we are God’s house if we confidently maintain our hope.
HEB.3.7	So it is as the Holy Spirit says:
HEB.3.7	“Today listen to what he says.
HEB.3.8	Do not be stubborn as in the past
HEB.3.8	when you turned against God,
HEB.3.8	when you tested God in the desert.
HEB.3.9	There your ancestors tried me and tested me
HEB.3.9	and saw the things I did for forty years.
HEB.3.10	I was angry with them.
HEB.3.10	I said, ‘They are not loyal to me
HEB.3.10	and have not understood my ways.’
HEB.3.11	I was angry and made a promise,
HEB.3.11	‘They will never enter my rest.’ ” 
HEB.3.12	So brothers and sisters, be careful that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart that will turn you away from the living God. 
HEB.3.13	But encourage each other every day while it is “today.” Help each other so none of you will become hardened because sin has tricked you. 
HEB.3.14	We all share in Christ if we keep till the end the sure faith we had in the beginning. 
HEB.3.15	This is what the Scripture says:
HEB.3.15	“Today listen to what he says.
HEB.3.15	Do not be stubborn as in the past
HEB.3.15	when you turned against God.”
HEB.3.16	Who heard God’s voice and was against him? It was all those people Moses led out of Egypt. 
HEB.3.17	And with whom was God angry for forty years? He was angry with those who sinned, who died in the desert. 
HEB.3.18	And to whom was God talking when he promised that they would never enter his rest? He was talking to those who did not obey him. 
HEB.3.19	So we see they were not allowed to enter and have God’s rest, because they did not believe.
HEB.4.1	Now, since God has left us the promise that we may enter his rest, let us be very careful so none of you will fail to enter. 
HEB.4.2	The Good News was preached to us just as it was to them. But the teaching they heard did not help them, because they heard it but did not accept it with faith. 
HEB.4.3	We who have believed are able to enter and have God’s rest. As God has said,
HEB.4.3	“I was angry and made a promise,
HEB.4.3	‘They will never enter my rest.’ ”
HEB.4.3	But God’s work was finished from the time he made the world. 
HEB.4.4	In the Scriptures he talked about the seventh day of the week: “And on the seventh day God rested from all his works.” 
HEB.4.5	And again in the Scripture God said, “They will never enter my rest.”
HEB.4.6	It is still true that some people will enter God’s rest, but those who first heard the way to be saved did not enter, because they did not obey. 
HEB.4.7	So God planned another day, called “today.” He spoke about that day through David a long time later in the same Scripture used before:
HEB.4.7	“Today listen to what he says.
HEB.4.7	Do not be stubborn.”
HEB.4.8	We know that Joshua did not lead the people into that rest, because God spoke later about another day. 
HEB.4.9	This shows that the rest for God’s people is still coming. 
HEB.4.10	Anyone who enters God’s rest will rest from his work as God did. 
HEB.4.11	Let us try as hard as we can to enter God’s rest so that no one will fail by following the example of those who refused to obey.
HEB.4.12	God’s word is alive and working and is sharper than a double-edged sword. It cuts all the way into us, where the soul and the spirit are joined, to the center of our joints and bones. And it judges the thoughts and feelings in our hearts. 
HEB.4.13	Nothing in all the world can be hidden from God. Everything is clear and lies open before him, and to him we must explain the way we have lived.
HEB.4.14	Since we have a great high priest, Jesus the Son of God, who has gone into heaven, let us hold on to the faith we have. 
HEB.4.15	For our high priest is able to understand our weaknesses. He was tempted in every way that we are, but he did not sin. 
HEB.4.16	Let us, then, feel very sure that we can come before God’s throne where there is grace. There we can receive mercy and grace to help us when we need it.
HEB.5.1	Every high priest is chosen from among other people. He is given the work of going before God for them to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. 
HEB.5.2	Since he himself is weak, he is able to be gentle with those who do not understand and who are doing wrong things. 
HEB.5.3	Because he is weak, the high priest must offer sacrifices for his own sins and also for the sins of the people.
HEB.5.4	To be a high priest is an honor, but no one chooses himself for this work. He must be called by God as Aaron was. 
HEB.5.5	So also Christ did not choose himself to have the honor of being a high priest, but God chose him. God said to him,
HEB.5.5	“You are my Son.
HEB.5.5	Today I have become your Father.”
HEB.5.6	And in another Scripture God says,
HEB.5.6	“You are a priest forever,
HEB.5.6	a priest like Melchizedek.”
HEB.5.7	While Jesus lived on earth, he prayed to God and asked God for help. He prayed with loud cries and tears to the One who could save him from death, and his prayer was heard because he trusted God. 
HEB.5.8	Even though Jesus was the Son of God, he learned obedience by what he suffered. 
HEB.5.9	And because his obedience was perfect, he was able to give eternal salvation to all who obey him. 
HEB.5.10	In this way God made Jesus a high priest, a priest like Melchizedek.
HEB.5.11	We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are so slow to understand. 
HEB.5.12	By now you should be teachers, but you need someone to teach you again the first lessons of God’s message. You still need the teaching that is like milk. You are not ready for solid food. 
HEB.5.13	Anyone who lives on milk is still a baby and knows nothing about right teaching. 
HEB.5.14	But solid food is for those who are grown up. They are mature enough to know the difference between good and evil.
HEB.6.1	So let us go on to grown-up teaching. Let us not go back over the beginning lessons we learned about Christ. We should not again start teaching about faith in God and about turning away from those acts that lead to death. 
HEB.6.2	We should not return to the teaching about baptisms, about laying on of hands, about the raising of the dead and eternal judgment. 
HEB.6.3	And we will go on to grown-up teaching if God allows.
HEB.6.4	Some people cannot be brought back again to a changed life. They were once in God’s light, and enjoyed heaven’s gift, and shared in the Holy Spirit. 
HEB.6.5	They found out how good God’s word is, and they received the powers of his new world. 
HEB.6.6	But they fell away from Christ. It is impossible to bring them back to a changed life again, because they are nailing the Son of God to a cross again and are shaming him in front of others.
HEB.6.7	Some people are like land that gets plenty of rain. The land produces a good crop for those who work it, and it receives God’s blessings. 
HEB.6.8	Other people are like land that grows thorns and weeds and is worthless. It is about to be cursed by God and will be destroyed by fire.
HEB.6.9	Dear friends, we are saying this to you, but we really expect better things from you that will lead to your salvation. 
HEB.6.10	God is fair; he will not forget the work you did and the love you showed for him by helping his people. And he will remember that you are still helping them. 
HEB.6.11	We want each of you to go on with the same hard work all your lives so you will surely get what you hope for. 
HEB.6.12	We do not want you to become lazy. Be like those who through faith and patience will receive what God has promised.
HEB.6.13	God made a promise to Abraham. And as there is no one greater than God, he used himself when he swore to Abraham, 
HEB.6.14	saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.” 
HEB.6.15	Abraham waited patiently for this to happen, and he received what God promised.
HEB.6.16	People always use the name of someone greater than themselves when they swear. The oath proves that what they say is true, and this ends all arguing. 
HEB.6.17	God wanted to prove that his promise was true to those who would get what he promised. And he wanted them to understand clearly that his purposes never change, so he made an oath. 
HEB.6.18	These two things cannot change: God cannot lie when he makes a promise, and he cannot lie when he makes an oath. These things encourage us who came to God for safety. They give us strength to hold on to the hope we have been given. 
HEB.6.19	We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, sure and strong. It enters behind the curtain in the Most Holy Place in heaven, 
HEB.6.20	where Jesus has gone ahead of us and for us. He has become the high priest forever, a priest like Melchizedek.
HEB.7.1	Melchizedek was the king of Salem and a priest for God Most High. He met Abraham when Abraham was coming back after defeating the kings. When they met, Melchizedek blessed Abraham, 
HEB.7.2	and Abraham gave him a tenth of everything he had brought back from the battle. First, Melchizedek’s name means “king of goodness,” and he is king of Salem, which means “king of peace.” 
HEB.7.3	No one knows who Melchizedek’s father or mother was, where he came from, when he was born, or when he died. Melchizedek is like the Son of God; he continues being a priest forever.
HEB.7.4	You can see how great Melchizedek was. Abraham, the great father, gave him a tenth of everything that he won in battle. 
HEB.7.5	Now the law says that those in the tribe of Levi who become priests must collect a tenth from the people—their own people—even though the priests and the people are from the family of Abraham. 
HEB.7.6	Melchizedek was not from the tribe of Levi, but he collected a tenth from Abraham. And he blessed Abraham, the man who had God’s promises. 
HEB.7.7	Now everyone knows that the more important person blesses the less important person. 
HEB.7.8	Priests receive a tenth, even though they are only men who live and then die. But Melchizedek, who received a tenth from Abraham, continues living, as the Scripture says. 
HEB.7.9	We might even say that Levi, who receives a tenth, also paid it when Abraham paid Melchizedek a tenth. 
HEB.7.10	Levi was not yet born, but he was in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met Abraham.
HEB.7.11	The people were given the law concerning the system of priests from the tribe of Levi, but they could not be made perfect through that system. So there was a need for another priest to come, a priest like Melchizedek, not Aaron. 
HEB.7.12	And when a different kind of priest comes, the law must be changed, too. 
HEB.7.13	We are saying these things about Christ, who belonged to a different tribe. No one from that tribe ever served as a priest at the altar. 
HEB.7.14	It is clear that our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests belonging to that tribe.
HEB.7.15	And this becomes even more clear when we see that another priest comes who is like Melchizedek. 
HEB.7.16	He was not made a priest by human rules and laws but through the power of his life, which continues forever. 
HEB.7.17	It is said about him,
HEB.7.17	“You are a priest forever,
HEB.7.17	a priest like Melchizedek.”
HEB.7.18	The old rule is now set aside, because it was weak and useless. 
HEB.7.19	The law of Moses could not make anything perfect. But now a better hope has been given to us, and with this hope we can come near to God. 
HEB.7.20	It is important that God did this with an oath. Others became priests without an oath, 
HEB.7.21	but Christ became a priest with God’s oath. God said:
HEB.7.21	“The Lord has made a promise
HEB.7.21	and will not change his mind.
HEB.7.21	‘You are a priest forever.’ ”
HEB.7.22	This means that Jesus is the guarantee of a better agreement from God to his people.
HEB.7.23	When one of the other priests died, he could not continue being a priest. So there were many priests. 
HEB.7.24	But because Jesus lives forever, he will never stop serving as priest. 
HEB.7.25	So he is able always to save those who come to God through him because he always lives, asking God to help them.
HEB.7.26	Jesus is the kind of high priest we need. He is holy, sinless, pure, not influenced by sinners, and he is raised above the heavens. 
HEB.7.27	He is not like the other priests who had to offer sacrifices every day, first for their own sins, and then for the sins of the people. Christ offered his sacrifice only once and for all time when he offered himself. 
HEB.7.28	The law chooses high priests who are people with weaknesses, but the word of God’s oath came later than the law. It made God’s Son to be the high priest, and that Son has been made perfect forever.
HEB.8.1	Here is the point of what we are saying: We have a high priest who sits on the right side of God’s throne in heaven. 
HEB.8.2	Our high priest serves in the Most Holy Place, the true place of worship that was made by God, not by humans.
HEB.8.3	Every high priest has the work of offering gifts and sacrifices to God. So our high priest must also offer something to God. 
HEB.8.4	If our high priest were now living on earth, he would not be a priest, because there are already priests here who follow the law by offering gifts to God. 
HEB.8.5	The work they do as priests is only a copy and a shadow of what is in heaven. This is why God warned Moses when he was ready to build the Holy Tent: “Be very careful to make everything by the plan I showed you on the mountain.” 
HEB.8.6	But the priestly work that has been given to Jesus is much greater than the work that was given to the other priests. In the same way, the new agreement that Jesus brought from God to his people is much greater than the old one. And the new agreement is based on promises of better things.
HEB.8.7	If there had been nothing wrong with the first agreement, there would have been no need for a second agreement. 
HEB.8.8	But God found something wrong with his people. He says:
HEB.8.8	“Look, the time is coming, says the Lord,
HEB.8.8	when I will make a new agreement
HEB.8.8	with the people of Israel
HEB.8.8	and the people of Judah.
HEB.8.9	It will not be like the agreement
HEB.8.9	I made with their ancestors
HEB.8.9	when I took them by the hand
HEB.8.9	to bring them out of Egypt.
HEB.8.9	But they broke that agreement,
HEB.8.9	and I turned away from them, says the Lord.
HEB.8.10	This is the agreement I will make
HEB.8.10	with the people of Israel at that time, says the Lord.
HEB.8.10	I will put my teachings in their minds
HEB.8.10	and write them on their hearts.
HEB.8.10	I will be their God,
HEB.8.10	and they will be my people.
HEB.8.11	People will no longer have to teach their neighbors and relatives
HEB.8.11	to know the Lord,
HEB.8.11	because all people will know me,
HEB.8.11	from the least to the most important.
HEB.8.12	I will forgive them for the wicked things they did,
HEB.8.12	and I will not remember their sins anymore.”
HEB.8.13	God called this a new agreement, so he has made the first agreement old. And anything that is old and worn out is ready to disappear.
HEB.9.1	The first agreement had rules for worship and a place on earth for worship. 
HEB.9.2	The Holy Tent was set up for this. The first area in the Tent was called the Holy Place. In it were the lamp and the table with the bread that was made holy for God. 
HEB.9.3	Behind the second curtain was a room called the Most Holy Place. 
HEB.9.4	In it was a golden altar for burning incense and the Ark covered with gold that held the old agreement. Inside this Ark was a golden jar of manna, Aaron’s rod that once grew leaves, and the stone tablets of the old agreement. 
HEB.9.5	Above the Ark were the creatures that showed God’s glory, whose wings reached over the lid. But we cannot tell everything about these things now.
HEB.9.6	When everything in the Tent was made ready in this way, the priests went into the first room every day to worship. 
HEB.9.7	But only the high priest could go into the second room, and he did that only once a year. He could never enter the inner room without taking blood with him, which he offered to God for himself and for sins the people did without knowing they did them. 
HEB.9.8	The Holy Spirit uses this to show that the way into the Most Holy Place was not open while the system of the old Holy Tent was still being used. 
HEB.9.9	This is an example for the present time. It shows that the gifts and sacrifices offered cannot make the conscience of the worshiper perfect. 
HEB.9.10	These gifts and sacrifices were only about food and drink and special washings. They were rules for the body, to be followed until the time of God’s new way.
HEB.9.11	But when Christ came as the high priest of the good things we now have, he entered the greater and more perfect tent. It is not made by humans and does not belong to this world. 
HEB.9.12	Christ entered the Most Holy Place only once—and for all time. He did not take with him the blood of goats and calves. His sacrifice was his own blood, and by it he set us free from sin forever. 
HEB.9.13	The blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow are sprinkled on the people who are unclean, and this makes their bodies clean again. 
HEB.9.14	How much more is done by the blood of Christ. He offered himself through the eternal Spirit as a perfect sacrifice to God. His blood will make our consciences pure from useless acts so we may serve the living God.
HEB.9.15	For this reason Christ brings a new agreement from God to his people. Those who are called by God can now receive the blessings he has promised, blessings that will last forever. They can have those things because Christ died so that the people who lived under the first agreement could be set free from sin.
HEB.9.16	When there is a will, it must be proven that the one who wrote that will is dead. 
HEB.9.17	A will means nothing while the person is alive; it can be used only after the person dies. 
HEB.9.18	This is why even the first agreement could not begin without blood to show death. 
HEB.9.19	First, Moses told all the people every command in the law. Next he took the blood of calves and mixed it with water. Then he used red wool and a branch of the hyssop plant to sprinkle it on the book of the law and on all the people. 
HEB.9.20	He said, “This is the blood that begins the Agreement that God commanded you to obey.” 
HEB.9.21	In the same way, Moses sprinkled the blood on the Holy Tent and over all the things used in worship. 
HEB.9.22	The law says that almost everything must be made clean by blood, and sins cannot be forgiven without blood to show death.
HEB.9.23	So the copies of the real things in heaven had to be made clean by animal sacrifices. But the real things in heaven need much better sacrifices. 
HEB.9.24	Christ did not go into the Most Holy Place made by humans, which is only a copy of the real one. He went into heaven itself and is there now before God to help us. 
HEB.9.25	The high priest enters the Most Holy Place once every year with blood that is not his own. But Christ did not offer himself many times. 
HEB.9.26	Then he would have had to suffer many times since the world was made. But Christ came only once and for all time at just the right time to take away all sin by sacrificing himself. 
HEB.9.27	Just as everyone must die once and then be judged, 
HEB.9.28	so Christ was offered as a sacrifice one time to take away the sins of many people. And he will come a second time, not to offer himself for sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.
HEB.10.1	The law is only an unclear picture of the good things coming in the future; it is not the real thing. The people under the law offer the same sacrifices every year, but these sacrifices can never make perfect those who come near to worship God. 
HEB.10.2	If the law could make them perfect, the sacrifices would have already stopped. The worshipers would be made clean, and they would no longer have a sense of sin. 
HEB.10.3	But these sacrifices remind them of their sins every year, 
HEB.10.4	because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
HEB.10.5	So when Christ came into the world, he said:
HEB.10.5	“You do not want sacrifices and offerings,
HEB.10.5	but you have prepared a body for me.
HEB.10.6	You do not ask for burnt offerings
HEB.10.6	and offerings to take away sins.
HEB.10.7	Then I said, ‘Look, I have come.
HEB.10.7	It is written about me in the book.
HEB.10.7	God, I have come to do what you want.’ ”
HEB.10.8	In this Scripture he first said, “You do not want sacrifices and offerings. You do not ask for burnt offerings and offerings to take away sins.” (These are all sacrifices that the law commands.) 
HEB.10.9	Then he said, “Look, I have come to do what you want.” God ends the first system of sacrifices so he can set up the new system. 
HEB.10.10	And because of this, we are made holy through the sacrifice Christ made in his body once and for all time.
HEB.10.11	Every day the priests stand and do their religious service, often offering the same sacrifices. Those sacrifices can never take away sins. 
HEB.10.12	But after Christ offered one sacrifice for sins, forever, he sat down at the right side of God. 
HEB.10.13	And now Christ waits there for his enemies to be put under his power. 
HEB.10.14	With one sacrifice he made perfect forever those who are being made holy.
HEB.10.15	The Holy Spirit also tells us about this. First he says:
HEB.10.16	“This is the agreement I will make
HEB.10.16	with them at that time, says the Lord.
HEB.10.16	I will put my teachings in their hearts
HEB.10.16	and write them on their minds.”
HEB.10.17	Then he says:
HEB.10.17	“Their sins and the evil things they do—
HEB.10.17	I will not remember anymore.”
HEB.10.18	Now when these have been forgiven, there is no more need for a sacrifice for sins.
HEB.10.19	So, brothers and sisters, we are completely free to enter the Most Holy Place without fear because of the blood of Jesus’ death. 
HEB.10.20	We can enter through a new and living way that Jesus opened for us. It leads through the curtain—Christ’s body. 
HEB.10.21	And since we have a great priest over God’s house, 
HEB.10.22	let us come near to God with a sincere heart and a sure faith, because we have been made free from a guilty conscience, and our bodies have been washed with pure water. 
HEB.10.23	Let us hold firmly to the hope that we have confessed, because we can trust God to do what he promised.
HEB.10.24	Let us think about each other and help each other to show love and do good deeds. 
HEB.10.25	You should not stay away from the church meetings, as some are doing, but you should meet together and encourage each other. Do this even more as you see the day coming.
HEB.10.26	If we decide to go on sinning after we have learned the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for sins. 
HEB.10.27	There is nothing but fear in waiting for the judgment and the terrible fire that will destroy all those who live against God. 
HEB.10.28	Anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was found guilty from the proof given by two or three witnesses. He was put to death without mercy. 
HEB.10.29	So what do you think should be done to those who do not respect the Son of God, who look at the blood of the agreement that made them holy as no different from others’ blood, who insult the Spirit of God’s grace? Surely they should have a much worse punishment. 
HEB.10.30	We know that God said, “I will punish those who do wrong; I will repay them.” And he also said, “The Lord will judge his people.” 
HEB.10.31	It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
HEB.10.32	Remember those days in the past when you first learned the truth. You had a hard struggle with many sufferings, but you continued strong. 
HEB.10.33	Sometimes you were hurt and attacked before crowds of people, and sometimes you shared with those who were being treated that way. 
HEB.10.34	You helped the prisoners. You even had joy when all that you owned was taken from you, because you knew you had something better and more lasting.
HEB.10.35	So do not lose the courage you had in the past, which has a great reward. 
HEB.10.36	You must hold on, so you can do what God wants and receive what he has promised. 
HEB.10.37	For in a very short time,
HEB.10.37	“The One who is coming will come
HEB.10.37	and will not be delayed.
HEB.10.38	Those who are right with me
HEB.10.38	will live by faith.
HEB.10.38	But if they turn back with fear,
HEB.10.38	I will not be pleased with them.”
HEB.10.39	But we are not those who turn back and are lost. We are people who have faith and are saved.
HEB.11.1	Faith means being sure of the things we hope for and knowing that something is real even if we do not see it. 
HEB.11.2	Faith is the reason we remember great people who lived in the past.
HEB.11.3	It is by faith we understand that the whole world was made by God’s command so what we see was made by something that cannot be seen.
HEB.11.4	It was by faith that Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did. God said he was pleased with the gifts Abel offered and called Abel a good man because of his faith. Abel died, but through his faith he is still speaking.
HEB.11.5	It was by faith that Enoch was taken to heaven so he would not die. He could not be found, because God had taken him away. Before he was taken, the Scripture says that he was a man who truly pleased God. 
HEB.11.6	Without faith no one can please God. Anyone who comes to God must believe that he is real and that he rewards those who truly want to find him.
HEB.11.7	It was by faith that Noah heard God’s warnings about things he could not yet see. He obeyed God and built a large boat to save his family. By his faith, Noah showed that the world was wrong, and he became one of those who are made right with God through faith.
HEB.11.8	It was by faith Abraham obeyed God’s call to go to another place God promised to give him. He left his own country, not knowing where he was to go. 
HEB.11.9	It was by faith that he lived like a foreigner in the country God promised to give him. He lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who had received that same promise from God. 
HEB.11.10	Abraham was waiting for the city that has real foundations—the city planned and built by God.
HEB.11.11	He was too old to have children, and Sarah could not have children. It was by faith that Abraham was made able to become a father, because he trusted God to do what he had promised. 
HEB.11.12	This man was so old he was almost dead, but from him came as many descendants as there are stars in the sky. Like the sand on the seashore, they could not be counted.
HEB.11.13	All these great people died in faith. They did not get the things that God promised his people, but they saw them coming far in the future and were glad. They said they were like visitors and strangers on earth. 
HEB.11.14	When people say such things, they show they are looking for a country that will be their own. 
HEB.11.15	If they had been thinking about the country they had left, they could have gone back. 
HEB.11.16	But they were waiting for a better country—a heavenly country. So God is not ashamed to be called their God, because he has prepared a city for them.
HEB.11.17	It was by faith that Abraham, when God tested him, offered his son Isaac as a sacrifice. God made the promises to Abraham, but Abraham was ready to offer his own son as a sacrifice. 
HEB.11.18	God had said, “The descendants I promised you will be from Isaac.” 
HEB.11.19	Abraham believed that God could raise the dead, and really, it was as if Abraham got Isaac back from death.
HEB.11.20	It was by faith that Isaac blessed the future of Jacob and Esau. 
HEB.11.21	It was by faith that Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each one of Joseph’s sons. Then he worshiped as he leaned on the top of his walking stick.
HEB.11.22	It was by faith that Joseph, while he was dying, spoke about the Israelites leaving Egypt and gave instructions about what to do with his body.
HEB.11.23	It was by faith that Moses’ parents hid him for three months after he was born. They saw that Moses was a beautiful baby, and they were not afraid to disobey the king’s order.
HEB.11.24	It was by faith that Moses, when he grew up, refused to be called the son of the king of Egypt’s daughter. 
HEB.11.25	He chose to suffer with God’s people instead of enjoying sin for a short time. 
HEB.11.26	He thought it was better to suffer for the Christ than to have all the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking for God’s reward. 
HEB.11.27	It was by faith that Moses left Egypt and was not afraid of the king’s anger. Moses continued strong as if he could see the God that no one can see. 
HEB.11.28	It was by faith that Moses prepared the Passover and spread the blood on the doors so the one who brings death would not kill the firstborn sons of Israel.
HEB.11.29	It was by faith that the people crossed the Red Sea as if it were dry land. But when the Egyptians tried it, they were drowned.
HEB.11.30	It was by faith that the walls of Jericho fell after the people had marched around them for seven days.
HEB.11.31	It was by faith that Rahab, the prostitute, welcomed the spies and was not killed with those who refused to obey God.
HEB.11.32	Do I need to give more examples? I do not have time to tell you about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets. 
HEB.11.33	Through their faith they defeated kingdoms. They did what was right, received God’s promises, and shut the mouths of lions. 
HEB.11.34	They stopped great fires and were saved from being killed with swords. They were weak, and yet were made strong. They were powerful in battle and defeated other armies. 
HEB.11.35	Women received their dead relatives raised back to life. Others were tortured and refused to accept their freedom so they could be raised from the dead to a better life. 
HEB.11.36	Some were laughed at and beaten. Others were put in chains and thrown into prison. 
HEB.11.37	They were stoned to death, they were cut in half, and they were killed with swords. Some wore the skins of sheep and goats. They were poor, abused, and treated badly. 
HEB.11.38	The world was not good enough for them! They wandered in deserts and mountains, living in caves and holes in the earth.
HEB.11.39	All these people are known for their faith, but none of them received what God had promised. 
HEB.11.40	God planned to give us something better so that they would be made perfect, but only together with us.
HEB.12.1	We are surrounded by a great cloud of people whose lives tell us what faith means. So let us run the race that is before us and never give up. We should remove from our lives anything that would get in the way and the sin that so easily holds us back. 
HEB.12.2	Let us look only to Jesus, the One who began our faith and who makes it perfect. He suffered death on the cross. But he accepted the shame as if it were nothing because of the joy that God put before him. And now he is sitting at the right side of God’s throne. 
HEB.12.3	Think about Jesus’ example. He held on while wicked people were doing evil things to him. So do not get tired and stop trying.
HEB.12.4	You are struggling against sin, but your struggles have not yet caused you to be killed. 
HEB.12.5	You have forgotten the encouraging words that call you his children:
HEB.12.5	“My child, don’t think the Lord’s discipline is worth nothing,
HEB.12.5	and don’t stop trying when he corrects you.
HEB.12.6	The Lord disciplines those he loves,
HEB.12.6	and he punishes everyone he accepts as his child.”
HEB.12.7	So hold on through your sufferings, because they are like a father’s discipline. God is treating you as children. All children are disciplined by their fathers. 
HEB.12.8	If you are never disciplined (and every child must be disciplined), you are not true children. 
HEB.12.9	We have all had fathers here on earth who disciplined us, and we respected them. So it is even more important that we accept discipline from the Father of our spirits so we will have life. 
HEB.12.10	Our fathers on earth disciplined us for a short time in the way they thought was best. But God disciplines us to help us, so we can become holy as he is. 
HEB.12.11	We do not enjoy being disciplined. It is painful at the time, but later, after we have learned from it, we have peace, because we start living in the right way.
HEB.12.12	You have become weak, so make yourselves strong again. 
HEB.12.13	Keep on the right path, so the weak will not stumble but rather be strengthened.
HEB.12.14	Try to live in peace with all people, and try to live free from sin. Anyone whose life is not holy will never see the Lord. 
HEB.12.15	Be careful that no one fails to receive God’s grace and begins to cause trouble among you. A person like that can ruin many of you. 
HEB.12.16	Be careful that no one takes part in sexual sin or is like Esau and never thinks about God. As the oldest son, Esau would have received everything from his father, but he sold all that for a single meal. 
HEB.12.17	You remember that after Esau did this, he wanted to get his father’s blessing, but his father refused. Esau could find no way to change what he had done, even though he wanted the blessing so much that he cried.
HEB.12.18	You have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire. You have not come to darkness, sadness, and storms. 
HEB.12.19	You have not come to the noise of a trumpet or to the sound of a voice like the one the people of Israel heard and begged not to hear another word. 
HEB.12.20	They did not want to hear the command: “If anything, even an animal, touches the mountain, it must be put to death with stones.” 
HEB.12.21	What they saw was so terrible that Moses said, “I am shaking with fear.”
HEB.12.22	But you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem. You have come to thousands of angels gathered together with joy. 
HEB.12.23	You have come to the meeting of God’s firstborn children whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God, the judge of all people, and to the spirits of good people who have been made perfect. 
HEB.12.24	You have come to Jesus, the One who brought the new agreement from God to his people, and you have come to the sprinkled blood that has a better message than the blood of Abel.
HEB.12.25	So be careful and do not refuse to listen when God speaks. Others refused to listen to him when he warned them on earth, and they did not escape. So it will be worse for us if we refuse to listen to God who warns us from heaven. 
HEB.12.26	When he spoke before, his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “Once again I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens.” 
HEB.12.27	The words “once again” clearly show us that everything that was made—things that can be shaken—will be destroyed. Only the things that cannot be shaken will remain.
HEB.12.28	So let us be thankful, because we have a kingdom that cannot be shaken. We should worship God in a way that pleases him with respect and fear, 
HEB.12.29	because our God is like a fire that burns things up.
HEB.13.1	Keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters. 
HEB.13.2	Remember to welcome strangers, because some who have done this have welcomed angels without knowing it. 
HEB.13.3	Remember those who are in prison as if you were in prison with them. Remember those who are suffering as if you were suffering with them.
HEB.13.4	Marriage should be honored by everyone, and husband and wife should keep their marriage pure. God will judge as guilty those who take part in sexual sins. 
HEB.13.5	Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be satisfied with what you have. God has said,
HEB.13.5	“I will never leave you;
HEB.13.5	I will never abandon you.”
HEB.13.6	So we can be sure when we say,
HEB.13.6	“I will not be afraid, because the Lord is my helper.
HEB.13.6	People can’t do anything to me.”
HEB.13.7	Remember your leaders who taught God’s message to you. Remember how they lived and died, and copy their faith. 
HEB.13.8	Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
HEB.13.9	Do not let all kinds of strange teachings lead you into the wrong way. Your hearts should be strengthened by God’s grace, not by obeying rules about foods, which do not help those who obey them.
HEB.13.10	We have a sacrifice, but the priests who serve in the Holy Tent cannot eat from it. 
HEB.13.11	The high priest carries the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place where he offers this blood for sins. But the bodies of the animals are burned outside the camp. 
HEB.13.12	So Jesus also suffered outside the city to make his people holy with his own blood. 
HEB.13.13	So let us go to Jesus outside the camp, holding on as he did when we are abused.
HEB.13.14	Here on earth we do not have a city that lasts forever, but we are looking for the city that we will have in the future. 
HEB.13.15	So through Jesus let us always offer to God our sacrifice of praise, coming from lips that speak his name. 
HEB.13.16	Do not forget to do good to others, and share with them, because such sacrifices please God.
HEB.13.17	Obey your leaders and act under their authority. They are watching over you, because they are responsible for your souls. Obey them so that they will do this work with joy, not sadness. It will not help you to make their work hard.
HEB.13.18	Pray for us. We are sure that we have a clear conscience, because we always want to do the right thing. 
HEB.13.19	I especially beg you to pray so that God will send me back to you soon.
HEB.13.20+HEB.13.21	I pray that the God of peace will give you every good thing you need so you can do what he wants. God raised from the dead our Lord Jesus, the Great Shepherd of the sheep, because of the blood of his death. His blood began the eternal agreement that God made with his people. I pray that God will do in us what pleases him, through Jesus Christ, and to him be glory forever and ever. Amen.
HEB.13.22	My brothers and sisters, I beg you to listen patiently to this message I have written to encourage you, because it is not very long. 
HEB.13.23	I want you to know that our brother Timothy has been let out of prison. If he arrives soon, we will both come to see you.
HEB.13.24	Greet all your leaders and all of God’s people. Those from Italy send greetings to you.
HEB.13.25	Grace be with you all. 
JAS.1.1	From James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
JAS.1.1	To all of God’s people who are scattered everywhere in the world:
JAS.1.1	Greetings.
JAS.1.2	My brothers and sisters, when you have many kinds of troubles, you should be full of joy, 
JAS.1.3	because you know that these troubles test your faith, and this will give you patience. 
JAS.1.4	Let your patience show itself perfectly in what you do. Then you will be perfect and complete and will have everything you need. 
JAS.1.5	But if any of you needs wisdom, you should ask God for it. He is generous to everyone and will give you wisdom without criticizing you. 
JAS.1.6	But when you ask God, you must believe and not doubt. Anyone who doubts is like a wave in the sea, blown up and down by the wind. 
JAS.1.7+JAS.1.8	Such doubters are thinking two different things at the same time, and they cannot decide about anything they do. They should not think they will receive anything from the Lord.
JAS.1.9	Believers who are poor should take pride that God has made them spiritually rich. 
JAS.1.10	Those who are rich should take pride that God has shown them that they are spiritually poor. The rich will die like a wild flower in the grass. 
JAS.1.11	The sun rises with burning heat and dries up the plants. The flower falls off, and its beauty is gone. In the same way the rich will die while they are still taking care of business.
JAS.1.12	When people are tempted and still continue strong, they should be happy. After they have proved their faith, God will reward them with life forever. God promised this to all those who love him. 
JAS.1.13	When people are tempted, they should not say, “God is tempting me.” Evil cannot tempt God, and God himself does not tempt anyone. 
JAS.1.14	But people are tempted when their own evil desire leads them away and traps them. 
JAS.1.15	This desire leads to sin, and then the sin grows and brings death.
JAS.1.16	My dear brothers and sisters, do not be fooled about this. 
JAS.1.17	Every good action and every perfect gift is from God. These good gifts come down from the Creator of the sun, moon, and stars, who does not change like their shifting shadows. 
JAS.1.18	God decided to give us life through the word of truth so we might be the most important of all the things he made.
JAS.1.19	My dear brothers and sisters, always be willing to listen and slow to speak. Do not become angry easily, 
JAS.1.20	because anger will not help you live the right kind of life God wants. 
JAS.1.21	So put out of your life every evil thing and every kind of wrong. Then in gentleness accept God’s teaching that is planted in your hearts, which can save you.
JAS.1.22	Do what God’s teaching says; when you only listen and do nothing, you are fooling yourselves. 
JAS.1.23	Those who hear God’s teaching and do nothing are like people who look at themselves in a mirror. 
JAS.1.24	They see their faces and then go away and quickly forget what they looked like. 
JAS.1.25	But the truly happy people are those who carefully study God’s perfect law that makes people free, and they continue to study it. They do not forget what they heard, but they obey what God’s teaching says. Those who do this will be made happy.
JAS.1.26	People who think they are religious but say things they should not say are just fooling themselves. Their “religion” is worth nothing. 
JAS.1.27	Religion that God accepts as pure and without fault is this: caring for orphans or widows who need help, and keeping yourself free from the world’s evil influence.
JAS.2.1	My dear brothers and sisters, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, never think some people are more important than others. 
JAS.2.2	Suppose someone comes into your church meeting wearing nice clothes and a gold ring. At the same time a poor person comes in wearing old, dirty clothes. 
JAS.2.3	You show special attention to the one wearing nice clothes and say, “Please, sit here in this good seat.” But you say to the poor person, “Stand over there,” or, “Sit on the floor by my feet.” 
JAS.2.4	What are you doing? You are making some people more important than others, and with evil thoughts you are deciding that one person is better.
JAS.2.5	Listen, my dear brothers and sisters! God chose the poor in the world to be rich with faith and to receive the kingdom God promised to those who love him. 
JAS.2.6	But you show no respect to the poor. The rich are always trying to control your lives. They are the ones who take you to court. 
JAS.2.7	And they are the ones who speak against Jesus, who owns you.
JAS.2.8	This royal law is found in the Scriptures: “Love your neighbor as you love yourself.” If you obey this law, you are doing right. 
JAS.2.9	But if you treat one person as being more important than another, you are sinning. You are guilty of breaking God’s law. 
JAS.2.10	A person who follows all of God’s law but fails to obey even one command is guilty of breaking all the commands in that law. 
JAS.2.11	The same God who said, “You must not be guilty of adultery,” also said, “You must not murder anyone.” So if you do not take part in adultery but you murder someone, you are guilty of breaking all of God’s law. 
JAS.2.12	In everything you say and do, remember that you will be judged by the law that makes people free. 
JAS.2.13	So you must show mercy to others, or God will not show mercy to you when he judges you. But the person who shows mercy can stand without fear at the judgment.
JAS.2.14	My brothers and sisters, if people say they have faith, but do nothing, their faith is worth nothing. Can faith like that save them? 
JAS.2.15	A brother or sister in Christ might need clothes or food. 
JAS.2.16	If you say to that person, “God be with you! I hope you stay warm and get plenty to eat,” but you do not give what that person needs, your words are worth nothing. 
JAS.2.17	In the same way, faith by itself—that does nothing—is dead.
JAS.2.18	Someone might say, “You have faith, but I have deeds.” Show me your faith without doing anything, and I will show you my faith by what I do. 
JAS.2.19	You believe there is one God. Good! But the demons believe that, too, and they tremble with fear.
JAS.2.20	You foolish person! Must you be shown that faith that does nothing is worth nothing? 
JAS.2.21	Abraham, our ancestor, was made right with God by what he did when he offered his son Isaac on the altar. 
JAS.2.22	So you see that Abraham’s faith and the things he did worked together. His faith was made perfect by what he did. 
JAS.2.23	This shows the full meaning of the Scripture that says: “Abraham believed God, and God accepted Abraham’s faith, and that faith made him right with God.” And Abraham was called God’s friend. 
JAS.2.24	So you see that people are made right with God by what they do, not by faith only.
JAS.2.25	Another example is Rahab, a prostitute, who was made right with God by something she did. She welcomed the spies into her home and helped them escape by a different road.
JAS.2.26	Just as a person’s body that does not have a spirit is dead, so faith that does nothing is dead!
JAS.3.1	My brothers and sisters, not many of you should become teachers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly. 
JAS.3.2	We all make many mistakes. If people never said anything wrong, they would be perfect and able to control their entire selves, too. 
JAS.3.3	When we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can control their whole bodies. 
JAS.3.4	Also a ship is very big, and it is pushed by strong winds. But a very small rudder controls that big ship, making it go wherever the pilot wants. 
JAS.3.5	It is the same with the tongue. It is a small part of the body, but it brags about great things.
JAS.3.5	A big forest fire can be started with only a little flame. 
JAS.3.6	And the tongue is like a fire. It is a whole world of evil among the parts of our bodies. The tongue spreads its evil through the whole body. The tongue is set on fire by hell, and it starts a fire that influences all of life. 
JAS.3.7	People can tame every kind of wild animal, bird, reptile, and fish, and they have tamed them, 
JAS.3.8	but no one can tame the tongue. It is wild and evil and full of deadly poison. 
JAS.3.9	We use our tongues to praise our Lord and Father, but then we curse people, whom God made like himself. 
JAS.3.10	Praises and curses come from the same mouth! My brothers and sisters, this should not happen. 
JAS.3.11	Do good and bad water flow from the same spring? 
JAS.3.12	My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree make olives, or can a grapevine make figs? No! And a well full of salty water cannot give good water.
JAS.3.13	Are there those among you who are truly wise and understanding? Then they should show it by living right and doing good things with a gentleness that comes from wisdom. 
JAS.3.14	But if you are selfish and have bitter jealousy in your hearts, do not brag. Your bragging is a lie that hides the truth. 
JAS.3.15	That kind of “wisdom” does not come from God but from the world. It is not spiritual; it is from the devil. 
JAS.3.16	Where jealousy and selfishness are, there will be confusion and every kind of evil. 
JAS.3.17	But the wisdom that comes from God is first of all pure, then peaceful, gentle, and easy to please. This wisdom is always ready to help those who are troubled and to do good for others. It is always fair and honest. 
JAS.3.18	People who work for peace in a peaceful way plant a good crop of right-living.
JAS.4.1	Do you know where your fights and arguments come from? They come from the selfish desires that war within you. 
JAS.4.2	You want things, but you do not have them. So you are ready to kill and are jealous of other people, but you still cannot get what you want. So you argue and fight. You do not get what you want, because you do not ask God. 
JAS.4.3	Or when you ask, you do not receive because the reason you ask is wrong. You want things so you can use them for your own pleasures.
JAS.4.4	So, you are not loyal to God! You should know that loving the world is the same as hating God. Anyone who wants to be a friend of the world becomes God’s enemy. 
JAS.4.5	Do you think the Scripture means nothing that says, “The Spirit that God made to live in us wants us for himself alone”? 
JAS.4.6	But God gives us even more grace, as the Scripture says,
JAS.4.6	“God is against the proud,
JAS.4.6	but he gives grace to the humble.”
JAS.4.7	So give yourselves completely to God. Stand against the devil, and the devil will run from you. 
JAS.4.8	Come near to God, and God will come near to you. You sinners, clean sin out of your lives. You who are trying to follow God and the world at the same time, make your thinking pure. 
JAS.4.9	Be sad, cry, and weep! Change your laughter into crying and your joy into sadness. 
JAS.4.10	Humble yourself in the Lord’s presence, and he will honor you.
JAS.4.11	Brothers and sisters, do not tell evil lies about each other. If you speak against your fellow believers or judge them, you are judging and speaking against the law they follow. And when you are judging the law, you are no longer a follower of the law. You have become a judge. 
JAS.4.12	God is the only Lawmaker and Judge. He is the only One who can save and destroy. So it is not right for you to judge your neighbor.
JAS.4.13	Some of you say, “Today or tomorrow we will go to some city. We will stay there a year, do business, and make money.” 
JAS.4.14	But you do not know what will happen tomorrow! Your life is like a mist. You can see it for a short time, but then it goes away. 
JAS.4.15	So you should say, “If the Lord wants, we will live and do this or that.” 
JAS.4.16	But now you are proud and you brag. All of this bragging is wrong. 
JAS.4.17	Anyone who knows the right thing to do, but does not do it, is sinning.
JAS.5.1	You rich people, listen! Cry and be very sad because of the troubles that are coming to you. 
JAS.5.2	Your riches have rotted, and your clothes have been eaten by moths. 
JAS.5.3	Your gold and silver have rusted, and that rust will be a proof that you were wrong. It will eat your bodies like fire. You saved your treasure for the last days. 
JAS.5.4	The pay you did not give the workers who mowed your fields cries out against you, and the cries of the workers have been heard by the Lord All-Powerful. 
JAS.5.5	Your life on earth was full of rich living and pleasing yourselves with everything you wanted. You made yourselves fat, like an animal ready to be killed. 
JAS.5.6	You have judged guilty and then murdered innocent people, who were not against you.
JAS.5.7	Brothers and sisters, be patient until the Lord comes again. A farmer patiently waits for his valuable crop to grow from the earth and for it to receive the autumn and spring rains. 
JAS.5.8	You, too, must be patient. Do not give up hope, because the Lord is coming soon. 
JAS.5.9	Brothers and sisters, do not complain against each other or you will be judged guilty. And the Judge is ready to come! 
JAS.5.10	Brothers and sisters, follow the example of the prophets who spoke for the Lord. They suffered many hard things, but they were patient. 
JAS.5.11	We say they are happy because they did not give up. You have heard about Job’s patience, and you know the Lord’s purpose for him in the end. You know the Lord is full of mercy and is kind.
JAS.5.12	My brothers and sisters, above all, do not use an oath when you make a promise. Don’t use the name of heaven, earth, or anything else to prove what you say. When you mean yes, say only yes, and when you mean no, say only no so you will not be judged guilty.
JAS.5.13	Anyone who is having troubles should pray. Anyone who is happy should sing praises. 
JAS.5.14	Anyone who is sick should call the church’s elders. They should pray for and pour oil on the person in the name of the Lord. 
JAS.5.15	And the prayer that is said with faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will heal that person. And if the person has sinned, the sins will be forgiven. 
JAS.5.16	Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so God can heal you. When a believing person prays, great things happen. 
JAS.5.17	Elijah was a human being just like us. He prayed that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years! 
JAS.5.18	Then Elijah prayed again, and the rain came down from the sky, and the land produced crops again.
JAS.5.19	My brothers and sisters, if one of you wanders away from the truth, and someone helps that person come back, 
JAS.5.20	remember this: Anyone who brings a sinner back from the wrong way will save that sinner’s soul from death and will cause many sins to be forgiven. 
1PE.1.1	From Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ.
1PE.1.1	To God’s chosen people who are away from their homes and are scattered all around Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. 
1PE.1.2	God planned long ago to choose you by making you his holy people, which is the Spirit’s work. God wanted you to obey him and to be made clean by the blood of the death of Jesus Christ.
1PE.1.2	Grace and peace be yours more and more.
1PE.1.3	Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. In God’s great mercy he has caused us to be born again into a living hope, because Jesus Christ rose from the dead. 
1PE.1.4	Now we hope for the blessings God has for his children. These blessings, which cannot be destroyed or be spoiled or lose their beauty, are kept in heaven for you. 
1PE.1.5	God’s power protects you through your faith until salvation is shown to you at the end of time. 
1PE.1.6	This makes you very happy, even though now for a short time different kinds of troubles may make you sad. 
1PE.1.7	These troubles come to prove that your faith is pure. This purity of faith is worth more than gold, which can be proved to be pure by fire but will ruin. But the purity of your faith will bring you praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is shown to you. 
1PE.1.8	You have not seen Christ, but still you love him. You cannot see him now, but you believe in him. So you are filled with a joy that cannot be explained, a joy full of glory. 
1PE.1.9	And you are receiving the goal of your faith—the salvation of your souls.
1PE.1.10	The prophets searched carefully and tried to learn about this salvation. They prophesied about the grace that was coming to you. 
1PE.1.11	The Spirit of Christ was in the prophets, telling in advance about the sufferings of Christ and about the glory that would follow those sufferings. The prophets tried to learn about what the Spirit was showing them, when those things would happen, and what the world would be like at that time. 
1PE.1.12	It was shown them that their service was not for themselves but for you, when they told about the truths you have now heard. Those who preached the Good News to you told you those things with the help of the Holy Spirit who was sent from heaven—things into which angels desire to look.
1PE.1.13	So prepare your minds for service and have self-control. All your hope should be for the gift of grace that will be yours when Jesus Christ is shown to you. 
1PE.1.14	Now that you are obedient children of God do not live as you did in the past. You did not understand, so you did the evil things you wanted. 
1PE.1.15	But be holy in all you do, just as God, the One who called you, is holy. 
1PE.1.16	It is written in the Scriptures: “You must be holy, because I am holy.”
1PE.1.17	You pray to God and call him Father, and he judges each person’s work equally. So while you are here on earth, you should live with respect for God. 
1PE.1.18	You know that in the past you were living in a worthless way, a way passed down from the people who lived before you. But you were saved from that useless life. You were bought, not with something that ruins like gold or silver, 
1PE.1.19	but with the precious blood of Christ, who was like a pure and perfect lamb. 
1PE.1.20	Christ was chosen before the world was made, but he was shown to the world in these last times for your sake. 
1PE.1.21	Through Christ you believe in God, who raised Christ from the dead and gave him glory. So your faith and your hope are in God.
1PE.1.22	Now that your obedience to the truth has purified your souls, you can have true love for your Christian brothers and sisters. So love each other deeply with all your heart. 
1PE.1.23	You have been born again, and this new life did not come from something that dies, but from something that cannot die. You were born again through God’s living message that continues forever. 
1PE.1.24	The Scripture says,
1PE.1.24	“All people are like the grass,
1PE.1.24	and all their glory is like the flowers of the field.
1PE.1.24	The grass dies and the flowers fall,
1PE.1.25	but the word of the Lord will live forever.”
1PE.1.25	And this is the word that was preached to you.
1PE.2.1	So then, rid yourselves of all evil, all lying, hypocrisy, jealousy, and evil speech. 
1PE.2.2	As newborn babies want milk, you should want the pure and simple teaching. By it you can mature in your salvation, 
1PE.2.3	because you have already examined and seen how good the Lord is.
1PE.2.4	Come to the Lord Jesus, the “stone” that lives. The people of the world did not want this stone, but he was the stone God chose, and he was precious. 
1PE.2.5	You also are like living stones, so let yourselves be used to build a spiritual temple—to be holy priests who offer spiritual sacrifices to God. He will accept those sacrifices through Jesus Christ. 
1PE.2.6	The Scripture says:
1PE.2.6	“I will put a stone in the ground in Jerusalem.
1PE.2.6	Everything will be built on this important and precious rock.
1PE.2.6	Anyone who trusts in him
1PE.2.6	will never be disappointed.”
1PE.2.7	This stone is worth much to you who believe. But to the people who do not believe,
1PE.2.7	“the stone that the builders rejected
1PE.2.7	has become the cornerstone.”
1PE.2.8	Also, he is
1PE.2.8	“a stone that causes people to stumble,
1PE.2.8	a rock that makes them fall.”
1PE.2.8	They stumble because they do not obey what God says, which is what God planned to happen to them.
1PE.2.9	But you are a chosen people, royal priests, a holy nation, a people for God’s own possession. You were chosen to tell about the wonderful acts of God, who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light. 
1PE.2.10	At one time you were not a people, but now you are God’s people. In the past you had never received mercy, but now you have received God’s mercy.
1PE.2.11	Dear friends, you are like foreigners and strangers in this world. I beg you to avoid the evil things your bodies want to do that fight against your soul. 
1PE.2.12	People who do not believe are living all around you and might say that you are doing wrong. Live such good lives that they will see the good things you do and will give glory to God on the day when Christ comes again.
1PE.2.13	For the Lord’s sake, yield to the people who have authority in this world: the king, who is the highest authority, 
1PE.2.14	and the leaders who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right. 
1PE.2.15	It is God’s desire that by doing good you should stop foolish people from saying stupid things about you. 
1PE.2.16	Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as an excuse to do evil. Live as servants of God. 
1PE.2.17	Show respect for all people: Love the brothers and sisters of God’s family, respect God, honor the king.
1PE.2.18	Slaves, yield to the authority of your masters with all respect, not only those who are good and kind, but also those who are dishonest. 
1PE.2.19	A person might have to suffer even when it is unfair, but if he thinks of God and can stand the pain, God is pleased. 
1PE.2.20	If you are beaten for doing wrong, there is no reason to praise you for being patient in your punishment. But if you suffer for doing good, and you are patient, then God is pleased. 
1PE.2.21	This is what you were called to do, because Christ suffered for you and gave you an example to follow. So you should do as he did.
1PE.2.22	“He had never sinned,
1PE.2.22	and he had never lied.”
1PE.2.23	People insulted Christ, but he did not insult them in return. Christ suffered, but he did not threaten. He let God, the One who judges rightly, take care of him. 
1PE.2.24	Christ carried our sins in his body on the cross so we would stop living for sin and start living for what is right. And you are healed because of his wounds. 
1PE.2.25	You were like sheep that wandered away, but now you have come back to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
1PE.3.1	In the same way, you wives should yield to your husbands. Then, if some husbands do not obey God’s teaching, they will be persuaded to believe without anyone’s saying a word to them. They will be persuaded by the way their wives live. 
1PE.3.2	Your husbands will see the pure lives you live with your respect for God. 
1PE.3.3	It is not fancy hair, gold jewelry, or fine clothes that should make you beautiful. 
1PE.3.4	No, your beauty should come from within you—the beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit that will never be destroyed and is very precious to God. 
1PE.3.5	In this same way the holy women who lived long ago and followed God made themselves beautiful, yielding to their own husbands. 
1PE.3.6	Sarah obeyed Abraham, her husband, and called him her master. And you women are true children of Sarah if you always do what is right and are not afraid.
1PE.3.7	In the same way, you husbands should live with your wives in an understanding way, since they are weaker than you. But show them respect, because God gives them the same blessing he gives you—the grace that gives true life. Do this so that nothing will stop your prayers.
1PE.3.8	Finally, all of you should be in agreement, understanding each other, loving each other as family, being kind and humble. 
1PE.3.9	Do not do wrong to repay a wrong, and do not insult to repay an insult. But repay with a blessing, because you yourselves were called to do this so that you might receive a blessing. 
1PE.3.10	The Scripture says,
1PE.3.10	“A person must do these things
1PE.3.10	to enjoy life and have many happy days.
1PE.3.10	He must not say evil things,
1PE.3.10	and he must not tell lies.
1PE.3.11	He must stop doing evil and do good.
1PE.3.11	He must look for peace and work for it.
1PE.3.12	The Lord sees the good people
1PE.3.12	and listens to their prayers.
1PE.3.12	But the Lord is against
1PE.3.12	those who do evil.”
1PE.3.13	If you are trying hard to do good, no one can really hurt you. 
1PE.3.14	But even if you suffer for doing right, you are blessed.
1PE.3.14	“Don’t be afraid of what they fear;
1PE.3.14	do not dread those things.” 
1PE.3.15	But respect Christ as the holy Lord in your hearts. Always be ready to answer everyone who asks you to explain about the hope you have, 
1PE.3.16	but answer in a gentle way and with respect. Keep a clear conscience so that those who speak evil of your good life in Christ will be made ashamed. 
1PE.3.17	It is better to suffer for doing good than for doing wrong if that is what God wants. 
1PE.3.18	Christ himself suffered for sins once. He was not guilty, but he suffered for those who are guilty to bring you to God. His body was killed, but he was made alive in the spirit. 
1PE.3.19	And in the spirit he went and preached to the spirits in prison 
1PE.3.20	who refused to obey God long ago in the time of Noah. God was waiting patiently for them while Noah was building the boat. Only a few people—eight in all—were saved by water. 
1PE.3.21	And that water is like baptism that now saves you—not the washing of dirt from the body, but the promise made to God from a good conscience. And this is because Jesus Christ was raised from the dead. 
1PE.3.22	Now Jesus has gone into heaven and is at God’s right side ruling over angels, authorities, and powers.
1PE.4.1	Since Christ suffered while he was in his body, strengthen yourselves with the same way of thinking Christ had. The person who has suffered in the body is finished with sin. 
1PE.4.2	Strengthen yourselves so that you will live here on earth doing what God wants, not the evil things people want. 
1PE.4.3	In the past you wasted too much time doing what nonbelievers enjoy. You were guilty of sexual sins, evil desires, drunkenness, wild and drunken parties, and hateful idol worship. 
1PE.4.4	Nonbelievers think it is strange that you do not do the many wild and wasteful things they do, so they insult you. 
1PE.4.5	But they will have to explain this to God, who is ready to judge the living and the dead. 
1PE.4.6	For this reason the Good News was preached to those who are now dead. Even though they were judged like all people, the Good News was preached to them so they could live in the spirit as God lives.
1PE.4.7	The time is near when all things will end. So think clearly and control yourselves so you will be able to pray. 
1PE.4.8	Most importantly, love each other deeply, because love will cause people to forgive each other for many sins. 
1PE.4.9	Open your homes to each other, without complaining. 
1PE.4.10	Each of you has received a gift to use to serve others. Be good servants of God’s various gifts of grace. 
1PE.4.11	Anyone who speaks should speak words from God. Anyone who serves should serve with the strength God gives so that in everything God will be praised through Jesus Christ. Power and glory belong to him forever and ever. Amen.
1PE.4.12	My friends, do not be surprised at the terrible trouble which now comes to test you. Do not think that something strange is happening to you. 
1PE.4.13	But be happy that you are sharing in Christ’s sufferings so that you will be happy and full of joy when Christ comes again in glory. 
1PE.4.14	When people insult you because you follow Christ, you are blessed, because the glorious Spirit, the Spirit of God, is with you. 
1PE.4.15	Do not suffer for murder, theft, or any other crime, nor because you trouble other people. 
1PE.4.16	But if you suffer because you are a Christian, do not be ashamed. Praise God because you wear that name. 
1PE.4.17	It is time for judgment to begin with God’s family. And if that judging begins with us, what will happen to those people who do not obey the Good News of God?
1PE.4.18	“If it is very hard for a good person to be saved,
1PE.4.18	the wicked person and the sinner will surely be lost!”
1PE.4.19	So those who suffer as God wants should trust their souls to the faithful Creator as they continue to do what is right.
1PE.5.1	Now I have something to say to the elders in your group. I also am an elder. I have seen Christ’s sufferings, and I will share in the glory that will be shown to us. I beg you to 
1PE.5.2	shepherd God’s flock, for whom you are responsible. Watch over them because you want to, not because you are forced. That is how God wants it. Do it because you are happy to serve, not because you want money. 
1PE.5.3	Do not be like a ruler over people you are responsible for, but be good examples to them. 
1PE.5.4	Then when Christ, the Chief Shepherd, comes, you will get a glorious crown that will never lose its beauty.
1PE.5.5	In the same way, younger people should be willing to be under older people. And all of you should be very humble with each other.
1PE.5.5	“God is against the proud,
1PE.5.5	but he gives grace to the humble.”
1PE.5.6	Be humble under God’s powerful hand so he will lift you up when the right time comes. 
1PE.5.7	Give all your worries to him, because he cares about you.
1PE.5.8	Control yourselves and be careful! The devil, your enemy, goes around like a roaring lion looking for someone to eat. 
1PE.5.9	Refuse to give in to him, by standing strong in your faith. You know that your Christian family all over the world is having the same kinds of suffering.
1PE.5.10	And after you suffer for a short time, God, who gives all grace, will make everything right. He will make you strong and support you and keep you from falling. He called you to share in his glory in Christ, a glory that will continue forever. 
1PE.5.11	All power is his forever and ever. Amen.
1PE.5.12	I wrote this short letter with the help of Silas, who I know is a faithful brother in Christ. I wrote to encourage you and to tell you that this is the true grace of God. Stand strong in that grace.
1PE.5.13	The church in Babylon, who was chosen like you, sends you greetings. Mark, my son in Christ, also greets you. 
1PE.5.14	Give each other a kiss of Christian love when you meet.
1PE.5.14	Peace to all of you who are in Christ. 
2PE.1.1	From Simon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.1	To you who have received a faith as valuable as ours, because our God and Savior Jesus Christ does what is right.
2PE.1.2	Grace and peace be given to you more and more, because you truly know God and Jesus our Lord.
2PE.1.3	Jesus has the power of God, by which he has given us everything we need to live and to serve God. We have these things because we know him. Jesus called us by his glory and goodness. 
2PE.1.4	Through these he gave us the very great and precious promises. With these gifts you can share in God’s nature, and the world will not ruin you with its evil desires.
2PE.1.5	Because you have these blessings, do your best to add these things to your lives: to your faith, add goodness; and to your goodness, add knowledge; 
2PE.1.6	and to your knowledge, add self-control; and to your self-control, add patience; and to your patience, add service for God; 
2PE.1.7	and to your service for God, add kindness for your brothers and sisters in Christ; and to this kindness, add love. 
2PE.1.8	If all these things are in you and are growing, they will help you to be useful and productive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. 
2PE.1.9	But anyone who does not have these things cannot see clearly. He is blind and has forgotten that he was made clean from his past sins.
2PE.1.10	My brothers and sisters, try hard to be certain that you really are called and chosen by God. If you do all these things, you will never fall. 
2PE.1.11	And you will be given a very great welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
2PE.1.12	You know these things, and you are very strong in the truth, but I will always help you remember them. 
2PE.1.13	I think it is right for me to help you remember as long as I am in this body. 
2PE.1.14	I know I must soon leave this body, as our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me. 
2PE.1.15	I will try my best so that you may be able to remember these things even after I am gone.
2PE.1.16	When we told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, we were not telling just clever stories that someone invented. But we saw the greatness of Jesus with our own eyes. 
2PE.1.17	Jesus heard the voice of God, the Greatest Glory, when he received honor and glory from God the Father. The voice said, “This is my Son, whom I love, and I am very pleased with him.” 
2PE.1.18	We heard that voice from heaven while we were with Jesus on the holy mountain.
2PE.1.19	This makes us more sure about the message the prophets gave. It is good for you to follow closely what they said as you would follow a light shining in a dark place, until the day begins and the morning star rises in your hearts. 
2PE.1.20	Most of all, you must understand this: No prophecy in the Scriptures ever comes from the prophet’s own interpretation. 
2PE.1.21	No prophecy ever came from what a person wanted to say, but people led by the Holy Spirit spoke words from God.
2PE.2.1	There used to be false prophets among God’s people, just as you will have some false teachers in your group. They will secretly teach things that are wrong—teachings that will cause people to be lost. They will even refuse to accept the Master, Jesus, who bought their freedom. So they will bring quick ruin on themselves. 
2PE.2.2	Many will follow their evil ways and say evil things about the way of truth. 
2PE.2.3	Those false teachers only want your money, so they will use you by telling you lies. Their judgment spoken against them long ago is still coming, and their ruin is certain.
2PE.2.4	When angels sinned, God did not let them go free without punishment. He sent them to hell and put them in caves of darkness where they are being held for judgment. 
2PE.2.5	And God punished the world long ago when he brought a flood to the world that was full of people who were against him. But God saved Noah, who preached about being right with God, and seven other people with him. 
2PE.2.6	And God also destroyed the evil cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them until they were ashes. He made those cities an example of what will happen to those who are against God. 
2PE.2.7	But he saved Lot from those cities. Lot, a good man, was troubled because of the filthy lives of evil people. 
2PE.2.8	(Lot was a good man, but because he lived with evil people every day, his good heart was hurt by the evil things he saw and heard.) 
2PE.2.9	So the Lord knows how to save those who serve him when troubles come. He will hold evil people and punish them, while waiting for the Judgment Day. 
2PE.2.10	That punishment is especially for those who live by doing the evil things their sinful selves want and who hate authority.
2PE.2.10	These false teachers are bold and do anything they want. They are not afraid to speak against the angels. 
2PE.2.11	But even the angels, who are much stronger and more powerful than false teachers, do not accuse them with insults before the Lord. 
2PE.2.12	But these people speak against things they do not understand. They are like animals that act without thinking, animals born to be caught and killed. And, like animals, these false teachers will be destroyed. 
2PE.2.13	They have caused many people to suffer, so they themselves will suffer. That is their pay for what they have done. They take pleasure in openly doing evil, so they are like dirty spots and stains among you. They delight in deceiving you while eating meals with you. 
2PE.2.14	Every time they look at a woman they want her, and their desire for sin is never satisfied. They lead weak people into the trap of sin, and they have taught their hearts to be greedy. God will punish them! 
2PE.2.15	These false teachers left the right road and lost their way, following the way Balaam went. Balaam was the son of Beor, who loved being paid for doing wrong. 
2PE.2.16	But a donkey, which cannot talk, told Balaam he was sinning. It spoke with a man’s voice and stopped the prophet’s crazy thinking.
2PE.2.17	Those false teachers are like springs without water and clouds blown by a storm. A place in the blackest darkness has been kept for them. 
2PE.2.18	They brag with words that mean nothing. By their evil desires they lead people into the trap of sin—people who are just beginning to escape from others who live in error. 
2PE.2.19	They promise them freedom, but they themselves are not free. They are slaves of things that will be destroyed. For people are slaves of anything that controls them. 
2PE.2.20	They were made free from the evil in the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But if they return to evil things and those things control them, then it is worse for them than it was before. 
2PE.2.21	Yes, it would be better for them to have never known the right way than to know it and to turn away from the holy teaching that was given to them. 
2PE.2.22	What they did is like this true saying: “A dog goes back to what it has thrown up,” and, “After a pig is washed, it goes back and rolls in the mud.”
2PE.3.1	My friends, this is the second letter I have written you to help your honest minds remember. 
2PE.3.2	I want you to think about the words the holy prophets spoke in the past, and remember the command our Lord and Savior gave us through your apostles. 
2PE.3.3	It is most important for you to understand what will happen in the last days. People will laugh at you. They will live doing the evil things they want to do. 
2PE.3.4	They will say, “Jesus promised to come again. Where is he? Our fathers have died, but the world continues the way it has been since it was made.” 
2PE.3.5	But they do not want to remember what happened long ago. By the word of God heaven was made, and the earth was made from water and with water. 
2PE.3.6	Then the world was flooded and destroyed with water. 
2PE.3.7	And that same word of God is keeping heaven and earth that we now have in order to be destroyed by fire. They are being kept for the Judgment Day and the destruction of all who are against God.
2PE.3.8	But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: To the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years is as one day. 
2PE.3.9	The Lord is not slow in doing what he promised—the way some people understand slowness. But God is being patient with you. He does not want anyone to be lost, but he wants all people to change their hearts and lives.
2PE.3.10	But the day of the Lord will come like a thief. The skies will disappear with a loud noise. Everything in them will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything in it will be exposed. 
2PE.3.11	In that way everything will be destroyed. So what kind of people should you be? You should live holy lives and serve God, 
2PE.3.12	as you wait for and look forward to the coming of the day of God. When that day comes, the skies will be destroyed with fire, and everything in them will melt with heat. 
2PE.3.13	But God made a promise to us, and we are waiting for a new heaven and a new earth where goodness lives.
2PE.3.14	Dear friends, since you are waiting for this to happen, do your best to be without sin and without fault. Try to be at peace with God. 
2PE.3.15	Remember that we are saved because our Lord is patient. Our dear brother Paul told you the same thing when he wrote to you with the wisdom that God gave him. 
2PE.3.16	He writes about this in all his letters. Some things in Paul’s letters are hard to understand, and people who are ignorant and weak in faith explain these things falsely. They also falsely explain the other Scriptures, but they are destroying themselves by doing this.
2PE.3.17	Dear friends, since you already know about this, be careful. Do not let those evil people lead you away by the wrong they do. Be careful so you will not fall from your strong faith. 
2PE.3.18	But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Glory be to him now and forever! Amen. 
1JN.1.1	We write you now about what has always existed, which we have heard, we have seen with our own eyes, we have looked at, and we have touched with our hands. We write to you about the Word that gives life. 
1JN.1.2	He who gives life was shown to us. We saw him and can give proof about it. And now we announce to you that he has life that continues forever. He was with God the Father and was shown to us. 
1JN.1.3	We announce to you what we have seen and heard, because we want you also to have fellowship with us. Our fellowship is with God the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ. 
1JN.1.4	We write this to you so we may be full of joy.
1JN.1.5	Here is the message we have heard from Christ and now announce to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. 
1JN.1.6	So if we say we have fellowship with God, but we continue living in darkness, we are liars and do not follow the truth. 
1JN.1.7	But if we live in the light, as God is in the light, we can share fellowship with each other. Then the blood of Jesus, God’s Son, cleanses us from every sin.
1JN.1.8	If we say we have no sin, we are fooling ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 
1JN.1.9	But if we confess our sins, he will forgive our sins, because we can trust God to do what is right. He will cleanse us from all the wrongs we have done. 
1JN.1.10	If we say we have not sinned, we make God a liar, and we do not accept God’s teaching.
1JN.2.1	My dear children, I write this letter to you so you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have a helper in the presence of the Father—Jesus Christ, the One who does what is right. 
1JN.2.2	He died in our place to take away our sins, and not only our sins but the sins of all people.
1JN.2.3	We can be sure that we know God if we obey his commands. 
1JN.2.4	Anyone who says, “I know God,” but does not obey God’s commands is a liar, and the truth is not in that person. 
1JN.2.5	But if someone obeys God’s teaching, then in that person God’s love has truly reached its goal. This is how we can be sure we are living in God: 
1JN.2.6	Whoever says that he lives in God must live as Jesus lived.
1JN.2.7	My dear friends, I am not writing a new command to you but an old command you have had from the beginning. It is the teaching you have already heard. 
1JN.2.8	But also I am writing a new command to you, and you can see its truth in Jesus and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.
1JN.2.9	Anyone who says, “I am in the light,” but hates a brother or sister, is still in the darkness. 
1JN.2.10	Whoever loves a brother or sister lives in the light and will not cause anyone to stumble in his faith. 
1JN.2.11	But whoever hates a brother or sister is in darkness, lives in darkness, and does not know where to go, because the darkness has made that person blind.
1JN.2.12	I write to you, dear children,
1JN.2.12	because your sins are forgiven through Christ.
1JN.2.13	I write to you, fathers,
1JN.2.13	because you know the One who existed from the beginning.
1JN.2.13	I write to you, young people,
1JN.2.13	because you have defeated the Evil One.
1JN.2.14	I write to you, children,
1JN.2.14	because you know the Father.
1JN.2.14	I write to you, fathers,
1JN.2.14	because you know the One who existed from the beginning.
1JN.2.14	I write to you, young people,
1JN.2.14	because you are strong;
1JN.2.14	the teaching of God lives in you,
1JN.2.14	and you have defeated the Evil One.
1JN.2.15	Do not love the world or the things in the world. If you love the world, the love of the Father is not in you. 
1JN.2.16	These are the ways of the world: wanting to please our sinful selves, wanting the sinful things we see, and being too proud of what we have. None of these come from the Father, but all of them come from the world. 
1JN.2.17	The world and everything that people want in it are passing away, but the person who does what God wants lives forever.
1JN.2.18	My dear children, these are the last days. You have heard that the enemy of Christ is coming, and now many enemies of Christ are already here. This is how we know that these are the last days. 
1JN.2.19	These enemies of Christ were in our fellowship, but they left us. They never really belonged to us; if they had been a part of us, they would have stayed with us. But they left, and this shows that none of them really belonged to us.
1JN.2.20	You have the gift that the Holy One gave you, so you all know the truth. 
1JN.2.21	I do not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know the truth. And you know that no lie comes from the truth.
1JN.2.22	Who is the liar? It is the person who does not accept Jesus as the Christ. This is the enemy of Christ: the person who does not accept the Father and his Son. 
1JN.2.23	Whoever does not accept the Son does not have the Father. But whoever confesses the Son has the Father, too.
1JN.2.24	Be sure you continue to follow the teaching you heard from the beginning. If you continue to follow what you heard from the beginning, you will stay in the Son and in the Father. 
1JN.2.25	And this is what the Son promised to us—life forever.
1JN.2.26	I am writing this letter about those people who are trying to lead you the wrong way. 
1JN.2.27	Christ gave you a special gift that is still in you, so you do not need any other teacher. His gift teaches you about everything, and it is true, not false. So continue to live in Christ, as his gift taught you.
1JN.2.28	Yes, my dear children, live in him so that when Christ comes back, we can be without fear and not be ashamed in his presence. 
1JN.2.29	Since you know that Christ is righteous, you know that all who do right are God’s children.
1JN.3.1	The Father has loved us so much that we are called children of God. And we really are his children. The reason the people in the world do not know us is that they have not known him. 
1JN.3.2	Dear friends, now we are children of God, and we have not yet been shown what we will be in the future. But we know that when Christ comes again, we will be like him, because we will see him as he really is. 
1JN.3.3	Christ is pure, and all who have this hope in Christ keep themselves pure like Christ.
1JN.3.4	The person who sins breaks God’s law. Yes, sin is living against God’s law. 
1JN.3.5	You know that Christ came to take away sins and that there is no sin in Christ. 
1JN.3.6	So anyone who lives in Christ does not go on sinning. Anyone who goes on sinning has never really understood Christ and has never known him.
1JN.3.7	Dear children, do not let anyone lead you the wrong way. Christ is righteous. So to be like Christ a person must do what is right. 
1JN.3.8	The devil has been sinning since the beginning, so anyone who continues to sin belongs to the devil. The Son of God came for this purpose: to destroy the devil’s work.
1JN.3.9	Those who are God’s children do not continue sinning, because the new life from God remains in them. They are not able to go on sinning, because they have become children of God. 
1JN.3.10	So we can see who God’s children are and who the devil’s children are: Those who do not do what is right are not God’s children, and those who do not love their brothers and sisters are not God’s children.
1JN.3.11	This is the teaching you have heard from the beginning: We must love each other. 
1JN.3.12	Do not be like Cain who belonged to the Evil One and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because the things Cain did were evil, and the things his brother did were good.
1JN.3.13	Brothers and sisters, do not be surprised when the people of the world hate you. 
1JN.3.14	We know we have left death and have come into life because we love each other. Whoever does not love is still dead. 
1JN.3.15	Everyone who hates a brother or sister is a murderer, and you know that no murderers have eternal life in them. 
1JN.3.16	This is how we know what real love is: Jesus gave his life for us. So we should give our lives for our brothers and sisters. 
1JN.3.17	Suppose someone has enough to live and sees a brother or sister in need, but does not help. Then God’s love is not living in that person. 
1JN.3.18	My children, we should love people not only with words and talk, but by our actions and true caring.
1JN.3.19+1JN.3.20	This is the way we know that we belong to the way of truth. When our hearts make us feel guilty, we can still have peace before God. God is greater than our hearts, and he knows everything. 
1JN.3.21	My dear friends, if our hearts do not make us feel guilty, we can come without fear into God’s presence. 
1JN.3.22	And God gives us what we ask for because we obey God’s commands and do what pleases him. 
1JN.3.23	This is what God commands: that we believe in his Son, Jesus Christ, and that we love each other, just as he commanded. 
1JN.3.24	The people who obey God’s commands live in God, and God lives in them. We know that God lives in us because of the Spirit God gave us.
1JN.4.1	My dear friends, many false prophets have gone out into the world. So do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see if they are from God. 
1JN.4.2	This is how you can know God’s Spirit: Every spirit who confesses that Jesus Christ came to earth as a human is from God. 
1JN.4.3	And every spirit who refuses to say this about Jesus is not from God. It is the spirit of the enemy of Christ, which you have heard is coming, and now he is already in the world.
1JN.4.4	My dear children, you belong to God and have defeated them; because God’s Spirit, who is in you, is greater than the devil, who is in the world. 
1JN.4.5	And they belong to the world, so what they say is from the world, and the world listens to them. 
1JN.4.6	But we belong to God, and those who know God listen to us. But those who are not from God do not listen to us. That is how we know the Spirit that is true and the spirit that is false.
1JN.4.7	Dear friends, we should love each other, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has become God’s child and knows God. 
1JN.4.8	Whoever does not love does not know God, because God is love. 
1JN.4.9	This is how God showed his love to us: He sent his one and only Son into the world so that we could have life through him. 
1JN.4.10	This is what real love is: It is not our love for God; it is God’s love for us. He sent his Son to die in our place to take away our sins.
1JN.4.11	Dear friends, if God loved us that much we also should love each other. 
1JN.4.12	No one has ever seen God, but if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is made perfect in us.
1JN.4.13	We know that we live in God and he lives in us, because he gave us his Spirit. 
1JN.4.14	We have seen and can testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world. 
1JN.4.15	Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God has God living inside, and that person lives in God. 
1JN.4.16	And so we know the love that God has for us, and we trust that love.
1JN.4.16	God is love. Those who live in love live in God, and God lives in them. 
1JN.4.17	This is how love is made perfect in us: that we can be without fear on the day God judges us, because in this world we are like him. 
1JN.4.18	Where God’s love is, there is no fear, because God’s perfect love drives out fear. It is punishment that makes a person fear, so love is not made perfect in the person who fears.
1JN.4.19	We love because God first loved us. 
1JN.4.20	If people say, “I love God,” but hate their brothers or sisters, they are liars. Those who do not love their brothers and sisters, whom they have seen, cannot love God, whom they have never seen. 
1JN.4.21	And God gave us this command: Those who love God must also love their brothers and sisters.
1JN.5.1	Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ is God’s child, and whoever loves the Father also loves the Father’s children. 
1JN.5.2	This is how we know we love God’s children: when we love God and obey his commands. 
1JN.5.3	Loving God means obeying his commands. And God’s commands are not too hard for us, 
1JN.5.4	because everyone who is a child of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers the world—our faith. 
1JN.5.5	So the one who conquers the world is the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
1JN.5.6	Jesus Christ is the One who came by water and blood. He did not come by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit says that this is true, because the Spirit is the truth. 
1JN.5.7	So there are three witnesses: 
1JN.5.8	the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three witnesses agree. 
1JN.5.9	We believe people when they say something is true. But what God says is more important, and he has told us the truth about his own Son. 
1JN.5.10	Anyone who believes in the Son of God has the truth that God told us. Anyone who does not believe makes God a liar, because that person does not believe what God told us about his Son. 
1JN.5.11	This is what God told us: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. 
1JN.5.12	Whoever has the Son has life, but whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
1JN.5.13	I write this letter to you who believe in the Son of God so you will know you have eternal life. 
1JN.5.14	And this is the boldness we have in God’s presence: that if we ask God for anything that agrees with what he wants, he hears us. 
1JN.5.15	If we know he hears us every time we ask him, we know we have what we ask from him.
1JN.5.16	If anyone sees a brother or sister sinning (sin that does not lead to eternal death), that person should pray, and God will give the sinner life. I am talking about people whose sin does not lead to eternal death. There is sin that leads to death. I do not mean that a person should pray about that sin. 
1JN.5.17	Doing wrong is always sin, but there is sin that does not lead to eternal death.
1JN.5.18	We know that those who are God’s children do not continue to sin. The Son of God keeps them safe, and the Evil One cannot touch them. 
1JN.5.19	We know that we belong to God, but the Evil One controls the whole world. 
1JN.5.20	We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we can know the True One. And our lives are in the True One and in his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the true God and the eternal life.
1JN.5.21	So, dear children, keep yourselves away from false gods. 
2JN.1.1	From the Elder.
2JN.1.1	To the chosen lady and her children:
2JN.1.1	I love all of you in the truth, and all those who know the truth love you. 
2JN.1.2	We love you because of the truth that lives in us and will be with us forever.
2JN.1.3	Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and his Son, Jesus Christ, will be with us in truth and love.
2JN.1.4	I was very happy to learn that some of your children are following the way of truth, as the Father commanded us. 
2JN.1.5	And now, dear lady, this is not a new command but is the same command we have had from the beginning. I ask you that we all love each other. 
2JN.1.6	And love means living the way God commanded us to live. As you have heard from the beginning, his command is this: Live a life of love.
2JN.1.7	Many false teachers are in the world now who do not confess that Jesus Christ came to earth as a human. Anyone who does not confess this is a false teacher and an enemy of Christ. 
2JN.1.8	Be careful yourselves that you do not lose everything you have worked for, but that you receive your full reward.
2JN.1.9	Anyone who goes beyond Christ’s teaching and does not continue to follow only his teaching does not have God. But whoever continues to follow the teaching of Christ has both the Father and the Son. 
2JN.1.10	If someone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not welcome or accept that person into your house. 
2JN.1.11	If you welcome such a person, you share in the evil work.
2JN.1.12	I have many things to write to you, but I do not want to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and talk face to face so we can be full of joy. 
2JN.1.13	The children of your chosen sister greet you. 
3JN.1.1	From the Elder.
3JN.1.1	To my dear friend Gaius, whom I love in the truth:
3JN.1.2	My dear friend, I know your soul is doing fine, and I pray that you are doing well in every way and that your health is good. 
3JN.1.3	I was very happy when some brothers and sisters came and told me about the truth in your life and how you are following the way of truth. 
3JN.1.4	Nothing gives me greater joy than to hear that my children are following the way of truth.
3JN.1.5	My dear friend, it is good that you help the brothers and sisters, even those you do not know. 
3JN.1.6	They told the church about your love. Please help them to continue their trip in a way worthy of God. 
3JN.1.7	They started out in service to Christ, and they have been accepting nothing from nonbelievers. 
3JN.1.8	So we should help such people; when we do, we share in their work for the truth.
3JN.1.9	I wrote something to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be their leader, will not listen to us. 
3JN.1.10	So if I come, I will talk about what Diotrephes is doing, about how he lies and says evil things about us. But more than that, he refuses to accept the other brothers and sisters; he even stops those who do want to accept them and puts them out of the church.
3JN.1.11	My dear friend, do not follow what is bad; follow what is good. The one who does good belongs to God. But the one who does evil has never known God.
3JN.1.12	Everyone says good things about Demetrius, and the truth agrees with what they say. We also speak well of him, and you know what we say is true.
3JN.1.13	I have many things I want to write you, but I do not want to use pen and ink. 
3JN.1.14	I hope to see you soon and talk face to face. 
3JN.1.15	Peace to you. The friends here greet you. Please greet each friend there by name. 
JUD.1.1	From Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James.
JUD.1.1	To all who have been called by God. God the Father loves you, and you have been kept safe in Jesus Christ:
JUD.1.2	Mercy, peace, and love be yours richly.
JUD.1.3	Dear friends, I wanted very much to write you about the salvation we all share. But I felt the need to write you about something else: I want to encourage you to fight hard for the faith that was given the holy people of God once and for all time. 
JUD.1.4	Some people have secretly entered your group. Long ago the prophets wrote about these people who will be judged guilty. They are against God and have changed the grace of our God into a reason for sexual sin. They also refuse to accept Jesus Christ, our only Master and Lord.
JUD.1.5	I want to remind you of some things you already know: Remember that the Lord saved his people by bringing them out of the land of Egypt. But later he destroyed all those who did not believe. 
JUD.1.6	And remember the angels who did not keep their place of power but left their proper home. The Lord has kept these angels in darkness, bound with everlasting chains, to be judged on the great day. 
JUD.1.7	Also remember the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and the other towns around them. In the same way they were full of sexual sin and people who desired sexual relations that God does not allow. They suffer the punishment of eternal fire, as an example for all to see.
JUD.1.8	It is the same with these people who have entered your group. They are guided by dreams and make themselves filthy with sin. They reject God’s authority and speak against the angels. 
JUD.1.9	Not even the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil about who would have the body of Moses, dared to judge the devil guilty. Instead, he said, “The Lord punish you.” 
JUD.1.10	But these people speak against things they do not understand. And what they do know, by feeling, as dumb animals know things, are the very things that destroy them. 
JUD.1.11	It will be terrible for them. They have followed the way of Cain, and for money they have given themselves to doing the wrong that Balaam did. They have fought against God as Korah did, and like Korah, they surely will be destroyed. 
JUD.1.12	They are like dirty spots in your special Christian meals you share. They eat with you and have no fear, caring only for themselves. They are clouds without rain, which the wind blows around. They are autumn trees without fruit that are pulled out of the ground. So they are twice dead. 
JUD.1.13	They are like wild waves of the sea, tossing up their own shameful actions like foam. They are like stars that wander in the sky. A place in the blackest darkness has been kept for them forever.
JUD.1.14	Enoch, the seventh descendant from Adam, said about these people: “Look, the Lord is coming with many thousands of his holy angels to 
JUD.1.15	judge every person. He is coming to punish all who are against God for all the evil they have done against him. And he will punish the sinners who are against God for all the evil they have said against him.”
JUD.1.16	These people complain and blame others, doing the evil things they want to do. They brag about themselves, and they flatter others to get what they want.
JUD.1.17	Dear friends, remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said before. 
JUD.1.18	They said to you, “In the last times there will be people who laugh about God, following their own evil desires which are against God.” 
JUD.1.19	These are the people who divide you, people whose thoughts are only of this world, who do not have the Spirit.
JUD.1.20	But dear friends, use your most holy faith to build yourselves up, praying in the Holy Spirit. 
JUD.1.21	Keep yourselves in God’s love as you wait for the Lord Jesus Christ with his mercy to give you life forever.
JUD.1.22	Show mercy to some people who have doubts. 
JUD.1.23	Take others out of the fire, and save them. Show mercy mixed with fear to others, hating even their clothes which are dirty from sin.
JUD.1.24	God is strong and can help you not to fall. He can bring you before his glory without any wrong in you and can give you great joy. 
JUD.1.25	He is the only God, the One who saves us. To him be glory, greatness, power, and authority through Jesus Christ our Lord for all time past, now, and forever. Amen.
REV.1.1	This is the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him, to show his servants what must soon happen. And Jesus sent his angel to show it to his servant John, 
REV.1.2	who has told everything he has seen. It is the word of God; it is the message from Jesus Christ. 
REV.1.3	Blessed is the one who reads the words of God’s message, and blessed are the people who hear this message and do what is written in it. The time is near when all of this will happen.
REV.1.4	From John.
REV.1.4	To the seven churches in Asia:
REV.1.4	Grace and peace to you from the One who is and was and is coming, and from the seven spirits before his throne, 
REV.1.5	and from Jesus Christ. Jesus is the faithful witness, the first among those raised from the dead. He is the ruler of the kings of the earth.
REV.1.5	He is the One who loves us, who made us free from our sins with the blood of his death. 
REV.1.6	He made us to be a kingdom of priests who serve God his Father. To Jesus Christ be glory and power forever and ever! Amen.
REV.1.7	Look, Jesus is coming with the clouds, and everyone will see him, even those who stabbed him. And all peoples of the earth will cry loudly because of him. Yes, this will happen! Amen.
REV.1.8	The Lord God says, 
REV.1.9	I, John, am your brother. All of us share with Christ in suffering, in the kingdom, and in patience to continue. I was on the island of Patmos, because I had preached the word of God and the message about Jesus. 
REV.1.10	On the Lord’s day I was in the Spirit, and I heard a loud voice behind me that sounded like a trumpet. 
REV.1.11	The voice said, 
REV.1.12	I turned to see who was talking to me. When I turned, I saw seven golden lampstands 
REV.1.13	and someone among the lampstands who was “like a Son of Man.” He was dressed in a long robe and had a gold band around his chest. 
REV.1.14	His head and hair were white like wool, as white as snow, and his eyes were like flames of fire. 
REV.1.15	His feet were like bronze that glows hot in a furnace, and his voice was like the noise of flooding water. 
REV.1.16	He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp double-edged sword came out of his mouth. He looked like the sun shining at its brightest time.
REV.1.17	When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. He put his right hand on me and said, 
REV.4.1	After the vision of these things I looked, and there before me was an open door in heaven. And the same voice that spoke to me before, that sounded like a trumpet, said, 
REV.4.2	Immediately I was in the Spirit, and before me was a throne in heaven, and someone was sitting on it. 
REV.4.3	The One who sat on the throne looked like precious stones, like jasper and carnelian. All around the throne was a rainbow the color of an emerald. 
REV.4.4	Around the throne there were twenty-four other thrones with twenty-four elders sitting on them. They were dressed in white and had golden crowns on their heads. 
REV.4.5	Lightning flashes and noises and thunder came from the throne. Before the throne seven lamps were burning, which are the seven spirits of God. 
REV.4.6	Also before the throne there was something that looked like a sea of glass, clear like crystal.
REV.4.6	In the center and around the throne were four living creatures with eyes all over them, in front and in back. 
REV.4.7	The first living creature was like a lion. The second was like a calf. The third had a face like a man. The fourth was like a flying eagle. 
REV.4.8	Each of these four living creatures had six wings and was covered all over with eyes, inside and out. Day and night they never stop saying:
REV.4.8	“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty.
REV.4.8	He was, he is, and he is coming.”
REV.4.9	These living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the One who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever. 
REV.4.10	Then the twenty-four elders bow down before the One who sits on the throne, and they worship him who lives forever and ever. They put their crowns down before the throne and say:
REV.4.11	“You are worthy, our Lord and God,
REV.4.11	to receive glory and honor and power,
REV.4.11	because you made all things.
REV.4.11	Everything existed and was made,
REV.4.11	because you wanted it.”
REV.5.1	Then I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One sitting on the throne. The scroll had writing on both sides and was kept closed with seven seals. 
REV.5.2	And I saw a powerful angel calling in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?” 
REV.5.3	But there was no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth who could open the scroll or look inside it. 
REV.5.4	I cried bitterly because there was no one who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside. 
REV.5.5	But one of the elders said to me, “Do not cry! The Lion from the tribe of Judah, David’s descendant, has won the victory so that he is able to open the scroll and its seven seals.”
REV.5.6	Then I saw a Lamb standing in the center of the throne and in the middle of the four living creatures and the elders. The Lamb looked as if he had been killed. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God that were sent into all the world. 
REV.5.7	The Lamb came and took the scroll from the right hand of the One sitting on the throne. 
REV.5.8	When he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders bowed down before the Lamb. Each one of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of God’s holy people. 
REV.5.9	And they all sang a new song to the Lamb:
REV.5.9	“You are worthy to take the scroll
REV.5.9	and to open its seals,
REV.5.9	because you were killed,
REV.5.9	and with the blood of your death you bought people for God
REV.5.9	from every tribe, language, people, and nation.
REV.5.10	You made them to be a kingdom of priests for our God,
REV.5.10	and they will rule on the earth.”
REV.5.11	Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels around the throne, and the four living creatures, and the elders. There were thousands and thousands of angels, 
REV.5.12	saying in a loud voice:
REV.5.12	“The Lamb who was killed is worthy
REV.5.12	to receive power, wealth, wisdom, and strength,
REV.5.12	honor, glory, and praise!”
REV.5.13	Then I heard all creatures in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea saying:
REV.5.13	“To the One who sits on the throne
REV.5.13	and to the Lamb
REV.5.13	be praise and honor and glory and power
REV.5.13	forever and ever.”
REV.5.14	The four living creatures said, “Amen,” and the elders bowed down and worshiped.
REV.6.1	Then I watched while the Lamb opened the first of the seven seals. I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, “Come!” 
REV.6.2	I looked, and there before me was a white horse. The rider on the horse held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out, determined to win the victory.
REV.6.3	When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” 
REV.6.4	Then another horse came out, a red one. Its rider was given power to take away peace from the earth and to make people kill each other, and he was given a big sword.
REV.6.5	When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse, and its rider held a pair of scales in his hand. 
REV.6.6	Then I heard something that sounded like a voice coming from the middle of the four living creatures. The voice said, “A quart of wheat for a day’s pay, and three quarts of barley for a day’s pay, and do not damage the olive oil and wine!”
REV.6.7	When the Lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, “Come!” 
REV.6.8	I looked, and there before me was a pale horse. Its rider was named death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill people by war, by starvation, by disease, and by the wild animals of the earth.
REV.6.9	When the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the word of God and to the message they had received. 
REV.6.10	These souls shouted in a loud voice, “Holy and true Lord, how long until you judge the people of the earth and punish them for killing us?” 
REV.6.11	Then each one of them was given a white robe and was told to wait a short time longer. There were still some of their fellow servants and brothers and sisters in the service of Christ who must be killed as they were. They had to wait until all of this was finished.
REV.6.12	Then I watched while the Lamb opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black like rough black cloth, and the whole moon became red like blood. 
REV.6.13	And the stars in the sky fell to the earth like figs falling from a fig tree when the wind blows. 
REV.6.14	The sky disappeared as a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
REV.6.15	Then the kings of the earth, the rulers, the generals, the rich people, the powerful people, the slaves, and the free people hid themselves in caves and in the rocks on the mountains. 
REV.6.16	They called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us. Hide us from the face of the One who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb! 
REV.6.17	The great day for their anger has come, and who can stand against it?”
REV.7.1	After the vision of these things I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. The angels were holding the four winds of the earth to keep them from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree. 
REV.7.2	Then I saw another angel coming up from the east who had the seal of the living God. And he called out in a loud voice to the four angels to whom God had given power to harm the earth and the sea. 
REV.7.3	He said to them, “Do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we mark with a sign the foreheads of the people who serve our God.” 
REV.7.4	Then I heard how many people were marked with the sign. There were one hundred forty-four thousand from every tribe of the people of Israel.
REV.7.5	From the tribe of Judah twelve thousand were marked with the sign,
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand,
REV.7.5	from the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Asher twelve thousand,
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand,
REV.7.6	from the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Levi twelve thousand,
REV.7.7	from the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand,
REV.7.8	from the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand,
REV.7.8	and from the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand were marked with the sign.
REV.7.9	After the vision of these things I looked, and there was a great number of people, so many that no one could count them. They were from every nation, tribe, people, and language of the earth. They were all standing before the throne and before the Lamb, wearing white robes and holding palm branches in their hands. 
REV.7.10	They were shouting in a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.” 
REV.7.11	All the angels were standing around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures. They all bowed down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, 
REV.7.12	saying, “Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength belong to our God forever and ever. Amen!”
REV.7.13	Then one of the elders asked me, “Who are these people dressed in white robes? Where did they come from?”
REV.7.14	I answered, “You know, sir.”
REV.7.14	And the elder said to me, “These are the people who have come out of the great distress. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. 
REV.7.15	Because of this, they are before the throne of God. They worship him day and night in his temple. And the One who sits on the throne will be present with them. 
REV.7.16	Those people will never be hungry again, and they will never be thirsty again. The sun will not hurt them, and no heat will burn them, 
REV.7.17	because the Lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd. He will lead them to springs of water that give life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”
REV.8.1	When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 
REV.8.2	And I saw the seven angels who stand before God and to whom were given seven trumpets.
REV.8.3	Another angel came and stood at the altar, holding a golden pan for incense. He was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all God’s holy people. The angel put this offering on the golden altar before the throne. 
REV.8.4	The smoke from the incense went up from the angel’s hand to God with the prayers of God’s people. 
REV.8.5	Then the angel filled the incense pan with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and there were flashes of lightning, thunder and loud noises, and an earthquake.
REV.8.6	Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
REV.8.7	The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were poured down on the earth. And a third of the earth, and all the green grass, and a third of the trees were burned up.
REV.8.8	Then the second angel blew his trumpet, and something that looked like a big mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea. And a third of the sea became blood, 
REV.8.9	a third of the living things in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
REV.8.10	Then the third angel blew his trumpet, and a large star, burning like a torch, fell from the sky. It fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. 
REV.8.11	The name of the star is Wormwood. And a third of all the water became bitter, and many people died from drinking the water that was bitter.
REV.8.12	Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars were struck. So a third of them became dark, and a third of the day was without light, and also the night.
REV.8.13	While I watched, I heard an eagle that was flying high in the air cry out in a loud voice, “Trouble! Trouble! Trouble for those who live on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpets that the other three angels are about to blow!”
REV.9.1	Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fall from the sky to the earth. The star was given the key to the deep hole that leads to the bottomless pit. 
REV.9.2	Then it opened up the hole that leads to the bottomless pit, and smoke came up from the hole like smoke from a big furnace. Then the sun and sky became dark because of the smoke from the hole. 
REV.9.3	Then locusts came down to the earth out of the smoke, and they were given the power to sting like scorpions. 
REV.9.4	They were told not to harm the grass on the earth or any plant or tree. They could harm only the people who did not have the sign of God on their foreheads. 
REV.9.5	These locusts were not given the power to kill anyone, but to cause pain to the people for five months. And the pain they felt was like the pain a scorpion gives when it stings someone. 
REV.9.6	During those days people will look for a way to die, but they will not find it. They will want to die, but death will run away from them.
REV.9.7	The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads they wore what looked like crowns of gold, and their faces looked like human faces. 
REV.9.8	Their hair was like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. 
REV.9.9	Their chests looked like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle. 
REV.9.10	The locusts had tails with stingers like scorpions, and in their tails was their power to hurt people for five months. 
REV.9.11	The locusts had a king who was the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in the Hebrew language is Abaddon and in the Greek language is Apollyon.
REV.9.12	The first trouble is past; there are still two other troubles that will come.
REV.9.13	Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice coming from the horns on the golden altar that is before God. 
REV.9.14	The voice said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, “Free the four angels who are tied at the great river Euphrates.” 
REV.9.15	And they let loose the four angels who had been kept ready for this hour and day and month and year so they could kill a third of all people on the earth. 
REV.9.16	I heard how many troops on horses were in their army—two hundred million.
REV.9.17	The horses and their riders I saw in the vision looked like this: They had breastplates that were fiery red, dark blue, and yellow like sulfur. The heads of the horses looked like heads of lions, with fire, smoke, and sulfur coming out of their mouths. 
REV.9.18	A third of all the people on earth were killed by these three terrible disasters coming out of the horses’ mouths: the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur. 
REV.9.19	The horses’ power was in their mouths and in their tails; their tails were like snakes with heads, and with them they hurt people.
REV.9.20	The other people who were not killed by these terrible disasters still did not change their hearts and turn away from what they had made with their own hands. They did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood—things that cannot see or hear or walk. 
REV.9.21	These people did not change their hearts and turn away from murder or evil magic, from their sexual sins or stealing.
REV.10.1	Then I saw another powerful angel coming down from heaven dressed in a cloud with a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his legs were like pillars of fire. 
REV.10.2	The angel was holding a small scroll open in his hand. He put his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land. 
REV.10.3	Then he shouted loudly like the roaring of a lion. And when he shouted, the voices of seven thunders spoke. 
REV.10.4	When the seven thunders spoke, I started to write. But I heard a voice from heaven say, “Keep hidden what the seven thunders said, and do not write them down.”
REV.10.5	Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven, 
REV.10.6	and he made a promise by the power of the One who lives forever and ever. He is the One who made the skies and all that is in them, the earth and all that is in it, and the sea and all that is in it. The angel promised, “There will be no more waiting! 
REV.10.7	In the days when the seventh angel is ready to blow his trumpet, God’s secret will be finished. This secret is the Good News God told to his servants, the prophets.”
REV.10.8	Then I heard the same voice from heaven again, saying to me: “Go and take the open scroll that is in the hand of the angel that is standing on the sea and on the land.”
REV.10.9	So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll. And he said to me, “Take the scroll and eat it. It will be sour in your stomach, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey.” 
REV.10.10	So I took the small scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it. In my mouth it tasted sweet as honey, but after I ate it, it was sour in my stomach. 
REV.10.11	Then I was told, “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”
REV.11.1	I was given a measuring stick like a rod, and I was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count the people worshiping there. 
REV.11.2	But do not measure the yard outside the temple. Leave it alone, because it has been given to those who are not God’s people. And they will trample on the holy city for forty-two months. 
REV.11.3	And I will give power to my two witnesses to prophesy for one thousand two hundred sixty days, and they will be dressed in rough cloth to show their sadness.”
REV.11.4	These two witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth. 
REV.11.5	And if anyone tries to hurt them, fire comes from their mouths and kills their enemies. And if anyone tries to hurt them in whatever way, in that same way that person will die. 
REV.11.6	These witnesses have the power to stop the sky from raining during the time they are prophesying. And they have power to make the waters become blood, and they have power to send every kind of trouble to the earth as many times as they want.
REV.11.7	When the two witnesses have finished telling their message, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will fight a war against them. He will defeat them and kill them. 
REV.11.8	The bodies of the two witnesses will lie in the street of the great city where the Lord was killed. This city is named Sodom and Egypt, which has a spiritual meaning. 
REV.11.9	Those from every race of people, tribe, language, and nation will look at the bodies of the two witnesses for three and one-half days, and they will refuse to bury them. 
REV.11.10	People who live on the earth will rejoice and be happy because these two are dead. They will send each other gifts, because these two prophets brought much suffering to those who live on the earth.
REV.11.11	But after three and one-half days, God put the breath of life into the two prophets again. They stood on their feet, and everyone who saw them became very afraid. 
REV.11.12	Then the two prophets heard a loud voice from heaven saying, “Come up here!” And they went up into heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched.
REV.11.13	In the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city was destroyed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and those who did not die were very afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven.
REV.11.14	The second trouble is finished. Pay attention: The third trouble is coming soon.
REV.11.15	Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet. And there were loud voices in heaven, saying:
REV.11.15	“The power to rule the world now belongs to our Lord and his Christ,
REV.11.15	and he will rule forever and ever.”
REV.11.16	Then the twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God, bowed down on their faces and worshiped God. 
REV.11.17	They said:
REV.11.17	“We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty,
REV.11.17	who is and who was,
REV.11.17	because you have used your great power
REV.11.17	and have begun to rule!
REV.11.18	The people of the world were angry,
REV.11.18	but your anger has come.
REV.11.18	The time has come to judge the dead,
REV.11.18	and to reward your servants the prophets
REV.11.18	and your holy people,
REV.11.18	all who respect you, great and small.
REV.11.18	The time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth!”
REV.11.19	Then God’s temple in heaven was opened. The Ark that holds the agreement God gave to his people could be seen in his temple. Then there were flashes of lightning, noises, thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm.
REV.12.1	And then a great wonder appeared in heaven: A woman was clothed with the sun, and the moon was under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars was on her head. 
REV.12.2	She was pregnant and cried out with pain, because she was about to give birth. 
REV.12.3	Then another wonder appeared in heaven: There was a giant red dragon with seven heads and seven crowns on each head. He also had ten horns. 
REV.12.4	His tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and threw them down to the earth. He stood in front of the woman who was ready to give birth so he could eat her baby as soon as it was born. 
REV.12.5	Then the woman gave birth to a son who will rule all the nations with an iron rod. And her child was taken up to God and to his throne. 
REV.12.6	The woman ran away into the desert to a place God prepared for her where she would be taken care of for one thousand two hundred sixty days.
REV.12.7	Then there was a war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. 
REV.12.8	But the dragon was not strong enough, and he and his angels lost their place in heaven. 
REV.12.9	The giant dragon was thrown down out of heaven. (He is that old snake called the devil or Satan, who tricks the whole world.) The dragon with his angels was thrown down to the earth.
REV.12.10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying:
REV.12.10	“The salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God
REV.12.10	and the authority of his Christ have now come.
REV.12.10	The accuser of our brothers and sisters,
REV.12.10	who accused them day and night before our God,
REV.12.10	has been thrown down.
REV.12.11	And our brothers and sisters defeated him
REV.12.11	by the blood of the Lamb’s death
REV.12.11	and by the message they preached.
REV.12.11	They did not love their lives so much
REV.12.11	that they were afraid of death.
REV.12.12	So rejoice, you heavens
REV.12.12	and all who live there!
REV.12.12	But it will be terrible for the earth and the sea,
REV.12.12	because the devil has come down to you!
REV.12.12	He is filled with anger,
REV.12.12	because he knows he does not have much time.”
REV.12.13	When the dragon saw he had been thrown down to the earth, he hunted for the woman who had given birth to the son. 
REV.12.14	But the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so she could fly to the place prepared for her in the desert. There she would be taken care of for three and one-half years, away from the snake. 
REV.12.15	Then the snake poured water out of its mouth like a river toward the woman so the flood would carry her away. 
REV.12.16	But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that came from the mouth of the dragon. 
REV.12.17	Then the dragon was very angry at the woman, and he went off to make war against all her other children—those who obey God’s commands and who have the message Jesus taught.
REV.12.18	And the dragon stood on the seashore.
REV.13.1	Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, and there was a crown on each horn. A name against God was written on each head. 
REV.13.2	This beast looked like a leopard, with feet like a bear’s feet and a mouth like a lion’s mouth. And the dragon gave the beast all of his power and his throne and great authority. 
REV.13.3	One of the heads of the beast looked as if it had been killed by a wound, but this death wound was healed. Then the whole world was amazed and followed the beast. 
REV.13.4	People worshiped the dragon because he had given his power to the beast. And they also worshiped the beast, asking, “Who is like the beast? Who can make war against it?”
REV.13.5	The beast was allowed to say proud words and words against God, and it was allowed to use its power for forty-two months. 
REV.13.6	It used its mouth to speak against God, against God’s name, against the place where God lives, and against all those who live in heaven. 
REV.13.7	It was given power to make war against God’s holy people and to defeat them. It was given power over every tribe, people, language, and nation. 
REV.13.8	And all who live on earth will worship the beast—all the people since the beginning of the world whose names are not written in the Lamb’s book of life. The Lamb is the One who was killed.
REV.13.9	Anyone who has ears should listen:
REV.13.10	If you are to be a prisoner,
REV.13.10	then you will be a prisoner.
REV.13.10	If you are to be killed with the sword,
REV.13.10	then you will be killed with the sword.
REV.13.10	This means that God’s holy people must have patience and faith.
REV.13.11	Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon. 
REV.13.12	This beast stands before the first beast and uses the same power the first beast has. By this power it makes everyone living on earth worship the first beast, who had the death wound that was healed. 
REV.13.13	And the second beast does great miracles so that it even makes fire come down from heaven to earth while people are watching. 
REV.13.14	It fools those who live on earth by the miracles it has been given the power to do. It does these miracles to serve the first beast. The second beast orders people to make an idol to honor the first beast, the one that was wounded by the deadly sword but sprang to life again. 
REV.13.15	The second beast was given power to give life to the idol of the first one so that the idol could speak. And the second beast was given power to command all who will not worship the image of the beast to be killed. 
REV.13.16	The second beast also forced all people, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead. 
REV.13.17	No one could buy or sell without this mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name. 
REV.13.18	This takes wisdom. Let the one who has understanding find the meaning of the number, which is the number of a person. Its number is 666.
REV.14.1	Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were one hundred forty-four thousand people who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. 
REV.14.2	And I heard a sound from heaven like the noise of flooding water and like the sound of loud thunder. The sound I heard was like people playing harps. 
REV.14.3	And they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the new song except the one hundred forty-four thousand who had been bought from the earth. 
REV.14.4	These are the ones who did not do sinful things with women, because they kept themselves pure. They follow the Lamb every place he goes. These one hundred forty-four thousand were bought from among the people of the earth as people to be offered to God and the Lamb. 
REV.14.5	They were not guilty of telling lies; they are without fault.
REV.14.6	Then I saw another angel flying high in the air. He had the eternal Good News to preach to those who live on earth—to every nation, tribe, language, and people. 
REV.14.7	He preached in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him praise, because the time has come for God to judge all people. So worship God who made the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the springs of water.”
REV.14.8	Then the second angel followed the first angel and said, “Ruined, ruined is the great city of Babylon! She made all the nations drink the wine of the anger of her adultery.”
REV.14.9	Then a third angel followed the first two angels, saying in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and his idol and gets the beast’s mark on the forehead or on the hand, 
REV.14.10	that one also will drink the wine of God’s anger, which is prepared with all its strength in the cup of his anger. And that person will be put in pain with burning sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb. 
REV.14.11	And the smoke from their burning pain will rise forever and ever. There will be no rest, day or night, for those who worship the beast and his idol or who get the mark of his name.” 
REV.14.12	This means God’s holy people must be patient. They must obey God’s commands and keep their faith in Jesus.
REV.14.13	Then I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write this: Blessed are the dead who die from now on in the Lord.”
REV.14.13	The Spirit says, “Yes, they will rest from their hard work, and the reward of all they have done stays with them.”
REV.14.14	Then I looked, and there before me was a white cloud, and sitting on the white cloud was One who looked like a Son of Man. He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. 
REV.14.15	Then another angel came out of the temple and called out in a loud voice to the One who was sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and harvest from the earth, because the time to harvest has come, and the fruit of the earth is ripe.” 
REV.14.16	So the One who was sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the earth was harvested.
REV.14.17	Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle. 
REV.14.18	And then another angel, who has power over the fire, came from the altar. This angel called to the angel with the sharp sickle, saying, “Take your sharp sickle and gather the bunches of grapes from the earth’s vine, because its grapes are ripe.” 
REV.14.19	Then the angel swung his sickle over the earth. He gathered the earth’s grapes and threw them into the great winepress of God’s anger. 
REV.14.20	They were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed out of the winepress as high as horses’ bridles for a distance of about one hundred eighty miles.
REV.15.1	Then I saw another wonder in heaven that was great and amazing. There were seven angels bringing seven disasters. These are the last disasters, because after them, God’s anger is finished.
REV.15.2	I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. All of those who had won the victory over the beast and his idol and over the number of his name were standing by the sea of glass. They had harps that God had given them. 
REV.15.3	They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb:
REV.15.3	“You do great and wonderful things,
REV.15.3	Lord God Almighty.
REV.15.3	Everything the Lord does is right and true,
REV.15.3	King of the nations.
REV.15.4	Everyone will respect you, Lord,
REV.15.4	and will honor you.
REV.15.4	Only you are holy.
REV.15.4	All the nations will come
REV.15.4	and worship you,
REV.15.4	because the right things you have done
REV.15.4	are now made known.”
REV.15.5	After this I saw that the temple (the Tent of the Agreement) in heaven was opened. 
REV.15.6	And the seven angels bringing the seven disasters came out of the temple. They were dressed in clean, shining linen and wore golden bands tied around their chests. 
REV.15.7	Then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the anger of God, who lives forever and ever. 
REV.15.8	The temple was filled with smoke from the glory and the power of God, and no one could enter the temple until the seven disasters of the seven angels were finished.
REV.16.1	Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of God’s anger on the earth.”
REV.16.2	The first angel left and poured out his bowl on the land. Then ugly and painful sores came upon all those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his idol.
REV.16.3	The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man, and every living thing in the sea died.
REV.16.4	The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood. 
REV.16.5	Then I heard the angel of the waters saying:
REV.16.5	“Holy One, you are the One who is and who was.
REV.16.5	You are right to decide to punish these evil people.
REV.16.6	They have poured out the blood of your holy people and your prophets.
REV.16.6	So now you have given them blood to drink as they deserve.”
REV.16.7	And I heard a voice coming from the altar saying:
REV.16.7	“Yes, Lord God Almighty,
REV.16.7	the way you punish evil people is right and fair.”
REV.16.8	The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and he was given power to burn the people with fire. 
REV.16.9	They were burned by the great heat, and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these disasters. But the people refused to change their hearts and lives and give glory to God.
REV.16.10	The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and darkness covered its kingdom. People gnawed their tongues because of the pain. 
REV.16.11	They also cursed the God of heaven because of their pain and the sores they had, but they refused to change their hearts and turn away from the evil things they did.
REV.16.12	The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates so that the water in the river was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east to come. 
REV.16.13	Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. 
REV.16.14	These evil spirits are the spirits of demons, which have power to do miracles. They go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them together for the battle on the great day of God Almighty.
REV.16.16	Then the evil spirits gathered the kings together to the place that is called Armageddon in the Hebrew language.
REV.16.17	The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. Then a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, “It is finished!” 
REV.16.18	Then there were flashes of lightning, noises, thunder, and a big earthquake—the worst earthquake that has ever happened since people have been on earth. 
REV.16.19	The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations were destroyed. And God remembered the sins of Babylon the Great, so he gave that city the cup filled with the wine of his terrible anger. 
REV.16.20	Then every island ran away, and mountains disappeared. 
REV.16.21	Giant hailstones, each weighing about a hundred pounds, fell from the sky upon people. People cursed God for the disaster of the hail, because this disaster was so terrible.
REV.17.1	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke to me. He said, “Come, and I will show you the punishment that will be given to the great prostitute, the one sitting over many waters. 
REV.17.2	The kings of the earth sinned sexually with her, and the people of the earth became drunk from the wine of her sexual sin.”
REV.17.3	Then the angel carried me away by the Spirit to the desert. There I saw a woman sitting on a red beast. It was covered with names against God written on it, and it had seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.4	The woman was dressed in purple and red and was shining with the gold, precious jewels, and pearls she was wearing. She had a golden cup in her hand, a cup filled with evil things and the uncleanness of her sexual sin. 
REV.17.5	On her forehead a title was written that was secret. This is what was written:
REV.17.5	the great babylon
REV.17.5	mother of prostitutes
REV.17.5	and of the evil things of the earth
REV.17.6	Then I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of God’s holy people and with the blood of those who were killed because of their faith in Jesus.
REV.17.6	When I saw the woman, I was very amazed. 
REV.17.7	Then the angel said to me, “Why are you amazed? I will tell you the secret of this woman and the beast she rides—the one with seven heads and ten horns. 
REV.17.8	The beast you saw was once alive but is not alive now. But soon it will come up out of the bottomless pit and go away to be destroyed. There are people who live on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life since the beginning of the world. They will be amazed when they see the beast, because he was once alive, is not alive now, but will come again.
REV.17.9	“You need a wise mind to understand this. The seven heads on the beast are seven mountains where the woman sits. 
REV.17.10	And they are seven kings. Five of the kings have already been destroyed, one of the kings lives now, and another has not yet come. When he comes, he must stay a short time. 
REV.17.11	The beast that was once alive, but is not alive now, is also an eighth king. He belongs to the first seven kings, and he will go away to be destroyed.
REV.17.12	“The ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet begun to rule, but they will receive power to rule with the beast for one hour. 
REV.17.13	All ten of these kings have the same purpose, and they will give their power and authority to the beast. 
REV.17.14	They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will defeat them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. He will defeat them with his called, chosen, and faithful followers.”
REV.17.15	Then the angel said to me, “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, races, nations, and languages. 
REV.17.16	The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute. They will take everything she has and leave her naked. They will eat her body and burn her with fire. 
REV.17.17	God made the ten horns want to carry out his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule, until what God has said comes about. 
REV.17.18	The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth.”
REV.18.1	After the vision of these things, I saw another angel coming down from heaven. This angel had great power, and his glory made the earth bright. 
REV.18.2	He shouted in a powerful voice:
REV.18.2	“Ruined, ruined is the great city of Babylon!
REV.18.2	She has become a home for demons
REV.18.2	and a prison for every evil spirit,
REV.18.2	and a prison for every unclean bird and unclean beast.
REV.18.3	She has been ruined, because all the peoples of the earth
REV.18.3	have drunk the wine of the desire of her sexual sin.
REV.18.3	She has been ruined also because the kings of the earth
REV.18.3	have sinned sexually with her,
REV.18.3	and the merchants of the earth
REV.18.3	have grown rich from the great wealth of her luxury.”
REV.18.4	Then I heard another voice from heaven saying:
REV.18.4	“Come out of that city, my people,
REV.18.4	so that you will not share in her sins,
REV.18.4	so that you will not receive the disasters that will come to her.
REV.18.5	Her sins have piled up as high as the sky,
REV.18.5	and God has not forgotten the wrongs she has done.
REV.18.6	Give that city the same as she gave to others.
REV.18.6	Pay her back twice as much as she did.
REV.18.6	Prepare wine for her that is twice as strong
REV.18.6	as the wine she prepared for others.
REV.18.7	She gave herself much glory and rich living.
REV.18.7	Give her that much suffering and sadness.
REV.18.7	She says to herself, ‘I am a queen sitting on my throne.
REV.18.7	I am not a widow; I will never be sad.’
REV.18.8	So these disasters will come to her in one day:
REV.18.8	death, and crying, and great hunger,
REV.18.8	and she will be destroyed by fire,
REV.18.8	because the Lord God who judges her is powerful.”
REV.18.9	The kings of the earth who sinned sexually with her and shared her wealth will see the smoke from her burning. Then they will cry and be sad because of her death. 
REV.18.10	They will be afraid of her suffering and stand far away and say:
REV.18.10	“Terrible! How terrible for you, great city,
REV.18.10	powerful city of Babylon,
REV.18.10	because your punishment has come in one hour!”
REV.18.11	And the merchants of the earth will cry and be sad about her, because now there is no one to buy their cargoes— 
REV.18.12	cargoes of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, red cloth; all kinds of citron wood and all kinds of things made from ivory, expensive wood, bronze, iron, and marble; 
REV.18.13	cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, carriages, slaves, and human lives.
REV.18.14	The merchants will say,
REV.18.14	“Babylon, the good things you wanted are gone from you.
REV.18.14	All your rich and fancy things have disappeared.
REV.18.14	You will never have them again.”
REV.18.15	The merchants who became rich from selling to her will be afraid of her suffering and will stand far away. They will cry and be sad 
REV.18.16	and say:
REV.18.16	“Terrible! How terrible for the great city!
REV.18.16	She was dressed in fine linen, purple and red cloth,
REV.18.16	and she was shining with gold, precious jewels, and pearls!
REV.18.17	All these riches have been destroyed in one hour!”
REV.18.17	Every sea captain, every passenger, the sailors, and all those who earn their living from the sea stood far away from Babylon. 
REV.18.18	As they saw the smoke from her burning, they cried out loudly, “There was never a city like this great city!” 
REV.18.19	And they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and being sad. They said:
REV.18.19	“Terrible! How terrible for the great city!
REV.18.19	All the people who had ships on the sea
REV.18.19	became rich because of her wealth!
REV.18.19	But she has been destroyed in one hour!
REV.18.20	Be happy because of this, heaven!
REV.18.20	Be happy, God’s holy people and apostles and prophets!
REV.18.20	God has punished her because of what she did to you.”
REV.18.21	Then a powerful angel picked up a large stone, like one used for grinding grain, and threw it into the sea. He said:
REV.18.21	“In the same way, the great city of Babylon will be thrown down,
REV.18.21	and it will never be found again.
REV.18.22	The music of people playing harps and other instruments, flutes, and trumpets,
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.22	No workman doing any job
REV.18.22	will ever be found in you again.
REV.18.22	The sound of grinding grain
REV.18.22	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.23	The light of a lamp
REV.18.23	will never shine in you again,
REV.18.23	and the voices of a bridegroom and bride
REV.18.23	will never be heard in you again.
REV.18.23	Your merchants were the world’s great people,
REV.18.23	and all the nations were tricked by your magic.
REV.18.24	You are guilty of the death of the prophets and God’s holy people
REV.18.24	and all who have been killed on earth.”
REV.19.1	After this vision and announcement I heard what sounded like a great many people in heaven saying:
REV.19.1	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.1	Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God,
REV.19.2	because his judgments are true and right.
REV.19.2	He has punished the prostitute
REV.19.2	who made the earth evil with her sexual sin.
REV.19.2	He has paid her back for the death of his servants.”
REV.19.3	Again they said:
REV.19.3	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.3	She is burning, and her smoke will rise forever and ever.”
REV.19.4	Then the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures bowed down and worshiped God, who sits on the throne. They said:
REV.19.4	“Amen, Hallelujah!”
REV.19.5	Then a voice came from the throne, saying:
REV.19.5	“Praise our God, all you who serve him
REV.19.5	and all you who honor him, both small and great!”
REV.19.6	Then I heard what sounded like a great many people, like the noise of flooding water, and like the noise of loud thunder. The people were saying:
REV.19.6	“Hallelujah!
REV.19.6	Our Lord God, the Almighty, rules.
REV.19.7	Let us rejoice and be happy
REV.19.7	and give God glory,
REV.19.7	because the wedding of the Lamb has come,
REV.19.7	and the Lamb’s bride has made herself ready.
REV.19.8	Fine linen, bright and clean, was given to her to wear.”
REV.19.8	(The fine linen means the good things done by God’s holy people.)
REV.19.9	And the angel said to me, “Write this: Blessed are those who have been invited to the wedding meal of the Lamb!” And the angel said, “These are the true words of God.”
REV.19.10	Then I bowed down at the angel’s feet to worship him, but he said to me, “Do not worship me! I am a servant like you and your brothers and sisters who have the message of Jesus. Worship God, because the message about Jesus is the spirit that gives all prophecy.”
REV.19.11	Then I saw heaven opened, and there before me was a white horse. The rider on the horse is called Faithful and True, and he is right when he judges and makes war. 
REV.19.12	His eyes are like burning fire, and on his head are many crowns. He has a name written on him, which no one but himself knows. 
REV.19.13	He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is the Word of God. 
REV.19.14	The armies of heaven, dressed in fine linen, white and clean, were following him on white horses. 
REV.19.15	Out of the rider’s mouth comes a sharp sword that he will use to defeat the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will crush out the wine in the winepress of the terrible anger of God the Almighty. 
REV.19.16	On his robe and on his upper leg was written this name: 
REV.19.17	Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he called with a loud voice to all the birds flying in the sky: “Come and gather together for the great feast of God 
REV.19.18	so that you can eat the bodies of kings, generals, mighty people, horses and their riders, and the bodies of all people—free, slave, small, and great.”
REV.19.19	Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth. Their armies were gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army. 
REV.19.20	But the beast was captured and with him the false prophet who did the miracles for the beast. The false prophet had used these miracles to trick those who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his idol. The false prophet and the beast were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. 
REV.19.21	And their armies were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse, and all the birds ate the bodies until they were full.
REV.20.1	I saw an angel coming down from heaven. He had the key to the bottomless pit and a large chain in his hand. 
REV.20.2	The angel grabbed the dragon, that old snake who is the devil and Satan, and tied him up for a thousand years. 
REV.20.3	Then he threw him into the bottomless pit, closed it, and locked it over him. The angel did this so he could not trick the people of the earth anymore until the thousand years were ended. After a thousand years he must be set free for a short time.
REV.20.4	Then I saw some thrones and people sitting on them who had been given the power to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been killed because they were faithful to the message of Jesus and the message from God. They had not worshiped the beast or his idol, and they had not received the mark of the beast on their foreheads or on their hands. They came back to life and ruled with Christ for a thousand years. 
REV.20.5	(The others that were dead did not live again until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first raising of the dead. 
REV.20.6	Blessed and holy are those who share in this first raising of the dead. The second death has no power over them. They will be priests for God and for Christ and will rule with him for a thousand years.
REV.20.7	When the thousand years are over, Satan will be set free from his prison. 
REV.20.8	Then he will go out to trick the nations in all the earth—Gog and Magog—to gather them for battle. There are so many people they will be like sand on the seashore. 
REV.20.9	And Satan’s army marched across the earth and gathered around the camp of God’s people and the city God loves. But fire came down from heaven and burned them up. 
REV.20.10	And Satan, who tricked them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur with the beast and the false prophet. There they will be punished day and night forever and ever.
REV.20.11	Then I saw a great white throne and the One who was sitting on it. Earth and sky ran away from him and disappeared. 
REV.20.12	And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne. Then books were opened, and the book of life was opened. The dead were judged by what they had done, which was written in the books. 
REV.20.13	The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. Each person was judged by what he had done. 
REV.20.14	And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. 
REV.20.15	And anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.
REV.21.1	Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth. The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and there was no sea anymore. 
REV.21.2	And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. It was prepared like a bride dressed for her husband. 
REV.21.3	And I heard a loud voice from the throne, saying, “Now God’s presence is with people, and he will live with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them and will be their God. 
REV.21.4	He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death, sadness, crying, or pain, because all the old ways are gone.”
REV.21.5	The One who was sitting on the throne said, “Look! I am making everything new!” Then he said, “Write this, because these words are true and can be trusted.”
REV.21.6	The One on the throne said to me, “It is finished. I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give free water from the spring of the water of life to anyone who is thirsty. 
REV.21.7	Those who win the victory will receive this, and I will be their God, and they will be my children. 
REV.21.8	But cowards, those who refuse to believe, who do evil things, who kill, who sin sexually, who do evil magic, who worship idols, and who tell lies—all these will have a place in the lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.”
REV.21.9	Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last troubles came to me, saying, “Come with me, and I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.” 
REV.21.10	And the angel carried me away by the Spirit to a very large and high mountain. He showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God. 
REV.21.11	It was shining with the glory of God and was bright like a very expensive jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal. 
REV.21.12	The city had a great high wall with twelve gates with twelve angels at the gates, and on each gate was written the name of one of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
REV.21.13	There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west. 
REV.21.14	The walls of the city were built on twelve foundation stones, and on the stones were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
REV.21.15	The angel who talked with me had a measuring rod made of gold to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 
REV.21.16	The city was built in a square, and its length was equal to its width. The angel measured the city with the rod. The city was 1,500 miles long, 1,500 miles wide, and 1,500 miles high. 
REV.21.17	The angel also measured the wall. It was 216 feet high, by human measurements, which the angel was using. 
REV.21.18	The wall was made of jasper, and the city was made of pure gold, as pure as glass. 
REV.21.19	The foundation stones of the city walls were decorated with every kind of jewel. The first foundation was jasper, the second was sapphire, the third was chalcedony, the fourth was emerald, 
REV.21.20	the fifth was onyx, the sixth was carnelian, the seventh was chrysolite, the eighth was beryl, the ninth was topaz, the tenth was chrysoprase, the eleventh was jacinth, and the twelfth was amethyst. 
REV.21.21	The twelve gates were twelve pearls, each gate having been made from a single pearl. And the street of the city was made of pure gold as clear as glass.
REV.21.22	I did not see a temple in the city, because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the city’s temple. 
REV.21.23	The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God is its light, and the Lamb is the city’s lamp. 
REV.21.24	By its light the people of the world will walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. 
REV.21.25	The city’s gates will never be shut on any day, because there is no night there. 
REV.21.26	The glory and the honor of the nations will be brought into it. 
REV.21.27	Nothing unclean and no one who does shameful things or tells lies will ever go into it. Only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life will enter the city.
REV.22.1	Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life. It was shining like crystal and was flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb 
REV.22.2	down the middle of the street of the city. The tree of life was on each side of the river. It produces fruit twelve times a year, once each month. The leaves of the tree are for the healing of all the nations. 
REV.22.3	Nothing that God judges guilty will be in that city. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be there, and God’s servants will worship him. 
REV.22.4	They will see his face, and his name will be written on their foreheads. 
REV.22.5	There will never be night again. They will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun, because the Lord God will give them light. And they will rule as kings forever and ever.
REV.22.6	The angel said to me, “These words can be trusted and are true.” The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to show his servants the things that must happen soon.
REV.22.8	I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. When I heard and saw them, I bowed down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed these things to me. 
REV.22.9	But the angel said to me, “Do not worship me! I am a servant like you, your brothers the prophets, and all those who obey the words in this book. Worship God!”
REV.22.10	Then the angel told me, “Do not keep secret the words of prophecy in this book, because the time is near for all this to happen. 
REV.22.11	Let whoever is doing evil continue to do evil. Let whoever is unclean continue to be unclean. Let whoever is doing right continue to do right. Let whoever is holy continue to be holy.”
REV.22.17	The Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” Let the one who hears this say, “Come!” Let whoever is thirsty come; whoever wishes may have the water of life as a free gift.
REV.22.18	I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to these words, God will add to that person the disasters written about in this book. 
REV.22.19	And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away that one’s share of the tree of life and of the holy city, which are written about in this book.
REV.22.20	Jesus, the One who says these things are true, says, 
REV.22.20	Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
REV.22.21	The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.
